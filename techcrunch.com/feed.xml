										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">automation hit center stage</a> when robotic process automation (RPA) vendor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">UIPath went public</a> after raising $2 billion in private investment. Investors who had been a part of that were richly rewarded when it closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">above its private valuation</a>. At the same time, established companies like ServiceNow, Microsoft, IBM and others were seeing the value in building automation into their product sets.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have three people who have been smack dab in the middle of this trend on a panel called &#8216;Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now&#8217; at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=automationpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=automationpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS</a> happening on October 27th. Those panelists include UIPath CEO Daniel Dines; Laela Sturdy, general partner at CapitalG and Dave Wright, chief innovation officer at ServiceNow.</p>
<p>Dines&#8217; company, which went public in April, concentrates mostly on RPA, and is the market leader according to Gartner, but automation has many dimensions beyond RPA including no code/low code tools and workflow automation. As we wrote on in an article <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">on the hot automation market</a> earlier this year:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221300" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>What we have here is a frothy mix of startups and large companies racing to provide a comprehensive spectrum of workflow automation tools to empower companies to spin up workflows quickly and move work involving both human and machine labor through an organization.</p></blockquote>
<p>RPA helps companies automate a series of mundane legacy tasks, which can include human intervention or not. Think of pulling information from an insurance claim, adding it to a spreadsheet and emailing a human administrator with the needed information &#8212; and doing all of this without a human touching it.</p>
<p>ServiceNow got into RPA in March when it bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/servicenow-takes-rpa-plunge-by-acquiring-india-based-startup-intellibot/">Indian startup Intellibot</a>. It also has several tools for low-code and workflow automation and with the Intellibot purchase, other acquisitions and organic development, has built automation across its entire platform.</p>
<p>Sturdy was an investor in UIPath and serves on its board. Other investments include Stripe, Cloudflare and Credit Karma, which Intuit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/intuit-credit-karma/">bought last year for $7.1 billion</a>. She was also the captain of the women&#8217;s basketball team, while attending Harvard, and participated in the 1998 NCAA basketball tournament, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/3/14/a-look-back-to-1998-harvard/">helping defeat #1 Stanford</a> in a huge upset.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re going to discuss why automation is coming to the fore now, the role of the pandemic in its rising popularity, whether it&#8217;s a jobs killer, or if it&#8217;s actually making life easier for employees.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;ll join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=automationpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=automationpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS on October 27th</a>. We&#8217;ll also be talking to Monte Carlo CEO Barr Moses, Microsoft executive Jared Spataro and investor Casey Alyward.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I could never really figure out why Facebook spent heavily on VR, but the move may have actually been pretty brilliant from a strategic perspective.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Snap are off just over 20% this morning, a huge cut to the valuation of the social networking company.</p>
<p>In one sense, the post-earnings drop is an indictment of the company&#8217;s business. On the other, Snap&#8217;s stock has merely retreated to midyear levels and remains far above the historical price range it found itself mired in during its more unprofitable days.</p>
<p>But Snap&#8217;s <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf">earnings report</a> and its ensuing selloff have not held their impact to just the company&#8217;s own value. Other social companies have also taken hits: Facebook shares are off nearly 5% this morning, while Twitter is off around 3%. It&#8217;s an arse day for social media companies that are public &#8212; and for their private-market brethren, even if we can&#8217;t see their prices change as granularly.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Let&#8217;s answer the <em>why</em> before we get into what the situation may mean for social companies more generally. We&#8217;ll focus on Facebook at that point, considering its metaverse and impending name change.</p>
<h2>Why Snap is down: Supply chains and Apple&#8217;s power</h2>
<p>Snap posted $1.07 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter, lower than market expectations of $1.10 billion, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/snap-earnings-q3-2021.html">per CNBC reporting</a>. That revenue result was up 57% year over year, and Snap narrowed its net loss to just under $72 million in the quarter, down from just under $200 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Even better, Snap posted massively improved cash flow results in the period when compared to its year-ago results. Growth? Check. Improving profitability? Check. Ability to self-fund? Check. And yet its stock fell sharply. Why? Guidance.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Snap said that it expects revenues for Q4 2021 &#8220;to be between $1,165 million and $1,205 million.&#8221; The market, in contrast, expected the company to generate $1.36 billion in the current quarter. The <em>lowest</em> analyst estimate for Q4 2021 Snap revenue <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP/analysis?p=SNAP">that Yahoo Finance has on file</a> was $1.20 billion. The company may miss even that guess.</p>
<p>Companies that are valued more on growth than GAAP profitability tend to swing sharply when growth slows. And Snap is forecasting an almighty revenue growth deceleration. That explains the selloff. But what explains the company&#8217;s slowing revenue growth?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Meet is getting new <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/10/google-meet-meeting-hosts-now-have-more.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GoogleAppsUpdates+%28Google+Workspace+Updates+Blog%29">audio and video locks</a> to let hosts turn off the microphones and cameras of other participants. The new feature essentially lets you mute a user and prevent them from unmuting themselves until you unlock them.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Google rolled out the ability for hosts to mute everyone all at once in a group call. This latest feature takes the move a step further by preventing participants from unmuting themselves at any point during the call.</p>
<p>Once a host enables either an audio or video lock in the main meeting, it will also be applied to breakout rooms. However, any changes made to a lock setting within a breakout room will not affect the settings of other breakout rooms or the main meeting.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222490" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google says audio and video locks give hosts more control over their meetings by letting them decide when they want to allow different levels of participation from users. It also gives them the ability to address disruptive meeting participants.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that participants using versions of the Android and iOS apps that do not support the new feature will be removed from the meeting if the host turns on the audio or video lock. If users try to join a meeting that currently has the locks enabled, they will be prompted to update their app in order to be allowed into the meeting. However, if the host turns off the locks, the participants will be able to rejoin the meeting.</p>
<p>The new audio and visual lock features are starting to roll out today to all Google Workspace customers, along with G Suite Basic and Business customers.</p>
<p>Google has been rolling out numerous features for Meet over the past few months, as it continues to compete with Zoom and Microsoft Teams amid the work-from-home era brought on by the pandemic. For instance, the company launched a new feature last month that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/google-meet-will-automatically-adjust-webcam-brightness-in-your-browser/">automatically adjusts</a> your webcam brightness. Additionally, Google rolled out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/google-meet-gets-a-refreshed-ui-multi-pinning-autozoom-and-more/">refreshed UI</a> and several features for Meet in April. The videoconferencing platform has also partnered with other services, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/otter-ai-expands-automatic-transcription-assistant-to-microsoft-teams-google-meet-and-cisco-webex/">Otter.ai</a>, with the goal of retaining and attracting more users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[None of this makes sense. Even by the standards of 2021 and the SPAC era, this is all very stupid.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When news broke that former U.S. President Donald Trump had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/">conceived of a media and technology company</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">intended to take it public via a blank-check company</a>, you would have been forgiven if you immediately began to wonder how quickly you could short the stock.</p>
<p>Pick a reason: Right-leaning social networks have largely flopped; the company appeared to be severely underfunded given the scope of its goals and the wealth of its rivals; the fact that there was no product available to use, let alone historical revenue to model forward. There are other reasons for skepticism, but those are my favorite.</p>
<p>And yet! Shares of the SPAC in question, Digital World Acquisition Corp, shot higher on the news. And it is repeating the feat this morning:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2222460" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png?w=362" alt="" width="362" height="127" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png 362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-9.30.40-AM.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /></p>
<p>Recall that DWAC is the Class A share ticker symbol of Digital World Acquisition Corp, while DWACU is the same equity, but with half a warrant attached. The latter shares are up less, which is a bit odd.</p>
<p>Regardless, DWAC now sports a market cap of around $4.7 billion, per Yahoo Finance. That means that Digital World &#8212; aka Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) &#8212; is something akin to the newest unicorn to come out of the land of media and tech. Sure, it&#8217;s a public price, but because the company that will merge with Digital World is so nascent as to be risible: <em>Fuck it</em>, let&#8217;s call it a startup.</p>
<p>None of this makes sense. Even by the standards of 2021 and the SPAC era, this is all very stupid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The only thing that TMTG has that makes it anything other than hot air attached to tissue-thin market statistics &#8212; we&#8217;d like to thank the company&#8217;s presentation for reminding us that podcasts are rising in popularity, a truly mind-bending insight &#8212; is Trump&#8217;s name. Recall that TMTG intends on using SPAC money to fund its operations, not Trump cash; it doesn&#8217;t even really have the financial backing of the man whose name is atop its business. You know, the supposed billionaire.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fact that the company is so silly should have tipped us off to it becoming a memestock, or stonk. Why? Because only the wackiest companies seem to make the cut. Physical retail is falling amid rising digital delivery of gaming goods? Let&#8217;s send GameStop to the moon. No one is renting cars? Let&#8217;s pile into Hertz stock. That sort of thing.</p>
<p>So, almost, <em>of course</em> DWAC is going vertical. Why <em>not?! </em>This stock shooting higher is at once utterly hilarious and a grim indictment of efficient market theory. Nothing makes a stonk better as a meme than it making little to no sense as a business. Thus, TMTG is up a kajillion percent, which makes sense precisely in how little sense it makes.</p>
<p>Normally I&#8217;d just go to bed at this point, but it turns out I have a lot of work to do so, we&#8217;ll leave this here for now. Good luck to everyone trading today.</p>

It filed, everyone found its <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/wework-may-reduce-its-valuation-ahead-of-ipo-by-tens-of-billions/">results to be ridiculous</a>, and the IPO eventually got yanked. A more modest &#8212; yet still negative &#8212; reaction can be found in Box&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/box-files-for-250m-ipo-on-full-year-revenue-of-124m-net-loss-of-168m/">first attempt at going public</a>.</p>
<p>Both companies eventually did debut, with Box managing to do so via normal methods, while WeWork had to wait for a SPAC to chariot it to the public markets. And no, I am not trying to draw any sort of business similarity between Box (software company run by a sane person) and WeWork (non-software business run by a person slightly less trustworthy than Aaron Levie).</p>

<p>A more recent example from the <em>folks not liking the numbers much</em> category is Rent the Runway&#8217;s IPO filing. The company &#8212; a good business idea that has engendered a large user base over time &#8212; is not entirely gorgeous from a business perspective.</p>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t want to read through Rent the Runway&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001468327/000119312521301156/d194411ds1a.htm">IPO filing</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">our notes on its numbers</a>, the gist is that it appears that the depreciation costs relating to clothing that Rent the Runway rents to customers are sufficiently steep as to make the company&#8217;s overall business profile unsteady.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>To combat that look, Rent the Runway provided adjusted profitability metrics that excluded inventory depreciation. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It wasn&#8217;t a very popular move. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More simply, it appears that Rent the Runway is just undercharging for its product when we consider the full set of costs associated with providing its service and running its business.</span></p>
<p>Regardless of our concerns, however, the company&#8217;s first IPO price range values the company north of $1 billion, so its IPO will be a unicorn debut. As such, we have to take it seriously. This morning, let&#8217;s quickly calculate its IPO valuation range, its resulting multiples, and compare the company to a related entity to get a grip on what the market is telling us about the fashion rental unicorn.</p>
<h2>Pricing Rent the Runway</h2>
<p>First, a bit of an apology. As an unfashionable slacker, I have too long dismissed investments in appearance. Mostly, this was my being both a boor <em>and</em> a bore, but it was also intellectually lazy.</p>
<p>In reality, humans love to express themselves through dress, both physical (clothing, makeup, etc.) and virtual (character skins, NFTs, etc). And they will spend to look good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hazard that the impulse to look good physically and in digital realms are pretty related, if not the same thing. So, the beating heart of the League of Legends business model (in-game cosmetics) and Rent the Runway&#8217;s (renting fashionable attire) should get similar levels of care.</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s to say: If we make some critical remarks about certain elements of Rent the Runway&#8217;s business results, we&#8217;re not mocking what it wants to do or the market demand it is working to meet. Instead, we&#8217;re noting that Rent is perhaps undercharging for its products, which makes some numbers a bit wonky.</p>

<p>Hello, and welcome to Equity, TechCrunch&#8217;s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. And have a good time.</p>
<p>This week Mary Ann and Natasha and Alex (along with our amazing production team Grace, Chris, and Kell) took on a bevy of topics from around the world of startups and technology more broadly.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>We naturally kicked off with news that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/facebook-reportedly-plans-to-change-its-name-to-focus-on-the-metaverse/">Facebook intends to rebrand itself.</a> Which we don&#8217;t think will do much to detract from its various crises. But the news <em>does</em> underscore that Facebook is, in fact, serious about writing its next chapter.</li>
<li>From there it was time to talk funding rounds. This week we picked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/vertical-oceans-aims-to-grow-sustainable-shrimp-in-huge-aqua-towers-inside-cities/">Vertical Oceans and its fishy plans</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/superplastic-guggimon-janky-virtual-celebrities-series-a/">Superplastic and its stable of rude digital critters</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/modern-age-is-on-a-mission-to-put-people-in-the-drivers-seat-of-their-aging-journey/">Modern Age and its plan to help us all age a bit more gracefully.</a></li>
<li>Vibe Capital, founded by Teachable&#8217;s Ankur Nagpal, is a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/vibe-capital-is-a-new-venture-firm-built-for-scrappy-international-founders/"> $60 million fund for international, scrappy founders.</a> We spoke about the founder to investor pipeline, and why everyone wants each other&#8217;s jobs.</li>
<li>And then Alex ran us through some data from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/china-venture-capital-q3-2021/">Chinese venture capital market</a>, information that was far more positive than we anticipated. Given, you know, the country&#8217;s regulatory crackdown on technology companies.</li>
<li>We closed with a number of major fintech rounds, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/with-customers-like-coinbase-and-shopify-remote-hiring-startup-deel-raises-425m-at-a-5-5b-valuation/">new capital for Deel</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/brex-raises-300m-at-a-12-3b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding scoop on Brex</a>, which is now officially a decacorn. Notably, Deel and Brex both raised mega-rounds just six months after raising mega-rounds.</li>
<li>While we&#8217;re in a bubble, it&#8217;s easy to get lost in the same narrative: everything is booming! This week&#8217;s episode was a good reminder of how diverse, and nuanced, this ever-lasting startup summer truly is.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">An awesome strategic comms pro should be your first marketing investment.</p>
<p>Without clear, concise and compelling messaging, your business loses the majority of its impact. Forget press and analysts — you will struggle to land customers or investors if your value proposition isn’t positioned correctly. Even if it’s too early to add someone full time, seek outside help from someone with a level of seniority that matches your own.</p>
<p>The processes of early messaging/positioning and early product design should not be treated as entirely separate. Allowing these messaging sessions to expose shortcomings or uncover new potential will help ensure all your future marketing efforts are rooted in truth and accuracy.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If you’ve put together a strong comms team, they have a strategy and a plan. You can help them execute that plan incrementally, but you can undo its progress in the blink of an eye.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When it is time to add a full-time comms person to your team, look for a strategic partner rather than a manager. Hire someone who understands your business, not just theirs. Even though they’re not a spokesperson, they’ll often be the first representative from your company with whom reporters, analysts and influencers will interact.</p>
<p>They should be able to discuss your product and industry as well as anyone on your sales team. If that sounds like a tall order, it is — yet another reason to properly invest in the role.</p>
<h2>Media relations is a small piece of the puzzle</h2>
<p>Too many people treat communications and PR as if they&#8217;re interchangeable when the latter is actually just a fractional percentage of the former. Traditional media relations is simply much less important than it was a decade ago.</p>
<p>The number of employed business journalists in the world dwindles every day, while the number of publications that accept paid and contributed content grows. The reporter you simply &#8220;have&#8221; to meet today might well be running PR for one of your competitors tomorrow.</p>
<p>Those left are stretched thin. They don’t even have the bandwidth to cover everything they need to. The days of a sure-fire business press story or guaranteed trade coverage around a product launch are long gone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All tech companies think they’re doing something unique and incredible, and many are. But no matter what you’re doing, there’s always someone out there who can bump you from the news cycle.</p>
<p>Figure out a way to measure the output of your communications program beyond the number of articles placed; those mentions are meaningless if they’re not aligned with your message. Relationships and creativity are the key to a strong media presence in today’s landscape. For the same reason they don’t have time to cover everything, reporters have to rely on a network of people they trust to tell them what’s important.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Foodology collects data on user preferences and cross-references that with nearby food options in a geographical area to manage the end-to-end creation of original dishes with delivery.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Foodology has been whipping up its restaurant brands in cloud and virtual kitchens in Colombia and Mexico since 2019, and with a new infusion of capital, hopes to scale that across Latin America.</p>
<p>The Bogotá-based company closed on $15 million in Series A funding in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Base Partners. Existing investors Kayyak Ventures and Jaguar Ventures (now Wollef) joined in as did a group of angel investors, including Instacart president Nilam Ganenthiran, Kavak CEO Carlos Garcia, Ualá CEO Pierpaolo Barbieri, former Burger King Chairman Dick Boyce and Merama CEO Sujay Tyle. Including the new funding, Foodology has raised more than $20 million.</p>
<p>The company was founded by CEO Daniela Izquierdo and Juan Guillermo Azuero, who met in a restaurant industry course at Harvard Business School. Izquierdo told TechCrunch that she is a big fan of cooking and wanted to mix that passion with a business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222282" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“It is a risky industry — people go broke, restaurants are closing down and it is capital-intensive to set it up, even a small shop,” she added. “We wanted to bring in technology and data to be more efficient and be prepared for a virtual world, which behind it is food delivery. Many restaurants did not change at all to serve the delivery customer.”</p>
<p>Azuero added that on the customer side, food delivery is “usually just an OK experience, not a great experience” and often the food packaging is not the best. Foodology is working to change that, and they say they have built a model that enables it to rapidly scale original and third-party restaurant brands across Latin American markets within weeks and deliver meals in a way that will delight customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s how it works: Foodology collects data on user preferences and cross-references that with nearby food options in a geographical area to manage the end-to-end creation of original dishes with delivery.</p>
<p>The company typically has seven to 10 brands being made in one kitchen and performs R&amp;D on the best-sold dishes in order to create menus with its full team of chefs, Izquierdo said.</p>
<p>Foodology currently operates 20 kitchens in six cities across Colombia and 10 in Mexico and has 60 corporate employees and over 300 in its kitchens. In Colombia, it is taking 100,000 orders per month and just passed a milestone of 1 million orders total. Izquierdo aims to open another six kitchens, as well as use the new funding to enter the Brazilian and Peruvian markets next year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1114000/foodservice-sales-growth-latin-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Latin America’s food service industry</a> was forecasted to generate $264 billion in 2020. To keep up, in addition to expanding the number of kitchens, the company will use the new funding on product development as it grows 50% month in revenue, a pace the founders see continuing as it opens more locations in Mexico and enters the new markets. Their goal is to support 500 kitchens in the future, Azuero said.</p>
<p>“There are tons of people looking to have virtual restaurants and brands, but very few have a model at scale in the region,” Izquierdo said. “We are by far the biggest player doing it in LatAm.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Though it might seem strange for a company like Klarna to get into travel, CMO David Sandstrom says travel is a pain point Klarna wants to solve for its consumers. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.klarna.com/us/aus47/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klarna</a>, the global retail bank, payments and shopping service, can now add “travel agent” to that list.</p>
<p>The company announced Friday that it acquired Inspirock, an online trip planner using artificial intelligence and local expertise to enable Klarna’s 90 million users to quickly and easily explore a destination’s offerings and create personalized itineraries. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Inspirock, based in East Palo Alto, was founded in 2012 by CEO Anoop Goyal and Prakash Sikchi. Over 25 million travelers use Inspirock annually to plan trips based on their interests or seek out new places to visit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222323" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/24/inspirock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $3 million in venture capital</a> funding in 2015, led by existing investor MakeMyTrip, one of India’s largest travel booking sites. David Sandstrom, Klarna’s chief marketing officer, told TechCrunch the entire Inspirock team is joining Klarna.</p>
<p>“Our goal at Inspirock has been to make planning a trip fast, fun and easy,” said Goyal in a written statement. “Together we can deliver on Klarna’s ambitions of providing a smooth shopping experience to the travel space in an innovative way. Klarna and Inspirock together can bring great inspiration, tools and shopping experiences, making planning the trip as fun as the actual trip itself.”</p>

<p>It’s been a busy year for Klarna, which is valued at $45.6 billion: This is the company’s fifth acquisition this year and follows three acquisitions over the summer of Apprl, Stocard and HERO, as well as Toplooks.ai earlier this year.</p>
<p>The acquisitions strategy so far was to enable creation of content at scale, Sandstrom said. He is bullish about ways to move into inspiration, curation and social shopping, which are key to what Klarna is doing. Sandstrom believes that e-commerce has shifted from an experience that was lonely and transactional into one that adds emotion.</p>
<p>“The next generation of e-commerce for me is going to be the social aspect, where we connect with peers and are able to do a deeper dive into reviews and interact with key opinion leaders,” he added. “We have put massive investments into content creation and curation, which will be an enabler for our entire customer base to create content.”</p>
<p>Though it might seem strange for a company like Klarna to get into the travel business, Sandstrom says the acquisition of Inspirock is his company&#8217;s way of solving another pain point for its consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In this case, after booking flight and hotel reservations, helping plan what the consumer will actually do on that vacation. And, providing them a way to purchase event and attraction tickets using Klarna’s buy now, pay later service. Integrating Inspirock also provides an opportunity to connect Klarna’s 250,000 retail partners to travelers that may visit their respective areas.</p>
<p>Some 66% of global travel bookings are already made online, and that figure is expected to grow to 72% by 2025 as the <a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p06064498/Online-Travel-Agent-Global-Market-Report-COVID-19-Growth-And-Change-To.html?utm_source=GNW">global online travel agent market</a> itself is poised to reach $833.5 billion by that year.</p>
<p>Klarna’s own research shows that an average of 21% of people around the world put travel at the top of their list for categories in which they plan to splurge on in 2021.</p>
<p>“Forty-two percent of people say they are frustrated planning their trips,” Sandstrom said. “There are already kick-ass sites for booking airlines and hotels, and we aren’t going into that. What we are doing is connecting local retailers and merchants with that trip planning experience so that consumers can have an easier time planning what they want to do during the visit and actually experience a city.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.citcon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citcon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a mobile wallet payment provider, has closed on $30 million in funding in a Series C round co-led by Norwest Venture Partners and Cota Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sierra Ventures and Sonae IM also joined the financing, which brings San Jose-based Citcon’s total raised since its 2015 inception to nearly $50 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citcon’s mission is straightforward: to allow merchants to accept payments by mobile wallet and alternative currencies “with the same ease as they process traditional credit card payments today,” according to CEO and founder Chuck Huang.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222309" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting Citcon, Huang spent four years as a lead systems architect at Visa, where he led the s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ystem architecture design and development for several products, including its mobile payment gateway and card-based rewards redemption platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citcon was built on the premise that mobile payments provide a “more user-friendly, secure and safer” contactless shopping and payment experience for both consumers and merchants. And that was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the surge in contactless payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, Citcon is doing something right. As 2021 draws to a close, Citcon’s annualized payment volume is about $1 billion, representing over 300% year-over-year growth. Revenue, too, has grown by the same percentage, according to Huang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s payment technology is integrated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with POS and e-commerce systems such as Toshiba, Oracle, Cegid, Shopify and SAP. And it’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deployed at more than 30,000 merchants’ sites and locations, including L&#8217;Oréal, Tumi, Texas Instruments, Macy’s and Panda Express.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citcon offers something that Apple Pay and Google Pay don’t, according to Huang. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ours is software-based and so unlike with Apple Pay or Google Pay, you don&#8217;t need a bank or credit card attached to the wallets,” he explained. “We have a unified API for both mobile and alternative payment methods (APMs).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional payment infrastructure was not designed to accept mobile wallets so merchants had to deal with a lot of implementation, Huang said. Since Citcon does a single API integration for a merchant, it allows that merchant to accept over 100 mobile wallets around the world.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2222355 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qr-code-payment-cap.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qr-code-payment-cap.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qr-code-payment-cap.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qr-code-payment-cap.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qr-code-payment-cap.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qr-code-payment-cap.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qr-code-payment-cap.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trend of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">software-based wallets for payments has accelerated globally over the last couple of years, according to Huang. And Citcon is poised to capitalize on that trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“China is an almost cashless society and its residents use this kind of wallet extensively, but it is gaining momentum all over,” Huang told TechCrunch. For example, in the U.S. the startup is working with PayPal/Venmo to enable this software wallet for its users. It has also partnered with Klarna to create a “buy now, pay later” wallet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Citcon plans to use its new capital to add to its current headcount of 100, and expand globally. It already has offices in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. It’s eyeing “rapid” overseas expansion with a particular focus on Latin America and the Asia-Pacific market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norwest Venture Partners’ partner Priti Youssef Choksi said her firm was first drawn to Citcon’s leadership team.</span> Sh<span style="font-weight: 400;">e described Huang and president and COO Wei Jang as “thought leaders” in the world of payments. The pair, she noted, are both natives of China and can bring an international view into how mobile wallets can evolve within the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is important because there are several key themes converging around mobile payments both in the U.S. and abroad,” she wrote via email. For one, mobile wallets have eclipsed credit cards to become the most widely used form of payment globally, with active mobile wallets expected to grow from 2.8 billion in 2020 to 4.8 billion in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the U.S., they’re quickly gaining share given new wallets (such as crypto, buy now, pay later platforms and neobank wallets) are increasingly popular among younger consumers, and as the pandemic has pushed consumers/merchants towards contactless payments,” Choksi added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is also impressed by the company’s ability to have navigated compliance challenges surrounding each wallet and country in which it operates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is particularly important given the regulatory scrutiny on payment flows in the U.S. and around the world,” Choksi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cota Capital partner Ben Malka said his firm has been closely following trends in alternative tender-type usage, both globally and in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we believe we are still in the early innings, there is a tremendous market opportunity to enable different payment types,” he said. “We were impressed with Chuck and his team. They have deep experience in the payment industry and the right acumen to build a global payments company.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new fund will enable Wollef to finally write the larger checks they weren't able to with their previous funds.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://jaguarvc.com/">Jaguar Ventures</a>, a Mexican fund investing in early-stage startups, is now Wollef and is launching its third fund with a target of raising $100 million before the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The firm got started back in 2013 when Eric Pérez-Grovas, who launched the Mercado Libre Mexico operations, joined with Cristóbal Perdomo, a serial founder of companies like Groupalia, which was sold to the Brazilian Peixe Urbano.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has invested in 31 companies, including unicorns Kavak, Konfío, Loft and Nubank. Its first fund raised $9.3 million in 2014, followed by a second fund of $22 million. Though 10 of the companies are in Mexico, another 19 are foreign companies that see Mexico as a key market, Pérez-Grovas told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222239" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Initially, the pair chose “jaguar” for its name because it was distinctive at the time, was an animal present in the Americas, where the firm invested and was an aggressive animal which spoke to the way they liked to invest. Unfortunately, several other entities emerged with “jaguar” in their name, and it caused some confusion, Pérez-Grovas added.</p>
<p>“We wanted to choose another name that was unique, and Cristóbal pointed out that we chose the wrong animal,” he said. “He said we should have chosen the wolf instead because though it is a hunter, it travels in a pack and the ‘alpha’ can be female or male. Wollef fits better and aligns with our vision of working as a team with the entrepreneur.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pérez-Grovas and Perdomo say the Latin American startup ecosystem is booming, noting data from the Latin American Venture Capital Association that showed venture capital in the first half of 2021 <a href="https://lavca.org/industry-data/2021-latin-american-startup-directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit $6 billion dollars,</a> up from the $4.8 billion that was invested in 2020.</p>
<p>This boom became beneficial to Wollef, which has had an easier time attracting limited partners into its latest fund. Perdomo explained that when they were raising in 2013, maybe 10 people out of 100 family offices and businesses in Mexico they called would take a meeting. That grew to half taking a meeting in 2019 for the second fund, but still only 10% of LPs got in. Now, the firm is on the receiving end of the calls, especially organizations from the U.S. that want to get involved in Latin America.</p>
<p>The new fund will be similar to the previous ones that have been agnostic to the sector, though much of Wollef&#8217;s portfolio comprises fintech, marketplaces and e-commerce companies, they said.</p>
<p>The firm is looking to invest in another 20 to 25 new companies, and Pérez-Grovas and Perdomo say they are eager to be able to write the larger checks this time around than with their previous funds. They expect to put in first checks between $500,000 and $1 million.</p>
<p>One of the unique aspects between them and other firms is that Wollef does not share information on companies with anyone. Pérez-Grovas explained that other firms in the country don’t see investments as financial returns, but instead as a way of gathering information.</p>
<p>“They may not have been successful, so they are using firms now for information,” he added. “We are helping startups for financial returns. That is also what we love about U.S. investors, they are looking for that, too.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Financial statement audits are an essential part of doing business, but often are complex and can require documentation gathering, most times requiring email correspondence back and forth between the auditor and the company for files and information to complete the task.</p>
<p>T.C. Whittaker, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.auditsight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audit Sight</a>, says companies can spend millions of dollars per year on these audits, but the customer experience is lacking. He recalls doing audit work from a windowless room, punching numbers into a spreadsheet while he was working for PwC.</p>
<p>“It was really painful,” he told TechCrunch. “They have to show all of the details, and out of that, the auditor will make some selections and there is a crazy back-and-forth with the client who is also trying to do their day job. Even back then, I was thinking there had to be a better way to do this.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222049" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He ended up building a company inside of PwC with co-founder Jonathan Womack around cloud systems for audit work and ultimately they left PwC last year to start another company, this time Atlanta-based Audit Sight, that eliminates all of the back and forth by using APIs to access client records and can also look at 100% of the transactions instead of a sample.</p>

<p>To continue developing its software, the company announced Friday $2.5 million in seed funding, led by Hyde Park Venture Partners, with participation from Alumni Ventures Group and individual investors, including Johnson Cook, CEO of Greenlight; Aaron Rankin, co-founder of Sprout Social; and John Seybold and Ken Branson, co-founders of Guidewire Software.</p>
<p>Whittaker notes that the audit services industry is projected to be a $43 billion market in the United States this year, so the new funding will enable the company to jump on additional hiring to meet that demand. It has already added Eric Kingery as chief technology officer and Attila Domokos as executive vice president of engineering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company intends to build out several SaaS applications and is poised to roll out its first two modules for revenue and accounts receivables by the end of the year. Audit Sight has customers piloting the software currently.</p>
<p>“Our next steps are to get this thing into the hands of paying customers,” Whittaker added. “Audits are a good thing and provide a lot of trust for how companies are doing. It’s also how banks determine if they want to lend money. We are at the forefront of providing transparency into this world.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Ira Weiss, partner at Hyde Park Venture Partners, has joined the Audit Sight board. Weiss knew the company’s team while they were still at PwC and also knew this pain point intimately when he was briefly an auditor himself.</p>
<p>His firm invests in companies that are going after large markets to solve problems that couldn’t have been solved before. In this case, due to accounting systems not yet having largely moved to the cloud.</p>
<p>One of the things that attracted Weiss to the investment was Whittaker’s and Womack’s backgrounds and previous expertise in working with accounting and software.</p>
<p>“I see a world where you can have audits done quickly and painlessly,” he added. “You can contact your audit firm and in less than a week, the firm can do some semblance of an audit. Even 30 or 40 years from now it could be instantaneous.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the climate crisis looming, lots of companies want to do their part. But asking customers to “offset the CO2 emission of this delivery” is usually a hammer to crack a nut. There is very little transparency around carbon offsets. Plus, smaller companies want to access high-quality carbon credits, but calculate their impact at a product, services and transactional level, and be able to purchase a fraction of a carbon credit rather than a very inaccurate “scheme.”</p>
<p><a href="http://pledge.io">Pledge</a> is a startup aimed at industries like freight forwarding, ride-hailing, travel and last-mile delivery, where customers can be presented with how to add offsets to their transactions.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $4.5 million seed round led by Visionaries Club with participation from Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital and Zinal Growth, the investment vehicle of Guillaume Pousaz (founder and CEO of Checkout.com). Pledge has been operating in closed beta until now.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222418" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded by early Revolut employees David de Picciotto and Thomas Lucas, as well as Freetrade’s co-founder and former CTO André Mohamed, Pledge will start with logistics and transportation. Pledge says companies will be able to measure and mitigate their shipments, rides, deliveries or travels to reach carbon neutrality by integrating the Pledge API. The platform aims to provide customers with analytics and insights as well as recommendations on how to reduce their emissions over time.</p>
<p>Pledge says its emissions calculations will follow global standards, including the GHG protocol, the GLEC framework as well as the ICAO methodology while complying with ISO standards.</p>
<p>The key to it all is that Pledge says its platform will allow companies able to purchase a fraction of a carbon credit (similar to retail investors purchasing a fraction of a stock) while offering access to balanced portfolios encompassing different methodologies and geographies (similar to an ETF).</p>
<p>David de Picciotto, co-founder and CEO of Pledge said: “Currently, there is no easy and scalable way exists for companies of any size to understand and remove their emissions. Traditional carbon measurement and offsetting solutions are costly and difficult to implement and so only accessible to a restricted group of larger companies. We started Pledge to enable any company to launch high quality and verified climate products in the easiest and fastest way possible.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Robert Lacher, co-founder and partner of Visionaries Club said: “Pledge is building pipes for any business to launch applications to measure and mitigate their environmental impact. Similar to the flurry of financial infrastructure providers allowing any company to become a fintech, Pledge will become the enabler of climate initiatives by providing the relevant tools and software infrastructure to build on top of.”</p>
<p>Clay Dumas, partner at Lowercarbon Capital added: “The biggest bottleneck to scaling carbon removal will be connecting supply with demand. The team at Pledge is applying what they learned building the world&#8217;s top financial products to unlock euros, dollars and pounds to suck carbon out of the sky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Picciotto says that while working in a large private equity firm and sitting right next to the ESG team, he saw firsthand the increasing number of requests from LPs, mostly pension funds, requesting further transparency and reporting on ESG and specifically climate KPIs of portfolio companies. He realised that there must be a way to streamline this reporting/calculation and access high-quality carbon credits, providing more transparency and tools for internal and external stakeholders.</p>
<p>“The more we looked into the mechanisms on which the carbon market has been built, the more parallels we saw with the financial services industry. Our research kicked off with the belief that our experience founding or helping build category-leading companies, such as Freetrade and Revolut, could provide a unique angle to help reverse climate change,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OfBusiness, an e-commerce startup that sells industrial goods and provides small businesses with credit, is in talks to raise a new round of funding at a valuation of over $4.5 billion, three sources familiar with those talks told me.</p>
<p>If the talks materialize, it would be the fourth financing round OfBusiness will secure this year. And it would also result in a multi-fold surge in its valuation, which was about $800 million in April this year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/tiger-global-backs-india-ofbusiness-at-3-billion-valuation/">$3 billion less than a month ago</a>.</p>
<p>Falcon Edge Capital is in talks to lead or co-lead the new round, one of the sources said. <a href="http://ofbusiness.com/">OfBusiness</a> already counts SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Tiger Global and Alpha Wave Incubation, a fund managed by Falcon, among its existing investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222416" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Asish Mohapatra, co-founder and chief executive of OfBusiness, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.</p>
<p>OfBusiness operates as a raw material aggregator and procurement finance provider. The startup works with banks to offer credit lines to small and medium enterprises that have an annual turnover of over $3 million.</p>
<p>The platform collects data on user activity that it relies on to underwrite loans to businesses that are using the OfBusiness platform for sourcing raw material and tenders.</p>
<p>It has come a long way. Within months of its launch, the startup realized that the bigger problem that its customers were facing was working capital. After this realization, Mohapatra began hiring key leaders to build a finance offering. In a podcast last year with an investor, he said when the realization hit him he had little to no understanding of underwriting and how to build a finance business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That business has become big &#8212; and is also profitable. And that’s what has attracted several high-profile investors to OfBusiness in recent quarters. The startup’s revenue run rate is over $1 billion, and by July this year, its loan book size had increased to $220 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Time and time again, tech&#8217;s most powerful companies have pushed the narrative that any threat to their own trillion-ish dollar businesses will trickle down, hurting the small companies that rely on their products.</p>
<p>But counter to the warm and fuzzy anecdotes that big tech has rolled out over the years, some business owners struggle with relying so heavily on massive, opaque corporations and often have little recourse if things go wrong.</p>
<p>Those struggles are the kind of thing that tech watchdog group <a href="https://accountabletech.org/">Accountable Tech</a> wants to draw attention to with its new awareness push, <a href="http://mainstreetagainstbigtech.org/">&#8220;Main Street Against Big Tech.&#8221;</a> The six figure campaign includes a full-page ad in San Jose&#8217;s daily paper the Mercury News next week, digital ads across social platforms and an ongoing video series highlighting experiences from small business owners that run counter to the PR narratives from tech companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222119" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The project has received support from the Main Street Alliance, Small Business Rising, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, and the American Economic Liberties Project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The [campaign] really underscores the litany of Big Tech&#8217;s harms to which these small business owners are subject – from misleading and unreliable data, to hidden costs and sudden changes to rules or algorithms that can kneecap their entire company without any access to customer service,&#8221; Accountable Tech co-founder Jesse Lehrich told TechCrunch. &#8220;Each entrepreneur has their own story and reason for speaking out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lehrich calls Facebook&#8217;s longstanding PR campaign around standing up for small business &#8220;incredibly cynical and opportunistic&#8221; — a position that <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-apple-fight-self-serving">some Facebook employees appear to share</a>. The reality of running a business on big tech platforms isn&#8217;t always rosy for small business owners, who are subject to the whims of massively powerful corporations they have only a tenuous relationship with.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are completely at the mercy of these giants, with little access to legitimate metrics or customer service,&#8221; Lehrich said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a partnership; it&#8217;s exploitation.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Public sentiment also seems to be moving into a phase where people widely acknowledge that even free tech platforms extract a cost, whether that&#8217;s in the form of privacy sacrifices or the endless streams of user-created content that provide a canvas for advertising.</p>
<p>Small businesses may rely on tools from dominant tech companies, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that in theory an upstart competitor couldn&#8217;t build something that serves them just as well or better. &#8220;This is how monopolies and oligopolies work –– these Big Tech corporations and their services are only &#8216;essential&#8217; because they&#8217;ve engaged in an endless array of anticompetitive behavior to ensure they&#8217;re the only game in town,&#8221; Lehrich told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As Congress wrestles with how to update laws designed for an era well before internet businesses even existed, the biggest companies in tech will continue to lean into their market dominance, leaving businesses and users alike stuck with what they&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>&#8220;In an effort to avoid regulatory scrutiny, monopolists like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have spent millions of dollars persuading lawmakers and the public that their business products are a lifeline for small businesses when in fact the opposite is true,” Accountable Tech Co-Founder and Executive Director Nicole Gill said. &#8220;&#8230; But now small business owners are fighting back by sharing their lived experience to expose the real relationship between Big Tech and Main Street.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://xanpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XanPool</a>, a payment infrastructure provider that facilitates faster crypto and fiat settlements, announced today it has raised a $27 million Series A led by Valar Ventures. The round included participation from CMT Digital, Wise founder and chairman Taavet Hinrikus and existing investors Gumi Cryptos and Antler.</p>
<p>The funding brings XanPool’s total raised since it was founded in 2019 to over $32 million. Founder and chief executive officer Jeffrey Liu told TechCrunch that the Series A will be used to consolidate XanPool’s presence across APAC, where it is used in 12 countries, with the goal of growing its user base from 500,000 now to 10 million by the end of 2022. Its users include consumers and businesses that want an alternative to traditional payment processors.</p>
<p>XanPool’s software enables a non-custodial crypto-to-crypto (C2C) network that is made up of liquidity providers, including crypto funds, money service operators and traditional-export businesses who have idle capital sitting in their crypto wallets, e-wallets or bank accounts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222359" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“XanPool never touches this money, we simply make the software which allows the individual or business to automate their buying and selling, and in return earn a fee,” Liu said.</p>
<p>The liquidity providers&#8217; capital is used to settle cross-currency and cryptocurrency transactions and, in return, they earn fees of up to 2% a month. XanPool says its C2C network now has over $200 million of liquidity.</p>

<p>Liu added that the peer-to-peer architecture reduces counterparty risks because its C2C transactions don’t involve an intermediary and transactions are completed without credit or late settlements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based in Hong Kong, XanPool has more than 400 business partners. These include South Korean financial &#8220;super app&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/viva-republica-developer-of-korean-financial-super-app-toss-raises-410m-at-a-7-4b-valuation/">Toss</a>; Vietnamese fintech ViettelPay; Singapore’s electronic fund transfer service PayNow; Indonesian e-wallet GoPay; PayID, the fast payments infrastructure developed by Australian banks; and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Faster Payment Service. They give their customers access to XanPool through their apps, and XanPool performs its own KYC on users.</p>

<p>Liu said XanPool’s user experience is different from traditional custody platforms because they just need to provide their crypto wallet address, send fiat to local liquidity peers on its C2C network and then receive cryptocurrency directly into their wallets.</p>
<p>Most traditional custody platforms, on the other hand, require users to send them fiat currency before conducting fiat-crypto exchanges and then wait for exchanges to approval withdrawals.</p>
<p>XanPool plans to continue offering its infrastructure to third-party exchanges, wallets and decentralized applications instead of launching its own app. Liu said XanPool’s goal is to become similar to the SWIFT Network, also enabling settlements without holding its own liquidity, but compatible with cryptocurrency, fast payment services and e-wallets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has held discussions to invest over $50 million in Indian social commerce startup Meesho, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/meesho-india-social-commerce-raises-570-million/">recently secured $570 million in a financing round</a>, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The Android-maker, which has backed over half a dozen startups in India, has yet to make the investment in Meesho, according to another person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Meesho — which counts Facebook, B Capital, SoftBank, Sequoia Capital India, Y Combinator and Elevation Capital among its earliest investors — operates a three-sided marketplace that connects suppliers (manufacturers and distributors) and resellers with customers on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. The resellers buy listed products from the suppliers and make commission on each transaction when they sell to customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222324" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>About 80% of resellers on the platform are women. From the beginning, the startup has aimed to help women start their business without need for any capital. The startup, which like many other e-commerce firms was severely hit by the pandemic last year, has fully recovered and achieved an all-time peak growth in recent months.</p>
<p>Meesho&#8217;s recent fast-growth has been a topic of several serious discussions at Flipkart, India&#8217;s largest e-commerce firm, according to two people who work at the firm&#8217;s recently launched social commerce effort.</p>
<p>As of April this year, 13 million entrepreneurs and more than 100,000 suppliers were using Meesho, the startup&#8217;s founder Vidit Aatrey told TechCrunch in an interview last month, adding that the startup had since “grown 3x.”</p>
<p>At stake is the world’s second-largest internet market, where e-commerce has hardly made any dent to the overall retail. Just the social commerce market is expected to be worth up to $20 billion in value by 2025, up from about $1 billion to $1.5 billion last year, analysts at Bernstein said last month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Social commerce has the ability to empower more than 40 million small entrepreneurs across India. Today, 85% of sellers using social commerce are small, offline-oriented retailers who use social channels to open up new growth opportunities,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Google, which has committed to invest $10 billion in 1India in the next couple of years, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">backed Indian startups Glance and DailyHunt</a>. YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/youtube-acquires-indian-social-commerce-startup-simsim/">acquired social commerce startup SimSim in July this year</a>. Earlier this month, the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/google-and-temasek-back-indian-neobank-open-in-100-million-fundraise/">backed Bangalore-based neobanking startup Open</a>.</p>
<p>Google did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/21/the-station-doordash-snags-400m-bolt-mobility-deploys-self-cleaning-tech-and-disappearing-jump-bikes/">Bolt Mobility</a>, a micromobility <a href="https://www.micromobility.com/">company</a> co-founded by Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, has launched an in-app navigation system for its e-scooters dubbed &#8220;MobilityOS.&#8221; To make this feature easy to use, Bolt&#8217;s next generation of scooters, the &#8220;Bolt Two,&#8221; allows a rider&#8217;s smartphone to be mounted to, and charged by, the scooter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The simple act of adding a phone mount to a scooter along with this in-app navigation is a differentiator in the shared scooter market. Not many shared e-scooters include phone mounts, a shocking oversight considering that it&#8217;s 2021 and most people who ride scooters likely outsource their navigation to Google Maps or Apple Maps. That said, some operators told TechCrunch giving distraction-prone riders a screen to look at when approaching intersections is a safety risk, not to mention the probable costs associated with having to fix or replace mounts that get damaged on the tough city streets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bolt&#8217;s MobilityOS uses map visualization provided by Google Maps, but the navigation system is built in-house to incorporate city-specific geofences for each unique ride, which helps keep riders on streets with bike lanes away from dangerous, sensitive or high-traffic areas. Spin&#8217;s app has a similar feature. Bolt says its system also encourages users to park vehicles safely and keep sidewalks clean with &#8220;reward parking zones.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221490" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The mount on the Bolt Twos is also a built-in wireless smartphone charger that&#8217;s powered by the scooter&#8217;s swappable batteries. The impact on the scooter battery of charging a smartphone is &#8220;minimal,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bolt is currently present in 33 cities, towns and campuses across the United States. MobilityOS and the Bolt Twos are already live in Miami, the company&#8217;s hometown, but the navigation system will arrive in Bolt&#8217;s other markets in the first quarter of next year. The new scooters will arrive into new markets, which Bolt hasn&#8217;t yet announced, and into existing markets as older fleets are updated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In terms of what the competition offers, Voi, which mainly operates in Europe, does have a phone mount, but most of the others, including Veo, Spin, Lime and Bird, don&#8217;t. Superpedestrian and Veo say they&#8217;re working on getting phone holders on their fleets now, and Lime is piloting them on its Gen4 Scooter in Stockholm before making a decision about rolling them out globally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lime, Spin and Bird are integrated with Google Maps, so users can both find e-scooters and route vehicle-specific trips on the app. However, without a mount, most users will probably just end up using headphones to listen out for directions while keeping their phone safely tucked away in a pocket.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-growing fintech </span><a href="https://www.brex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $300 million in funding that propels it to decacorn status, just six months after it was valued at $7.4 billion, according to people familiar with the deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sources, who wished to remain anonymous since the deal is not yet public (although a term sheet has been signed), said corporate spend startup Brex is now valued at $12.3 billion. Greenoaks is said to be leading the investment, which also reportedly includes return backers who want more of a stake in the company after seeing the “strength” of the business. Brex is on track to double revenue this year, according to the sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Brex nor Greenoaks responded to requests for comment.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by </span><span class="s1">Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras (who are now in their mid-20s),</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> San Francisco-based Brex was valued at $7.4 billion this April after raising </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $425 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Tiger Global Management. The company had raised $1.2 billion in debt and equity financing, according to Crunchbase </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/brex"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With its latest infusion, that number climbs to $1.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Brex is now a decacorn is somewhat remarkable, given its relatively young age. As mentioned above, it&#8217;s now on track to double revenue in 2021, although we don&#8217;t have any hard figures on hand. The company told TechCrunch at the time of its last raise that it was “onboarding thousands of new tech and non-tech customers every month.” Brex also said then that it grew its “total customer” figure by 80% in the first quarter of 2021, “with total monthly customer additions increasing by 5x.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corporate spend space has heated up in a major way over the past year. Spend management startup Ramp in August announced it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $300 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series C round of funding that valued the company at $3.9 billion. Brex is focused on earlier-stage startups as well as more established businesses, especially those in the mid-market category. Ramp tends to serve larger, more established companies. At the time of its raise, Ramp told TechCrunch that it had seen its revenue and transaction volume surge by 1,000% since the beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last week, TripActions revealed that a pandemic pivot to helping enterprises with corporate expenses helped boost its revenue and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/from-0-in-revenue-to-a-7-25b-valuation-why-tripactions-275m-raise-has-fintech-to-thank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lift its valuation to $7.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So it too now has unexpectedly emerged as a competitor in the corporate spend race. CEO Ariel Cohen told TechCrunch that he believes TripActions differs from Brex and Ramp in that the two startups “are disparate from travel” and thus focus more on SMEs while TripActions is more focused on enterprise companies. Interestingly, Greenoaks led that company’s recent $275 million round, as well.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brex, too, continues to evolve its model. Earlier today, the startup announced its new &#8220;<a href="https://www.brex.com/product/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brex API</a>.&#8221; The new open API is available to all Brex customers for no extra charge, it said, and is designed to allow them to &#8220;seamlessly manage financial information in a customizable interface.&#8221; For customers without in-house developers, Brex also announced a partnership with Zapier, which will allow the automation of workflows among products &#8220;without having to write a single line of code.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the Brex API, the company added, developers can build workflows that are customized for their company’s individual needs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the company announced it had put together a new service </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005625/en/Brex-Unveils-All-In-One-Financial-Solution-For-Businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called Brex Premium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that costs $49 per month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The number of premium subscribers that we now have definitely blew away our expectations,” Dubugras told me in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Brex was the latest fintech </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to apply for a bank charter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which sells a credit card tailored for startups, with Emigrant Bank currently acting as the issuer, had submitted an application with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) to establish Brex Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in August, the company said it would </span><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/brex-will-withdraw-applications-for-industrial-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voluntarily withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its bank charter and federal deposit insurance applications in an effort to “modify and strengthen” its application before resubmitting at a later date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in August, Brex </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brex-buys-weav-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platforms-for-50m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired one-year-old Weav,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a developer of a universal API for commerce platforms, for $50 million in its first significant acquisition. The move was aimed at giving the businesses which use its platform the ability to get financial services and new products “more quickly and precisely,” the company said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re standing at the water&#8217;s edge of the San Francisco Bay, chances are that you have half a dozen high-speed internet providers clamoring for your attention, eager to give you gigabits of internet. That isn&#8217;t the case for billions of people in rural communities around the world, who often have to make do with sub-par &#8212; if any &#8212; service. That&#8217;s the market <a href="https://meshplusplus.com/">Mesh++</a> is aiming to serve, and the company just snagged a couple of sacks of cash to help them realize its mission. Headquartered in Chicago and Nairobi, the team is focused on bringing internet connectivity to rural and underserved communities.</p>
<p>On paper, the solution is elegant. You plug a wireless router into power, and the router looks for other nearby Mesh++ routers. They connect and share any available internet connectivity across the mesh network. Each router becomes a node, further spreading the Wi-Fi love across the land. The company claims a single node can blanket 10 acres of Wi-Fi connectivity, supporting up to 100 people. If a local internet connection goes down due to connectivity or power failure, the rest of the network picks up the slack &#8212; and if there&#8217;s a full breakdown, the network can be used for internal communication, including messaging and news alerts within the network.</p>
<p>The internet connection can come from anywhere &#8212; whether via ethernet, via cellular modems, via multiple points &#8212; you have a set of Ethernet or cellular modems, throughout the network, and you&#8217;re able to aggregate the bandwidth from all those sources. So that creates a redundant network where if one of those fails the others can fill in. The cool thing about that, versus having a set of separate networks that are all fed separately, is that it creates a very trusted network where, for example, you might be deploying a fiber network in a very old city where the fiber infrastructure is already starting to fail. And having a network like this, that can aggregate the sources, means you can trust a normally untrusted source, because if it fails, nothing really major happens. So, we can create very resilient networks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to routine connectivity when everything is working as planned, the network should be able to survive disaster situations. This was tested a couple of years ago, when Hurricane Ida knocked out a huge swathe of connectivity across New Orleans; the company claims its network continued without any downtime.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no shortage of plays for rural and remote internet connectivity, but I&#8217;m struck by how Mesh++&#8217;s solution is coming at the challenge from a place of access and equality. It is certainly more equalitarian than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/elon-musk-says-starlink-internet-private-beta-to-begin-in-roughly-three-months-public-beta-in-six/">Elon Musk&#8217;s Starlink</a>, to pick an example out of outer space, but at the same time it is easy to imagine a combination of Starlink for internet gateway purposes and Mesh++ for the local distribution of rural internet connectivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a number of companies out there who can give you gigabit internet connections anywhere in the world,&#8221; says Mesh++&#8217;s CEO Danny Gardner, suggesting that Starlink may, in fact, be a good fit. &#8220;It would be a dream partnership. The challenge that a lot of these companies face, is that you can, in theory, serve a few hundred people per satellite, and the last-mile internet connectivity is the challenge. For them, partnering with a technology like ours that can get connectivity to anywhere, we will be able to connect the world&#8217;s remaining 3 billion people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is betting that it can out-execute even the big cellular data providers, and the team seems pretty unfazed by the competition offered by LTE or 5G networks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Look, T-Mobile promised to cover most of the U.S. with sub 6 Ghz 5G connectivity. But the truth is that if they haven&#8217;t covered it yet with 4G because they determined that wasn&#8217;t financially sustainable, then it&#8217;s not gonna happen with 5G either,&#8221; Gardner surmises.</p>
<p>In addition to having built out test networks in a number of American cities, the company has a presence in Nairobi, with a five-person subsidiary there.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first started the company, it was primarily geared towards emerging markets and the need for internet access,&#8221; says Gardner. &#8220;At first, we didn&#8217;t realize how big of a problem it is here at home in the U.S. Slowly over time, we shifted more towards fixing the connectivity problems in our own backyard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mesh++ has raised a $4.9 million seed led by impact investor <a href="https://www.worldwithin.org/">World Within</a>, with participation from new investors Lateral Capital, Anorak Ventures, First Leaf Capital and existing investors SOSV, GAN Ventures, TechNexus and Illinois Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fundraising marks a major shift in the company, from a pure R&amp;D-driven company over the past few years, and towards focusing more on sales, and turning the company into a more mature organization,&#8221; says Gardner. &#8220;The fundraising unlocks us being able to partner with customers and distributors to connect as many people as possible, and to get the product out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is playing into the macro-economic trend of ensuring that every home in the U.S. can be covered by internet connections. There is lots of funding available for last-mile networks, especially in the U.S. &#8212; now over $80 billion in the last few years. That’s not enough for fiber to every home &#8212; the economics and logistics of that only works in areas with higher population densities. This is where mesh networks might just be the key. Mesh++ claims that its technology cuts the infrastructure cost for installation from more than $400 per household to $29 or thereabouts. The savings are primarily in the labor costs and ease of installation, rather than the cost of the hardware that needs to be installed on-site.</p>
