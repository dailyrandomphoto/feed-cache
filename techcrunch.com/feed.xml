										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart is further investing in technology that will enable shopping via voice and chat with its latest acquisition. The retail giant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accelerating-our-conversational-platform-through-botmocks-ainoa/">announced</a> it&#8217;s acquiring &#8220;select technology assets&#8221; from a startup called <a href="https://www.botmock.com/">Botmock</a>, which had developed a set of tools for designing, prototyping, testing, and deploying conversational applications across platforms.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Botmock got off the ground just when conversational experiences were starting to be developed. At this time, there was a lack of resources available for design teams. The company says most of its early customers were working directly within platforms like DialogFlow or IBM Watson, for example, which made it harder for them to rapidly test their ideas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, non-developers were using tools like Visio or LucidCharts to create their conversation flows. Botmock promised a better toolset that would allow teams to avoid blind spots in their design and build better overall conversational experiences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227868" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2227916" style="width: 614px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227916" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2227916" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?w=604" alt="" width="604" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg 1333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=267,300 267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=768,864 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=604,680 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227916" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Botmock&#8217;s solution offers a drag-and-drop editor for designing a chatbot (or voice bot)&#8217;s conversations. The system automatically develops the code in the background as users design their conversation flows. It also helps to handle the specific complexities that were involved with the project &#8212; like platform-specific restrictions &#8212; while facilitating team collaboration.</p>
<p>Ahead of Walmart&#8217;s acquisition, the Botmock system worked with a company&#8217;s existing tools, like Atlassian JIRA, RASA, DialogFlow, Atlassian Confluence, Slack, Zapier, Alexa Skills Kit, or IBM Watson. The conversations developed within Botmock could then be output to text-based or voice platforms, including Apple Business Chat, WhatsApp, SMS, Messenger, Microsoft Office Teams, Slack, Alexa, or Google Assistant.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210914233413/https://botmock.com/">to a recent version of Botmock&#8217;s website</a>, its tools were being used by over 50,000 people. It also touted customers across verticals, including large businesses like Nationwide, Accenture, Delta, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Oracle, Viasat, Mercury.ai, Liveperson, BlueRobot, BT, Avanade, and Enbridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Walmart, however, intends to use Botmock for what it calls &#8220;conversational commerce&#8221; &#8212; an area of increased investment in recent months.</p>
<p>The company in October <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/10/14/the-future-is-conversational-how-voice-and-text-are-transforming-shopping">announced</a> the beta test of a &#8220;Walmart Text to Shop&#8221; experience that allows customers to text to make purchases. It follows years of investment in voice-based shopping, which culminated in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/">2019 partnership</a> with Google for voice-enabled grocery shopping. Today, Walmart offers voice-based shopping through both Google and Siri, and allows customers to check-in for contactless pickup using their voice.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, text-based shopping is only now getting warmed up, <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/10/14/the-future-is-conversational-how-voice-and-text-are-transforming-shopping">Walmart says</a>.</p>
<p>With Botmock, the company says it will be able to build out natural voice and chat interfaces for both its customers and its associates &#8212; the latter through the internally used &#8220;Ask Sam&#8221; app which can answer questions or direct store staff to the location of products, among other things.</p>
<p>&#8220;With such a tool we can build natural voice and chat interfaces for our customers and associates faster and deploy them more rapidly,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accelerating-our-conversational-platform-through-botmocks-ainoa/">shared</a> Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart SVP of Core Retail Services &amp; Emerging Technology. &#8220;Building seamless interactions for voice or chat is a fairly difficult design problem that requires us to consider all possible conversational flows, which depend on customers’ unique situation and needs,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, when a customer is building their weekly grocery cart using their voice, they might say, &#8216;add milk to my cart.&#8217; The right action and the response to the customer depends on various factors, including if the customer has bought milk in the past, what their preferred type of milk is (e.g., 2% or non-fat, etc.), do they already have some type of milk in their cart, and if so, should we ask whether they want to change the quantity or let them know they already have it in their cart,&#8221; Ainoa noted.</p>
<p>In the past, these types of experiences could take months to develop and deploy, but Botmock&#8217;s technology will allow it to deploy in days, she added. This, in turn, will help to speed time to market and lower its costs.</p>
<p>Walmart did not detail the terms of the deal, noting only it was acquiring select technology assets.</p>
<p>According to Botmock&#8217;s <a href="https://www.botmock.com/">website</a>, however, the team will also be joining Walmart and working to transition its existing customers by helping migrate their data. Its customers will have access to Botmock through Dec. 1st, 2021 and pro-rated refunds on subscriptions are being issued, the website said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">rebranding itself</a>, Facebook announced plans to delete a trove of the most worrisome data that the world&#8217;s biggest social network collected on more than a billion individuals.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/">blog post Tuesday</a>, Facebook&#8217;s newly-named parent company Meta explained that it would close shop on its facial recognition systems and delete a massive collection of more than a billion facial recognition templates used to pair faces with photos and videos. Facebook will no longer do that pairing moving forward for users who previously opted in.</p>
<p>Facebook introduced facial recognition in 2010 to automatically tag photos with names. The feature was automatically enabled at launch, and Facebook only made the system <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/update-face-recognition/">explicitly opt-in in 2019</a>, a choice that explains how it managed to compile more than a billion facial recognition profiles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227861" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead, we still see facial recognition technology as a powerful tool, for example, for people needing to verify their identity, or to prevent fraud and impersonation,&#8221; Facebook VP of artificial intelligence Jerome Pesenti wrote in a blog post. &#8220;&#8230; But the many specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pesenti noted the uncertain environment for facial recognition technology in the decision to limit Meta&#8217;s facial recognition work to a narrower set of applications.</p>
<p>At this point, Facebook&#8217;s face recognition system was probably more trouble than it was worth. Many proposals to regulate online privacy in the U.S. remain hypothetical, particularly at the federal level, but existing laws can complicate the use of facial recognition technology. Among them is an Illinois privacy law known as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bipa/">Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)</a>, which has ensnared some of tech&#8217;s biggest companies.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Facebook was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/facebook-illinois-class-action-bipa/">ordered to pay $650 million in a BIPA settlement</a> for using facial recognition to identify Illinois residents&#8217; photos without their consent. The controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI is also currently facing a BIPA lawsuit in the state. The FTC also cited Facebook&#8217;s use of facial recognition in its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/"> record-breaking but ultimately toothless $5 billion settlement</a> with the company over deceptive privacy practices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s decision to turn away from facial recognition is a symbolic gesture on the heels of the company&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/"> big rebrand around the metaverse</a>. Concerns about Facebook&#8217;s privacy and moderation failings have done little to dent its business, but public distrust and looming regulation will follow the company into its next chapter, rebrand or no.</p>
<p>As the company now known as Meta tries to reposition itself as a trustworthy steward for the next internet era, it has its work cut out for it. Attempting to cast off some baggage from previous privacy scandals is a shrewd move — and ultimately a win for users — even if nobody buys the sudden change of heart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alternative assets, from bottles of fine wine to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/nfts-are-changing-cultural-value-creation/">non-fungible tokens</a> to even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/masterworks-raises-110m-to-push-fractional-shares-of-physical-art-not-nfts-into-investor-portfolios/">fractional shares of physical art</a>, are becoming a mainstream form of modern investing. As consumers diversify their portfolios away from traditional public equities, New York-based startup Aqua is betting that the future may look a little more private.</p>
<p>Co-founded by Rohan Marwaha and Dev Patel, Aqua wants to help any investor have access to private equity funds, an investment vehicle that has traditionally been reserved for high net-worth individuals or institutional investors. By getting savvy investors to put money into a PE fund instead of the S&amp;P 500 or Cartoon Ape, Aqua thinks it can blend stable returns with diversified assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227396" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There’s all of this general proof that investors are excited, investors are ready and they understand what the new asset classes are,” Marwaha said. “Where we draw the distinction is that, in private equity funds, it’s a little bit less risky, but it’s part of the same trend.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2227890 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg" alt="" width="841" height="550" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg 1394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /></p>
<p>Aqua is a two-sided marketplace. It helps private equity firms deal with the back office, logistical work of handling smaller investors, while giving those same investors access to opportunities with minimums of $10,000 &#8211; instead of a traditionally higher range between $250,000 and $25 million. The startup, still pre-launch, declined to share any information about early usage on its platform or customer engagement.</p>
<p>Marwaha saw inefficiencies within the private equity system while working as an analyst at Blackstone, an investment group where he worked for less than a year. He noticed that most processes within private equity firms are completed by hand, on paper or through faxing machines. The archaic processes disincentivize PE firms from pursuing smaller investors, since coordination for capital calls and eventual returns is even harder to pull off.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2227891" style="width: 885px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227891" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2227891" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg" alt="" width="875" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg 1394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227891" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://Aquua" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aqua <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The co-founder argues that the logistical woes of dealing with smaller checks aren’t hindering interest from PE firms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RJAluJPvCh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/private-equity-giveth-and-private-equity-taketh-away/">Private equity giveth, and private equity taketh away</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Private equity giveth, and private equity taketh away&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/private-equity-giveth-and-private-equity-taketh-away/embed/#?secret=RJAluJPvCh" data-secret="RJAluJPvCh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“A tech-enabled solution, where we deal with all the back office work of dealing with the smaller investors would be a huge value add to private equity,” he said. “They want access to dollars to continue to grow their funds and new opportunities, they just don&#8217;t want to have to deal with administrative stuff.”</p>
<p>From an integration perspective, Aqua acts like an LP for PE firms. It operates a single entity on a PE firm’s cap table on behalf of the consumers that are pouring smaller checks into the fund. When and if returns come, Aqua then distributes the profits to every investor that puts money into the pipeline.</p>
<p>Persuading PE firms to use the service for fundraising will be the biggest early challenge for Aqua. After all, how can you bet that a firm will try out a new experimental service if its processes are built atop an entirely different ethos? Marwaha pushed back on this characterization, saying that “there were always people interested in [private equity funds] but it was just too difficult for the [firms] themselves to take on their capital.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t hurt that Aqua isn’t charging firms a dime for its services, too.</p>
<p>Aqua, at least for now, doesn’t cost a penny for PE firms to use. Instead, the startup makes money through normal return cycles, only cashing in when its customers do. Because distributions aren’t as predictable as, say, recurring revenue from a SaaS subscription, Aqua is exposing itself to some volatility: returns can take anywhere from seven to ten years. The team is working to make sure it has a good diversity of assets, with rolling return options, for both the health of its business (and I’m sure, the delight of its consumers). Aqua is also experimenting with options in which individuals can buy and sell portions of funds during designated times of the year.</p>

<p>The strategy has convinced a slew of early backers and partners. Aqua has landed a partnership with Permira, an asset manager with over $50 billion under its umbrella. The company also announced that it has raised a $2.5 million seed round led by Gradient Ventures, Google’s AI-focused venture fund, with participation from Y Combinator. With the early validation, the two founders plan to hire eight more people within the next six months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Iron Ox <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iron-ox-launches-grover-an-all-new-autonomous-mobile-robot-301413565.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today announced</a> the launch of the crop-assisting mobile robot Grover. According to the Bay Area-based indoor farming firm, the mobile robot is capable of lifting and moving up to 1,000 pounds of payload.</p>
<p>The primary cargo is a 6&#215;6-foot module that houses hydroponically fed produce. The modules are moved to a machine for scanning their progress and then transferred to another station for either additional care or harvesting. The system navigates a grow space courtesy of on-board lidar, as well as sets of forward and upward-facing cameras.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are applying technology to minimize the amount of land, water and energy needed to nourish a growing population,&#8221; CEO Brandon Alexander said in a release. &#8220;Our short-term goal is to mitigate the impact of climate change on the agriculture system. And we won&#8217;t stop until we achieve our long-term mission of making the produce sector carbon negative.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227835" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The technology arrives during a time of increased interest around indoor farming, as startups are looking for potentially more sustainable agricultural efforts to feed booming population growth. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">Vertical farming</a> is perhaps the buzziest form in the category, but Iron Ox’s solution takes the form of a more traditional greenhouse &#8212; albeit one that is fully automated from the ground up.</p>
<p>The California-based company recently broke ground on a 535,000-square-foot indoor farm in Texas. In September the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/robotic-farming-firm-iron-ox-raises-53m/">raised a $53 million Series C</a>, bringing its total funding to $98 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FBI has warned that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> groups are targeting companies involved in &#8220;significant, time-sensitive financial events,” like mergers and acquisitions, in an effort to coerce victims into paying their ransom demands.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/211101.pdf">an advisory to private companies this week</a>, the FBI said that cybercriminals often try to find non-public information when targeting companies involved in major financial events, which cybercriminals can threaten to publish if they don&#8217;t pay the ransom demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the initial reconnaissance phase, cyber criminals identify non-publicly available information, which they threaten to release or use as leverage during the extortion to entice victims to comply with ransom demands. Impending events that could affect a victim’s stock value, such as announcements, mergers, and acquisitions, encourage ransomware actors to target a network or adjust their timeline for extortion where access is established,&#8221; the FBI said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“If victims do not pay a ransom quickly, ransomware actors will threaten to disclose this information publicly, causing potential investor backlash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impending events that could affect a victim’s stock value, such as announcements, mergers, and acquisitions, encourage ransomware actors to target a network or adjust their timeline for extortion where access is established,&#8221; he advisory said.</p>
<p>The FBI said it&#8217;s identified several cases of ransomware groups using information on an ongoing merger or acquisition negotiations to put pressure on organizations to pay up.</p>
<p>Last year, a long-time member of the REvil ransomware group encouraged using the NASDAQ stock exchange as a way to strong-arm victims into paying up. Weeks later, another ransomware group cited a victim&#8217;s publicly traded stock in its negotiations with the company. Later that year, an analysis of another ransomware attack identified several keywords used by the hackers to search a victim&#8217;s network for non-public financial information related to financial filings with regulators and upcoming press releases, according to the FBI.</p>
<p>In April this year, the DarkSide ransomware group — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">since rebranded as BlackMatter</a> — announced that it was looking to work with market traders to punish victims that failed to pay up. In a message posted to its now-defunct blog, the urged traders to reach out and receive the inside scoop on the gang’s latest corporate victims, so they can short sell their stock before any data is leaked and the news goes public.</p>
<p>“Now our team and partners encrypt many companies that are trading on NASDAQ and other stock exchanges,” a post from the Russian hacking collective read. “If the company refuses to pay, we are ready to provide information before the publication, so that it would be possible to earn in the reduction price [sic] of shares.”</p>
<p>The FBI has long urged organizations not to give in to cybercriminals’ ransom demands as it “emboldens&#8221; the hackers to target additional organizations and funds other criminal activity, but noted that it “understands that when businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers.”</p>
<p>The warning comes just weeks after the FBI — along with CISA and the NSA — warned that the aforementioned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cisa-nsa-blackmatter-food-industry/">BlackMatter ransomware group has targeted “multiple” organizations deemed critical infrastructure</a>, including two organizations in the U.S. food and agriculture sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">early</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-is-launching-a-trio-of-members-only-casual-games-in-poland-italy-and-spain/">tests</a> in select markets, Netflix announced today its debut lineup of exclusive mobile games will begin rolling out to all members globally on Android devices, starting this week. In July, the streaming service first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/netflix-says-its-gaming-push-will-begin-with-mobile/">confirmed</a> its plans to enter the mobile gaming market, calling games &#8220;another new content category&#8221; for the company to offer its subscribers, alongside movies and TV. Since then, Netflix has made available to members a growing number of free games with no ads or in-app payments &#8212; including a mix of both casual games and those centered around its popular original TV series, &#8220;Stranger Things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Netflix had been expanding its investments in gaming for some time. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">the E3 gaming conference back in 2019</a>, Netflix detailed a series of gaming integrations across popular game platforms like Roblox and Fortnite and plans to bring new &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games to the market. On mobile, it then began working with the Texas-based game studio BonusXP on the game, &#8220;Stranger Things: The Game,&#8221; which has since been rebranded to &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; to differentiate it from the follow-up title, &#8220;Stranger Things 3.&#8221;</p>
<p>These two games also became the first titles to be tested within the Netflix Android app when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">began marketing</a> its games in Poland this August.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In September, Netflix also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">acquired</a> the independent game developer Night School Studio, best known for narrative-driven titles like Oxenfree, to further build out its library of Netflix games.</p>
<p>And just last month, TechCrunch broke the news of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-is-launching-a-trio-of-members-only-casual-games-in-poland-italy-and-spain/">Netflix&#8217;s gaming expansion</a> with the launch of three new casual games &#8212; <a href="https://frostypop.com/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frosty Pop&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Shooting Hoops&#8221; and &#8220;Teeter Up&#8221; and  <a href="https://rogueco.com/games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rogue Games</a>&#8216; &#8220;Card Blast&#8221; &#8212;  to Netflix subscribers in Spain and Italy, in addition to Poland.</p>
<p>Now this full lineup, including the two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games and the three casual games, will become available to all members globally on Android.</p>
<p>To access the titles, users will tap on the new Games tab in the Netflix app for Android where the games are listed. After selecting a title, users are directed to the Google Play Store to install the games, as you would any other app. However, to sign in and play the game, a Netflix membership is required.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After being downloaded, the games will be available to play at any time by tapping them within the Netflix app or on the home screen of their Android device.</p>

<p>During tests, the games were only available to Android smartphone users. With the global launch, they&#8217;ll now become available to members with Android tablets, too, Netflix says. Here, the games will also be featured in a new games row (pinned to position 6), and they&#8217;ll be found in the Categories drop-down menu in the Netflix app.</p>
<p>The company tells TechCrunch the new games will become visible in the Google Play Store starting today, but their rollout to the Netflix Android app will begin on Wednesday. It may be several days until that rollout completes and all Netflix members in global markets are able to access the games.</p>
<p>Netflix doesn&#8217;t have any plans at present to monetize the games directly. Currently, the titles are free to download, free from advertising and don&#8217;t include any in-app purchases. Instead, the company sees games as a means of growing and maintaining its existing subscriber base. If you download a game but are not a Netflix member, you&#8217;ll be directed to create a Netflix account on the web, for example. (This could also be seen as another way to route around the app stores&#8217; commissions on in-app purchases).</p>
<p>During its Q3 earnings call with investors, Netflix COO and Chief Product Officer Gregory Peters explained Netflix&#8217;s interest in gaming was about meeting its members where they are. He revealed that the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of subscribers engage with the service on a mobile device. That requires offering a different set of experiences beyond just long-form video content. On this front, Netflix also this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">launched a TikTok-like short feed of comedy videos</a> called &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; on mobile, which serves a similar purpose of expanding the type of content available under the Netflix umbrella.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s efforts in mobile gaming are still &#8220;incredibly early,&#8221; Peters cautioned on the call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly what we&#8217;ve done to date is about essentially making sure that all of our systems are working as we expect. So it&#8217;s really about proving to ourselves that we can do the delivery in a way that we want,&#8221; he said, referencing the early mobile gaming tests. But longer-term, Netflix sees potential in being able to personalize suggestions of games to play to its members, the way its algorithms today suggest new movies and shows to watch, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same thing that&#8217;s made our service very powerful for recommending movies and TV shows,&#8221; Peters continued, &#8220;connecting great content creators to this audience &#8212; that&#8217;s the capability that we need to build on the game side now, as well,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The company says it plans to roll out downloadable games to iOS users in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, though, may prove to be a bit more difficult than on Android, due to Apple&#8217;s stricter App Store rules, which generally prevent apps from hosting other apps and games.</p>
<p>However, Apple last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/apple-revises-app-store-rules-to-permit-game-streaming-apps-clarify-in-app-purchases-and-more/">did update its rules to allow</a> game-streaming apps to offer a &#8220;catalog app&#8221; where customers subscribe to a service that then links out to the individual gaming titles the subscription offers, which may include games from multiple publishers. Though intended for services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Google Stadia, a third-party app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/gameclub-offers-mobile-gamings-greatest-hits-for-5-per-month/">catalog offered via subscription by GameClub</a> was the seeming inspiration for the policy as it offers a hub to subscribe to a series of downloadable titles.</p>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s catalog could work under these guidelines, too &#8212; as long as potential subscribers were pointed to the main Netflix app to sign up, giving Apple its cut.</p>
<p>The company says the games rollout to Android will begin on November 3 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roblox-outage-ends-210646994.html">three-day</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/31/roblox-back-after-three-days-halloween-outage/">Halloween weekend outage</a> benefitted other popular gaming apps, according to new data from mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower. In a rare, but unfortunately timed outage event, Roblox&#8217;s gaming platform went down on the evening on October 28 and didn&#8217;t return until October 31, leading to gains in apps also favored by Roblox&#8217;s younger users, including Minecraft, Among Us, and, possibly, Twitch.</p>
<p>Based on Sensor Tower&#8217;s panel of installs, users continued to try to access the Roblox app while it was down. This resulted in some form of &#8220;time spent&#8221; in the Roblox app during the outage. But overall, the average time spent in the app was down by 93% week-over-week, <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/roblox-outage-impact">the firm reported</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Minecraft&#8217;s usage saw a 2% week-over-week boost in usage during the same period between Oct. 29 to 31, and Among Us surged upwards by 6%. These jumps are likely a result of Roblox users looking for another game to visit over the weekend where they could also network with friends, as they had planned. In addition, Among Us usage jumped 12% on October 29 compared with the day prior to the outage, and Minecraft usage was bumped up 13%.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227759" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2227818" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227818" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2227818" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="413" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=768,466 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227818" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>The firm also took a look at the game-streaming app Twitch, and found time spent in the app had grown by 8% week-over-week and saw an 11% increase in average session count. But in this case, not all the growth may be attributed directly to the Roblox downtime. Sensor Tower also notes that Twitch was hosting the League of Legends semi-finals over the Halloween weekend, and it was featuring many special holiday streams from popular gamers.</p>
<p>In addition to capturing gamers&#8217; time and attention, the Roblox outage may have also played a role in boosting other apps&#8217; installs, the report said.</p>
<p>Early data indicates Among Us installs jumped up 19% from the day prior on Oct. 30, to reach approximately 436,000 across both iOS and Android. They were also up 44% week-over-week. This made for the best day for Among Us installs since April 4, 2021. It also gained 1% in terms of revenue, with an addition $12,000 &#8212; its best day for revenue since July 17, 2021. (The report didn&#8217;t analyze the other apps.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Roblox has since attributed its outage to a combination of factors. It said a core system in its infrastructure was overwhelmed due to a &#8220;subtle bug&#8221; in its backend service communications while under a heavy load. The company dismissed the rumors this was due to the Chiptole free burrito promo &#8212; the chain was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chipotle-to-open-virtual-restaurant-on-roblox-with-1-million-in-free-burritos-and-serve-up-5-digital-entree-offer-for-boorito-301408455.html">going to give out</a> $1 million worth of free burritos to players. The promo had just begun running just before the systems crashed. But Roblox <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454215549014069249">said</a> the disruption was not caused by any &#8220;experiences or partnerships&#8221; on its platform.</p>
<p>The outage followed Roblox&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/roblox-avatar-updates-rdc-2021/">announcement</a> of a number of significant changes coming to its platform. In addition to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/roblox-voice-chat-spatial-audio/">recently launched voice chat system</a>, the company also said it would update its player avatars to be more realistic and be able to sport layered and more personalized clothing, and would support an NFT-like system for selling digital items in-game.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/10/update-recent-service-outage/">said</a> it would publish a more detailed post-mortem after its analysis of the outage is complete.</p>
<p>The timing of the disruption was significant. While other games may have been boosted, as a result, Roblox lost money. <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/10/celebrate-halloween-roblox/">It had planned a series of Halloween events</a> on its platform across a number of games, including Royale High, Super Golf, and themed games like Ghostopia and Spirits of Hallows Eve, and had special Halloween items available for players&#8217; avatars.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Backblaze's IPO is a harkening back to the time when it was somewhat difficult to convince private-market investors to value your company in the nine-figures, let alone 10. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Backblaze first filed to go public, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/backblazes-ipo-shows-its-possible-to-go-public-sans-mountains-of-vc-cash/">found it a compelling company</a>. With a central core of content to help power customer acquisition and a huge swath of customers, it was an interesting cloud storage play. But when it came to pricing, we had little idea of how to value the company.</p>
<p>Since it was smaller in revenue terms than most tech companies going public these days, we deferred on judging its worth until Backblaze itself provided some guidance. And it has, namely <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001462056/000119312521316078/d62601ds1a.htm">an S-1/A filing</a> indicating that the company expects to price its IPO between $15 and $17 per share.</p>
<p>At its IPO price range and 28,545,893 shares expected to be outstanding after its IPO, Backblaze is worth $428.2 million to $485.3 million. Notably the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation is quite a bit higher, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88067/Storage-cloud-platform-Backblaze-sets-terms-for-$100-million-IPO">with Renaissance Capital reporting</a> that at $16 per share, Backblaze&#8217;s valuation inclusive of shares that have been earned, if not yet exercised via options or similar, to be $644 million.</p>
<p>Quick extrapolation indicates that at the top end of its price range, Backblaze&#8217;s IPO could value the storage firm at $684.3 million.</p>
<p>That means that Backblaze is going public as a non-unicorn. Which is notable given the sheer heft of many tech companies we&#8217;ve seen go public lately. Indeed, even some of the smaller or less traditional companies that we&#8217;ve seen debut in recent quarters have had valuations north of $1 billion.</p>
<p>The examples roll from memory: Robinhood was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">worth dozens of billions</a> when it went public; Coinbase was as well when it direct listed; NerdWallet is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/nerdwallets-ipo-proves-you-can-write-your-way-to-a-unicorn-valuation/">going to be a public unicorn merely on the strength of the written word</a>; and AllBirds? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/allbirds-flotation-should-help-the-market-sort-the-value-of-tech-enabled-ipos/">More like AllUnicorn</a>. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Which makes Backblaze nearly unique from our perspective. Its IPO is a harkening back to the time when it was somewhat difficult to convince private-market investors to value your company in the nine-figures, let alone 10. And when double-digit multiples applied to <em>profit</em> and not <em>revenue. </em>So, color us more than curious.</p>
<p>But before we sign off, we have new numbers from Backblaze that give us a nibble at its Q3 results. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>

<p>The company started with a focus on distributed tracing for serverless platforms like AWS&#8217; API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3 and Lambda. But as the team announced today, it is now also expanding its SaaS service to cover containers and virtual machines.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227821" style="width: 379px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Find_Fix_Issues.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227821" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2227821" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Find_Fix_Issues.gif?w=481" alt="" width="369" height="248" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2227821" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lumigo</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227756" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Using the company&#8217;s platform, businesses can easily visualize every transaction in their network to understand how data flows between services &#8212; and then quickly diagnose issues when it doesn&#8217;t. It offers both a paid SaaS service (which <a href="https://lumigo.io/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes a free tier</a>), as well as a free <a href="https://lumigo.io/blog/introducing-the-lumigo-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">command line tool</a> for analyzing and tuning services based on AWS Lambda and Kinesis.</p>
<p>Some of Lumigo&#8217;s current customers include Medtronic, Vimeo and Sonos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most other Observability platforms have just tacked serverless features onto what were essentially legacy products,&#8221; said Lumigo CEO Erez Berkner. &#8220;Lumigo was designed from the ground up for cloud-native environments, allowing us to offer deep monitoring, distributed tracing and debugging features tailored to the modern cloud technologies and expand outwards to containers and Kubernetes in a way that actually fits how cloud-native apps are designed and operated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berkner noted that as enterprises adopt an ever-growing number of cloud services, Lumigo has to match this velocity if it wants to become the standard observability tool for cloud-native applications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Correlating millions of log lines, traces and metrics across distributed services is pretty close to impossible, and just gets harder with scale,&#8221; said Redline Capital partner Benno Jering. &#8220;<span class="il">Lumigo</span>’s offering solves an ever-growing problem for cloud-native applications; understanding applications as more than just the sum of their parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company will use the new funding to double its 30-person team as it builds out its marketing and product groups (in addition to more hiring on the engineering side).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Switchback II Corporation are off more than 14% in morning trading today, appearing to sell off sharply in the wake of news that the blank-check company&#8217;s merger with scooter company Bird has been approved by shareholders. Shares of the SPAC were off as far as 20% before recovering.</p>
<p>dot.LA <a href="https://dot.la/bird-scooters-public-market-debut-2655476340.html">first spotted the vote news</a>; Bird is based in the Los Angeles metropolitan agglomeration.</p>
<p>News <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/bird-reportedly-prepares-to-go-public-via-spac-aims-for-2023-profitability/">broke in May</a> that Bird was looking at a SPAC-led debut on the public markets. A few days later, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-to-go-public-via-spac-at-an-implied-value-of-2-3b/">the deal was confirmed</a>, including an expected valuation of around $2.3 billion for Bird when it began to trade. That&#8217;s precisely what the company will be worth in light of Switchback II&#8217;s share price declines, but the number could be lower than the headline figure from early merger disclosures.</p>

<p>When the Bird deal was first announced, TechCrunch was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">broadly skeptical of its historical economics</a>. The company&#8217;s early business model of buying scooters and renting them out led to staggering losses.</p>
<p>However, Bird has shaken up its model in recent quarters, leveraging a partner network to handle scooter deployment, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/bird-shows-improving-scooter-economics-long-march-to-profitability/">generated more attractive results</a>. For example, Bird had gross margins that were negative in 2018, 2019 and 2020. This year, the company expects — looking at predictions that included results through Q2 2021 — to post positive gross margins.</p>
<p>Other figures are looking up, too. Ride profit inclusive of depreciation, to pick another example, rose to $15.4 million in Q2 2021, its best result ever, and one of only four quarters in which the result was positive.</p>
<p>Under Bird&#8217;s new business model, scooters go directly to indie operators, who take on a bulk of the operational work that the company once centralized. The company&#8217;s model changed around when the pandemic hit, which, accompanied with improved scooter designs that promise to last longer and so improve depreciation results, have provided a positive boost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pearpop, a marketplace for social collaborations, is expanding to Instagram after previously only being available to TikTok creators. The platform, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/pearpop-lets-tiktok-celebrities-monetize-by-sharing-shoutouts-and-screentime-with-fans/">launched last year</a>, allows creators and brands to buy collaborations with celebrities and larger creators. Pearpop will also become available on Twitter later this month, and on Twitch in December.</p>
<p>The official rollout on Instagram follows a soft launch at the beginning of October. Pearpop says that in less than a month, more than 10,000 Instagram creators have joined the platform. It notes that Instagram availability was the most requested feature among Pearpop users, as over 90% of existing Pearpop creators are already active on the platform. Early adopters of the new Instagram offering include Post Malone, Jake Paul, Paris Hilton, Swae Lee, Tom Felton and Noah Schnapp.</p>
<p>Pearpop CEO and co-founder, Cole Mason, says the initial concept for the platform came out of an obvious gap within the space, as no marketplace existed for creators of all sizes to monetize through simple collaborations that are mutually beneficial.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227257" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“I built Pearpop as the social capital marketplace that helps creators grow, earn and promote across all platforms,” Mason told TechCrunch in an interview. “The overall vision is to move the industry away from platform-driven awareness marketing towards people-driven influence.”</p>
<p>The idea brought in a slew of musicians, athletes, actors and entertainers, including The Weeknd, Amy Schumer, The Chainsmokers, Diddy, Gary Vaynerchuk, Griffin Johnson, Josh Richards, Mark Cuban, Marshmello, Moe Shalizi, Snoop Dogg and more.</p>
<p>Pearpop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/the-chainsmokers-alexis-ohanian-amy-schumer-kevin-hart-mark-cuban-marshmello-and-snoop-dogg-back-pearpop/">announced $16 million</a> in funding in April, which was split between a $6 million seed funding round co-led by Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures and Slow Ventures, with participation from Atelier Ventures and Chapter One Ventures; and a $10 million additional investment led by Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six with participation from Bessemer.</p>
<p>Since Pearpop’s last funding announcement, the company has added several new angel investors, including Swae Lee, Noah Schnapp, Lil Nas X, Dre London, King Bach, Gabrielle Union, Jake Paul, YG, James Corden and Paris Hilton.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its launch, Pearpop has been compared to Cameo, which is an app that allows users to pay celebrities to create personalized videos. When asked about the comparison, Mason stated that &#8220;other platforms offer personalized video messages that are largely used for gifting, and that&#8217;s about it. This isn&#8217;t what Pearpop competes with. Pearpop is a powerful social media tool that can help brands and creators reach big goals like driving people-driven influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Mason says Pearpop will continue to expand to other platforms and focus on refining its current features, such as &#8220;Challenges,&#8221; which allows artists to offer rewards to creators who reach a certain number of followers while promoting a song. Mason also noted that the real goal for Pearpop is to see everyone as a creator.</p>
<p>“Pearpop believes everyone is a creator. Right now, when you think of a creator, you would typically think of someone with 50,000 followers or more. But when you are posting something creative and getting viewership on it, there’s no way to monetize that right now. We think if you have 100 followers or if you have 50 million followers, you should be making money from your content,” Mason said. “We’re just trying to empower that and that’s what we’re building all of our product features around.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Billionaire VC Tim Draper (via Draper Associates) has led a $6 million Series A in wellness tracking startup, <a href="https://vivoo.io/">Vivoo</a>. Also participating in the funding round is ONCE Ventures, Revo Capital, 500 Startups (which backed its pre-seed), Global Ventures, and (the female-led consumer tech startup focused) Halogen Ventures.</p>
<p>The personalized nutrition and lifestyle startup sells subscription-based at-home urine test kits that work in conjunction with an app. Its machine learning technology remotely analyzes a user&#8217;s peed-on test strip to serve up custom &#8216;wellness&#8217; insights, then and there, offering recommendations across a range of areas such as nutrition and biological function.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s founding team is led by CEO and co-founder Miray Tayfun, a serial founder and bioengineer by background who graduated from Stanford&#8217;s postgraduate programs. Other co-founders for the 2017-founded startup are George Radman, CFO; and Gozde Buyukacaroglu, COO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227595" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Vivoo launched its subscription service in July 2020 and has amassed more than 50,000 users from over 100 different countries in a little over a year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s says it&#8217;s expecting its revenue to grow 10x in 2021 &#8212; and points to predictions that the mobile health app market will be worth $236BN by 2026.</p>
<p>It does currently offer a one-time pack (of 4 &#8220;wellness&#8221; tests for $34.99) &#8212; but otherwise it&#8217;s selling a 3-month subscription offering ($15.99pm) or a 12-month subscription which works out to $7.99pm.</p>
<p>While Vivoo is shipping its kits around the world, its biggest markets are the US and Canada &#8212; followed by the UK and Australia. (The Anglo bias is down to content currently only being available for English, and &#8220;tailored for Western cuisine&#8221;, which puts some obvious limits on global appeal.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Typical users to-date are &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">health conscious individuals&#8221; looking for &#8220;actionable </span>insights to improve their diet, health, energy, sleep and overall longevity&#8221;, per Tayfun.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Keto diet audience were the early adopters for our product but we’re seeing interest from a wide age and geography at the moment,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Our biggest audience is 25-45 year old women users followed by the same age group male users. &#8220;Around 80% of our users also use other trackers such as wearable devices and who did or would like to do tests like genetic and microbiome at-home tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivoo says the Series A funding will mostly go on expanding its team to further scale the business &#8212; with a focus on the US, where it has already inked partnerships with retail outlets including Amazon and Walmart to distribute the product.</p>
<p>Funding will also go on expanding the product, with additional test kits planned and a new premium offering incoming that will expand what can be tracked and offer integration with wearable data from products like the Apple Watch to further boost utility.</p>
<p>The quantified health trend has been evolving for several years now, beyond basics like step counting and sleep tracking &#8212; and getting, well, a whole lot more interesting and intimate. But the challenge for this new wave of &#8216;personalized wellness/health&#8217; startups is not just gathering accurate data and avoiding privacy pitfalls, it&#8217;s making good sense of the data they gather.</p>
<p>Whatever the chosen biomarker, such startups have to be able to extract genuinely useful signal from biological noise (remotely in Vivoo&#8217;s case); and, if applying AI (as it is; and most startups in this new wave are), they also need to begin with enough training data to build algorithms that can robustly identify patterns across a diverse user-base and transform a snapshot of individual data into genuinely beneficial lifestyle nudges for the individual in question. Aka: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/eat-this-not-that-exercise-now-new-personalized-software-predicts-and-helps-prevents-blood-sugar-spikes/">Eat this, drink that, exercise now</a> &#8212; as one such startup (January AI) does it.</p>
<p>Startups in this space are targeting a variety of biomarkers to sell the promise of custom nutrition/lifestyle advice that claims to offer a superior spin on the basic tenets of eat fresh, exercise often.</p>
<p>Some &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ultrahuman-raises-17-5m-touting-a-wearable-blood-glucose-tracker/">Ultrahuman</a> and Zoe &#8212; are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/eat-this-not-that-exercise-now-new-personalized-software-predicts-and-helps-prevents-blood-sugar-spikes/">tracking blood glucose</a> and/or getting users to collect and send in stool samples for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/personalized-nutrition-startup-zoe-closes-out-series-b-at-53m/">analysis of their microbiome</a>. And here the focus may be on diet/tackling obesity or pro-fitness/elite sports (or both).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Personalized nutrition startup Zoe closes out Series B at $53M total raise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/personalized-nutrition-startup-zoe-closes-out-series-b-at-53m/embed/#?secret=aLDZIFO50A" data-secret="aLDZIFO50A" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While, for a female fertility use case, the biomarker in question can involve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/kegg-kegel-ball-fertility/">tracking vaginal mucus</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/natural-cycles-gets-30m-for-its-eu-certified-digital-contraception/">body temperature</a>, as with Kegg and Natural Cycles respectively. Or using saliva to track hormones (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/femtech-startup-inne-takes-the-wraps-off-a-hormone-tracker-and-8-8m-in-funding/">Inne</a>).</p>
<p>Certain approaches to personalized wellness/health require more invasive interventions than others to acquire the necessary biological data to perform the tracking. But it&#8217;s fair to say that all ask users to get pretty up close and personal with their own bodies.</p>
<p>Collecting stool samples is obviously a fairly messy business. And gathering real-time blood glucose measurements &#8212; at very least &#8212; means being okay with pricking your finger, for example.</p>
<p>One game-changing technology &#8212; continuous blood glucose monitors (CGMs) &#8212; yields a steady flow of pretty fascinating diet and lifestyle data but you&#8217;ll need to be comfortable wearing a sensor that contains a semi-invasive filament embedded in your interstitial fluid in order to play. (And putting that kind of &#8216;wearable&#8217; in place typically means applying a spring-loaded hollow needle that fires the filament into your flesh&#8230; so it&#8217;s definitely not the Apple Watch and isn&#8217;t going to be for everyone. Although researchers are trying to come up with truly non-invasive CGMs &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/graphwear-closes-20-5m-series-b-for-a-needle-free-nanotech-powered-glucose-monitor/">GraphWear&#8217;s</a> years-long push to build a skin-surface-level wearable for glucose monitoring; so if they pull that off it will be a major breakthrough for scaling personalized health.)</p>
<p>Vivoo &#8212; by contrast &#8212; is using a fairly simple, low mess, non-invasive avenue to get snapshots of biological data: Pee sticks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We chose urine rather than saliva or blood to start because it’s easy to collect and analyze and can be used to measure a high number of the body’s performance variables. 4,000 metabolites can be seen in the urine,&#8221; says Tayfun, suggesting it plans to branch out in the future. She adds that the startup sees CGM as a &#8220;complementary technology&#8221; &#8212; envisaging a partnership with a device maker down the line (&#8220;since the data is complementary to Vivoo data sets, and our users are always seeking more information&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our biggest criteria when we’re looking for other tests or tracking devices is it should be at-home, not sending to a lab and waiting for your results for weeks. We believe that the process is frustrating and old-fashioned for &#8216;at-home&#8217; lab tests,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Vivoo&#8217;s approach is simple: It ships a pack of individual urine test strips to subscribers. (And for anyone who&#8217;s used an at-home pregnancy test the basic process will be familiar.)</p>
<p>Each Vivoo test strip contains a series of colored boxes. After the user has peed on these they just have to wait a couple of minutes and then take a scan of the strip using the camera in the app &#8212; which uploads the image data for analysis. (So the app is examining the pre- and post-pee colors to compare changes &#8212; and using that to determine urine test results.)</p>
<p>Vivoo says it&#8217;s using machine learning technology to perform this remote urine analysis &#8212; including what it bills as &#8220;advanced image and color processes for calibration, validation, and verification&#8221; (i.e. given how much variation there is across smartphone camera hardware). Once the user&#8217;s data has been crunched, the app then returns them custom wellness advice based on the machine learning tech&#8217;s remote read of their urine test.</p>
<p>Advice dished out may include suggestions on how to could tweak your diet to boost a certain nutrient if the urine analysis suggests it&#8217;s low (e.g. calcium or vitamin C) &#8212; such as &#8216;eat more calcium-rich arugula&#8217; or &#8216;have a bowl of vitamin C-boosting strawberries for breakfast&#8217; &#8212; or it might give an alert about a possible infection.</p>
<p>Hydration is another tracked measure. And, here again, Vivoo&#8217;s tech is using a color change analysis to determine whether a user is getting enough to drink &#8212; and, if it thinks not, the app will nudge users to drink more (by, say, recommending they drink 10 glasses of water per day).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While it&#8217;s making recommendations it says are evidence-based and associated with a healthier lifestyle, the startup&#8217;s website is careful to specify the product is for &#8220;wellness&#8221; purposes only &#8212; and that the app is not a medical diagnostic device.</span></p>
<p>Vivoo says its product offers a range of wellness &#8220;parameters&#8221; that health-conscious users can track &#8212; including overall hydration; menstruation; whether they have an infection (e.g. UTI) or bodily inflammation (tracked by analysis of white blood cells); their urine’s acidity and alkalinity level (used as a dietary indicator); ketones (mainly for those on a ‌‌ketogenic‌ ‌diet); and the function of their liver and kidney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users can access data on 15 health factors, including hydration, pH balance, ketones, calcium, magnesium, Vitamin C, free radicals, kidney function, liver function, UTI risk, activity levels, stress levels, menstruation, and overall wellness,&#8221; it writes in a press release.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of tracking going on here so it&#8217;s clearly not the simplest personalized health message. But Tayfun said the team was frustrated with the limitations of other health/wellness trackers and at-home test kits &#8212; wanting something more comprehensive as well as the gratification of instant results. Hence setting out to build Vivoo.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was definitely personal for me,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch. &#8220;I’m a bioengineer, and I wanted to know everything I could about my own health. Prior to creating Vivoo, I had tried every kind of tracker and test &#8212; wearables, tests like 23 and Me, blood tests like Everlywell &#8212; I wanted to know it all. But it was costly, and the results were rarely real time. Sometimes it could take 1-2 months to get specific metrics.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a bioengineer, I knew there had to be a better way. So we created a wellness tracker based on at-home urine tests that gives instant results and engaging, personalized recommendations to help people improve and manage their health on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per Tayfun the &#8220;key data points&#8221; the app currently reads are: hydration, pH, Ketones, UTIs, kidney and liver scores.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the premium experience, we extended the tests and our customers will be able to track their Magnesium like minerals, Vitamin C, Free Radicals, and salt consumption,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>What scientific research is Vivoo drawing on to make recommendations based on its (remote) analysis of users&#8217; urine samples?</p>
<p>&#8220;Our approach is to suggest evidence-based recommendations created by dieticians and reviewed by doctors,&#8221; she responds on that, further specifying: &#8220;The research mainly uses higher-quality scientific research such as meta-analysis, systematic reviews, and nutritional guidelines. Additionally, the impact factor and scientific journal ranking is also taken into account when selecting a reference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the information on Vivoo&#8217;s website talks about the importance of &#8216;balancing&#8217; the pH of urine. Asked about this she says urinary pH has a &#8220;close association with the dietary acid load&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diet composition has long been known to influence acid-base balance by providing acid or base precursors. In general, foods rich in protein, such as meat, cheese, eggs, and others, increase the production of acid in the body, whereas fruit and vegetables increase alkalis,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The capacity of acid or base production of any food is called potential renal acid load (PRAL). While human urine can range from 4.5 to 8, The optimal urine should be around 6-7. Having too acidic or too alkaline urine has some health risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>So this means that the app might flag that a user&#8217;s urine is &#8216;too acidity&#8217; &#8212; and say that&#8217;s linked with eating more High-PRAL (aka &#8220;High acidic&#8221;) foods &#8212; which Tayfun suggests causes &#8220;metabolic acidosis&#8221; that she says has been associated with the development of a number of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, renal lithiasis and non-alcoholic fatty liver, &#8220;among others&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case, we show the possible health risks and suggest low-PRAL (Alkaline promoting) foods to balance the &#8216;acidic&#8217; urine pH and lower the health risks,&#8221; she goes on, suggesting generally that checking their urine pH regularly will help Vivoo users to be &#8220;more proactive, learn more about their body and get help with choosing mindful food options to improve their wellbeing&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the website Vivoo recommends users do a weekly test of their urine &#8212; although it suggests that those tracking their hydration or ketones might feel nudged to test more often. (Although the current subscription packs don&#8217;t provide enough test kits for users to maintain daily testing without a break.)</p>
<p>Vivoo&#8217;s speedy remote analysis of users&#8217; urine test strips hinges on machine learning models that Tayfun says were trained on &#8220;more than 1M data points to give precise results&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although she qualifies that by saying the database is growing &#8220;day by day&#8221; to add more info on &#8220;different light conditions, camera models, phone models and softwares of the mobile devices to be accurate in multiple platforms&#8221;.</p>
<p>And, well, as the app itself is not a medical device the analysis it performs is just a data operation, not a medical diagnosis &#8212; so performance/accuracy is obviously not akin to a medical-grade device.</p>
<p>Asked how it&#8217;s assessed the accuracy of the scanning component of the analysis, Tayfun says that for the Vivoo Lite product the image processing system has been tested in external laboratories and in its own labs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Measurements are carried out simultaneously in the tests and comparative analyzes are made. Phones with different operating systems and camera features are used in accuracy tests,&#8221; she says, adding: &#8220;Comparative analyzes in urine analysis devices are measured by looking at two percentiles, which are 100% accurate and +-1 level error of measurement values.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also specifies that a new Premium subscription tier of the product will also undergo a third party laboratory and analysis &#8212; with results slated to be published in a peer-reviewed journal (but that hasn&#8217;t happened yet).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our urine tests are registered with the FDA but the app is not as it’s not a diagnostic device but a data tracking tool,&#8221; she adds when asked whether Vivoo has plans to apply for the app to be regulated as a medical device in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have plans to extend the capabilities of the application in the future, and we may consider adding metrics that can help chronic disease sufferers to track and share their data with their healthcare professionals. We will be following the FDA’s guidelines and recommendations as always if we choose that approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the nearer term, Vivoo will be beefing up the product proposition and looking to scale revenue with a premium tier.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we added more metrics into our urine tests, we realized wearable integration and even Genetic data integration can be a<br />
huge benefit for our customers to better understand what is going inside their bodies,&#8221; Tayfun suggests, adding: &#8220;We will be making major updates from November to February on a monthly basis so stay tuned!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The main benefit of allowing our customers to integrate their wearable data is that now they will be able to crossmatch their sleep, activity, and heart data with Vivoo’s urine metrics. A simple example is seeing you had a bad night of sleep is &#8216;ok data&#8217; but visualizing your sleep data with your hydration and magnesium data, will give you more actionable items about how you can improve your sleep via nutrition and simple daily activities. Same for period cramps, heart health, even mood swings, and mindfulness.&#8221;</p>
<p>While commercial momentum is clearly building to encourage the &#8216;worried well&#8217; to quantify and track various bits of their biology, there are likely to be limits on how many of these wellness trackers/test kits/subscription services even a highly &#8216;health conscious&#8217; individual is going to be prepared to shell out for.</p>
<p>Vivoo&#8217;s push to cover a wide range of trackable metrics &#8212; including by bolting on additional at home tests kits (presumably expanding out from urine analysis) &#8212; looks like a play to cover as many bases as possible so it can sell consumers on a single subscription service for all their wellness tracking needs.</p>
<p>Asked about the competitive landscape, Tayfun says its current perspective is that technologies that are using &#8220;different body data and science-base&#8221; are complementary to Vivoo&#8217;s approach &#8212; and she extends an invite to fellow founders for API integrations &#8220;if the customer consents&#8221;; (adding: &#8220;We believe together we can change bad habits to goods more easily! More data will allow our technologies to provide better insights and recommendations.&#8221;)</p>
<p>However she also agrees that consumers will have a finite budget for wellness tracking.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’d like to position Vivoo as a one-stop shop by covering a big area of wellness, nutrition, mindfulness, activity, and sleep on the line. But we don’t have expertise in all of these verticals so working with well-established partners such as Apple, Calm, Oura, Whoop and collaborations as such would benefit both the customers and companies to provide better insights to customers,&#8221; she says, adding: &#8220;Also, I believe more data will improve products as well. You might see you’re lactose intolerant in 23 and Me and dairy can be your superfood in Viome, anonymized data can guide us to be more precise, and improve the company&#8217;s science and technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Research remains a priority for the startup &#8212; which says it will continue to spend a fifth of its budget on R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Tayfun confirms that this includes doing research on what she describes as &#8220;anonymized data&#8221; from users &#8212; trailing &#8220;amazing findings&#8221; it plans to publish (&#8220;in late 2022&#8221;), such as the &#8220;most hydrated States and state water fountain regulations&#8221; and &#8220;ketones and personal income (rich cities starve themselves more!)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A in a supporting statement, Draper describes &#8220;personalized data driven health care&#8221; as a &#8220;major theme&#8221; for Draper Associates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miray and her team at Vivoo are collecting personalized data frictionlessly through a simple at-home pee test with actionable advice that allows customers to be proactive about their health,&#8221; he said, adding: &#8220;Wellness has become such a high priority over the past year, with more people taking proactive control of their health. We’re excited to work with Vivoo as the company expands its footprint globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting today, Amazon Music is launching auto-generated, synchronized transcripts on select podcasts for users in the United States. Rolling out for the latest version of the Amazon Music app on iOS and Android, these transcripts will be available for recent episodes of select podcasts by Amazon Originals and Wondery, a network owned by Amazon. Transcripts will also be available for certain shows from American Public Media, audiochuck, Cadence13, The New York Times, Stitcher, and TED, like &#8220;My Favorite Murder,&#8221;<span class="m_360241222206779193apple-converted-space"> &#8220;</span>Crime Junkie,&#8221; &#8220;Modern Love&#8221; and &#8220;This American Life.&#8221;</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/amazon-music-adds-podcasts-including-its-own-original-shows/">adding podcasts</a> to Amazon Music in September 2020, this is the first major <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22752750/amazon-music-podcast-transcripts-synchronized">podcast feature</a> that the app has implemented. Spotify beta tested a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/spotify-to-add-automatic-transcripts-for-its-own-exclusive-and-original-podcasts/">similar feature</a> for Spotify Exclusive and Original shows in May. Creators on Apple Podcasts can include transcriptions in their show notes, which are then <a href="https://podnews.net/update/apple-podcasts-transcription-search">searchable</a> in the app, but they aren&#8217;t synced with audio in this way.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227755" style="width: 686px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227755" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2227755" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?w=676" alt="Amazon music podcast transcriptions" width="676" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png 1540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=298,300 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=768,773 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=676,680 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=1526,1536 1526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FullscreenPR.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227755" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon Music</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227717" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Listeners can read the transcript in paragraph form in the app, or they can listen along, with the words being highlighted as the host says them. This feature can also be useful for finding a certain place in a podcast if you want to revisit an episode later &#8212; while dragging the cursor along, users will be able to see previews of the words being spoken, like scrubbing a video and seeing thumbnail previews.</p>
<p>As an audio-only medium, transcriptions are essential for podcasters to reach Deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences. Many podcasts already post transcriptions on their website, but this feature offers another way to experience a show. When it comes to live audio, live captioning is an essential accessibility feature &#8212; while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Twitter Spaces</a> offers this, Clubhouse has yet to implement the feature.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Alternative mobile browser Firefox today shipped its latest release for iOS and Android with an update aimed at helping users address common issues &#8212; like the visual clutter of having too many open tabs or needing to pick up where your left off the last time the app was closed, among other things. The changes [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alternative mobile browser Firefox today <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/firefox-brings-you-a-new-homepage/">shipped</a> its latest release for iOS and Android with an update aimed at helping users address common issues &#8212; like the visual clutter of having too many open tabs or needing to pick up where your left off the last time the app was closed, among other things. The changes are a part of the Firefox Beta, which introduced a new homepage that will now serve as a re-entry point to the mobile web, says the browser&#8217;s maker, Mozilla.</p>
<p>The changes could make Firefox more competitive with default options on mobile devices, like Apple&#8217;s Safari or Google&#8217;s Chrome, for example, whose &#8220;new tab&#8221; pages today point users to their bookmarks, a reading list, and other items &#8212; like Safair&#8217;s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212721">new &#8220;Shared with You&#8221; collection</a> of things you&#8217;ve been sent via other Apple apps, or Chrome&#8217;s easy-access buttons for recent tabs or search history.</p>
<p>But in Firefox&#8217;s case, it will make it easier to get back to items &#8212; like articles you were reading or recent searches &#8212; as they&#8217;re not just a button, but a list you can scroll through directly on the homepage.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227708" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The &#8220;Jump back in&#8221; section, for instance, will help users quickly find the article they had been reading but didn&#8217;t get a chance to finish and close out of, which is a common source of tab clutter. These will be presented in a list when you click on the &#8220;Show all&#8221; link, next to the most recent headline appearing directly on the homepage.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y8FVIiWyao?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Your recently saved bookmarks are now also available on the homepage, including those that have synced over from Firefox on the desktop, if you have this set up. And your recent searches will be found on the homepage, where they&#8217;re grouped by topic. These will be saved for up to 14 days, Mozilla says, so you can easily return to your online research without having to dig through your search history.</p>
<p>However, one of the bigger changes will go to address one of the most common problems with using mobile browsers: tab clutter. Often, users choose to keep tabs open that they need to refer back to or finish reading instead of closing them out. But this leads to a lot of open tabs and a cluttered, and sometimes overwhelming, experience when you actually need to relocate the open tab in question.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Firefox is addressing this with a new feature that will save the inactive tabs you haven&#8217;t revisited in 14 days, but will remove them from your view to reduce the visual clutter and stress of having too many open tabs available. Unfortunately, this feature is only available on the Android beta at launch.</p>
<p>The company is also expanding its partnership with the read-it-later app Pocket to allow users to customize their homepage with stories that match their interests. Before, Firefox was offering new articles from Pocket to Android users, but heard feedback that users wanted to better customize which sort of articles were displayed. This feature is also Android-only for the time being.</p>
<p>Other changes in this release include a new selection of over 18 themes to choose from, and better support against side-channel attacks with the rollout of security architecture called <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/05/introducing-firefox-new-site-isolation-security-architecture/">Site Isolation</a>.</p>
<p>The new changes add more polish to the larger redesign that was <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/modern-clean-new-firefox-clears-the-way-to-all-you-need-online/">introduced</a> in May, which had the goal of simplifying the browsing experience with clutter-free menus, simpler navigation, a new tab design, an updated iOS app, and enhanced privacy features. At the time, Mozilla promised more updates would arrive later in the year.</p>
<p>Mozilla also last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/firefox-focus-gets-new-logo-shortcuts-dark-theme-and-more/">revamped its privacy-centric browser,</a> Firefox Focus, which included a way for users to get to their frequently visited sites faster.</p>
<p>The updated version of the new browser, Firefox 94, is currently available on the Google Play Store by searching for &#8220;Firefox Beta&#8221; and works on Android 5.0 and up. On iOS, users will need to download the beta through TestFlight instead, and supports iOS 13 and above.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch held events in China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/announcing-hardware-battlefield-2019-in-shenzhen-china/">as recently as 2019</a>, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/techcrunch-shenzhen-november-19-20/">several years</a> of hosting conferences in the country’s hardware capital, Shenzhen. In the wake of today’s news, TechCrunch.com is no longer available for regular access in China.</p>
<p>How quickly things change.</p>
<p>This morning, global media noted weekend news that Yahoo, TechCrunch’s parent company, is pulling its remaining services from China. The move follows decisions by other major American companies to also end certain operations from China, including Microsoft and Epic Games.</p>
<p>According to an official Yahoo statement, due to an “increasingly challenging business and legal environment in China, Yahoo&#8217;s suite of services will no longer be accessible from mainland China” as of the start of the month. The news was first disclosed over the weekend, albeit to muted note and coverage.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Yahoo added in the same comment that it &#8220;remains committed to the rights of our users including a free and open internet&#8221; — about as direct a dig against the Chinese government that you will find from a corporation that operates globally.</p>
<p>The recent decisions to limit or end the availability of certain international products in China’s mainland area follows a deluge of regulatory changes aimed at curbing the power of domestic technology companies, changes to rules regarding media and more. The revamps include changes to video game access for youths, the culture of celebrity fan clubs and for-profit educational products aimed at students not yet in university.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220366 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>In recent quarters, the Chinese market has seen its openings narrow. Films that might have found a release window in the country are failing to make it to market, for example. The context for Yahoo’s decision to leave the country, then, is both broad and deep.</p>
<h2>China&#8217;s &#8220;increasingly challenging business and legal environment&#8221;</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty to choose from when trying to identify what created an &#8220;increasingly challenging business and legal environment&#8221; for Yahoo. But the fact that it&#8217;s closing the curtains this month points at a blatant culprit: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (PIPL)</a>, which came into effect on November 1.</p>
<p>While it makes sense to compare the PIPL to the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in terms of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/what-chinas-new-data-privacy-law-means-for-us-tech-firms/">what it takes for foreign companies to comply</a>, the comparison only goes so far. Indeed, storing data in the country or having to &#8220;pass a security assessment organized by the national cybersecurity authority&#8221; before transferring information across borders doesn&#8217;t have the same implications when the country in question is China.</p>
<p>Add in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">broader flurry of regulatory changes</a>, and it is not hard to see why Epic Games is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/epic-pulls-plug-on-fortnite-in-china/">pulling the plug on Fortnite in China</a>, or why Microsoft earlier announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">pulling LinkedIn from the Chinese market</a>. In a <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/october/14/china-sunset-of-localized-version-of-linkedin-and-launch-of-new-injobs-app">blog post</a>, the professional network was described as “facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China” — wording that echoes Yahoo&#8217;s statement this weekend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has wreaked havoc on the world&#8217;s supply chains for a number of reasons from a lack of raw material to labor shortages, but whatever the reason the problems are persisting and Microsoft has decided to put its considerable resources to bear on modernizing supply chain and manufacturing</p>
<p>To help address these issues, the company is announcing a new manufacturing solution called the Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing along with Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights, a tool designed to give customers more visibility into what&#8217;s happening along their supply chain routes and intelligence to deal with issues as they arise. Both products are being announced at Microsoft Ignite and are available in preview starting today.</p>
<p>Caglayan Arkan, VP of manufacturing and supply chain at Microsoft, says the company has been thinking about ways to help companies solve these issues, and at the same time evolve into more digitally-focused companies, something that has been a challenge for manufacturers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227657" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Arkan says that Microsoft examined the state of things and saw brittle systems that when faced with the pressure of the pandemic didn&#8217;t hold up well. &#8220;Manufacturing and the supply chain has been very stable; very, very lean, perhaps too lean. They grew very comfortable in their very long cycles and manual siloed data state,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He added that manufacturers have been working this way for years and they had no real reason to change until the pandemic came along. &#8220;Everything stopped. The music stopped, and you couldn&#8217;t send employees to the shop floor anymore, supplies were not there. You couldn&#8217;t even see your supplier to know where your goods were, and that was a huge disruption,&#8221; Arkan explained.</p>
<p>The manufacturing cloud is designed to help digitize the factory floor, and provide a path to become fully digital by moving from  traditional systems of record to what Arkan calls &#8220;systems of reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means that manufacturers need to be able to link what&#8217;s happening in the marketplace in terms of demand, what&#8217;s happening on their shop floor in terms of production and what&#8217;s happening in the world in terms of supplies to get a big picture view, so they won&#8217;t get caught flat-footed as they did when demand for toilet paper and PPE ballooned early in the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The manufacturing cloud is designed to help collect these signals and warn manufacturers when they might need additional supplies. The Supply Chain Insights tool is specifically designed to map out supply chain routes and root out issues that could affect delivery of key raw materials before bottlenecks happen. Together they are designed to bring more agility and flexibility to manufacturing companies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227667" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227667" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2227667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-9.34.27-AM-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights tool" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227667" class="wp-caption-text">Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights tool. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Unlike in the past, Microsoft recognizes that these kinds of companies, which have been traditionally modernized very slowly, don&#8217;t want to rip and replace existing systems and take on a huge project. As Arkan says, you need to start with one successful project and then move to the next one, and he says this solution is designed to be delivered in this way.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, he says that each project can build on one another and fund the next one through savings and innovation. &#8220;Every step of your digital transformation, every engagement with us creates economic headroom to add funds to the next one because we either give you more top-line revenue, capacity or provide savings or quality improvements in a matter of 8-12 weeks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a bold promise, but if Microsoft can deliver on that &#8212; and that&#8217;s a big if &#8212; it creates a comfortable path to modernization for companies that have traditionally rejected big kinds of changes like this.</p>
<p>If Microsoft and other large enterprise companies like SAP and Salesforce can begin to solve some of these fundamental problems, it could begin to loosen the supply chain issues we are seeing today. While software alone can&#8217;t magically produce scarce raw materials or hire enough people to build and deliver supplies and goods, it can be part of a solution to help mitigate these kinds of crises in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft is bringing back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/wave-goodbye-to-google-wave/">Google Wave</a>, the doomed real-time messaging and collaboration platform Google launched in 2009 and prematurely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/wave-goodbye-to-google-wave/">shuttered</a> in 2010.</p>
<p>Maybe we should&#8217;ve seen this coming. Back in 2019, Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/microsoft-launches-the-first-public-preview-of-its-fluid-framework-for-collaborative-editing/">announced</a> the Fluid Framework (not to be confused with the Fluent design system). The idea here was nothing short of trying to re-invent the nature of business documents and how developers build real-time applications. Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsofts-fluid-framework-is-now-open-source-comes-to-office-365/">open-sourced Fluid</a> and started building it into a few of its own Office applications. Today, at its Ignite conference, it&#8217;s launching a whole new product built on top of Fluid: Microsoft <del>Wave</del> Loop.</p>
<p>Loop is a new app &#8212; and concept &#8212; that takes the Fluid framework, which provides developers with flexible components to mix and match in order to create real-time editing-based applications, to create a new experience for users to collaborate on documents. In many ways, that was also the promise of Google Wave &#8212; real-time collaboration plus a developer framework and protocol to bring Wave everywhere.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226604" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2226605" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Loop_People-moving-in-and-out-of-pages.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226605" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2226605" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Loop_People-moving-in-and-out-of-pages.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2226605" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Now, you may say: isn&#8217;t that what Teams is for? Why isn&#8217;t this built into Teams. And yes, all of that is in the works, but there will also be a Loop app, which Microsoft says &#8220;combines a powerful and flexible canvas with portable components that move freely and stay in sync across apps – enabling teams to think, plan and create together.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226802" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Loop_Thoughts-and-high-five.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226802" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2226802" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Loop_Thoughts-and-high-five.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2226802" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>There are three elements to Loop: Loop components, &#8220;atomic units of productivity&#8221; (tip of my hat to whoever came up with that phrase) like lists, tables, notes and tasks; Loop pages, &#8220;flexible canvases where you can organize your components and pull in other useful elements like files, links, or data to help teams think, connect, and collaborate;&#8221; and Loop workspaces, shared spaces where you somehow can catch up on what everybody is working on and track progress toward shared goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One thing Wave never had that is apparently a core feature of Loop is that Loop tracks your cursor position in real time. That&#8217;s the current state of the metaverse for you right there. Nothing says I&#8217;m present and active in a meeting like moving your cursor around, after all.</p>
<p>Some new Loop/Fluent components coming soon are a voting table (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/28/google-wave-drips-with-ambition-can-it-fulfill-googles-grand-web-vision/">day-one feature of Google Wave</a>, I might add) and a status tracker.</p>
<p>Google Wave was clearly ahead of its time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its Ignite conference, Microsoft today announced the preview launch of Azure Container Apps, a new fully managed serverless container service that complements the company&#8217;s existing <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/containers/">container infrastructure services</a> like the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Microsoft notes that Azure Container Apps was specifically built for microservices, with the ability to quickly scale based on HTTP traffic, events or long-running background jobs.</p>
<p>In many ways, it&#8217;s probably most like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/?c=cn&amp;sec=srv">AWS App Runner</a>, one of Amazon&#8217;s small fleet of serverless container services, with App Runner also specifically focused on microservices. Google meanwhile also offers a set of container-centric services, including <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-bringing-serverless-to-containers">Cloud Run</a>, its serverless platform for running container-based applications.</p>
<p>Microsoft says that with Azure Container Apps, developers will be able to build their apps in the language and with the framework of their choosing and then deploy it with the help of this new service. The infrastructure itself sits on top of open-source projects like Microsoft&#8217;s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/microsofts-dapr-open-source-project-hits-1-0/">Dapr application runtime</a> and its scaling technology is powered by <a href="https://keda.sh/">Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling</a> (KEDA), a project that is supported by Microsoft, Red Hat and Codit, as well as Vexxhost and Snyk.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226807" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think about the Azure Container Apps experience as more like a PasS-like experience to AKS, which is your IaaS,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Roanne Sones, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate VP for Azure Edge and Platform, explained. &#8220;I</span>n a world where customers start with IaaS and, eventually, if they could just have gone straight to PaaS, they probably would have. Because why not? All I have to do is think about my app and or consume the app &#8212; and it&#8217;s done for me. That&#8217;s how I think about that laddering. If AKS is the underlying infrastructure service that you give to customers for running a CNCF-compliant Kubernetes service, then Azure Container Apps sits above that and it abstracts away more of the infrastructure so you don&#8217;t have to get into the guts of that level of design and lifecycle management.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s maybe no surprise that all of the major cloud providers now offer serverless container services of various kinds, both for sophisticated ops teams that need to have full control of their deployments and for companies that want others to handle all of this for them. And despite a plethora of tools to make this easier, managing Kubernetes clusters remains a full-time job for infrastructure teams, after all. The promise of containers has always been the ability to easily scale services up and down as needed and to free developers from having to think about the infrastructure that their code will run on. For a lot of teams that simply want to get their services into production, serverless is the way to go.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Whimsical aims to make work collaborative, distributed and quick, enabling teams to create and share without having to open another tab or website.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://whimsical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whimsical</a>, a startup creating tools for workplace collaboration, announced Tuesday its first funding round, a $30 million Series A investment led by Accel.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Kaspars Dancis in 2017 when he saw that the tools most people use for work &#8212; the documents, spreadsheets and slide decks &#8212; were not conducive to the way people were working, for example, increasingly remote.</p>
<p>The idea for the company originated over 20 years ago when Dancis, who is from Latvia, started his professional career and was working in California, but corresponding with peers around the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227244" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“I always worked in some form of distributed organization with a larger engineering theme of people everywhere trying to make it work,” he told TechCrunch. “I felt some of the technology was evolving and getting better, but there were still parts of work that if you tried to be distributed, it felt like not being in the same room was a disadvantage.”</p>
<p>The company’s goal is to make distributed work better than being in the same room by focusing on content and collaboration, something Dancis said existing tools have, but are still siloed in a way that you would have to drop something in another tool in order to share it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WEewsvynF5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/more-companies-should-shift-to-a-work-from-home-model/">More companies should shift to a work-from-home model</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More companies should shift to a work-from-home model&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/more-companies-should-shift-to-a-work-from-home-model/embed/#?secret=WEewsvynF5" data-secret="WEewsvynF5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As its name suggests, Whimsical aims to make work collaborative, distributed and quick, enabling teams to create and share flowcharts, wireframes, mind maps, sticky notes and documents without having to open another tab or website.</p>
<p>The funding follows four years of bootstrapped growth and profitability, Dancis said. This includes three times revenue growth in the past 12 months and acquiring a couple million total users at companies like Intercom, Netflix and Twilio.</p>
<p>Whimsical built itself in an organic way during that time and got early traction, which enabled it to continue building products. The company remained a small team for years, only growing from 12 to 30 in the past few months, Dancis said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227250" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227250" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2227250" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whimsical-screenshot@2x.png" alt="Whimsical" width="1024" height="813" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whimsical-screenshot@2x.png 3236w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whimsical-screenshot@2x.png?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whimsical-screenshot@2x.png?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whimsical-screenshot@2x.png?resize=768,610 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whimsical-screenshot@2x.png?resize=680,540 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whimsical-screenshot@2x.png?resize=1536,1220 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whimsical-screenshot@2x.png?resize=2048,1627 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/whimsical-screenshot@2x.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227250" class="wp-caption-text">Whimsical dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Whimsical</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then in 2021, he felt the company “reach a milestone inflection point where being bootstrapped was working, but was slowing it down.” In order to get to the next level, he needed partners to be able to invest more in the product and its go-to-market strategy. This is as the <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/productivity-management-software-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global productivity management software market</a> was valued at $42.6 billion in 2020 and is <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-productivity-management-software-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poised to nearly triple by 2028</a>, according to Grandview Research.</p>
<p>“We are achieving the vision of an integrated experience and still have some building blocks to create,” Dancis added. “We have this content that can be broadly described as a whiteboard and early this year introduced Docs, but there are some we want to add and also focused on creating a spreadsheet experience, but we want to do it in a way that it will be integrated with everything else we’ve created.”</p>
<p>He felt Accel was that partner, along with Basis Set Ventures and angel investments from dozens of company executives, including those from Dropbox, Stripe, GitHub and Google, that joined in on the funding round.</p>
<p>Accel partner Daniel Levine said he first began hearing about Whimsical a few years ago and officially met the team in 2020. He took it as a sign that sophisticated companies were already customers and the people who used the tools were passionate about doing so.</p>
<p>While many tools like Figma and Slack were built with communication and collaboration in mind, Levine said when teams went fully remote, they had to be adapted as people tried to do remote better.</p>
<p>One of the challenges that emerged was that people wanted more particular tools that were tailored toward collaborative work, which he said Whimiscal solved.</p>
<p>“When I met Kaspars, I thought he was really thoughtful and sharp,” he said. “Whimsical feels like it has a simple vibe, but when you go deeper around these tools, you see they are built for the 80% of people that want to do things super quick. Whimsical was tailor-made for a particular case and we will see more dedicated tools like that in the future, but the company is ahead on this.”</p>
