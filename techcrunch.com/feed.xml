										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2013, eight tech companies were accused of funneling their users&#8217; data to the U.S. National Security Agency under the so-called PRISM program, according to highly classified government documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Six months later, the tech companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/08/tech-companies-outline-more-nsa-reform-demands/">formed a coalition</a> under the name Reform Government Surveillance, which as the name would suggest was to lobby lawmakers for reforms to government surveillance laws.</p>
<p>The idea was simple enough: to call on lawmakers to limit surveillance to targeted threats rather than conduct a dragnet collection of Americans&#8217; private data, provide greater oversight and allow companies to be more transparent about the kinds of secret orders for user data that they receive.</p>
<p>Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, Yahoo and AOL (to later become Verizon Media, which owns TechCrunch — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">for now</a>) were the founding members of <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/">Reform Government Surveillance</a>, or RGS, and over the years added Amazon, Dropbox, Evernote, Snap and Zoom as members.</p>
<p>But then sometime in June 2019, Evernote quietly disappeared from the RGS website without warning. What&#8217;s even more strange is that nobody noticed for two years, not even Evernote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t realized our logo had been removed from the Reform Government Surveillance website,&#8221; said an Evernote spokesperson, when reached for comment by TechCrunch. &#8220;We are still members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evernote <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/evernote-joins-the-reform-government-surveillance/">joined the coalition</a> in October 2014, a year and a half after PRISM first came to public light, even though the company was never named in the leaked Snowden documents. Still, Evernote was a powerful ally to have onboard, and showed RGS that its support for reforming government surveillance laws was gaining traction outside of the companies named in the leaked NSA files. Evernote cites its membership of RGS in its <a href="https://evernote.com/privacy/transparency-report">most recent transparency report</a> and that it supports efforts to &#8220;reform practices and laws regulating government surveillance of individuals and access to their information&#8221; — which makes its disappearance from the RGS website all the more bizarre.</p>
<p>TechCrunch also asked the other companies in the RGS coalition if they knew why Evernote was removed and all either didn&#8217;t respond, wouldn&#8217;t comment or had no idea. A spokesperson for one of the RGS companies said they weren&#8217;t all that surprised since companies &#8220;drop in and out of trade associations.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175238" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175238" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175238 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="789" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg 2212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=768,592 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=680,524 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=1536,1183 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=2048,1578 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175238" class="wp-caption-text">The website of the Reform Government Surveillance coalition, which features Amazon, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snap, Twitter, Verizon Media and Zoom, but not Evernote, which is also a member.

<p>While that may be true — companies often sign on to lobbying efforts that ultimately help their businesses; government surveillance is one of those rare thorny issues that got some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley rallying behind the cause. After all, few tech companies have openly and actively advocated for an increase in government surveillance of their users, since it&#8217;s the users themselves who are asking for more privacy baked into the services they use.</p>
<p>In the end, the reason for Evernote&#8217;s removal seems remarkably benign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evernote has been a longtime member — but they were less active over the last couple of years, so we removed them from the website,&#8221; said an email from Monument Advocacy, a Washington, D.C. lobbying firm that represents RGS. &#8220;Your inquiry has helped to prompt new conversations between our organizations and we&#8217;re looking forward to working together more in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monument has been involved with RGS since near the beginning after it was hired by the RGS coalition of companies to lobby for changes to surveillance laws in Congress. Monument has spent $2.2 million in lobbying to date since it began work with RGS in 2014, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/issues?cycle=2018&amp;id=F193676">according to OpenSecrets</a>, specifically on lobbying lawmakers to push for changes to bills under congressional consideration, such as changes to the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, albeit with mixed success. RGS <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/statement-of-reform-government-surveillance-on/">supported</a> the USA Freedom Act, a bill designed to curtail some of the NSA&#8217;s collection under the Patriot Act, but was unsuccessful in <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/statement-on-the-fisa-amendments-reauthorization/">its opposition</a> to the reauthorization of Section 702 of FISA, the powers that allow the NSA to collect intelligence on foreigners living outside the United States, which was reauthorized <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/senate-fisa-section-702-cloture-vote-wyden-paul/">for six years</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>RGS has been largely quiet for the past year — issuing just <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/importance-of-transatlantic-data-flows/">one statement</a> on the importance of transatlantic data flows, the most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/european-parliament-amps-up-pressure-on-eu-us-data-flows-and-gdpr-enforcement/">hot-button issue</a> to concern tech companies, fearing that anything other than the legal status quo could see vast swaths of their users in Europe cut off from their services.</p>
<p>&#8220;RGS companies are committed to protecting the privacy of those who use our services, and to safeguard personal data,&#8221; said the statement, which included the logos of Amazon, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snap, Twitter, Verizon Media and Zoom, but not Evernote.</p>
<p>In a coalition that&#8217;s only as strong as its members, the decision to remove Evernote from the website while it&#8217;s still a member hardly sends a resounding message of collective corporate unity — which these days isn&#8217;t something Big Tech can find much of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://twitter.com/badboyboyce">Peter Boyce II</a> has left General Catalyst to start his own firm, a little over a year after the venture capital firm<a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/general-catalyst-names-three-partners"> promoted him to partner</a>. His new firm is called Stellation Capital, and filings indicate that he is looking to raise up to $40 million for the debut investment vehicle. Sources say that most, if perhaps not all, of that total has been closed <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001858819-21-000001/">since the initial SEC filing in April.</a></p>
<p>Boyce declined to comment for this story. It’s been a quiet transition for the investor; his LinkedIn and Twitter have not been updated to indicate his new job title, but his personal website indicates the new gig. For an investor to leave a prominent venture capital firm after an eight-year tenure to raise dozens of millions of his own — and somehow do so quietly and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=stellation%20capital&amp;src=typed_query">with minimal coverage</a> — might be a result of the funding frenzy and consequential numbness to yet another filing.</p>
<p>Boyce joined GC in 2013 and led investments in Ro, Macro, towerIQ and Atom. He’s also supported portfolio companies such as Giphy, Jet.com and Circle. Beyond GC, Boyce has experience co-founding and running Rough Draft Ventures, a program that helps incubate startups founded by students, recent graduates as well as promote entrepreneurship on campuses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Stellation Capital will leverage his work and name into early-stage investments. The name of the firm, per its website, is derived from the Latin root of stella, which means star. The name also describes “the process of extending a polygon in new dimensions to form a new shape&#8230;just like we’re extending the potential of a founder into new possibilities.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear what the firm’s check size and cadence will be, but it did say it wants to back successful companies at “their earliest stages” on the website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instacart has appointed Facebook executive <a href="https://twitter.com/fidjissimo">Fidji Simo</a> as its new CEO, just seven months after she joined the grocery delivery company’s board of directors. Simo, formerly the vice president and head of the Facebook app, will replace Instacart founder and current CEO Apoorva Mehta on August 2. Mehta will transition to executive chairman of the board, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/instacart-appoints-board-member-fidji-simo-to-chief-executive-officer-and-announces-founder-and-current-ceo-apoorva-mehta-will-serve-as-executive-chairman-of-the-board-301327620.html">per a statement from Instacart.</a></p>
<p>Instacart declined on behalf of Simo for request to provide further comment.</p>
<p>Women of color chief executives at the forefront of billion-dollar businesses are still an unfortunately rare occurrence. Simo is the co-founder of Women in Product, a nonprofit organization that works to empower women in product management, as well as advance and advocate for women’s careers in tech. The transition marks that Facebook has lost one of its few female leaders, and Instacart has a new energy as it itself plans to increase its head count by 50% in 2021.</p>

<p>The departure of Mehta from his role so close to an expected IPO is as notable as it is rare. Mehta founded Instacart 10 years ago, incubating it through <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/instacart">Y Combinator’s 2012 summer batch </a>to its most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">recent valuation of $39 billion. </a></p>
<p>The pandemic spotlighted Instacart’s purpose, as millions of people around the world faced quarantines and limited in-person interactions, including trips to the grocery store. The increased consumer spending on for-delivery services led Instacart to hire hundreds of thousands of workers, as well as launch same-day delivery on a variety of products beyond avocados &#8211; including electronics, sports equipment and prescription medicine</p>
<p>The growth hasn’t come without controversy. Instacart, joined Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Postmates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon"> as major backers for Proposition 22</a>, a measure that would classify gig workers as independent contractors, limiting the types of benefits that they could receive. Prop 22 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/prop-22-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually passed</a>, which could be seen as beneficial to Instacart executives and detrimental to the shoppers who make the deliveries. The event happened after years of protests, class-action lawsuits over wages and tipping debacles in which Instacart is scrutinized for unfair policies toward its shoppers.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Xk90IDbuua"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon/">An even bigger battle for gig worker rights is on the horizon</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Simo obviously has experience working at controversial companies, thanks to her decade at Facebook. Facebook&#8217;s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg replied to Simo&#8217;s announcement in a comment on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fidji – I&#8217;m immensely grateful for the impact you&#8217;ve had on Facebook over the last 10 years,&#8221; Sandberg wrote. &#8220;You&#8217;ve worn so many hats leading the Facebook App – all while advocating for gender equality in the tech community. I&#8217;m so proud to see where you&#8217;re headed. Cheering you on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instacart describes Simo as a &#8220;core driver of Facebook&#8217;s mobile monetization strategy&#8221; and the leader behind the architecture of Facebook&#8217;s advertising business. The executive helped scale Facebook as it grew from 1,000 to 100,000 employees, and through its transition to the public markets &#8211; experience that may mesh well with Instacart&#8217;s ambitions to eventually go public.</p>
<p>Her rise to chief executive comes as the pandemic winds down and parts of the world begin to reopen, which will likely signal a new chapter about how Instacart conducts business and faces new challenges on how the business stays relevant.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Understanding what you will change is most important to achieve a long-lasting and successful robotic process automation transformation. There are three pillars that will be most impacted by the change: people, process and digital workers (also referred to as robots). The interaction of these three pillars executes workflows and tasks, and if integrated cohesively, determines the success of an enterprisewide digital transformation.</p>
<p>Robots are not coming to replace us, they are coming to take over the repetitive, mundane and monotonous tasks that we’ve never been fond of. They are here to transform the work we do by allowing us to focus on innovation and impactful work. RPA ties decisions and actions together. It is the skeletal structure of a digital process that carries information from point A to point B. However, the decision-making capability to understand and decide what comes next will be fueled by RPA’s integration with AI.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			From a strategic standpoint, success measures for automating, optimizing and redesigning work should not be solely centered around metrics like decreasing fully loaded costs or FTE reduction, but should put the people at the center.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We are seeing software vendors adopt vertical technology capabilities and offer a wide range of capabilities to address the three pillars mentioned above. These include powerhouses like UiPath, which recently went public, Microsoft’s Softomotive acquisition, and Celonis, which recently became a unicorn with a $1 billion Series D round. RPA firms call it &#8220;intelligent automation,&#8221; whereas Celonis targets the execution management system. Both are aiming to be a one-stop shop for all things related to process.</p>
<p>We have seen investments in various product categories for each stage in the intelligent automation journey. Process and task mining for process discovery, centralized business process repositories for CoEs, executives to manage the pipeline and measure cost versus benefit, and artificial intelligence solutions for intelligent document processing.</p>
<p>For your transformation journey to be successful, you need to develop a deep understanding of your goals, people and the process.</p>
<h2>Define goals and measurements of success</h2>
<p>From a strategic standpoint, success measures for automating, optimizing and redesigning work should not be solely centered around metrics like decreasing fully loaded costs or FTE reduction, but should put the people at the center. To measure improved customer and employee experiences, give special attention to metrics like decreases in throughput time or rework rate, identify vendors that deliver late, and find missed invoice payments or determine loan requests from individuals that are more likely to be paid back late. These provide more targeted success measures for specific business units.</p>
<p>The returns realized with an automation program are not limited to metrics like time or cost savings. The overall performance of an automation program can be more thoroughly measured with the sum of successes of the improved CX/EX metrics in different business units. For each business process you will be redesigning, optimizing or automating, set a definitive problem statement and try to find the right solution to solve it. Do not try to fit predetermined solutions into the problems. Start with the problem and goal first.</p>
<h2>Understand the people first</h2>
<p>To accomplish enterprise digital transformation via RPA, executives should put people at the heart of their program. Understanding the skill sets and talents of the workforce within the company can yield better knowledge of how well each employee can contribute to the automation economy within the organization. A workforce that is continuously retrained and upskilled learns how to automate and flexibly complete tasks together with robots and is better equipped to achieve transformation at scale.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The term muscle car has always been a euphemism for concessions. Want the most power for the money? Forget about a sports car from Porsche or Lotus. Buy a muscle car and just take corners a bit slower. Today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">Dodge announced it&#8217;s making an electric muscle car</a> and it will be available in 2024. The first question that comes to mind: Well, if it&#8217;s a muscle car, what&#8217;s missing?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a difference between a muscle car and a sports car, and Dodge is uniquely suited to know the differences. The brand has long been associated with horsepower and going fast in a straight line. The Dodge Viper. The Dodge Challenger. Even the Dodge Durango, a lumbering SUV, is available with a tricked-out V8 capable of putting out 710 hp — more power than most Porsches, though no one is about to pit a Durango against a 911 on the track.</p>
<p>Part of the draw of electric vehicles revolves around their mechanical simplicity. That was the original sales pitch for the muscle car, too. But, instead of offering a sports car with a tuned chassis and remarkable aerodynamics, which adds significant development cost, American car companies just stuffed larger engines in everyday family cars. Bam. Muscle cars, baby.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume Dodge uses the muscle car mold and makes a low-cost, high-power, straight-line electric racer — think Dodge Challenger rather than Toyota Supra. This mold has several distinct characteristics.</p>
<p>One, burnouts. Muscle cars are known for their burnouts, which themselves are a byproduct of an overabundance of power, lack of chassis refinement and utter disregard for your tires&#8217; tread. Dodge teased this capability in its announcement tweet, showing a vehicle smoking all four tires. Dodge knows its audience.</p>
<p>Muscle car owners expect to be able to tune, tweak and modify their vehicles at home. That&#8217;s one of the main appeals to this type of vehicle. Straight from the factory, muscle cars are capable, but the buyer understands the automaker omitted certain parts to keep the sticker price as low as possible. Want better traction? Swap out the tires. Want better cornering? Add stiffer sway bars. An electric muscle car must be modifiable — something that&#8217;s increasingly rare as performance is more often optimized through software tweaks than mechanical upgrades.</p>
<p>Tesla has long been criticized for its aversion to vehicle modifications and at-home repairs. This is an opportunity for Dodge and others. A large swath of car buyers expect to be able to wrench on their vehicles, and I&#8217;ll wager this demographic is critical to Dodge&#8217;s future growth.</p>
<p>These unique characteristics of muscle cars are what make the segment so appealing for Dodge. The auto brand struggles to keep up with the market with a stable of stale vehicles, and the muscle car&#8217;s low-cost formula could allow for cheaper development costs.</p>
<p>And keeping development costs low is what Dodge needs right now.</p>
<p>Dodge is owned by Stellantis, a new automobile conglomerate formed when FCA, Dodge&#8217;s old owner, merged with the Dutch automaker PSA Group. It gets more confusing when Dodge&#8217;s previous owner is mentioned. Once always mentioned along with the giants of GM and Ford, Chrysler previously owned Dodge but is now just another brand in the Stellantis family. Together, Dodge and Chrysler offer only six vehicles, and none have seen significant updates in years.</p>
<p>An electric muscle car could revitalize the brand in the same way the Bronco is revitalizing Ford.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;From electric charging to supply chain management, InMotion Ventures preps Jaguar for a sustainable future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/from-electric-charging-to-supply-chain-management-inmotion-ventures-preps-jaguar-for-a-sustainable-future/embed/#?secret=H2HxutJtS1" data-secret="H2HxutJtS1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Look at Ford. The 2021 Bronco is a hit because it lines up nicely with consumer&#8217;s expectations of a Bronco. People hardly remember the engine and chassis issues that were long associated with the Bronco. Instead, people remember a durable off-roader (and slow car chases), so Ford made a durable off-roader loaded with modern conveniences.</p>
<p>Dodge should do the same with its upcoming electric muscle car. But, of course, calling a vehicle a muscle car sets certain expectations that Dodge would be wise to deliver.</p>
<p>Likewise, Ford is also selling a four-door electric Mustang, and its heavily rumored Chevrolet is preparing a similar electric SUV Corvette. While most people love the electric Mustang (I don&#8217;t), they also concede the Mustang naming muddles the branding.</p>
<p>What is it going to be called? Automakers are increasingly turning to their back catalog for new branding. GM revived the Hummer for its first electric truck, and Ford brought back the Bronco and F-150 Lightning. Dodge has a lot of history with muscle cars. There&#8217;s the legendary Charger Daytona (perfect if the upcoming car is built on the current Charger or Challenger), the low-cost Coronet and its upgraded sibling Coronet Super Bee, the Dodge Stealth or Dodge Polara — though maybe Polara is too close to the EV maker Polestar. Or Dodge could turn to names used by Plymouth, another brand previously owned by Chrysler. So there&#8217;s the Plymouth Roadrunner, Duster, Fury and Barracuda, too.</p>
<p>Last question: How will Dodge make the car sound like a muscle car? Hopefully, they won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m here for feeling performance rather than hearing it — and I drive a big F-150 with a custom exhaust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stellantis, the global automaker born out of a merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and French automaker Groupe PSA, will invest €30 billion ($35.5 billion) in electric vehicles and new software over the next four years as part of a major push to transition away from internal combustion engines.</p>
<p>The world’s fourth-largest automaker joins rivals such as General Motors and Volkswagen in earmarking billions toward EV investments through the first part of the decade. Among the company’s plans are manufacturing an electric Dodge muscle car and an electric Ram pickup truck, both by 2024. Stellantis also said it would offer an electric or plug-in model in every vehicle segment under its Jeep brand by 2025.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim, CEO Carlos Tavares said during the company’s inaugural EV Day event on Thursday, is to hit sales targets for low-emission vehicles (including plug-ins) of 70% in Europe and 40% in the U.S. by 2030.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stellantis has been slower to electrify than some of its rivals, perhaps due in part to its lineup’s best-sellers skewing toward performance and heavy-duty models. The company designs and manufactures cars across over a dozen brands, including Jeep, Chrysler, Ram Trucks and Dodge. Its major brands in Europe include Peugeot, Vauxhall, Citroen and Fiat.</p>
<p>In order to deliver on its electrification strategy, Stellantis executives said that the company will also manufacture 130 gigawatt hours of battery capacity by 2025 and around 260 gigawatt hours across five factories in North America and Europe by 2030. The company will use two battery chemistries by 2024, with the goal of developing solid-state battery technology by 2026.</p>

<p>The car giant is also developing a portfolio of four dedicated electric vehicle platforms: Small, for city driving; Medium, for premium vehicles; Large, for performance and muscle models; and Frame, for trucks and heavy-duty vehicles. The platforms will have a range of up to 300 miles for Small and 500 miles for Large and Frame. The aim is to decrease battery costs by 40% by 2024, Stellantis CFO Richard Palmer said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Morgan Stanley has joined the growing list of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accellion/">Accellion</a> hack victims — more than six months after attackers first breached the vendor’s 20-year-old file-sharing product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The investment banking firm — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-fined-1-million-for-client-data-breach-1465415374">which is no stranger to data breaches</a> — confirmed in a letter this week that attackers stole personal information belonging to its customers by hacking into the Accellion FTA server of its third-party vendor, Guidehouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a letter sent to those affected, first reported by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/morgan-stanley-reports-data-breach-after-vendor-accellion-hack/">Bleeping Computer</a>, Morgan Stanley admitted that threat actors stole an unknown number of documents containing customers&#8217; addresses and Social Security numbers.</p>
<p>The documents were encrypted, but the letter said that the hackers also obtained the decryption key, though Morgan Stanley said the files did not contain passwords that could be used to access customers&#8217; financial accounts.</p>
<p>“The protection of client data is of the utmost importance and is something we take very seriously,” a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We are in close contact with Guidehouse and are taking steps to mitigate potential risks to clients.”</p>
<p>Just days before news of the Morgan Stanley data breach came to light, an <a href="https://www.arhealthwellness.com/about-us.html">Arkansas-based healthcare provider</a> confirmed it had also suffered a data breach as a result of the Accellion attack. Just weeks before that, so did UC Berkeley. While data breaches tend to grow past initially reported figures, the fact that organizations are still coming out as Accellion victims more than six months later shows that the business software provider still hasn’t managed to get a handle on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The cyberattack was first uncovered on December 23, and Accellion initially claimed the FTA vulnerability was patched within 72 hours before it was later forced to explain that new vulnerabilities <a href="https://www.accellion.com/company/press-releases/accellion-provides-update-to-recent-fta-security-incident/">were discovered</a>. Accellion’s next (and final) update came in March, when the company claimed that all known FTA vulnerabilities — which authorities say were exploited by the FIN11 and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/ukrainian-police-arrest-multiple-clop-ransomware-gang-suspects/">Clop ransomware gang</a> — have been remediated.</p>
<p>But incident responders said Accellion’s response to the incident wasn’t as smooth as the company let on, claiming the company was slow to raise the alarm in regard to the potential danger to FTA customers.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, for example, raised concerns about the timeliness of alerts it received from Accellion. In a <a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2021/05/reserve-bank-taking-action-to-respond-to-data-breach-reports">statement</a>, the bank said it was reliant on Accellion to alert it to any vulnerabilities in the system — but never received any warnings in December or January.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this instance, their notifications to us did not leave their system and hence did not reach the Reserve Bank in advance of the breach. We received no advance warning,&#8221; said RBNZ governor Adrian Orr.</p>

<p>This, according to a discovery made by KPMG International, was due to the fact that the email tool used by Accellion failed to work: &#8220;Software updates to address the issue were released by the vendor in December 2020 soon after it discovered the vulnerability. The email tool used by the vendor, however, failed to send the email notifications and consequently the Bank was not notified until 6 January 2021,&#8221; the KPMG&#8217;s <a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/ReserveBank/Files/data-breach/kpmg-incident-assessment.pdf">assessment</a> said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have not sighted evidence that the vendor informed the Bank that the System vulnerability was being actively exploited at other customers. This information, if provided in a timely manner is highly likely to have significantly influenced key decisions that were being made by the Bank at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>In March, back when it was <a href="https://www.accellion.com/company/security-updates/mandiant-issues-final-report-regarding-accellion-fta-attack/">releasing updates</a> about the ongoing breach, Accellion was keen to emphasize that it was planning to retire the 20-year-old FTA product in April and that it had been working for three years to transition clients onto its new platform, Kiteworks. A press release from the company in May says 75% of Accellion customers have <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/18/2231538/0/en/Accellion-FTA-Customers-Migrate-to-Kiteworks-to-Protect-Their-Most-Sensitive-Data.html">already migrated</a> to Kiteworks, a figure that also highlights the fact that 25% are still clinging to its now-retired FTA product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This, along with Accellion now taking a more hands-off approach to the incident, means that the list of victims could keep growing. It’s currently unclear how many the attack has claimed so far, though recent tallies put the list at around 300. This list includes Qualys, Bombardier, Shell, Singtel, the University of Colorado, the University of California, Transport for New South Wales, Office of the Washington State Auditor, grocery giant Kroger and law firm Jones Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a patch is issued for software that has been actively exploited, simply patching the software and moving on isn’t the best path,&#8221; Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Since the goal of patch management is protecting systems from compromise, patch management strategies should include reviews for indications of previous compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accellion declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://powerz.tech">PowerZ</a> has raised another $8.3 million (€7 million at today’s exchange rate) including $1.2 million (€1 million) in debt — the rest is a traditional equity round. The company is both an edtech startup and a video game studio with an ambitious goal — it wants to build a game that is as engaging as Minecraft or Fortnite, but with a focus on education.</p>
<p>In February, PowerZ launched the first version of its game on computers. It doesn’t have a lot of content, but the company wanted to start iterating as quickly as possible. Aimed at kids who are six years old and over, PowerZ teleports the player into a fantasy world with cute dragons and magic spells.</p>
<p>“The idea is really to build a sort of Harry Potter,” co-founder and CEO Emmanuel Freund told me. “You have this world that is super nice and very interesting. Like with Hogwarts, you want to come back regularly, and the story will progress over a very long time.”</p>
<p>15,000 children tried out the first chapter. On average, they spent four hours in the game. I asked whether Freund was satisfied with those metrics. He told me he thought his company’s vision was “completely validated.”</p>
<p>Bpifrance Digital Venture, RAISE Ventures and Bayard are investing in today’s round. Existing investors Educapital, Hachette Livres, Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet and Michaël Benabou are also investing once again.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175174" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175174" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175174" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png" alt="" width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175174" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PowerZ</p></div></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to add content, expand to other platforms and launch new languages. When it comes to content, the company wants to partner with other game studios. They’re going to create new islands and design games that make you learn new stuff. Zero Games, Opal Games and ArkRep are the first third-party studios to contribute to PowerZ.</p>
<p>When those new chapters are available, kids will be able to practice mental calculation, geometry, vocabulary, foreign languages, sign language, but also astronomy, photography, architecture, sculpture, cooking, wildlife, yoga, etc.</p>
<p>“Basically we want to position ourselves as a publisher,” Freund said. “The only thing we want to keep in-house is the main storyline.”</p>
<p>As for new platforms, PowerZ is launching its game on the iPad this week. The company realized that launching on computers was a mistake. Adults are already using computers or don’t want to leave your kid on the computer. That’s why PowerZ is starting with the iPad and the iPhone will follow suite. In 2022, the company expects to release its game on the Nintendo Switch and potentially other game consoles.</p>
<p>While the game is only available in French for now, the startup is also thinking about launching an English version soon.</p>
<p>“The game is completely free right now. We have an idea to monetize it. We&#8217;ll copy every other games with in-app purchases for visual items,” Freund said.</p>
<p>When you look further down the roadmap, PowerZ has some radically ambitious goals. Freund believes that educational games will become mainstream really quickly. Many companies don’t want to develop this kind of stuff because screens are bad for kids.</p>
<p>“If we just say that screens are bad, we’ll end up with an Amazon product to learn math. I feel a sense of urgency to develop an educational platform for screens that can scale,” Freund told me.</p>
<p>PowerZ wants to reach hundreds of thousands of children as quickly as possible. And just like Fortnite or Minecraft, the company believes its game can act as a platform for other stuff that can evolve over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I mentioned at the close of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robotics-roundup-18/">last week’s roundup</a>, the biggest issue in writing this roundup on Wednesday is that sometimes news breaks on Thursday morning. Again, I’m asking the robotics community to try not make any big headlines on Thursdays. That would really help a guy out.</p>
<p>Last week, news broke that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/zebra-technologies-is-acquiring-warehouse-robotics-company-fetch/">Zebra Technologies had purchased Fetch</a>. I’ve written about the latter several times over the past couple years, and spoken to founder Melonee Wise a number of times, as well. Ultimately, it’s not much of a surprise Fetch went the acquisition route. If I were a better man, however, I would have leaned heavily toward an acquisition by some mega-retailer like Walmart or Target.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172692" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172692" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172692" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172692" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everyone is looking for a competitive advantage against Amazon, including those big names. And, of course, they’ve got the deep pockets to purchase a head start. Ultimately, I think a deal like this is better for the industry, at large, given how Amazon’s acquisitions tend to go. The company loves to buy up startups and keep all of that cool technology to itself. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/fetch-robotics-ceo-on-the-companys-acquisition-and-the-future-of-warehouse-robots/">I spoke to Wise about the deal</a>, late last week. Some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we were fundraising for our Series D, this opportunity came out of that. I think when you look at it, over the last couple of years, we’ve had a good relationship with them. With the pandemic, there’s been a huge draw for more and more automation technology. Before the pandemic, there were already labor shortages for warehouse and logistics, and the pandemic only exacerbated it. One of the other great things about us joining Zebra is they have a strong go-to-market engine, and they can amplify our sales capability. They’re already in all of the customers we want to be working with. It helps us reach a much broader, wider and deeper audience.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I think it’s complicated. When I started the company, I never really planned on anything. I just wanted to go build something. I mean that in the most sincere way. I wanted to go build something and not fail. And the question is, what does not failing look like? I think the facts are that in the last 20-something years, almost no robotics company has IPO’ed. Now we’re starting to see SPACS, but there hasn’t been a robotics company that’s IPO’ed through the traditional route.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In terms of vision of how we’re thinking about it, Zebra is very excited to kind of make Fetch the centerpiece of this whole new offering that they’re building out. It’s a high strategic priority for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_1802082" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1802082" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1802082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1802082" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abundant</p></div></p>
<p>On the whole, this week marked a pretty substantial slow down in terms of funding announcements. We did get one big bummer news item, as Abundant Robotics is shutting down. <a href="https://www.goodfruit.com/abundant-robotics-closes-shop/">Good Fruit Grower</a> got the following statement from CEO Dan Steere,</p>
<blockquote><p>After a series of promising commercial trials with prototype apple harvesters, the company was unable to raise enough investment funding to continue development and launch a production system.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve reached out for further comment, but the company’s understandably not champing at the bit to discuss where things went wrong. It’s easier, of course, to celebrate the successes than it is to dissect the failures, the latter happens much more often than we can to admit in this field. Often they arrive early in the process and don’t really warrant a lot of ink.</p>
<p>Abundant’s different. From the outside, the Bay Area company appeared to be on the right track toward becoming a dominant name in robotic fruit harvesting. The company had raised a total of $12 million, including Series A in 2017. Granted, that’s not an insignificant amount of time to go between raises and bringing robotics to production is extraordinarily difficult.</p>
<p>What’s more surprising is that the company couldn’t drum up enough interest to get it across the finish line during the pandemic, when, anecdotally, interest in robotics and automation seems to be heating up. Certainly that applies to farming, which has experienced series labor shortages over the past year. More insight into that soon, I hope.</p>

<p>Sarcos, meanwhile, keeps finding its way into the news cycle. This week, it’s the launch of the<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210707005077/en/Sarcos-Robotics-Successfully-Implements-Next-Generation-Teleoperation-Capabilities-of-Guardian%C2%AE-XT%E2%84%A2-Robotic-System"> teleoperated Guardian XT</a>. The company’s exoskeletons get all the love (thanks in no small part to some high profile partnerships), but company also produces non-body mounted robotics. Per the company,</p>
<p>The SenSuit controller enables the Guardian XT robot to mimic the operator’s movements in real-time. It is an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based motion tracker that communicates with the robot and leverages Sarcos’ proprietary force feedback technologies. The company also plans to integrate a VR- or AR-based HMD to provide remote visual and situational awareness to the operator. The Guardian XT robot is equipped with 3-degrees of freedom end effectors that enable dexterous control of trade tools and materials, including hand-held power tools, welding and cutting equipment, inspection and test equipment, parts and components, hazardous materials, and retail inventory goods, amongst others.</p>
<p>The system is capable of lifting and moving up to 200 pounds and will hit the market by the end of next year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, robotic surgery company <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/07/06/2258470/0/en/Integrity-Implants-and-Fusion-Robotics-Merge-to-Form-Accelus.html">Fusion Robotics announced</a> this week announced plans to merge with Adaptive Geometry, another tech company specializing in spinal surgery technology. The two companies will combine to create the perfectly nondescript Accelus (frankly, Fusion is a pretty good name for two combined companies, but maybe that&#8217;s just me).</p>
<p>“Accelus will create opportunities for wide-scale adoption of robotics in spine surgery—both in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs)—by addressing previous constraints related to cost and efficiency,” Accelus Chris Walsh said in a release. “Both Fusion Robotics and Integrity Implants have built enabling technology platforms that create a force multiplier for spinal care. Our products and culture create accessibility to fit each patient’s anatomy, each surgeon’s preferred approach, and each healthcare facility’s space and budget limitations, embodying our core principle of access without compromise.”</p>
<p>That’s a lot of business talk this week, so here’s a fun video of Boston Dynamics doing fun Boston Dynamics stuff, presumably to welcome their new Hyundai overlords:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Circle is the sort of business that is correct for a SPAC-led debut. It could not go public in a traditional manner in its current state of maturity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">Coinbase&#8217;s direct listing earlier this year</a>, other crypto companies may be looking to go public sooner than later. That appears to be the case with Circle, a Boston-based technology company that provides API-delivered financial services and a stablecoin.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Circle will not direct list or pursue a traditional IPO. Instead, the company is <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/investors/Press-Release-Circle-Concord-July2021.pdf">combining</a> with Concord Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or blank-check company. The transaction values the crypto shop at an enterprise value of $4.5 billion and an equity value of around $5.4 billion.</p>

Unlike Coinbase, which operates a trading platform and generates fees in a manner that is widely understood by public-market investors, Circle&#8217;s offerings are a bit more exotic.</p>
<p>Circle&#8217;s <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/investors/Circle-Investor-Presentation-July2021.pdf">SPAC presentation</a> details a company whose core business deals with a stablecoin &#8212; a crypto asset pegged to an external currency, in this case, the U.S. dollar &#8212; and a set of APIs that provide crypto-powered financial services to other companies. It <a href="https://www.seedinvest.com/blog/seedinvest/seedinvest-officially-closes-its-sale-to-circle">also owns SeedInvest</a>, an equity crowdfunding platform, though Circle appears to generate the bulk of its anticipated revenues from its other businesses.</p>
<p>For more on the deal itself, TechCrunch&#8217;s Romain Dillet has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/">a piece focused on the transaction</a>. Here, we&#8217;ll dig into the company&#8217;s investor presentation, talk about its business model, and riff on its historical and anticipated results and valuation multiples.</p>
<p>In short, we get to have a little fun. Let&#8217;s begin.</p>
<h2>How Circle&#8217;s business works</h2>
<p>As noted above, Circle has three main business operations. Here&#8217;s how it describes them in its deck:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175000" style="width: 732px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175000" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175000 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png" alt="" width="722" height="234" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png 722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png?resize=300,97 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png?resize=680,220 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175000" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Circle investor presentation</p></div></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider each one, starting with USDC.</p>
<p>Stablecoins have become popular in recent quarters. Because they are pegged to an external currency, they operate as an interesting form of cash inside the crypto world. If you want to have on-chain buying power, but don&#8217;t want to have all your value stored in more volatile, and tax-inducing, cryptos that you might have to sell to buy anything else, stablecoins can operate as a more stable sort of liquid currency. They can combine the stability of the U.S. dollar, say, and the crypto world&#8217;s interesting financial web.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies look for ways to respond to incidents in their complex microservices-driven software stacks, SREs — site reliability engineers — are left to deal with the issues involved in making everything work and keeping the application up and running. <a href="https://rootly.io/">Rootly</a>, a new early-stage startup wants to help by building an incident-response solution inside of Slack.</p>
<p>Today the company emerged from stealth with a $3.2 million seed investment. XYZ Venture Capital led the round with participation from 8VC, Y Combinator and several individual tech executives.</p>
<p>Rootly co-founder and CEO Quentin Rousseau says that he cut his SRE teeth working at Instacart. When he joined in 2015, the company was processing hundreds of orders a day, and when he left in 2018 it was processing thousands. It was his job to make sure the app was up and running for shoppers, consumers and stores even as it scaled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that while he was at Instacart, he learned to see patterns in the way people responded to an issue and he had begun working on a side project after he left looking to bring the incident response process under control inside of Slack. He connected with co-founder JJ Tang, who had started at Instacart after Rousseau left in 2018, and the two of them decided to start Rootly to help solve these unique problems that SREs face around incident response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically we want people to manage and resolve incidents directly in Slack. We don&#8217;t want to add another layer of complexity on top of that. We feel like there are already so many tools out there and when things are chaotic and things are on fire, you really want to focus quickly on the resolution part of it. So we&#8217;re really trying to be focused on the Slack experience,&#8221; Rousseau explained.</p>
<p>The Rootly solution helps SREs connect quickly to their various tools inside Slack, whether that&#8217;s Jira or Zendesk or DataDog or PagerDuty, and it compiles an incident report in the background based on the conversation that&#8217;s happening inside of Slack around resolving the incident. That will help when the team meets for an incident post-mortem after the issue is resolved.</p>

<p>The company is small at the moment with fewer than 10 employees, but it plans to hire some engineers and sales people over the next year as they put this capital to work.</p>
<p>Tang says that they have built diversity as a core component of the company culture, and it helps that they are working with investor Ross Fubini, managing partner at lead investor XYZ Venture Capital. &#8220;That&#8217;s also one of the reasons why we picked Ross as our lead investor. [His firm] has probably one of the deepest focuses around [diversity], not only as a fund, but also how they influence their portfolio companies,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Fubini says there are two main focuses in building diverse companies including building a system to look for diverse pools of talent, and then building an environment to help people from underrepresented groups feel welcome once they are hired.<br />
&#8220;One of our early conversations we had with Rootly was how do we both bring a diverse group in and benefit from a diverse set of people, and what&#8217;s going to both attract them, and when they come in make them feel like this is a place that they belong,&#8221; Fubini explained.</p>
<p>The company is fully remote right now with Rousseau in San Francisco and Tang in Toronto, and the plan is to remain remote whenever offices can fully reopen. It&#8217;s worth noting that Rousseau and Tang are members of the current Y Combinator batch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are excruciatingly high stakes for software today. Trillions of dollars of market cap, billions of consumers, hundreds of billions of revenue, and limitless hours of usage are dependent on software working in real time, all the time, without downtime.</p>
<p>As the sophistication of software delivery has increased, every layer of the tech stack has been rewritten — an accelerated evolution has led to a bevy of multibillion-dollar, up-and-coming unicorns and multiple massive public market debuts.</p>
<p>However, today we’re talking about one of the most integral pillars holding up the internet. The Domain Name System, otherwise known as DNS, is the key addressing system that connects browsers, users, devices and servers together. Type in “www.techcrunch.com” in your browser, and DNS finds the address linked to that name and tells routers and switches across the world which server to connect to and how to send data back to you.</p>
<p>Unlike physical postal addresses, innovation around DNS addressing has flourished in recent years. Traffic management, performance scaling, and cost shaping have turned DNS from a basic directory into a vital layer for guaranteeing the reliability of all software in use on the internet today while protecting the bottom line.</p>
<p>Few companies have parlayed internet infrastructure experience into a world-class engineering company quite like <b>NS1</b>. The New York City-based startup has raised more than $100 million as it builds a strategic node at the core of the modern web delivery tech stack. Customers are flocking: 760 at latest count (up from 600 a year ago), with year-over-year bookings growth well into the triple digits.</p>
<p>How did the company take a slumbering and dreary yet reliable aspect of the internet and turn it into a strategic moat and an enterprise win? And what lessons can we learn about the future of the enterprise infrastructure layer from one of its leading lights? That’s what we’re here to find out.</p>
<p>The lead writer of this EC-1 is <b>Sean Michael Kerner</b>. Kerner has been covering the IT and enterprise infrastructure market for more than a decade as a tech journalist (or, <a href="https://twitter.com/TechJournalist">@TechJournalist</a> as he is known on Twitter). Perhaps most importantly, he’s also partially fluent in Klingon, which has no bearing on this EC-1, but is one of those cool facts we wanted to include anyway. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, and illustrations were drawn by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>NS1 had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Kerner has no financial ties to NS1 or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The NS1 EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 10,300 words and a reading time of 41 minutes. Here’s what we’ll be (DNS) addressing:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part 1: Origin story</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">1 napkin and 22 lines of code, or how NS1 rewrote the rules of internet infrastructure</a>” (2,700 words/11 minutes) — Sets the context for NS1’s business and provides a brief explanation of why DNS (the technology at the core of the NS1 service) matters.</li>
<li><b>Part 2: Product development and roadmap</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">WTF is NS1? It’s DNS, DDI, and maybe other TLAs</a>” (2,700 words/11 minutes) — Analyzes NS1&#8217;s products, vision and open-source efforts through NS1 Labs.</li>
<li><b>Part 3: Competitive landscape</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-competition/">The fight for the future of DNS is white hot</a>” (2,300 words/9 minutes) — Evaluates how NS1 competes in a space littered with well-funded Big Tech companies and well-established mature companies.</li>
<li><b>Part 4: Customer development</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-customers/">Outages, pandemics and the reengineering of traffic on the internet</a>” (2,600 words/10 minutes) — Explores how companies like Roblox and Pinterest have had to reshape their networking infrastructure in light of massive growth and increasing demands for resilience from users.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re always iterating on the EC-1 format. If you have questions, comments or ideas, please send an email to TechCrunch Managing Editor Danny Crichton at <a href="mailto:danny@techcrunch.com">danny@techcrunch.com</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Kris Beevers, John Sullivan and Alex Vayl wanted to rebuild the core addressing system of the internet and transform it from a cost center into a critical tool for software reliability and cost savings.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s the most important primary layer in the modern tech stack for internet software, and its most intriguing evolution was written on a napkin in a New York City bar and translated to just shy of two dozen lines of Python code.</p>
<p>Such is the nature of tech innovation today, and such was the birth of NS1. Kris Beevers, along with Jonathan Sullivan and Alex Vayl, wanted to rebuild the core addressing system of the internet — the Domain Name System, or DNS — and transform it from a cost center into a critical tool for software reliability and cost savings. It was a smart idea back in 2012 and gained much steam a few years later when a fortuitous outage at a competitor left hundreds of websites stranded.</p>

<p>NS1 may make the networks of the internet more reliable. But the story of the company is also built on the back of a durable social network of engineers who met at a little-known NYC startup named Voxel. That startup would go on to become, unintentionally, an incubator for several massive enterprise companies and exits.</p>
<p>Chance encounters, bold engineering and lucky breaks: It’s the quintessential startup tale, and it’s changing the face of software delivery.</p>
<h2>“You learn a lot because you&#8217;re doing way more than you rightfully should.&#8221;</h2>
<p>NS1’s story begins back at the turn of the millennium, when Beevers was an undergrad at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in upstate New York and found himself employed at a small file-sharing startup called Aimster with some friends from RPI. Aimster was his first taste of life at an internet startup in the heady days of the dot-com boom and bust, and also where he met an enterprising young engineer by the name of Raj Dutt, who would become a key relationship over the next two decades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;We are not a DNS company, despite the name, and despite everything we&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; NS1 founder and CEO Kris Beevers says.</p>
<p>That might sound counter-intuitive, given that the company’s flagship product offering is literally called Managed DNS. The issue and the challenge NS1 actually solves today goes much deeper, and by positioning itself as being about more than DNS, the company helps to differentiate itself against what is, by any measure, a very commoditized technology.</p>

<p>NS1 looks at DNS differently from the competition: It doesn’t consider it as just a conduit to connect traffic; instead, DNS is treated as a routing system that can direct traffic very effectively.</p>
<p>Across its product portfolio, NS1 leverages data and injects software-defined intelligence, automation and real-time decisioning policy to steer and optimize traffic at the DNS layer, Beevers says. It does all this by a core technology known as the filter chain, and it is foundational to NS1’s current success.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">In the first part of this EC-1</a>, I spoke about how Beevers wrote 22 lines of code to sketch out that filter chain technology, bringing NS1 to life. I will now look at how the company has expanded beyond DNS into what’s known as DDI, a key technology stack for managing internal networks within companies. We’ll also talk about NS1’s open-source efforts, and why experimentation remains a bedrock principle of the company’s engineering culture.</p>
<h2>Managing external traffic: DNS and active traffic management</h2>
<p>&#8220;Something that I will say very often to our team and to our customers in the market is, we&#8217;re not here to make DNS better; we&#8217;re not here to make DDI better, which is another realm that we play in now,&#8221; Beevers said. &#8220;We&#8217;re here to turn those technologies into leverage to solve much bigger problems that equate to connecting applications with an audience more effectively, at better scale, driving better performance and experiences with security and reliability.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since its inception, one of the toughest challenges NS1 has faced is the simple fact that DNS is a mature market category with venerable and well-established incumbents. When Kris Beevers and his two co-founders started the company, quite literally every company and internet user already had some form of DNS technology in place. It’s a decades-old technology after all.</p>
<p>Beevers and everyone associated with the company is keen to point out time and again that NS1 isn&#8217;t a DNS vendor, but rather a suite of products offering application and traffic delivery, performance and reliability. NS1 in its early days had to constantly preach that message and educate its potential customers on how its offering provided something different than the incumbents with years of performance history.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Because DNS mostly “just works,” some organizations don&#8217;t put a serious amount of thought behind it, assuming that all of the services and capabilities out there are roughly equivalent.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In the first two parts of the EC-1, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">we looked at the origins of the company</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">its core product offerings in DNS and DDI</a>. In this section, it&#8217;s time to look at the broader market and the competition facing NS1 and what that portends for the future of the company.</p>
<h2>Everyone owns a product they don’t fully understand</h2>
<p>Hosting providers typically offer basic DNS services that “just work” out of the box, creating a large challenge for any vendor in the managed DNS space. Eric Hanselman, principal research analyst with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said that among some organizations, there is an expectation that DNS is just part of what happens on the internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the largest misconception that I find about DNS in general, is the lack of understanding of how critical it is to the performance and the customer experience of just about everything that organizations do today that is technology related,&#8221; Hanselman said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sales in enterprise infrastructure is all about meeting a customer’s requirements. But what happens if customers don’t even realize they need a startup’s product in the first place?</p>
<p>In the first three parts of this EC-1, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">we looked at the origins of NS1</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">how the company built its DNS and DDI services</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-competition/">how it competes in a hypercompetitive market</a>. This fourth and final part is where the &#8220;rubber meets the road&#8221; — the actual customers. Without customers, there is no money, there is no growth and there is no NS1.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			NS1 kicked off with the idea that DNS could be used for more than it was previously. The company&#8217;s technology has continued to evolve since its initial inception and now uses DNS as a leverage point to help organizations like Pinterest, Roblox and hundreds of others improve application delivery.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As we saw, the challenge for NS1 is that most customers are relatively content with their existing DNS service. It’s a space that has many offerings from legacy as well as public cloud providers, and for most customers, there’s never an urgent force pushing them to upend the fundamentals of their network.</p>
<p>NS1 has had a couple of lucky breaks. The first, as we will see with Pinterest and Roblox, was a major outage of one of the company’s largest competitors, DynDNS, back in October 2016. That failure brought NS1 immediate attention from network architects, turning a relatively staid layer of infrastructure into a critical area for re-architecting.</p>
<p>Beyond that outage, NS1 has been able to educate its customers on why a more flexible base for DNS is important for performance. We interviewed Roblox extensively to understand how the children’s gaming platform has engineered its systems in light of its feverish growth amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Finally, we will look at how NS1 continues to expand its product lineup, and what the future holds for the company. NS1 now serves more than <a href="https://ns1.com/customers">760 customers</a>, including many of the world’s most trafficked applications, such as LinkedIn, Dropbox, JetBlue, Fox and The Guardian. It has become a major infrastructure leader, and an “unusual outcome” likely awaits.</p>
<h2>One outage to topple them all</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different reasons why any enterprise or organization would choose to buy services from NS1.</p>
<p>Every business and internet user on the planet already has access to DNS in one form or another. NS1 doesn&#8217;t sell merely DNS services, as the company repeated time and again in every interview and briefing, but instead sells network resilience and performance. Sure, DNS &#8220;just works&#8221; in many cases, but &#8220;good enough&#8221; isn&#8217;t good enough when microseconds count and users demand and expect to always be connected at the best possible speed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lula.is/">Lula</a>, a Miami-based insurance infrastructure startup, announced today it has raised $18 million in a Series A round of funding.</p>
<p>Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures co-led the round, which also included participation from SoftBank, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Shrug Capital, Steve Pagliuca (Bain Capital co-chairman and Boston Celtics owner), Tiny Capital&#8217;s Andrew Wilkinson. Existing backers such as Nextview Ventures and Florida Funders also invested, in addition to a number of insurance and logistics groups such as Flexport.</p>
<p>The startup’s self-proclaimed mission is to provide companies of all sizes &#8212; from startups to multinational corporations &#8212; with insurance infrastructure. Think of it as a “Stripe for insurance,” its founders say.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by 25-year-old twin brothers and Miami natives Michael and Matthew Vega-Sanz, Lula actually emerged from another business the pair had started while in college.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t afford to have a car on campus and wanted pizza one night,” Michael recalls. “So I thought it would be cool if there was an app that let me rent a car from another student, and then I thought &#8216;Why don’t we build it?’ We then built the ugliest app you’ve ever seen but it allowed us to rent cars from other people on the campus.” It was the first company to allow 18-year-olds to rent cars without restrictions, according to the company.</p>
<p>By September 2018, they formally launched the app beyond the campus of Babson College, which they were attending on scholarships. Within eight days of launching, the brothers say, the app became one of the top apps on Apple’s App Store. The pair dropped out of college, and within 12 months, they had cars available on more than 500 college campuses in the United States.</p>
<p>“As you can imagine we needed to make sure there was insurance coverage on each rental. We pitched it to 47 insurance companies and they all rejected us,” Michael said. “So we developed our own underwriting methodologies or underwriting tools into the operations and had the lowest incident rate in the industry.”</p>
<p>As the company grew, it began partnering with car rental providers (think smaller players, not Enterprise, et al.) to supplement its supply of vehicles. In doing so, the brothers soon realized that the most compelling aspect of their offering was the insurance infrastructure they’d built into it.</p>
<p>“Our rental companies begin to put a significant portion of their business through our platform, and one day one called us and asked if they could start using the software in the insurance infrastructure we’d built out in the rest of our business.”</p>
<p>That was in early 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p>
<p>“At that moment, we began to realize, ‘Hey maybe the big opportunity here is not a car-sharing app for college students, but maybe the big opportunity here is something with insurance,’” Michael said.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the duo shut down their core business and by April 2020, they pivoted to building out Lula as it exists today.</p>
<p>“In the same way that Stripe has built a payment API that eliminates the need for companies to build their own payment infrastructure, we decided we could build an insurance API that eliminates the need for companies to build their own insurance infrastructure,” Matthew said. “Companies would no longer need to build out internal insurance systems or tools. No longer would they need to deal with insurance brokers to procure them coverage. No longer would they need to deal with insurance teams. We can integrate on to a platform and handle all things insurance for companies and their customers via our API.”</p>
<p>By August of 2020, the company launched an MVP (minimum viable product) and since then has been growing about 30% month over month after reaching profitability in its first four months.</p>

<p>Today, Lula offers a “fully integrated suite” of technology-enabled tools such as customer vetting, fraud detection, driver history checks, and policy management and claims handling through its insurance partners. It has a waiting list of nearly 2,000 companies and raised its funding to fulfill that demand.</p>
<p>“The main purpose for raising capital was so we can build out the team necessary to fulfill demand and sustain growth moving forward,” Matthew said. “And apart from that, we also just want to further develop the technology &#8212; whether it be in the ways that we&#8217;re collecting data so we can get more granular and make smarter decisions or just optimizing our vetting system. We’re also just working toward developing a much more robust API.”</p>
<p>Existing clients include ReadyDrive, a car-sharing program for the U.S. military and a “ton of SMBs,” the brothers say. Investor Flexport will be conducting a pilot with the company.</p>
<p>“Every time a trucker picks up a load or delivery, instead of paying monthly policies, they will be able to pay for insurance for the two to three days they are on the road only,” Michael says. “Also, if someone is shipping a container via Flexport, they can add cargo coverage at the point of sale and get an additional layer of protection.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Lula’s goal is to act as a carrier in some capacity.</p>
<p>Founders Fund&#8217;s Delian Asparouhov believes that the way millenials and Gen Zers utilize physical assets is &#8220;wildly different&#8221; than prior generations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We grew up in a shared economy world, where apps like Uber, GetAround, Airbnb have allowed us to episodically utilize assets rather than purchase them outright,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In his view, though, the insurance industry has not picked up on the massive shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;Typical insurance agents both don&#8217;t know how to underwrite episodic usage of assets, and they don&#8217;t know how to integrate into these typical of digital rental platforms and allow for instantaneous underwriting,&#8221; Asparouhov told TechCrunch. &#8220;Lulu is combining both of these technologies into an incredibly unique approach that digitizes insurance and gives us flashbacks to how Stripe disrupted the digitization of payments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite their recent success, the brothers emphasize that the journey to get to this point was not always a glamorous one. Born to Puerto Rican and Cuban parents, they grew up on a small south Florida farm.</p>
<p>“We started our company out of our dorm room and initially emailed 532 investors only to get one response,” Michael said. “Founders just see the headlines but I just want to advise them to stay persistent and really keep at it. I’m not afraid to share that the company started off slow.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://z1.app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Sao Paulo-based digital bank aimed at Latin American GenZers, has raised $2.5 million in a round led by U.S.-based Homebrew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of other investors also participated in the financing including Clocktower Ventures, Mantis – the VC firm owned by The Chainsmokers, Goodwater, Gaingels, Soma Capital and Rebel Fund. Notably, Mantis has also backed </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a teen-focused fintech based in the U.S., and Goodwater has also invested in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenlight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which too has a similar offering as Z1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z1 participated in Y Combinator’s Winter ‘21 batch earlier this year, and at the time got $125,000 in funding from the accelerator. Maya Capital led its $700,000 seed round in March of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Z1 is a digital bank app built for teenagers and young adults. The company was founded on the notion that by using its app and linked prepaid card, Brazilian and Latin American teenagers can become more financially independent.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teen banking service Step raises $100M Series C, announces Steph Curry&#8217;s investment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/embed/#?secret=rPsMffjLma" data-secret="rPsMffjLma" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaopedrothompson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">João Pedro Thompson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-waddington-achatz-3280a297/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thiago Achatz</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">started the company in late 2019 and soon after,  </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccraveiro/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mateus Craveiro</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-secaf-b647b891/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophie Secaf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined as co-founders. In its early days, Z1 is focused on Brazil but the startup has plans to expand into other countries in Latin America over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Z1 is what we’re building to be the go to bank of the next generation, and not just be a digital bank for teens,” Achatz told TechCrunch. “We want to grow with him and one day, be the biggest bank in Brazil and LatAm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson agrees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re acquiring users really early and creating brand loyalty with the intention of being their bank for life,” he said. “We will still meet their needs as they grow into adulthood.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174907" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174907" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174907 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg" alt="" width="661" height="717" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg 940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=138,150 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=277,300 277w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=768,833 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=627,680 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174907" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Z1</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Z1’s offering is not completely unlike that of Greenlight here in the U.S. the founders agree that its products have been adapted more to the Brazil-specific cultural and market situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, points out Thompson, most teenagers in Brazil use cash because they don’t have access to other financial services, whether they be traditional or digital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We offer an account where they can deposit money, cash out money via an instant payment system in Brazil or spend through a prepaid credit card,” he said. “Most sites don’t accept debit cards so this is a big step compared to what teens already have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the company’s use for the capital is to make its product more robust so they can do things like save money for big purchases such as an iPhone and earn interest on their accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another big difference between Brazil and the U.S., the company believes, is that many parents in general in Latin America haven’t had a true financial education that they can pass down to their kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not top down like Greenlight,” Achatz said. “That approach doesn’t make sense in Latin America. Here, many are independent from an early age and already work whether it’s through a microbusiness, a side job or selling things on Instagram. They’re much more self-taught and the income they earn is often outside of their parents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z1 has grown 30% per week and 200% per month since launch, spending “very little” on marketing and relying mostly on word-of-mouth. For example, the company is following the lead of its U.S. counterparts and turning to TikTok to spread the word about its offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Step has around 200,000 followers on TikTok, and we have a little under half of that,” the company says. “We’re well-positioned in terms of branding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For lead investor Homebrew, the opportunity to educate and provide financial services to Gen Z in Latin America is even more exciting than the opportunity in the US., notes partner Satya Patel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over one third of LatAm Gen Z’ers have a “side hustle,” generating their own income independent from their parents, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While millennials grew up during an economic boom, Gen Z grew up during recessions – 3 in Brazil over the last decade – and wants to become financially independent as soon as possible. They&#8217;re becoming economically educated and active much earlier than previous generations,” Patel added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also believes the desire to transact online, for gaming and entertainment in particular, creates a groundswell of GenZ demand in Brazil for credit card and digital payments products.</span></p>

<p>One month after<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/South-Korea-s-Coupang-launches-trial-operation-in-Japan"> entering Japan</a>, its first international market, <a href="https://www.coupang.com/">Coupang</a> has launched in Taiwan. The South Korean e-commerce giant began offering its service in Taipei City’s Zhongshan neighborhood, allowing people there to order items through its app for on-demand delivery between 8AM to 11PM, charging a delivery fee of 19 NTD (about 68 cents USD).</p>
<p>Coupang is testing its service and will assess different models for its delivery infrastructure in Taiwan. The selection of items is similar to what’s available in Japan&#8211;customers can buy food, beverages, daily necessities and pet supplies. In Taipei, Coupang’s most direct competition is currently Uber Eats and Foodpanda, which deliver from some retailers, including drugstores, as well as restaurants. A key difference is that Coupang is currently fulfilling orders directly, instead of sending couriers to stores or restaurants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As it expands into more product categories, it will also compete with e-commerce platforms like Momo and PChome, which both offer 24-hour deliveries. In South Korea, Coupang’s e-commerce platform offers millions of products. Its other services include Rocket Fresh for perishable groceries and Coupang Eats for meals.</p>
<p>Coupang <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/coupang-follows-roblox-to-a-strong-first-day-of-trading/">held a successful initial public offering </a>in March on the New York Stock Exchange. Founded in 2010, Coupang has become the e-commerce market leader in South Korea and also developed an international reputation for “out-Amazoning Amazon” with the speed of its deliveries and dollar retention rate (or how often customers return and spend money).</p>

<p>Coupang invested heavily in its own logistics infrastructure when it launched a decade ago, but now also partners with third-party providers in South Korea. It remains to be seen what kind of fulfillment model it will decide on in Japan and Taiwan. The company hasn’t announced what its next market is, but it has <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/korean-e-commerce-firm-coupang-said-to-move-ahead-in-expansion-into-spore">been hiring in Singapore</a> for lead operations, retail and logistics roles.</p>
