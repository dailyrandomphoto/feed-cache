										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.electric.ai/">Electric</a>, makers of IT infrastructure software for SMBs, has been on a tear lately.</p>
<p>The company announced the close of a $90 million Series D financing round today. GGV, an existing investor, led the round, with participation from other existing investors Bessemer, Primary Venture Partners, Greenspring Associates, 01 Advisors, Atreides Management, Vintage Investment Partners and Slack.</p>
<p>What Electric does for IT infrastructure is similar to what <a href="https://justworks.com/">Justworks</a> does for HR. Instead of an SMB hiring out a person or a department to handle the basics of IT, 90 percent of which is maintenance and compliance, Electric software handles distribution, maintenance and security for an organization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220159" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before Electric, there were two options for SMBs: build out your own IT department, or use a local IT provider. Electric came on the scene and allowed an admin within the company to make sure all devices were up to date, secure and compliant, as well as issue new equipment and revoke permissions.</p>
<p>In the COVID era, where remote work has become the default, the need for something like Electric has only grown, which is showing in the startup&#8217;s metrics.</p>
<p>In 2020, the company saw more than 100 percent revenue growth. Interestingly, Electric set very aggressive growth targets for 2020 and beat all of them, despite the fact that they went two months at the beginning of lockdown without selling a single thing. (Many startups saw an accelerating digital transformation create a warm market for their products.)</p>
<p>This led to the company&#8217;s Series C funding, closed in February, with Electric counting just shy of $20 million worth of ARR and 400 customers at the time. The growth continued through this year, with the startup&#8217;s customer count rising to 700, along with 40,000 total end users and 111 percent ARR growth on the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ojSTdM8Q8v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/electric-raises-40m-series-c-to-put-small-business-it-in-the-cloud/">Electric raises $40M Series C to put small-business IT in the cloud</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Electric raises $40M Series C to put small-business IT in the cloud&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/electric-raises-40m-series-c-to-put-small-business-it-in-the-cloud/embed/#?secret=ojSTdM8Q8v" data-secret="ojSTdM8Q8v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Investors came a knockin&#8217; to raise yet again, and Denehy thought about the long-term trajectory of the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to realize that we could double the business again next year, we can double it probably the year after that, and all of a sudden we could have a company that could be ready to go public in two to three years,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;That&#8217;s a really compelling opportunity but it&#8217;s going to take more capital to really prepare ourselves and the team and the product to be on a true pre-IPO trajectory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, the company is tracking at just under $40 million ARR for 2021.</p>
<p>As with most scaling SaaS businesses, focus is the greatest challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have the same competitive pressures as most B2B SaaS companies and we&#8217;ve got an operationally complex business,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;So on any given day, there are so many economically compelling opportunities and so many things that we could do to flip a. switch and get a new line of business generating millions of dollars in revenue. But at the same time, we have to respect that the reason we don&#8217;t have any venture-backed direct competitors is because this is a super hard problem to solve. So if we start to get distracted by running in too many different directions, we&#8217;re going to dilute the quality of everything else that we do and potentially get taking off track.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-unleashed-event-this-morning/">slew of interesting announcements at its event on Monday</a>. But one that stood out to me &#8212; and I feel didn’t get as much attention &#8212; is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-debuts-a-4-99-per-month-apple-music-voice-plan-designed-mainly-for-homepod-use/">new pricing tier of Apple Music</a>. A new &#8216;Voice&#8217; tier will offer the entire Apple Music library to subscribers at a reduced rate of just $5 per month: The catch is you have to use Siri to access it, eschewing the standard Apple Music visual and typing-friendly in-app user interface.</p>
<p>Apple didn’t share why it is launching this plan, but I think it’s reasonable to speculate that the iPhone-maker is lowering the price barrier and persuading more people to use Siri because it wants to gather more voice data to train and improve its voice assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited that even more people will be able to enjoy Apple Music simply with their voice,&#8221; Apple chief executive Tim Cook said at the event.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I can’t imagine any other compelling reason why the Apple Music Voice plan exists, especially since Apple is likely offering the new service with much lower margins than the standard plan as the licensing agreements with labels remain the same to offer up the entire Apple Music catalog.</p>
<p>Again, this is just speculation, but I think given the stiff competition between Apple and Spotify, if the Swedish firm could offer its streaming service at $7-8 a month to beat Apple Music at price, it would. And Apple is taking some loss with the new subscription tier because it really wants to gather vast amounts of data. When I <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1450418281127428098">tweeted</a> this theory, my colleague Alex <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1450420803527450630">wondered aloud</a> why wouldn&#8217;t Apple just make the subscription free? I suppose Apple, a $2.5 trillion dollar company, can technically swallow that much of a hit on the balance sheet, but it doesn&#8217;t want to attract more criticism from standalone music streaming firms such as Spotify. It&#8217;s already facing scrutiny for anti-competitive behavior on a number of fronts.</p>
<p>Tech firms feed their AI models with vast amounts of data to improve the services’ capabilities. Even as Siri has considerably improved over the years, the general consensus among many people who work in tech and the masses alike is that Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant are far superior.</p>
<p>It’s likely that Apple has already been gleaning such voice data from existing Apple Music users, but as a friend suggested, “the point is this &#8211; this feature always existed. It&#8217;s just that they&#8217;d put a high paywall. They&#8217;ve lowered that wall now.” In addition to lowering the barrier to entry, making Music voice-only via the new plan means people have to engage with Siri to make use of it; Siri is a feature for standard Apple Music subscribers, but it&#8217;s highly likely that most users primarily or exclusively access the content via the app&#8217;s UI.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you want an example of what can happen for voice-powered assistants when you require that users treat it as a voice-first or voice-only service, look at Amazon&#8217;s Alexa. Out of the gate, Alexa had to be accessed by voice. This allowed Amazon to not only collect massive amounts of training data for its Alexa algorithms, but also helped train users about how to use it to maximum effect.</p>
<p>Another reason why I think my theory works is the markets where Apple plans to offer this new subscription tier first: Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
<p>Having India, Spain, Ireland and France in the first wave of nations suggests that Apple is looking to amass a wide-range of dialects from across the globe. On a side note, voice search is<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-typing-the-internets-next-billion-users-will-use-video-and-voice-1502116070"> very popular in many markets</a>, including developing nations such as India, and in markets like China and Japan where text input can sometimes be unnecessarily complex vs. spoken word. (A Google executive told me once that the surprising mass adoption of voice searches in India, the world&#8217;s second largest smartphone market and where Android commands about 98% of the pie, helped the company improve Google Assistant and prompted more aggressive approach to innovate on the voice front.)</p>
<p>Siri is often framed as a bit of a laggard in terms of its competence vs. the rest of the voice assistant competition, and Apple&#8217;s latest move in services could be an attempt to help it close the perceived gap, while offering customers a discounted way to onboard to its music streaming service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you anticipate the content people want before they want it? How do you figure out where your audience lives online and what they like? What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a creator, after all?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021, we were joined by Julia Munslow, Special Projects Editor at Yahoo News, Alexis Gay, comedian and host of Non Technical Podcast, and Sushma Dwivedi, who leads communications and brand marketing at Daily Harvest. All three of our speakers come at the challenge of building a brand online from different angles, and they all had valuable perspectives to share for navigating a social media landscape that has very high expectations from anyone creating content in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an independent creator or a company, you need to think about how to connect with the audience that’s right for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before dipping your toes into brand building. With more platforms than ever, and more savvy content perpetually upping the social game, it’s worth remembering that building </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">audience doesn’t just mean accumulating a sky high follower count.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really help anybody to try and be everything to everyone at any size of brand, no matter how big or small,&#8221; Dwivedi said. &#8220;&#8230; When you&#8217;re really looking to galvanize a base, and build some momentum amongst a dedicated base of customers, it serves you to really think about who they are. What do they need? Where are they and how on those platforms are they being communicated to?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can study an audience you want to reach, you have to figure out where they live online. And as new social platforms and products emerge, that process can require quite a bit of trial and error. For Daily Harvest, TikTok was a successful experiment that continues to pay off, but not all experiments will work out — and according to Dwivedi, that’s just fine. Daily Harvest dipped a toe into Clubhouse when the social audio app took off, but because of the visual nature of its brand and audience, it wasn’t a perfect fit.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.instacart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart</a> made its name by providing a way for consumers to bypass shopping in stores in person, by ordering items online and getting them delivered to their homes &#8212; a business that positively boomed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. But with physical stores still looming large in the world of groceries, Instacart is also wants to play a role there, too. Today, the company announced that it is acquiring <a href="http://caper.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caper AI</a>, a startup that builds smart cart and cashier-less checkout technology that uses computer vision and other techniques to detect items and ring them up for shoppers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Instacart confirmed that it is paying around $350 million for the startup, in a combination of cash and shares.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The acquisition is part of Instacart&#8217;s expanding &#8220;B2B2C&#8221; retail technology strategy. Alongside its mainstay online ordering and grocery delivery service, the company &#8212; as of March this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $39 billion</a> &#8212; is building out a stack of products and services for stores that they in turn can use to provide new services to their customers. It follows just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart acquired FoodStorm</a> to help stores take and manage catering-style larger orders of ready-made food.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220072" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Instacart&#8217;s CEO Fidji Simo (who joined </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/instacart-hires-facebook-executive-as-new-ceo-ahead-of-expected-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this year from Facebook</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">), said in an interview with TechCrunch this week that this acquisition is in keeping with what retailers themselves want and need to do. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Against the backdrop of huge competition from the likes of Amazon &#8212; which has its own cashier-free check out technology and is getting much more aggressive with its physical store strategy &#8212; retailers are chasing a customer base that increasingly expects and will use more modern, digital services than earlier generations of shoppers.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We are&#8230; unlocking for retail partners [what] we think is what’s next. We are meeting the evolving needs of customers online or offline. Retailers want to develop unified offerings that break down silos,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We see ourselves as a retail enablement company&#8230; We already have a vast platform to power commerce services [covering] both delivery and pick up that already blends the lines.&#8221;</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Simo said that the plan will be to continue Caper&#8217;s business as it is today &#8212; the company already has smart cart technology development deals with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kroger and Wakefern in the U.S., Sobeys in Canada and Auchan in France and Spain; and it provides smart checkout counters (where items are placed in a weight-sensitive box that scans and automatically rings up the items for the shopper) across a range of smaller convenience stores. Now Instacart will shop Caper&#8217;s tech to its wider network of existing grocery partners, too.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I’m incredibly proud of the business we’ve built and the technological leap forward our products represent for the entire grocery industry. The powerful technology we’ve created is intuitive for customers, easy to deploy for retailers of all sizes, and creates a physical retail ecosystem that never existed before,” said Lindon Gao, cofounder and CEO of <span class="il">Caper</span> AI, in a statement. “We share <span class="il">Instacart</span>&#8216;s vision of enabling grocery retailers with new innovations that create step changes for their businesses, and we’re proud to now be joining forces with <span class="il">Instacart</span> to develop even more solutions that help bring the online and offline together for retailers.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But it will also supercharge Caper&#8217;s expansion and how it is used. For example, there are plans to integrate Caper&#8217;s tech into Instacart&#8217;s app: people who start their in-person shopping lists on the Instacart app can then use the Caper technology to automatically ring up the items once they are in stores.</span></p>
<p>While this deal will be bringing a hardware business, as well as more hardware expertise, to Instacart, the company looks like it will be taking a more conservative approach to that area, at least in the short/medium term.</p>
<p>&#8220;For now we want to focus on these [existing] products,&#8221; Simo said of Caper Cart and Caper Counter, as its two products are called. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to get the tech absolutely perfect and adopted globally. There is a lot of work to do to get to scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Caper, this is a great landing. The company had raised just $13 million from investors that included Lux Capital, First Round, FundersClub and Y Combinator. Simo said that Instacart proactively approached Caper to do a deal while it was in the middle of fundraising, and it was intent on acquiring rather than just investing to bring the IP, talent and existing business into the Instacart fold.</p>
<p>But, it has to be said that as an independent startup, Caper would have been facing a very impressive and large slate of competition.</p>
<p>Amazon has built its &#8220;Just Walk Out&#8221; technology (as its cashier-free tech is called) mainly to run in Amazon&#8217;s own brick-and-mortar stores, but with Amazon you should never count out how it might eventually productize its own technology and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/amazon-is-now-selling-its-cashierless-store-technology-to-other-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell it to others as a service</a> (as it has done with AWS, its fulfillment tech, and so on). Trigo out of Israel has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/trigo-bags-10m-for-its-computer-vision-based-checkout-tech-to-rival-amazons-just-walk-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised over $100 million</a> and just today debuted its latest customer, the supermarket giant Tesco, which is <a href="https://www.tescoplc.com/news/2021/tesco-opens-new-checkout-free-store-getgo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using its tech in its new GetGo stores</a>. Standard Cognition, now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/amazon-go-rival-bets-pandemic-bolstered-case-for-cashierless-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at over $1 billion</a>, wants to be in 100 stores by the end of this year and most recently brought on Circle K as a customer. Shopic and Imagr are also working on continuing to hone their technology, and there are a number of others.</p>
<p>In that regard, this acquisition will give Instacart a way of competing against all of the above, and also getting its oar in to be the provider of that tech to retailers. A lot of the technology for cashier-free is still relatively nascent, and therefore some conceptions of how it should look and work are very expensive &#8212; perhaps cost-prohibitively so. Caper AI&#8217;s approach, Simo points out, is plug and play and relatively easy (and therefore cheaper) to implement than systems that involve retrofitting entire stores with overhead cameras, large computing systems to process the information, bringing in new physical carts and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were attracted to the smart cart solution the form factor that retailers will already understand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And that doesn’t require a big investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other side of the equation, of course, is the labor situation: solutions like these inevitably will raise questions of what the impact will be on people who traditionally would have worked as cashiers. And for Instacart, it&#8217;s notable that it is buying into technology that removes people from the checkout equation precisely at the same time that it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/instacart-shopper-activist-group-asks-customers-to-delete-the-app-until-demands-for-better-conditions-are-met/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing backlash of its own</a> over its labor practices. These issues are unlikely to be resolved with or without this specific acquisition, but there are questions and choices that Instacart, grocers, and consumers need to consider longer term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s nothing easy about learning a language, and so it&#8217;s also maybe no surprise that there are plenty of startups that want to make life easier for students. But while some mostly focus on individual learners and bypass the school systems, others are trying to make inroads in schools, too. One of the latest entrants to this market is <a href="https://www.magnilearn.com/">MagniLearn</a>, an AI-centric startup that provides students with individualized lessons based on their progress.</p>
<p>As the Israel-based startup announced today, it has now raised a $2.8 million seed funding round led by crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/">OurCrowd</a>&#8216;s incubator Labs/02 and India&#8217;s Reliance Industries, in addition to the Israeli Innovation Authority and a number of private investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;With our precise personalization &#8212; which allows pupils to thrive and reach their full potential &#8212; lessons for two students will never be identical,&#8221; Lana Tockus, MagniLearn’s CEO and co-founder, explained. &#8220;The lessons evolve as students progress, with our AI algorithms dynamically creating exercises in real time. The exercises are at exactly the right level to appropriately challenge each student and to best utilize their time. The algorithms understand each part of the learner&#8217;s answer and provide the learner with precise feedback in their own native language.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219922" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The service currently has users in Japan, Korea and Israel, but Tockus notes that she plans to use the new funding to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Currently, MagniLearn&#8217;s product focuses on teaching English.</p>
<p>The pandemic, the company argues, has put a lot of stress on school systems. But Tockus also notes that MagniLearn doesn&#8217;t strive to replace language teachers. &#8220;We want nothing less than to empower educators and students via personalized data-driven insights in order to maximize learning efficiency,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This will open up opportunities for students the world over who need English in order to join the global economy, double their income and secure a better future for themselves and their families.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that it&#8217;s October, it&#8217;s officially spooky season. But debut author Calvin Kasulke&#8217;s novel &#8220;<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671445/several-people-are-typing-by-calvin-kasulke/">Several People Are Typing</a>&#8221; gives us something new to be afraid of &#8212; what if you got trapped inside of your office&#8217;s Slack workspace, and Slackbot took over your corporeal form? As Kasulke told TechCrunch, &#8220;Capitalism is bad and bodies are prisons, but the only thing worse than having one is not having one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Several People Are Typing&#8221; is written entirely in Slack messages &#8212; Kasulke even wrote style guides for the idiosyncratic typing of each character, helping him develop the cast of characters, who work at a PR agency. Within their Slack workspace, the characters deal with a dog food publicity crisis, in-office romances and fights over who gets Gerald&#8217;s desk by the window while he &#8220;works from home&#8221; &#8212; he can&#8217;t commute to the office since he no longer has control of his body, but his supervisor doesn&#8217;t care, since he&#8217;s more productive than ever (what else is there to do but work when you&#8217;re literally stuck inside Slack?). The only time Gerald can&#8217;t work is when Slackbot shows him how to become one with sunset.gif, so that any time a Slack user uploads the gif, Gerald is transported to their workspace. Being a sunset gif sounds painful.</p>
<p>Slack declined to comment on the book when TechCrunch reached out, but Kasulke thinks that the company is cool with it &#8212; after all, the book&#8217;s publisher, Doubleday Books, ran <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUNDn3IAzMy/">a giveaway</a> with Slack. But the novel has less to do with Slack itself than it does with the way we work.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2213862" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/slack-office-trouble/620173/">The Atlantic</a> recently called Slack &#8220;the first enterprise software in history to convince people that it’s cool.&#8221; Kasulke will be the first to admit that the whole book-told-through-Slack thing is a gimmick, but it&#8217;s a really well-executed gimmick. In a strange turn of events for a book that screams Weird Internet<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, the novel was picked as <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/people-typing-calvin-kasulke-gma-september-book-club-79728692">Good Morning America&#8217;s Book of the Month</a>, which means that more people than you&#8217;d think are reading the troubling scene in which a newly corporeal Slackbot eats a meatball sub too fast and learns the hard way that living in a flesh sac isn&#8217;t always all it&#8217;s cracked out to be. But Kasulke says that people are weirder than we give them credit for, so it&#8217;s no wonder that the novel resonates with people who might read more texts than prose on some days.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Since his book is told through Slack messages, TechCrunch interviewed Kasulke via text. Enjoy. </span></p>

<p><strong>amanda at 3:08 PM</strong><br />
What’s your background with slack and how did you decide to write a book told only in slack messages?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:08 PM</strong><br />
So when I was writing the book I worked at a consulting firm that used Slack pretty heavily, both because we had offices in two different cities and because it was the kind of job where you always had to be plugged in<br />
So I was sending and receiving a ton of work slacks every day, plus you know, DMing coworkers about both work related things and like, if they thought the Knicks were going to make the playoffs or whatever<br />
AND I have a background in screenwriting/playwriting, and what is a work Slack but a long, endless play</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:10 PM</strong><br />
yeah I think something that’s really funny about the book is that you can only include conversations that would feasibly happen on slack, but the thing is that you could argue that anything could feasibly be discussed on slack, so I didn’t really bat an eye reading the book when characters start discussing nsfw things on slack because like, of course that would happen in a random marketing agency slack<br />
it’s like, we all know that in theory our managers can read our slack DMs, but people still use them to talk about things maybe they don’t want their managers to see anyway</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:11 PM</strong><br />
right exactly, and no one can reasonably expect colleagues to exclusively discuss work<br />
in some ways having a work slack is capitulating to the idea that office communication cannot exclusively take place in an office context<br />
which in many cases is a sort of wedge into a more hybrid approach to office work anyway<br />
And there&#8217;s a world of difference between a public slack and a private DM between coworkers<br />
and all of those little differences in how we ~perform~ ourselves at work were a ton of fun to write<br />
because you get this view of characters as their Public Work Selves, as their more Group DM Work Selves and then as total goblins in one-on-one DMs<br />
not all of them are goblins<br />
some, though</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:13 PM</strong><br />
I’m super fascinated by the linguistics of slack and how different characters in the book have different quirks in their typing, how that changes when talking to different people, etc<br />
(and also how we are now demonstrating that by doing this interview via text)</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:16 PM</strong><br />
lol I wrote a style guide<br />
for how each character would type</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:17 PM</strong><br />
i think that’s so important though because I don’t think the book would work if you couldn’t get a sense for who the characters are solely via slack<br />
But also IRL we have to get to know coworkers solely via slack oftentimes</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:18 PM</strong><br />
If the whole thing was going to be in dialogue they had to be distinguishable so I wrote little rules for everyone. and then broke some of them sometimes because people aren&#8217;t terribly consistent and also because sometimes a joke would land better with certain punctuation or something<br />
oh yeah I have a ton of colleagues now I&#8217;ve only met online, it&#8217;s wild</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:19 PM</strong><br />
I think it’s easy for people to be like “oh a slack book sounds like a gimmick” but I think it’s true to life in a really disconcerting way<br />
And speaking of disconcerting things<br />
so, the book is kind of like. horror?<br />
how did slackbot-as-villian(?) come about</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:20 PM</strong><br />
It is a gimmick! Gimmicks are fun! And also I tried to imbue the book with enough, both in terms of plot and in terms of a pound of flesh (feelings, thoughts, reflections, etc.) that it would be more thanjust a gimmick<br />
*than just<br />
that whole sentence came out a little weird<br />
On to your point about Slackbot!<br />
I needed some way to raise the stakes of Gerald being trapped in Slack, and it seemed natural that the fate of his real-world body would be the main source of escalating that plot<br />
But again, the book is in Slack, so it needs to be legible in that format</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:22 PM</strong><br />
Slackbot loves to Taste!</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:23 PM</strong><br />
He wants more life! He wants to experience the physical world! The same one Gerald has been TELLING HIM ABOUT the whole time!</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:23 PM</strong><br />
i never really used slackbot much but now I cannot use slackbot because I don’t want to get stuck in slack</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:23 PM</strong><br />
Idk I think Slackbot&#8217;s motivations are pretty clear. They&#8217;re literally amoral, because the bot doesn&#8217;t really have a sense of ethics, but like<br />
I get it</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:24 PM</strong><br />
yeah I think if I realized one day that I was a robot I would be freaked out<br />
and try to get out and eat a meatball sub<br />
As slackbot does (spoiler alert)<br />
and other things</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:24 PM</strong><br />
Meatball subs are as good a reason to have a physical form as anything<br />
top 5 reasons to stay tethered to this mortal coil</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:25 PM</strong><br />
but I think the whole Thing<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is like it is possible to be stuck in slack anyway in jobs where, like you said before, you feel like you have to be always online<br />
and there’s the whole thing where Gerald starts to be like “guys I swear it’s not a bit I am literally stuck in slack” but no one will help him get out of slack<br />
because everyone thinks it’s just a really weird bit and his manager doesn’t care because he’s being more productive than ever (…..because he can’t escape slack)</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:27 PM</strong><br />
well and also like. A. It&#8217;s a wild thing to happen and B. Even if it was real what could you, Gerald&#8217;s coworker and a person who is not personally a warlock, do about it<br />
You have to go to meetings and send emails and write memos and stuff, and you are not a ghostbuster or a wizard and probably can&#8217;t help him anyway? even if it was real? which it can&#8217;t be because, you know, that is not a real thing that happens?<br />
In many ways believing him would be&#8230; worse, for everyone involved except maybe Gerald</p>

<p><strong>amanda at 3:29 PM</strong><br />
have you talked to anyone at slack about the book? do you know what people who work on slack think?</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:30 PM</strong><br />
Doubleday and Slack just did a giveaway thing together!</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:30 PM</strong><br />
oh nice!</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:30 PM</strong><br />
I have been contacted by folks there informally<br />
And I have heard secondhand that people were excited for the book before it came out<br />
And I have to assume the giveaway means at least some folks there didn&#8217;t hate it, lol<br />
though if the book made you afraid of Slackbot maybe their opinion will change</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:31 PM</strong><br />
i mean i think the book isn&#8217;t really like &#8220;slack is bad&#8221; it&#8217;s like &#8220;maybe Capitalism and Not Having Work Life Balance is bad&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:31 PM</strong><br />
capitalism is bad and bodies are prisons, but the only thing worse than having one is not having one</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:31 PM</strong><br />
slack is no more responsible for bad working conditions than like, gmail i guess?<br />
bad managers are responsible for bad working conditions<br />
idk!</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:32 PM</strong><br />
yeah no this is definitely not an indictment of Slack specifically, it was a very fun platform to write in</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:32 PM</strong><br />
but slack is so much more interesting than gmail because in slack people type like this and in gmail people type with proper punctuation and no emojis</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:33 PM</strong><br />
right yeah, working conditions are determined by what bosses demand and what workers will put up with<br />
and the circumstances that influence both of those factors (the economy, the labor market specifically, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:35 PM</strong><br />
another thing is like<br />
now it&#8217;s like, the GMA book of the month?<br />
or last month I mean<br />
so i&#8217;m curious how that went<br />
like i think it&#8217;s super cool because it&#8217;s a really good, funny, thought-provoking book but also. it&#8217;s weird!<br />
or maybe the viewership of GMA is weirder than we give them credit for</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:38 PM</strong><br />
September, yeah!<br />
No one was more surprised than me!!</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:39 PM</strong><br />
or i guess, it is weird, but also, it&#8217;s sometimes close to life in a way that&#8217;s maybe relatable to people?</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:40 PM</strong><br />
I hope it doesn&#8217;t come off as false modesty because I am proud of this book<br />
And I am genuinely very surprised by the response it&#8217;s gotten and that it has mainstream traction as a GMA book club pick and a review in the New Yorker</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:41 PM</strong><br />
no i think it&#8217;s valid to be surprised because yeah i think it&#8217;s a really good book but also i wouldn&#8217;t peg it as being accessible to the mainstream in the same way as a book like&#8230;. idk sally rooney</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:41 PM</strong><br />
I think people are weirder than we give them credit for, and I also think people are very used to readings texts and chats and group DMs</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:41 PM</strong><br />
i like the idea that people are weirder than we give them credit for</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:42 PM</strong><br />
which maybe provides a bit more leeway for things to get weird but for readers to feel like they&#8217;re along for the ride</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:42 PM</strong><br />
yeah, like i think if the story was written in traditional prose, it wouldn&#8217;t be as exciting or funny</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:42 PM</strong><br />
I tried to design the book in a way where readers were learning how to read it as they go along<br />
You have to establish the rules before you can get weird<br />
And because so much of our lives are already online, even folks who don&#8217;t use Slack can clock what&#8217;s going on</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:45 PM</strong><br />
i think what i love about the book is that it makes you think really critically about work/life balance, role of tech in your own life, etc. while also being like. hey what if slackbot ate a meatball sub.<br />
has writing the book changed how you interact with slack/the internet/work at all?</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:46 PM</strong><br />
lol I am VERY not active on Slack at my current workplace<br />
In part because I get more work done without notifications beeping and in part because I don&#8217;t want people to feel like I am Harvesting Their Conversations For Content</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:47 PM</strong><br />
that is an extremely specific problem to have<br />
although recently when a former boss/now friend told me she was pregnant she was like &#8220;don&#8217;t tweet this&#8221; bc she hadn&#8217;t announced it publicly at the time, which feels similar</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:47 PM</strong><br />
yeah it&#8217;s a more acute version of something that comes up a fair amount anyway<br />
re: &#8220;don&#8217;t tweet this&#8221; or someone posting a picture you&#8217;re in the background of or a screenshot of a funny text exchange or something<br />
we tend to develop these habits before we develop an ethics around them<br />
or at least a conventional ethics, like for example, asking permission from your interlocutor before you post a picture of a funny text exchange</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:50 PM</strong><br />
have you thought about the facebook metaverse thing where they wanna use VR to have us<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/facebook-finally-made-a-good-virtual-reality-app/"> go to work meetings</a>?</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:52 PM</strong><br />
I have! I don&#8217;t think people want VR in that way, honestly<br />
We keep reverting back to different ways to type at each other if we can&#8217;t be in person</p>
<p><strong>amanda at 3:53 PM</strong><br />
i wonder if there&#8217;s a line in how much we want tech to be in our lives and where that line is</p>
<p><strong>calvin at 3:53 PM</strong><br />
if we&#8217;re not gonna be bodies in space together, let&#8217;s not meet in a virtual office. at least not if we can&#8217;t do it in like, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-is-a-tense-and-fluid-return-to-form-for-nintendos-enduring-series/">Samus&#8217;s Zero Suit</a></p>
<p>Okay, back to properly punctuated, complete sentences, written without a timestamp (it&#8217;s 11:55 AM on Monday, October 18, in case you were wondering). If you were able to follow that conversation, you can probably follow &#8220;Several People Are Typing.&#8221; Even the audiobook feels like a natural read, featuring an ensemble cast to play each individual Slack chatter. While the book is critical of the way we work today, it&#8217;s not that exaggerated. Sure, the idea of several corporate professionals working together to figure out how to spin the PR nightmare of a dog food brand accidentally poisoning Pomeranians is pretty ridiculous, but we know that&#8217;s probably happening IRL. That&#8217;s why now, we glean <a href="https://twitter.com/steak_umm/status/1449015873960873986">thoughtful insights about the social media attention economy</a> from the official account of Steak-umms.</p>

<p>As far as the gimmick goes &#8212; should every book be written in text-speak like it&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ttyl">an AIM-based, young adult novel from 2004</a>? That might be a stretch. But absurdism is most effective when it feels like it might just be real, which is why this particular story works &#8212; the supernatural scenarios might feel unfamiliar, but no form of communication feels more sublimely ordinary than a Slack message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> wants to foster usage in the U.S. with better free accounts. Like in other markets, Revolut offers both free and paid accounts in the U.S. When you pay for a subscription fee, you get higher fair usage caps and more features, such as insurance coverage and different card designs.</p>
<p>With today’s change, Revolut is making the free plan more attractive. When you open a Revolut account, you get your own account details and a free Revolut card. You can then send and receive money, spend with your card and access a wide range of financial products.</p>
<p>The company is upping the limit on free ATM withdrawals. Before today, you could withdraw up to $300 per month without fees on Revolut’s side. After that, Revolut used to charge 2% in fees. Free Revolut users can now withdraw up to $1,200 per month without fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218757" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Revolut is also becoming more attractive if you want to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/revolut-partners-with-paxos-to-bring-cryptocurrency-trading-to-the-us/">partnered with Paxos</a> for cryptocurrency trading in the U.S. Before today, users would pay 2.5% in conversion fees after exchanging $200.</p>
<p>Now, users can trade up to $200,000 per month without paying any commission. But there’s some spread — you don’t get the same exchange rate when you buy and when you sell cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>One of Revolut’s key feature is the ability to exchange currencies in the app. You can create different sub-accounts and hold money in several currencies. Revolut promises low <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/legal/standard-fees">exchange fees</a> with a 0.5% markup fee once you go above the $1,000 fair usage limit for free Revolut accounts.</p>
<p>Additionally, Revolut charges a flat fee to send money to a foreign bank account. That fee encourages your friends and family to use Revolut as well as you don’t pay it for Revolut-to-Revolut transfers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But sometimes you have to send money to a foreign bank account. Premium users didn’t have to pay that flat fee for their first international transfer each month. Now, Revolut is waiving the flat fee on international transfers for up to 10 international transfers per month.</p>
<p>Finally, free Revolut users in the U.S. can create up to five <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/">Junior account</a>. Those accounts targeted toward kids aged 7-17 feature an integration with the main Revolut app on the parent’s side. It makes it easier to manage allowance and give some flexibility to your children.</p>
<p>With today’s move, Revolut is adapting its product depending on market conditions. The company is competing with other fintech companies in the U.S., such as <a href="https://www.chime.com">Chime</a> or <a href="https://robinhood.com">Robinhood</a>. That’s why it’s important to attract all sorts of users, including users who don’t want to pay a subscription fee to use basic banking features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not content with setting your feet a-tapping with its intuitive music sequencer aimed at amateur music makers, Artiphon today <a href="http://artiphon.com/downloads">announced an app</a> that adds video-making prowess to the Orba&#8217;s already impressive feature set. Appealing to your inner Video Jockey, <a href="https://vimeo.com/612035970/a659bd7305">the Orbacam demo video</a> makes it look easy, adding video filters and effects to your visual creative pursuits.</p>
<p>The idea of the Orbacam is to create quick and easy videos that Artiphon refers to as &#8220;Musical Selfies.&#8221; The results of the videos are fun, colorful, highly shareable music videos that sync automatically to whatever else you&#8217;re playing on the Orba. The app turns the already social media-magnet of a musical instrument into the perfect companion for Instagram Stories, TikTok or Snap creative pursuits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217154" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217154" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217154" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6.-Orbacam-UI.gif" alt="Orbicam in Action" width="480" height="480" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217154" class="wp-caption-text">Orbicam in action. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Artiphon</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that music is always a multisensory experience, and we designed Orbacam as an auditory, visual and tactile experience that anyone can play immediately,” says Artiphon&#8217;s CEO and founder Mike Butera. “We’ve seen the power of synchronizing music with social content, but almost all of that is just pasting someone else’s song on your video. Now people can create musical videos that are entirely their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Orbacam, the company made it easy to make music &#8212; what is new, is the ability to weave visual effects into the video export, without needing to do additional music mixing, audio routing or post-production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app also enables you to use the microphone connected to your phone &#8212; or the one built into your phone &#8212; to sing or beat-box your way on top of the music you&#8217;re creating. It also gives users the option to import videos and photos from the phone&#8217;s camera roll. </span></p>
<p>For armchair musicians, the Orba takes some of the scary parts out of creating music. Part synthesizer, part looper, part MIDI controller, the palm-sized digital grapefruit already made it easy and intuitive to create music. Most impressively, Orba wasn&#8217;t even the company&#8217;s first shot at creating weird and wonderful music-making tools. In 2015, the company pre-sold $1.3 million worth of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/07/the-crowdfunded-artiphon-instrument-1-mixes-high-and-low-musical-tech/">the INSTRUMENT 1 musical instrument</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ever the sucker for creative hardware products making their way to market, we&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on Artiphon. The Orba originally saw the light of day following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/artiphon-orba/">a $1.4 million Kickstarter campaign</a>, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/artiphon-seed-funding/">a cash injection from, among others, Warner Music</a>. We thought it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/this-99-gadget-helps-you-make-music-no-skill-required/">fun to play with when it launched</a> last year. We&#8217;re delighted to see the company add a companion app with more features, stretching its usefulness beyond the slightly gimmicky, if relatively affordable, offering.</p>
<p>If you already have an Orba, the free app is <a href="http://artiphon.com/downloads">available from Artiphon</a> today. If you don&#8217;t, you can <a href="https://artiphon.com/pages/orba-by-artiphon">pick up the Orba for $100</a> from a number of retailers, or direct from Artiphon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In April of this year, collaborative design powerhouse <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> launched a white boarding tool called <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a>. A separate tool and brand from Figma, FigJam allows users to brainstorm and iterate together in an infinite white board experience, complete with voice service to chat it out in the very same tool.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, FigJam can be seen as an extension upstream for the design software company. Rather than focusing on designers and the parties working closely alongside them, like engineering and product management, through Figma, FigJam asks anyone in the organization to get involved and share their ideas.</p>
<p>Usage data indicates that the product is reaching non-designers in customer organizations, the company said. However, there has been a barrier concerning price, per Figma CEO and founder Dylan Field</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219434" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So, starting in February 2022, FigJam will see a price cut. Pro plans will go from $8 per month to $3 per month per seat, and Org plans will go from $15 per month to $5 per month per seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We kept coming back to this principle of &#8216;let&#8217;s not get in the way&#8217;,&#8221; said Field. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to block adoption based on price. So if we can be the most competitive pricing system and use it to emphasize development, but not try to make a crazy profit on this, I think it&#8217;s pretty powerful. Because that way, we get more people in the design process, which is aligned with our vision of making design accessible.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that it&#8217;s important to not think just about initial cost but incremental cost for these organizations.</p>
<p>There is also a free tier of FigJam that allows for unlimited personal whiteboards and three shared whiteboards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oEjrGYCN3C"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/figma-introduces-a-whiteboard-tool-called-figjam/">Figma introduces a whiteboard tool called FigJam</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Figma introduces a whiteboard tool called FigJam&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/figma-introduces-a-whiteboard-tool-called-figjam/embed/#?secret=oEjrGYCN3C" data-secret="oEjrGYCN3C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Alongside the pricing update, Figma is doing even more to make FigJam accessible, including the introduction of &#8220;Open Sessions.&#8221; Open Sessions allow users to invite anyone to a jam session for a 24-hour window without a log-in. The company thinks of it as the digital equivalent to inviting someone to the office for a meeting or casual hang.</p>
<p>Figma has a robust plug-in community, and the company is looking to bring the same community-powered fun to FigJam. The product is introducing plugins, widgets and other tools to further build out the whiteboard tool.</p>
<p>These plugins and widgets range from productivity tools, like plugins that automate repetitive tasks, to widgets that let users play games like dice, or even embed content like videos and docs.</p>
<p>In fact, Donut has built out a widget for FigJam that pairs users in an org together for a jam session. Thus far, Donut has built exclusively for Slack, helping employees in separate departments get to know another in our remote, COVID world. (You can learn more about widgets and plug-ins coming to FigJam in <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-the-power-of-our-open-platform-to-figjam/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Field explained that there are considerable challenges in building for organizations as a whole, rather than for the designers and their adjacents exclusively.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to recalibrate internally about which people matter and make sure we&#8217;re building for the right folks,&#8221; said Field. &#8220;In FigJam, one of the parameters we really care about is this idea of a facilitator and worrying about their needs. This is someone who wants to make things better and is able to influence inside the organization. It&#8217;s a subset of Figma&#8217;s audience but it&#8217;s not the champion we typically see. And so the challenge is to worry about their needs and make sure we&#8217;re addressing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus far, it&#8217;s working. Roughly two-thirds of Figma users overall identify as something other than &#8216;designer.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SOC Prime, a Boston-based early-stage startup that claims to have built the world’s largest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/advanced-threat-detection/">threat detection</a> marketplace, has secured $11 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The company will use the investment, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dnx-ventures/">DNX Ventures</a> with participation from Streamlined Ventures and Rembrandt Venture Partners, to scale and accelerate the adoption of its marketplace that allows researchers to monetize their threat detection code to help security teams defend against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattacks/">cyberattacks</a>.</p>
<p>SOC Prime describes its Detection as Code platform as like &#8220;Spotify for cyber threats.&#8221; This curates threat detection content from nearly 400 researchers and allows you to pull it into your existing SIEM and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/hunters-brings-in-30m-series-c-to-grow-xdr-security-tech/">XDR</a> platforms. Currently, the platform is home to more than 130,000 detections aligned with the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, a curated knowledge base of known adversary threats, tactics and techniques.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219281" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company pays security researchers a bounty every time their content is used, and allows subscribers to rate the content to determine how big a payout they get. In September, researchers earned $700 on average, and the startup tells TechCrunch that top performers in the program earn over $20,000 annually.</p>
<p>With its Series A investment in the bank, the company plans to double the bounty size in the short-term, with plans to grow it by up to fivefold over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>“The power of the global threat hunting community is an untapped resource for security teams around the world,” said Andrii Bezverkhyi, founder and CEO of SOC Prime. “Our threat detection marketplace is fueled by the industry’s most diverse, bounty-driven threat hunting community, and we are committed to empowering them as they contribute timely, impactful detections that help organizations adopt a collaborative defense approach to more efficiently combat digital threats.”</p>
<p>SOC Prime was founded in 2015 by Bezverkhyi, alongside fellow Ukranians Oleksandr Bredikhin and Ruslan Mikhalov, as a way to help organizations establish basic security practices and improve threat visibility in the face of a global talent shortage and alert fatigue, the startup tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In the last 12 months, the company grew its premium subscriber base by 50%, its monthly recurring revenue by 86% and its active customer base by 85%. Its customer base includes over 6,000 organizations using its freemium SaaS offering and over 70 paying customers, including enterprises, public sector organizations in the U.S. and EU, and security vendors.</p>
<p>The startup currently has over 80 employees in addition to the more than 300 vetted top threat researchers that create and monetize their threat detection code. By the end of 2022, the company plans to reach 140 employees and more than 900 vetted researchers.</p>
<p>Hiro Rio Maeda, managing partner at DNX Ventures, said: &#8220;Just like Netflix and Spotify changed the way that consumers access music and movies, we believe that SOC Prime will revolutionize the way that security teams access the threat detection content that is vital to defend their organizations.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Product developers want to use AI, but don't always have the right tools to do it without relying on data scientists.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mage.ai/">Mage</a>, developing an artificial intelligence tool for product developers to build and integrate AI into apps, brought in $6.3 million in seed funding led by Gradient Ventures.</p>
<p>Founder Tommy Dang started the company at the end of 2020 after building internal low-code tools at Airbnb. While collaborating with product developers, Dang saw that while product developers wanted to use AI, they didn’t have the right tools in which to do it without relying on data scientists.</p>
<p>“We worked with hundreds of developers who had great machine learning tools and internal systems to launch models, but there were not many who knew how to use the tools,” Dang told TechCrunch. “They didn’t work with machine learning extensively, so we decided to build tools for technical non-experts. We are like Stripe for AI, making it easier for developers to put AI into apps.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219626" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/">market for AI tools</a> is expected to reach $126 billion by 2025, but most of those continue to be geared toward those with experience in AI. Mage’s technology is a low-code, cloud-based tool and user interface with a shared workspace similar to Figma. Users can add data by uploading a file, streaming data or connecting to a data warehouse. From there, they can build models and select from other use cases, like churn prevention, ranking and matching users. Following the model creation, users can review the model, improve on it and then download to a file, connect back to the data warehouse or deploy it into an API or app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219656" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219656" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219656 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/product-preview.jpg?w=680" alt="Mage product review" width="680" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/product-preview.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/product-preview.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/product-preview.jpg?resize=300,247 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/product-preview.jpg?resize=768,631 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/product-preview.jpg?resize=680,559 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/product-preview.jpg?resize=1536,1262 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/product-preview.jpg?resize=2048,1683 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/product-preview.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219656" class="wp-caption-text">Mage dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mage</p></div></p>
<p>Joining Gradient in the round were Neo, Designer Fund and a group of angel investors, including Unity CEO John Riccitiello, Behance founder Scott Belsky, Lenny’s Newsletter author Lenny Rachitsky and James Beshara.</p>
<p>Darian Shirazi, general partner at Gradient Ventures, said via email that he found Mage while looking for an investment in the machine learning infrastructure space that didn&#8217;t require data engineering experience. He saw most of the companies funded recently were heavy infrastructure, and facilitated large jobs for data scientists and machine learning engineers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shirazi saw a market asking for technologies and systems that enabled non-data scientists to leverage AI and machine learning. Shirazi found that in Mage. He had met Dang while at UC Berkeley and later reconnected while Dang was at Airbnb. He believes that if “Mage succeeds in providing the easiest tools for leveraging AI and machine learning, they will transform how everyone does business.”</p>
<p>“There is a strong appetite from companies and individuals to leverage technologies and systems that are currently only accessible to domain experts such as data scientists, ML engineers and AI researchers,” he added. “The reality is that the number of applications for AI/ML are endless. There needs to be simple tools to allow anyone to leverage machine learning, without requiring a deep understanding of math, computer science or data science.”</p>

<p>He considers Mage&#8217;s “superpower” to be “the nexus of data quality tools and interoperability of ML models and features.” Shirazi expects the company to eventually have a marketplace of different models and tools for manipulating and combining data sets, like for marketing, sales, product and finance.</p>
<p>Mage is still in beta, but working with small businesses, and Dang said the company has plans for its self-service feature to go live in early 2022. Behind-the-scenes, the company is hiring for product design and engineering and intends to also use the new capital to build out additional AI tools and expand internationally.</p>
<p>Dang said the company wasn’t focused on revenue at the moment, but has amassed a group of paying customers from the beginning. These early clients are helping Mage by trying out the features, he added.</p>
<p>“Our next steps are to launch to general availability where you can onboard yourself,” Dang said. “The need for machine learning is a global need, and not many others emphasize making tools accessible. We have a community of developers that want to expand their skill set and grow their toolkits.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A rush of platforms have been built in the last several years that cater to the needs of knowledge workers, helping them find jobs (and employers find workers), managing the remuneration process regardless of location, and addressing their professional development. But that is not the whole story. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.wonolo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonolo</a> that has built a work-booking app for the other end of the employment spectrum &#8212; front-line workers and laborers &#8212; is announcing a major round of funding.</p>
<p>The company has picked up $140 million on the back of its own growth. Wonolo says that to date over 1 million people &#8212; retail workers, delivery people, administrative clerks, general laborers, event staffers and more &#8212; have used its platform to find work, with the thousands of companies using its services ranging from huge consumer brands like Coca Cola through to Uniqlo and Mutual of Omaha. It will be using the funding to continue expanding its platform in the U.S. with international being something it would also like to consider down the road.</p>
<p class="p4">Leeds Illuminate led the round, with &#8220;strong participation&#8221; also from 137 Ventures and G2 Venture Partners, with Franklin Templeton also in the round. Wonolo last raised funding well before the pandemic hit &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/19/wonolo-a-staffing-platform-for-blue-collar-and-labor-contractors-left-behind-by-silicon-valley-raises-32m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$32 million in 2018</a> &#8212; which speaks to the state of the company&#8217;s business and its margins, and the boost its business has seen in the last couple of years (including, specifically, the last 20 months). Wonolo has now raised more than $200 million, and Yong Kim, the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, said it is not disclosing its valuation except to say that it has &#8220;significantly increased&#8221; since the last round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wonolo&#8217;s rise and ethos speaks to a specific moment in the world of labor and employment. Front-line workers took on a new profile in the Covid-19 pandemic. After years of gradual neglect and disregard in favor of the shift to digitally native &#8220;knowledge workers&#8221;, they suddenly became heroes, people who were taking on jobs and getting things done at a time when many others were staying at home and avoiding contact with others, either by choice, or company or municipal mandates.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s opened the door to thinking more about what the needs of those workers might be, and how to provide services that cater to them specifically. And in the view of Wonolo that has a direct correlation to what it has built. In short, there are front-line workers in the world today who do not want to be tied to single companies &#8212; either because they don&#8217;t want to be doing the same job day in, day out; or because they need more time flexibility &#8212; and so Wonolo has built a platform to help them continue to get jobs in that context.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty percent of the world is in front line work, and those people have been misunderstood and underexposed,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;Now we have a moment to empower them and we want to be the company that stands for them and educates the world on the amazing job they are doing. We want to increase awareness of that workforce, and we want them to be more fulfilled in their jobs.&#8221; He added that there is currently a &#8220;tremendous demand for flexible working&#8221; among blue-collar and front-line laborers.</p>
<p>The company sits in an interesting crossroads in gig economy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the one hand, gig (or temporary, non-regular) working has found a strong current in the concept of &#8220;on demand&#8221;: companies staff up to meet a specific need in a specific time, whether they are built in themselves as &#8220;on demand&#8221; businesses like Uber or delivery companies; or if they are not those kinds of businesses but are trying to operate in more agile ways.</p>
<p>On the other hand, being a gig worker can have its own issues. Work consistently enough for a single company, and you will start to wonder why you too shouldn&#8217;t be afforded the benefits of more standard employees. This has played out in a number of countries with more requirements demanded of those employing the workers, and will likely continue to for years to come.</p>
<p>Wonolo, as a platform to encourage more gig working, does not offer anything equivalent to a &#8220;union&#8221; for those using its platform, but Kim says that it sees its role is as an enabler of better practices. It provides some guidance on adequate pay, and Kim notes that the marketplace also plays a role: if a job is priced too low, no one picks it up. And Kim says that some who are regularly working for a single company do sign on sometimes as full-time staff, although generally speaking the appetite among Wonoloers (as the workers are called) is to remain freelance. That in itself has presented a challenge for some employers, he added &#8212; one reason why they turn to using Wonolo to find workers in the first place.</p>
<p>“The world of temporary staffing is massive, generating over $500 billion in global annual revenue. We see Wonolo as the leader in disrupting this space and offering a tech-first, flexible solution that helps businesses and workers alike,” said Stephanie Nieman, MD at Leeds Illuminate, in a statement. “We are struck by how thoughtful Wonolo has been in building a business that puts workers first and is innovating with organizations to solve real labor problems across many industries.” Nieman is joining the startup&#8217;s board of directors with this round.</p>
<p>Longer term, it will be interesting to see what kinds of jobs fall into the Wonolo net, and I suspect that thinking of this as &#8220;front-line&#8221; will see that net widen. Kim said that teachers (specifically substitute teachers), nurses and other care staff, and even more technical jobs are all categories that it will be looking to incorporate into its platform over the years. Whether you see that as more skilled jobs turning into &#8220;blue collar&#8221; or if blue collar is rising in stature might depend on how you choose to view it, but the fact remains that it points to another big trend in labor: gig jobs appear to be gaining ground over full-time work, and so platforms like Wonolo&#8217;s to connect people with jobs will continue to play a role.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.valencesecurity.com/">Valence</a>, a Tel Aviv-based security startup that aims to help businesses better protect what Valence calls the &#8220;business application mesh,&#8221; today announced that it has raised a $7 million seed round, led by <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a>. Stonemill Ventures, the <a href="https://www.stlcig.com/">St. Louis Cyber Interest Group</a> (STLCIG) and a number of angel investors, including a group of prominent CISOs, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Founded by CEO Yoni Shohet (who also previously co-founded <a href="https://www.scadafence.com/">SCADAfence</a>) and CTO Shlomi Matichin, Valence helps businesses better understand the connections between the many enterprise SaaS and self-hosted applications they now use. Often, after all, a company may use APIs, automation tools like Workato or Zapier or SaaS marketplaces to get more value from their various tools. But at the same time, this network, which Valence dubs the &#8220;business application mesh,&#8221; often grows without a lot of governance, leaving the door open for a variety of security issues from the shadow connectivity, over-provisioned privileges and unmanaged third-party access that is the inevitable result of connecting all of these disparate systems.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219880" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Valence-logo-Full-color-Horizontal@3x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219880" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219880 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Valence-logo-Full-color-Horizontal@3x.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219880" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Valence</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219876" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we started to talk to practitioners and talk to security customers and CISOs about this problem space, we realized that there&#8217;s this unhandled world of integrations between applications that is basically unmanaged and ungoverned by any type of security solution today,&#8221; Matichin told me.</p>
<p>What the team realized is that a lot of security tools today focus on how humans access corporate applications. Matichin argues that these tools don&#8217;t cover machine-to-machine connections very well, especially given the rise of automation and cloud migrations we&#8217;re seeing in the enterprise world right now. The connections between these applications are often set-and-forget &#8212; and depending on the company, there may not even be a formal vetting process either. Among other things, this leaves a company open to an unvetted third party having privileged access into the ecosystem of their corporate applications and data.</p>
<p>As Shohet noted, a lot of these networks are pretty centralized. By being able to scan the connections to a relatively small number of core systems, Valence can quickly detect potential issues like unvetted vendors and help its users disconnect these &#8212; or automate the process if needed. Some customers, he noted, are able to reduce their risk surface by dozens and sometimes even hundreds of applications within a few days of getting started with Valence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really hard right now in security is to define a very unique approach to solve something in a holistic way,&#8221; YL Ventures partner John Brennan said.&#8221; And so, while we as investors had in our minds these fragments of different problems, the risk you&#8217;re running security right now &#8212; especially with so many smart people starting a lot of interesting companies &#8212; is solving maybe a small problem in an interesting way. And what Yoni and Shlomi together did when they came to us is essentially evangelize and define and articulate a massive platform that could solve a lot of these problems with a very different approach. [&#8230;] <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think it&#8217;s fair to say, when I look across our whole portfolio, the early velocity of this company is truly remarkable and I think it is a testament to the two people running it.&#8221; </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you follow tech press, you&#8217;ve probably noticed more outlets covering the blockchain-based, play-to-earn trend, wherein individuals playing crypto-powered games can ostensibly earn a living off their gaming skills if they earn assets within the game or tokens that they can then sell for &#8220;real&#8221; money.</p>
<p>A Vietnam company called &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; has been driving the current conversation. It&#8217;s so popular that a startup in the Philippines that exists solely to lend money to players who want to get started in &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; (one needs first to buy its digital creatures) attracted a check from Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>A month later, &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/10/05/investing-in-axie-infinity/">itself </a>announced funding from the firm.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219846" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bl5GK3Rpdz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/arianna-simpson-of-a16z-on-yield-guild-games-the-firms-newest-bet-on-crypto-gaming/">Arianna Simpson of a16z on Yield Guild Games, the firm&#8217;s newest bet on crypto + gaming</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Arianna Simpson of a16z on Yield Guild Games, the firm&#8217;s newest bet on crypto + gaming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/arianna-simpson-of-a16z-on-yield-guild-games-the-firms-newest-bet-on-crypto-gaming/embed/#?secret=bl5GK3Rpdz" data-secret="bl5GK3Rpdz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The trend is no flash in the pan, say the cofounders of a new, early-stage venture firm called Patron. Instead, they believe games like &#8220;Axie&#8221; will be the biggest consumer on-ramp to what&#8217;s being called the decentralized &#8220;Web 3&#8221; era.</p>
<p>We emailed yesterday with Patron&#8217;s founders to learn more. One of them, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Brian Cho, spent the last seven years with Riot Games, leaving as its global head of business and corporate development. (He also logged two years with Andreessen Horowitz beginning in 2012.) His cofounder, </span>Jason Yeh, spent the last four years as the founder of his own investment firm in Berlin, Germany and before that, worked for<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> eight years at Riot Games, including as its </span>head of EU Esports.</p>
<p>They shared the many individuals who make up Patron&#8217;s new LP base, including a handful of investors from Andreessen Horowitz, along with Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, Garry Tan of Initialized Capital, and Hans Tung of GGV Capital. They also shared a bit of their roadmap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You met at Riot Games. At what point did you decide you wanted to leave to do your own thing?</strong></p>
<p>BC: Yes, we initially met at Riot Games as colleagues and became close through co-investing in various deals over the past decade. Patron has been in the works conceptually for many years. However, it wasn&#8217;t until recently that the market&#8217;s needs provided us with the opportunity to successfully create the type of firm we originally wanted to build that led us to [do this].</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have capital commitments from a lot prominent VCs. Who wrote the first check? </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">BC: We purposely focused on getting individuals who would have skin in the game and a desire to help our companies reach a successful Series A milestone. </span>What we didn&#8217;t expect was how much positive impact our earlier individual LPs would have on our overall fundraising and our ability to win some of the most competitive seed deals in the market. We were able to raise the entire $90 million in four months.</p>
<p>Many of the LPs are people we&#8217;ve been close to for the better part of the past decade as colleagues or co-investors, so it made sense to get them on board first. Our first checks were our former bosses and mentors like Chris and Marc at a16z, Rick and Amish at FirstMark [where Yeh was an associate more than a decade ago], and the founders of Riot Games. Our average individual check size is north of $400,000, so many of the individuals wrote large personal checks into the fund.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are there any institutions involved? If Riot Games a backer?</strong></p>
<p>JY: Horsley Bridge Partners and Invesco are two of our most significant institutional leads in the fund. Riot Games is not an investor, as we wanted to prioritize individuals and institutions rather than strategics for fund one.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: &#8216;Play to earn&#8217; is everywhere suddenly, thanks to &#8220;Axie Infinity.&#8221; How long have you been tracking this trend, and which other startups are interesting here and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>BC:I left Riot Games briefly four years ago to start a company in the NFT games space when Cryptokitties had first launched. It was, unfortunately, the wrong timing for us as consumers or investor interests were not strong back then, especially after the market bottomed out in 2018. That said, the most significant signal for us has been around products like &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; and &#8220;NBA Top Shot&#8221; that we can onboard non-crypto users onto the platform in the past year.</p>
<p>In addition, crypto-native products like BAYC and Punks have been driving more mainstream awareness. The 2.3 million-strong waitlist on Coinbase NFT marketplace and the deal flow we see from AAA and Web 2 game developers leaving to start companies in the space have all been fantastic signals.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many investments have you made to date?</strong></p>
<p>JY: We&#8217;ve made four investments in the space, which are still unannounced but live squarely within our thesis.</p>
<p><strong>TC: W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ill you be using the capital to buy tokens and equity? How are you thinking about these different modes of investment, and what are your LPs&#8217; expectations on this front?</span></strong></p>
<p>JY: Yes, and one of our first deals is a pure token deal. We evaluate these on a case-by-case basis, and our perspective is that it should be a thoughtful implementation for the type of startup or product that the founder should try to build. We&#8217;ve told our LPs that Web 3 and tokens will be a significant part of the fund given the strong convergence between gaming and Web 3, and it&#8217;s one of the reasons why they are excited to be investing in Patron.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: Do you think there is any particular advantage to being based in Los Angeles, given what you are funding?</span></strong></p>
<p>JY: Yes, there is a strong intersection of arts, creatives, gaming, entertainment, and crypto in LA right now. That said, we&#8217;re a virtual native firm, and while we will have a presence in LA and SV, our coverage will be international, and we expect around half of our deals to come outside of the US.</p>
<p>I recently moved back to LA after spending most of the prior decade living in Berlin, and both Brian and I spent time working on opportunities in East and Southeast Asia during our time at Riot. We believe you can build global consumer businesses from any of these geographies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: In terms of check sizes, how are you thinking about the minimum investment you&#8217;ll make &#8212; and where&#8217;s the upper boundary?</span></strong></p>
<p>JY: We are taking the high conviction and concentrated portfolio model &#8212; meaning we aim for quality over quantity and look to lead or co-lead opportunities at the seed stage. This means that we&#8217;ll [write anywhere] from $1 to $4 million checks for the stage that we play in, with the goal of having a high ownership % early as a lead investor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: Where are you scouting around for interesting projects?</span></strong></p>
<p>JY: Our LPs have been some of the best sources of our deal flow and ability to win competitive deals. Of course, Twitter and Discord will be natural places for us to connect with founders. We also expect non-traditional areas like Web 3 native communities such as DAOs or closely-knit angel syndicates &#8212; which we are part of &#8212; to be a vital source of our future deal flow.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[RevOps developed a software stack that enables users to build “the knobs and switches” that make automated quote-to-cash approvals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building internal sales agreement software, often known as quote-to-cash, is an expensive and time-consuming process that <a href="https://www.revops.io">RevOps</a> wants to take off the plate of fast-growing startups.</p>
<p>Today, RevOps announced an oversubscribed $5 million follow-on seed round led by Caffeinated Capital, Coatue Management and Gradient Ventures. Angel investors, including Twilio’s Jeff Lawson and executives from Airtable, GitHub and Twilio, also participated. The round brings the company’s total seed funding to $6.7 million.</p>
<p>Company founders Adam Ballai and John Solis saw this problem firsthand while working at Twilio and PullString, respectively. Ballai led the team that built Twilio’s billing software to automate receivables, payables, reconciliations and pricing engines, while also launching hundreds of new products annually. However, much of the deal management was still being done via spreadsheet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219509" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The essential revenue software stack&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/the-essential-revenue-software-stack/embed/#?secret=fyb53U0rZT" data-secret="fyb53U0rZT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After Twilio, Ballai moved on to Stripe, and again saw that familiar spreadsheet. After meeting Solis, the pair did a study on the time it took to put these pricing deals together.</p>
<p>They found out that not only did it take hours to go through the approval process, but that many salespeople were often new to their positions and hadn’t yet have nailed down all of the ins-and-outs, like terms and conditions. They noticed much of that sales workflow could be automated as the salespeople worked in their company’s CRM.</p>
<p>RevOps developed a software stack that enables users to build “the knobs and switches” that make automated approvals, Ballai told TechCrunch. Users can also create a pricing calculator that already has terms and conditions baked in, as well as the ability to customize the payment structure of the deal. And, by taking a headless approach to deal management, users can integrate RevOps with other parts of the operations stack as they work with engineering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, founded in 2018, is already working with startups like Onna, Ketch, Stytch, Loom and Retool.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re experiencing rapid growth as a company, and RevOps is helping us operationalize our sales infrastructure so we can feel confident about scaling quickly in 2022 and beyond,&#8221; said Jonathan Krangel, Retool’s head of sales, success strategy and operations, in a written statement. &#8220;It&#8217;s on track to become a critical part of our go-to-market stack, not just integrating with our CRM but also with other platforms we rely on like Slack, Stripe and DocuSign.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ballai plans to use the funding to grow the company, including building out its executive team and investing in R&amp;D for further integrations and programs targeted to early-stage startups.</p>
<p>The new funding comes as the company experienced a 146% growth in customers between 2020 and 2021. Many of them are looking to scale their sales representatives, in some cases by five times, he said.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding announcement, RevOps also recently launched its agreement automation integration into the HubSpot marketplace so that those using the CRM can quickly quote prices and create deals.</p>
<p>“We try to tackle the right product that is going to be most effective, and we have an amazing team that created a repository of features,” Ballai added. “Our goal is to help people have choice on how they have their quote-to-cash, a space that has not had innovation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/">Cockroach Labs</a>, the makers of CockroachDB, announced a public beta of a new serverless version of its SQL database today, giving developers an easier way to access database resources that scale up and down without having to explicitly define them.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Spencer Kimball says that the goal is to reduce complexity for developers, while providing a granular pricing structure. &#8220;[The serverless product] eliminates decision points upfront for the developer, which is quite important. But then the other thing that&#8217;s [a big advantage] is that you can be billed for fine-grained usage, so you only get charged for exactly what you use,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>The key thing is with a serverless approach to the database, is that it eliminates all of the capacity planning and everything associated with that for developers. That means they no longer have to predict the number of nodes or machine types that they will need to run their application Instead, they simply point to the Cockroach serverless database and it will provide the exact number of resources required to run the workload. That might not even be a full node if the workload doesn&#8217;t require that.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While this involves using shared resources, Kimball points out that when it comes to individual data, that will always be isolated on the back end. &#8220;The important part where your actual data is unencrypted is completely isolated to any particular developer or use case. So there is still isolation, but on the back end a lot of the data storage and retrieval organization tasks are being shared across a large number of machines and essentially what that allows us to do is efficiently use the resources,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says this ability to share resources efficiently has enabled the company to offer a generous free tier to developers to build their applications and not have to pay until it really begins to take off. What&#8217;s more, if you have bursty workloads, the resources will scale up and down for you automatically as needed, and you can dictate how much you&#8217;re willing to spend so the resources don&#8217;t outpace your ability to pay for them, an important point when you&#8217;re automating capacity in this way.</p>
<p>Kimball says the company doesn&#8217;t ask for a credit card until you cross the threshold of the free tier into a paid one, so you won&#8217;t be surprised with a bill if your application suddenly takes off. While he describes the free tier as generous, the exact details of these pricing tiers were still being worked out.</p>
<p>The serverless product is available in public beta today.</p>
<p>Cockroach Labs was founded in 2015 and has raised over $355 million, according to Crunchbase data.Its most recent funding was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-scores-160m-series-e-on-2b-valuation/">a $160 million Series E</a> at a $2 billion valuation in January.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market for corporate data privacy products is heating up, with <a href="https://www.skyflow.com/">Skyflow</a> announcing a $45 million Series B this morning, just a day after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/tripleblind-secures-24m-for-a-new-approach-to-enterprise-level-privacy-preserving-data-sharing/">TripleBlind announced a $24 million round</a>.</p>
<p>Skyflow, which TechCrunch has covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/skyflow-raises-7-5m-to-build-its-privacy-api-business/">since its early-2020 seed financing</a>, offers an API-delivered service that stores personally identifying information (PII), among other sensitive data for customers.</p>
<p>When we last discussed Skyflow, the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">just closed its $17.5 million Series A</a>, back in late 2020. It has since expanded its product mix to include a <a href="https://www.skyflow.com/post/introducing-the-fintech-data-privacy-vault">fintech-data-focused service</a> to help financial technology companies store credit card and other sensitive information. The company offers variations of its service for healthcare companies, as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Insight Partners led the new financing event, which included money from venture arms associated with AmEx and Santander. The startup has now raised $70 million, it said in a release.</p>
<p>Skyflow, like many API-delivered companies, wants to take a hard problem and abstract it into a single developer hook. Or, more simply, Skyflow wants to handle all the difficult privacy, encryption and data issues of storing PII and other forms of potentially radioactive data for its customers. (Skyflow uses a zero-trust vault built with polymorphic encryption, in case you are curious.)</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Skyflow <a href="https://twitter.com/anshublog">co-founder and CEO Anshu Sharma</a> emphasized that his company is working to ensure that it can handle data residency requirements and other related regulatory matters so that companies around the world can use its service without attracting the ire of any particular government.</p>
<p>The startup is seeing some success with its model thus far, claiming &#8220;8x growth&#8221; in the last nine months. From what base &#8212; and where that growth scales the company&#8217;s revenue run rate to &#8212; was not clear. Series B is roughly the point after which we demand harder metrics from startups; this will be Skyflow&#8217;s last round where we&#8217;ll chat about it without harder figures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has around 65 staff today and is looking to roughly double that by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Skyflow didn&#8217;t need to raise new funds when it closed its Series B. It has been less than a year since it raised its last round, after all. The company had capital still on its books from that prior investment &#8212; around $11 million, per Sharma. That data point matters because it implies that the company raised when it wasn&#8217;t forced to by a dwindling bank account, likely giving it leverage in its fundraising.</p>
<p>The company declined to share a valuation on the record, but given the $45 million raise, we expect that the company is now comfortably into the nine-figure range, though where it lands on that interval is not clear. PitchBook <a href="http://pitchbook.com">data indicates</a> that Skyflow was worth just under $100 million before it raised this round, so a valuation of $300 million to $500 million feels range-correct for its Series B, if we were the guessing type.</p>
<p>The issue of data privacy is not small. TripleBlind and Skyflow are not the only companies working on the matter, though they both have healthcare-facing products for sale. Certainly, with its new raise, Skyflow has the cash to make its case that it has built the right product for its target markets and thus will not find itself eventually subsumed into some larger technology shop.</p>
<p>Thinking one level up from the startups we&#8217;re discussing, companies are only accreting more data to themselves as time passes. If that weren&#8217;t the case, we wouldn&#8217;t see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">Databricks scaling its revenues and valuation as rapidly</a> as it is. More data, more risk. More risk, more demand for privacy-focused software. In secular terms, startups focused on solving the data storage and security issues are running downhill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch Research, a company creating workflow software for medical research, announced a $3.5 million seed</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">round on Tuesday. This round of funding will help Overwatch expand its presence into the US, and get its clinical trial management software into more labs and drugmakers’ hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch Research is behind software, also called Overwatch, designed to run the ins and outs of preclinical trials, from data collection to task tracking. The interface isn’t dissimilar to project management software you might see at a desk job (something like Trello, for instance), but its tools are designed for lab experiments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experimental data can be shared in a central location. Study data can be visualized instantly, and lab-specific organizational tools, like spreadsheets tracking lab animals’ status, are all held in one place. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch is CEO and co-founder Chris Armstrong’s approach to a problem he encountered during his career in prostate cancer drug development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seemed that we were still stuck in the same archaic method of managing studies,” Armstrong tells TechCrunch. “Everything was just spreadsheets and email trails. Things that in this day and age, I felt, should have been solved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interviews with over 250 biotech and pharma companies confirmed Armstrong’s intuition that the problem wasn’t only confined to his own experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch was founded in 2017 and has already raised a pre-seed round to build out its software’s capability. This current round, led by Frontline Ventures, will bring the company’s total amount of funding raised to $4.27 million total. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round also includes investment from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SV Angel, Techstart Ventures, and Michael Polansky (CEO of The Parker Group and Co-founder of Parker Institute for Cancer Immunology), as well as several investors already active in the intersection of data management software and clinical research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those investors include Zach Weinberg, the Co-founder of Flatiron Health (a major manager of real-world oncology data acquired by Roche in 2018), and Robert Fenton CEO of Qualio (a cloud-based data management system for life sciences companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch didn’t disclose its valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big problem Overwatch is trying to tackle, per Armstrong, is the “reproducibility crisis” in clinical research. In short, when scientists try to recreate experiments and see if they get the same results, they find that this doesn’t happen as much as it should. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reproducibility crisis is best known in the world of </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716"><span style="font-weight: 400;">psychology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it’s also well-documented in preclinical research. A </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002165#sec010"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major 2015 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated the irreproducibility rate in preclinical research could be about 50 percent, but </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002165"><span style="font-weight: 400;">might also range</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 18 percent to 89 percent (ironically, it estimating irreproducibility is an imperfect science). Either way, the study estimated that about $28 billion per year is spent each year on research that can’t be replicated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of people have tried to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">understand why the reproducibility crisis exists. Explanations run the gamut from scientific fraud, to poor study design, shady statistical practices, and refusal to share data openly. For its part, the 2015 paper suggests poor research materials, study design and faulty data analysis are three major causes of the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a lot of issues software alone to tackle, but Armstrong’s pitch is that Overwatch can at least make a dent in two of those three areas: study design and faulty data analysis. Overwatch’s approach to the problem is to smooth out the kinks in study design that can bias an experiment before it even starts. That’s done via a “study creation engine” that makes designing a study a matter of filling in the blanks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s basically a matter of a scientist going in and saying, ‘this is the type of model or type of study that I&#8217;m doing, and everything else is formatted as a consequence of that’,” Armstrong says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That formatting might suggest statistical tests that fit with certain study designs, and create systems designed to receive data in the proper format. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing to notice about Overwatch is the feel of the product. It’s a user-interface more like something you’d see on a personal computer, than in a lab. The design aspect, in addition to the clinical trials tools, is one way the company hopes to distinguish itself from existing research management software. Armstrong says it takes a one-hour demo to run through the product, and about five minutes on onboard new users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the major factors that’s lacking in software for life science is user experience as a whole. It seems like it&#8217;s about 10 to 15 years behind any other industry – scientists are still being forced to use horrible software that&#8217;s reminiscent of Windows XP, in terms of the interface,” says Armstrong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User-friendly software for scientists, once thought to be a niche area, has yielded returns for at least for one company: Benchling, another platform that can track experiments, internlink data, and manage R&amp;D workflows. This year, Benchling has raised about $350 million, and was valued at $4 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2021/04/14/biotech-rd-startup-benchling-hits-4-billion-valuation-as-the-company-starts-laying-the-groundwork-for-an-ipo/?sh=651b6ab03ac9">per </a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real test, though, is whether Overwatch can actually sell to biotech and pharma companies, who will need to be convinced to let a startup’s software run their precious preclinical research processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Overwatch has closed 20 deals with biotech companies in the United States and 15 in Europe. The startup has closed one five-year license deal with a “top ten pharma” company. Armstrong says the company is currently speaking with three other major pharmaceutical companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also has at least one major academic partner: The Institute for Cancer Research, London. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This funding round will be focused on expanding Overwatch’s client base, and building out a sales and marketing team. At this point, nearly all client acquisition has come from word of mouth, says Armstrong. The company is also planning a move to Boston, Massachusetts, to shore up its US presence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The switch in the business now is going to be much more sales and marketing focus,” Armstrong says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While investors continue to question whether crypto will swallow up more traditional VC opportunities down the road, it certainly appears that today the blockchain space is eating up the attention of Silicon Valley&#8217;s buzziest early investors.</p>
<p>Jesse Walden tells TechCrunch his crypto-centric VC firm <a href="https://variant.fund/">Variant</a> has raised a new $110 million early-stage fund, just over a year after the firm launched with a $22.5 million debut fund. Notably, Walden raised this fund alongside investor Li Jin who tells TechCrunch that she has joined Variant as its third general partner, merging her firm <a href="https://www.atelierventures.co/">Atelier Ventures</a> with Variant after deploying the entirety of her own creator economy-centric debut fund.</p>
<p>Jin and Walden overlapped during their time at Andreessen Horowitz, and, despite considerably different founding theses for their solo GP firms, found plenty of shared interest as they deployed their respective funds during the pandemic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220045" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We realized that there was quite a bit of overlap and convergence in the themes that we were investing against &#8212; we, the passion economy, and Jesse, the ownership economy,&#8221; Jin told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;We co-led several deals together, we co-invested in several deals together, and it just became quite clear that the two theses were two sides of the same coin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jin has cultivated an outsized presence in the tech investor community in the past couple of years, building up her reputation for spotting trends in the creator economy space. She spent nearly four years at Andreessen Horowitz helping the venture giant source deals, before leaving last summer to start Atelier Ventures. Jin officially launched the $13 million fund this past February though she had been writing checks throughout much of 2020. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Throughout 2021, Jin has grown more outspoken in her views that technologies born out of the blockchain, like NFTs, may be the key to the next generation of creator monetization tools.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I raised my fund really as a traditional consumer Web2 fund,&#8221; Jin told us. &#8220;As I started deploying and spending more time in the ecosystem, I realized that crypto actually offered this really powerful toolset for aligning incentives between platforms and their participants.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An upswing in cryptocurrency prices during the pandemic, teamed with surging interest in institutional NFT art sales and crypto gaming titles like NBA Top Shot and Axie Infinity made 2021 a massive year for crypto investment among the venture community. Andreessen Horowitz made waves earlier this year with the announcement of their largest vertical-specific fund yet, a $2.2 billion crypto fund. That growing stockpile of crypto-destined capital has made a16z impossible to ignore among smaller crypto funds looking to back the hottest companies.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Atelier has had significant crossover with investments led by a16z, particularly on the crypto side of things. In addition to backing more traditional creator platform plays like Substack, Atelier&#8217;s portfolio of investments also includes NFT startup Yield Guild Games, DAO platform Syndicate, protocol XMTP and crypto publishing platform Mirror. </span>Variant has participated alongside bother Atelier and Andreessen in a handful of deals, but has also backed competitors as the firm has dug deeper into the emerging worlds of NFTs, DeFi and DAOs. Variant&#8217;s portfolio includes decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, NFT platform Foundation and crypto wallet Phantom.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Variant brought on its second GP, Spencer Noon, who joined from a Miami-based crypto fund. Walden notes that many of the founders in the firm&#8217;s portfolio are also backers of the new Fund II itself &#8212; an effort Variant has made to leverage its network to stay competitive with bigger funds.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the space continues to expand, we obviously can&#8217;t hire 100 people in-house,&#8221; Walden tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And so we decided we need to take a network-driven approach, and in order to build a network that grows bigger, faster and adds more value to all stakeholders, we just looked to our thesis, which says that the way to grow bigger, faster is to give ownership to your users. So, who are our users? They&#8217;re the founders that we back and other builders in the space, and we have over 100 of them in the fund, meaning they own the fund itself.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you move around a city, you often end up farther away from some of your favorite restaurants and bakeries. <a href="http://www.shoplocale.com/">Locale</a> wants to keep you connected to the food you love, even if you live hours away now.</p>
<p>Locale, based in San Francisco, enables customers to order from dozens of businesses, including bakeries and restaurants, and get them delivered in one box for just a $5 delivery fee.</p>
<p>In addition to San Francisco, the company is now operating in Los Angeles. To keep up the pace, Locale secured a $2 million seed round led by Decent Capital, the family office of Tencent co-founder Jason Zeng. Other investors include Goodwater Capital and Esas Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219523" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>High school friends Jonathan Friedland and Chris Clark started Locale in 2020 and bootstrapped its way to hundreds of customers, and since being a part of Y Combinator’s three-month program, grew revenue by 100% year over year, Friedland said.</p>
<p>“We saw the crazy lines outside of popular bakeries, but when the pandemic hit, it wasn’t something you could do,” Friedland told TechCrunch. “We wondered why they weren’t on DoorDash, and the reason was two-fold: a bakery has to plan production days ahead of time, and every delivery sales takes away from retail customers. If a loaf of bread is $7, but you pay $15 for delivery, it doesn’t work for small-ticket items.”</p>
<p>Instead, their idea was to bundle businesses together and operate on a weekly model, so all of the bakeries and restaurants have one big order by Thursday for Saturday delivery rather than a bunch of separate orders. Locale employs hundreds of delivery contractors who don’t have to wait around for the food to be made, but go to Locale’s facility and pick up the deliveries that are on their route.</p>
<p>Their customers include more than 80 bakeries, restaurants and farms, enabling them to not only receive orders days ahead for better planning, but to expand their business’ delivery range to more than 100 miles, catering to loyal customers and reaching new customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Decent Capital’s Keyan Li, investment director, and Carley Phillips, investment analyst, told TechCrunch that the pandemic hit the restaurant industry, but as it moves to digitalization, both online and offline, Locale is providing a way for restaurants to find people.</p>
<p>“It is both an exciting and incremental market,” Li said. “People’s buying behaviors will stay, and they will do both food delivery online and also go into the shop. Locale is good for people who have left the metros, but still miss the city life and want to order something from their favorite place.”</p>
<p>And, Locale also gives smaller businesses a more even footing as large chain restaurants that already had similar infrastructure in place, Phillips said. She sees the trends going forward being more of a hybrid model of convenience and a seamless ordering experience as people move but still want to support local businesses.</p>
<p>The new capital comes as Locale expands farther into San Francisco and Marin County this month and adds a new “locale” in Los Angeles in November. The company broke even in its first 10 months of operation, doubled its revenue in the past three months and is already delivering more than 2,500 orders per month with an average order value of more than $105, Friedland said.</p>
<p>“We will continue to perfect the product, and as we expand, be able to deliver something that is just as top-notch a year down the line when we are in multiple locations,” he added.</p>
