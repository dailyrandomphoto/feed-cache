										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An old rule of thumb for building a startup is to find a group of professionals who use spreadsheets to do their work and then build an app to replace their spreadsheet usage. Presto, you have a startup, and perhaps even a new software category.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spreadsheet.com/">Spreadsheet.com</a>, however, is doing the opposite. Instead of turning spreadsheets into apps, the startup wants to put apps in your spreadsheets.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with the company when it reached out, disclosing that it raised $5.5 million last June. That round, wrought from the coffers of Spark Capital, First Round Capital and Firebolt Ventures, is now a pretty dated event. (<a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> details a valuation of around $22 million, post-money, for that funding event.) But what Spreadsheet.com is up to is neat. Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>People love spreadsheets</h2>
<p>Spreadsheets are a blend of database (structured data storage), calculator (averages, sums and all sorts of other goodies), and programming interface (functions and more). That hybrid feature set has kept traditional spreadsheet tools like Microsoft&#8217;s venerable Excel relevant amid a growing sea of applications.</p>
<p>Jokes abound concerning just how much spreadsheets hold up the world. This meme remains stuck in my mind, for example:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I got more <a href="https://t.co/t4ibeRWhIf">pic.twitter.com/t4ibeRWhIf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Amy Deep (@deepenergyy) <a href="https://twitter.com/deepenergyy/status/1417579667297509377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The movement to replace spreadsheets has yet to strike a lethal blow against their general usage. That reality forms part of Spreadsheet.com&#8217;s thesis. CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrobinson/">Matt Robinson</a> told TechCrunch that companies that break out parts of their workflow from spreadsheets into tailored apps wind up merely running both sets of software at the same time. So, Robinson and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/murali-mohan-4544134/">Murali Mohan</a> want to build a spreadsheet that helps companies avoid running more apps at one time than they must.</p>
<p>What does the company&#8217;s product do? Robinson answered that question with a question of his own: What do we currently do with spreadsheets? He offered up managing data, assigning tasks and linking to docs as examples. Using his startup&#8217;s service, he said, those are things that you can do <em>in</em> a spreadsheet, without having to use a separate app.</p>
<p>&#8220;We designed Spreadsheet.com to be the best of both worlds,&#8221; he explained in a follow-up Q&amp;A. &#8220;It works just like the traditional spreadsheet you already know, but with a whole new set of capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s software can display spreadsheets in various formats like a timeline-style perspective, something that should be familiar to Airtable fans. Robinson also emphasized that Spreadsheet.com can handle formulas that folks already know, adding that it will be able to handle if-then functions to send data to other apps or trigger emails. The CEO argued that his company is building first-party features instead of third-party plugins.</p>
<p>Notably, Spreadsheet.com is not generally available today, so if you haven&#8217;t heard of it, don&#8217;t consider yourself behind. The company told TechCrunch that it currently has a 16,000-person waiting list, which it plans to open to others on October 17, which, it turns out, is <a href="https://spreadsheet-day.com/">Spreadsheet Day</a>.</p>
<p>Asked how the company managed to build such a large waitlist while being in something akin to stealth mode, Robinson noted that <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432824/move-over-microsoft-and-google-meet-the-spreadsheet-of-the-future">Fast Company did cover the company back in 2019</a>. Not a bad result.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s ahead?</h3>
<p>When a startup flies out of the ether to announce a historical funding round, our first question is whether it&#8217;s about to fundraise again. TechCrunch doesn&#8217;t want to play patsy to a company&#8217;s next funding cycle. In this case, Robinson said that his startup has received inbound Series A interest and may raise in the next 12 months. Because that&#8217;s not tomorrow, I&#8217;m content to yammer about them in the interim.</p>
<p>Robinson indicated that Spreadsheet.com has around 2.5 years of capital in the bank and is not cash-constrained. If it does raise in 2021, then, it should be able to extract a pound of flesh in the form of a strong valuation; raise when you don&#8217;t need to, another startup rule of thumb states.</p>
<p>Why raise more capital inside the next year if the company doesn&#8217;t need cash? Robinson said that if his startup wants to scale its non-engineering roles &#8212; it is currently around 92% engineers by headcount &#8212; and wants to hire the best, and those folks won&#8217;t come cheap. And the CEO noted that some competing players have raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Competing won&#8217;t be cheap, either.</p>
<p>In the larger universe that Spreadsheet.com plays in, there are many competing companies. Airtable is the obvious mention; the unicorn has raised more than $600 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airtable/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>. Layer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/layer-gets-5-6m-to-make-joint-working-on-spreadsheets-less-hassle/">wants to make spreadsheets more collaboration-friendly</a>. Stacker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/stacker-raises-1-7m-to-help-nocoders-build-apps-from-spreadsheets/">wants to help no-code developers build apps from spreadsheets</a>, something akin to the antithesis of Spreadsheets.com. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/rows-formerly-dashdash-raises-16m-to-build-and-populate-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills/">does Rows</a>, which was known as dashdash earlier in life. Flowhaven <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/flowhaven-raises-16m-to-evolve-brand-licensing-management-beyond-emails-and-spreadsheets/">wants to do brand work outside of spreadsheets</a>, an example of the market trend that Spreadsheet.com wants to combat. And Fivetran wants to &#8220;bring spreadsheets into the modern age and make it easier for users to work with messy data and analyze large amounts of information,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/yc-backed-fivetran-launches-a-smart-online-spreadsheet-for-data-analysis/">per our own reporting</a>.</p>
<p>So, we now wait for Spreadsheet.com to open its doors and let the world get a better look at its tech. Are spreadsheets going apps, or are apps going spreadsheets? We&#8217;ll find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While markets grapple with the concept that the pandemic might not be entirely in the rear view mirror, investors are continuing to seek out investment opportunities outside public markets as they seek to diversify.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.withvincent.com/">Vincent</a>, an alternative asset aggregation hub, is hoping to capture some of that investor attention, allowing users to scour multiple types of assets across vertical-specific platforms and build up a diverse portfolio. Vincent CEO Slava Rubin says that more than 100 thousand people have used the platform since its launch in November, and that they now have 75 partner platforms integrated with the site.</p>
<p>Rubin, who previously co-founded the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, tells TechCrunch that Vincent has just closed a $6 million Series A led by LAUNCH with additional investment from 8VC and Digital Currency Group, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vincent is looking to approach both accredited and unaccredited investors and the platform is currently a pretty even split between the two, Rubin tells us. The platform&#8217;s partner offerings span several alternative asset classes including venture capital, real estate, debt, crypto, art and collectibles. Vincent makes money by facilitating discovery on its partner platforms and earning fees.</p>
<p>We covered the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/indiegogo-founder-launches-alternative-investments-discovery-platform-vincent/">company&#8217;s launch back in December</a> when the alternative asset market was taking off but would proceed to get hotter by the week. At the moment, venture capital and real estate deals make up more than half of the capital flowing through the platform while crypto investments have seemed to slide in popularity amid the broader market sell-off there. Unaccredited investors gaining access to VC deals via equity crowdfunding has been a big onramp for the platform, especially amid loosening restrictions which have made that fundraising method more popular among some founders.</p>
<p>Today, there are more $3.5 billion worth of searchable deals on the Vincent platform spread across supported platforms like WeFunder, Groundfloor, Republic, SharesPost, Rally Rd. and Otis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ecosystem of potential investors is bigger than it&#8217;s ever been,&#8221; Rubin tells us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stripe, with its $95 billion valuation, has been taking on the payment landscape with a whole platform approach, bringing in dozens of adjacent services to snag a wider and deeper set of customers that use these services by way of APIs. But in the world of so-called &#8220;embedded finance&#8221; there still remains a lot of room for smaller players to bring a more sophisticated approach to the business of building complicated financial processes that can be integrated by third parties to carry out their own businesses, and today one of them is announcing some funding to support its own mission.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dwolla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dwolla</a>, which provides an API that allows companies to build and facilitate fast payments, specifically with a focus on ACH (automated clearing house, or payments or transfers between banks or other financial institutions), has closed $21 million in funding, money that it will be using to continue building out the functionality of its service and specifically how it integrates and provides more of the responsiveness of card payments; hiring more talent; and starting the process of taking its rails to more markets outside of the U.S., most likely looking at Canada, the U.K. and Australia first.</p>
<p>Foundry Group is leading this round, with Park West Asset Management LLC, Union Square Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners, Firebrand Ventures and Next Level Ventures also participating. Jeremy Andrus, the CEO of Traeger, is also in the round as an individual investor. Other investors in the company include Andreesen Horowitz, High Alpha, Thrive Capital and Ludlow Ventures, and CEO Brady Harris in an interview said Dwolla would not be disclosing its valuation at the moment, but described it as &#8220;competitive in what’s happening with transactions and payments overall.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dwolla is based out of Des Moines, Iowa, and has been somewhat under the radar over the years. Since 2009 it had only raised just over $50 million before this round, a relatively modest amount for a fintech these days. This $21 million is its biggest-single round to date.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also been quietly seeing a lot of growth. In 2019, Dwolla processed $11 billion in gross payment volume over its platform. In 2020, that grew to $20 billion. This year it&#8217;s projected to be $30 billion, said Harris. Customers include both larger institutions and fintechs that want to incorporate faster and more efficient ACH-based payments into their own services without going through the grunt work of building them from the ground up, as well as businesses that want these also in their stack, with particular requirements around how they would like the white labelled and customised.</p>
<p>In total the company has some 3 million end users on its platform, which are channelled through some 500 customers using its services.  Those customers include real estate companies, educational institutions, and retailers and brands like <a href="https://www.goat.com/">GOAT</a>, <a href="https://home.ibotta.com/">Ibotta</a>, and <a href="https://rallyrd.com/">Rally</a>. Some of those customers are bigger than you might think. Harris noted to me that one of its customers using the Dwolla API in a white-label service is a fintech that sees some $9 trillion in gross transactions. (Dwolla is under NDA so cannot disclose the name.) That 3 million number, Harris said, is currently growing by 1.5 million each quarter, so it&#8217;s really seeing a lot of transaction traffic right now.</p>
<p>And $30 billion is, of course, just a small part of the payments pie, with transactions estimated to be valued at <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4534418/digital-payments-market-growth-trends-covid?utm_source=BW&amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;utm_code=6vpctq&amp;utm_campaign=1546532+-+Digital+Payments+Market+Report+2021%3a+Transaction+Value+was+%245.44+Trillion+in+2020+-+Global+Growth%2c+Trends%2c+COVID-19+Impact%2c+and+Forecasts+2021-2026&amp;utm_exec=chdo54prd">$5.4 trillion</a> in 2020 and projected to grow to <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4534418/digital-payments-market-growth-trends-covid?utm_source=BW&amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;utm_code=6vpctq&amp;utm_campaign=1546532+-+Digital+Payments+Market+Report+2021%3a+Transaction+Value+was+%245.44+Trillion+in+2020+-+Global+Growth%2c+Trends%2c+COVID-19+Impact%2c+and+Forecasts+2021-2026&amp;utm_exec=chdo54prd">$11.29 trillion</a> by 2026.</p>
<p>As Harris describes it, while there are a lot of options out there in the market today for companies that want to incorporate payments and specifically bank transfer-based payments into their stack, Dwolla&#8217;s unique approach is that it&#8217;s made this particular service more efficient, and easily customizable for those that want to add more features into the process. (That could include more timing, incorporating a blended approach including card payments or other payment methods, or something else altogether.)</p>
<p>&#8220;ACH products are something that a consumer can pull off the shelf at a payments company like Stripe, but this is about creating more customization,&#8221; said Harris. &#8220;We get a lot of people who are mid integration with another provider but it can’t do it what they would like it to, and so they come to us. We like to think of ourselves as programmatic and flexible.&#8221;</p>
<p>This focus and mastery of its space has helped Dwolla&#8217;s star rise not just with customers but also investors.</p>
<div>“<span class="il">Dwolla</span> continues to push the needle on innovating modern business payments. In pivoting to the B2B space, <span class="il">Dwolla</span> was positioned to provide a much-needed solution for business payments,&#8221; said <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Chris Moody, Partner, Foundry Group, in a statement. &#8220;</span>Now, <span class="il">Dwolla</span> is using that drive and innovation to completely transform the way today’s leading brands move money. Doubling-down on our investment was a no-brainer as we continue to see the company’s value in modernizing B2B payments and the importance of financial technology for companies to function at their peak.”</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Much has been made of the rise of the “creator economy” in the last year. With the Pandemic biting, millions flooded online, looking for a way to make money or promote themselves. The podcasting world has exploded, and with it platforms like Patreon, Clubhouse, and many others. But the thorny problem remains: Do you really own your audience as a creator, or does the platform own you? Companies like <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty Networks</a>, Circle and Tribe have tried to address this, giving creators greater control than social networks do over their audiences. Now another joins the fray.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.disciplemedia.com/">Disciple Media</a> bills itself as a SaaS platform to enable online creators to build community-led businesses. It’s now raised $6 million in funding in what it calls a ‘large Angel round&#8217;. It already claims to have garnered 2 million members and 500 communities since launching in 2018. Investors include Nick Mason (drummer in Pink Floyd), Sir Peter Michael (CEO of Cray Computers, founder of classic FM, Quantel and Cosworth Engineering), Rob Pierre (founder and CEO of Jellyfish), and Keith Morris (ex. chairman Sabre Insurance). It’s also announced a new Chairman, Eirik Svendsen, a expert in online marketplaces, SaaS and the publishing and media industry.</p>
<p>On its communities so far it has American country star and American Idol judge Luke Bryan, Gor Tex, and Body by Ciara. The platform is also available on iOS and Android and comes with community management tools, a CRM, and monetization options. The company claims its creators are now “earning millions in revenue each year.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Benji Vaughan, Founder and CEO said: “The scale and rapid growth of the creator economy is extraordinary, and today that growth is being driven by entrepreneurial creators looking to build independent businesses outside of Youtube and the social networks.”</p>
<p>Vaughan, a Techno DJ and artist-turned-entrepreneur, says he came up with the idea after building similar communities for clients. He says the data created on Disciple communities is owned entirely by the host who built the network, “removing third-party risk and allowing insights to be actioned immediately”.</p>
<p>He told me: “We are moving from a position of effectively having ‘gig economy workers for social networks’ to owners of businesses who use social networks for their needs, not the other way around. Therefore, these people are starting to leave social networks to build their businesses and using social networks as marketing channels, as the rest of the world does. Once that migration happens where they move away from social networks as their prime platform, they need a hub where their data is going to get pulled together, they have an audience, which we see as a community that connects with itself as much as they do with the host.”</p>
<p>He thinks the equivalent of Salesforce or HubSpot in the creative economy is going to be a community platform: “That&#8217;s where they&#8217;re going to aggregate all the information about their valuable audience or community engagement. So, we are looking to, over time, to build out something very akin to what HubSpot sites they have for tech companies or SaaS businesses: a complete package, a complete platform to manage your engagement with your users, grow your user base and then convert that into revenue.”</p>
<p>Rob Pierre, founder and CEO Jellyfish said: “Creating and engaging with your community digitally has never been more important. Disciple allows you to do both of those things with a fully functional, feature-rich platform which requires very little upfront capital expenditure. It also provides numerous options to monetize your community.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Customer success company <a href="https://vitally.io/">Vitally</a> raised $9 million in Series A funding from Andreessen Horowitz to continue developing its SaaS platform automating customer experiences.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Jamie Davidson got the idea for Vitally while he was at his previous company, Pathgather. As chief customer officer, he was looking at tools and “was underwhelmed” by the available tools to automate repetitive tasks. So he set out to build one.</p>
<p>The global pandemic thrust customer satisfaction into the limelight as brands realized that the same ways they were engaging with customers had to change now that everyone was making the majority of their purchases online. Previously, a customer service representative may have managed a dozen accounts, but nowadays with product-led growth, they tackle a portfolio of thousands of customers, Davidson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New York-based Vitally, founded in 2017, unifies all of that customer data into one place and flows it through an engine to provide engagement insights, like what help customers need, which ones are at risk of churning and which to target for expanded revenue opportunities. Its software also provides automation to balance workflow and steer customer success teams to the tasks with the right customers so that they are engaging at the correct time.</p>
<p>Andreessen approached Davidson for the Series A, and he liked the alignment in customer success vision, he said. Including the new funding, Vitally raised a total of $10.6 million, which includes $1.2 million in September 2019.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Vitally was bringing in strong revenue growth, which enabled the company to focus on building its platform and hold off on fundraising.</p>
<p>“A Series A was certainly on our mind and road map, but we weren’t actively fundraising,” Davidson said. “However, we saw a great fit and great backing to help us grow. Tools have lagged in the customer success area and how to manage that. Andreessen can help us scale and grow with our customers as they manage the thousands of their customers.”</p>
<p>Davidson intends to use the new funding to scale Vitally’s team across the board and build out its marketing efforts to introduce the company to the market. He expects to grow to 30 by the end of the year to support the company’s annual revenue growth — averaging 3x — and customer acquisition. Vitally is already working with big customers like Segment, Productboard and Calendly.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Andreessen general partner David Ulevitch is joining the Vitally board. He saw an opportunity for the reimagining of how SaaS companies delivered customer success, he told TechCrunch via email.</p>
<p>Similar to Davidson, he thought that customer success teams were now instrumental to growing SaaS businesses, but technology lagged behind market need, especially with so many SaaS companies taking a self-serve or product-led approach that attracted more orders than legacy tools.</p>
<p>Before the firm met Vitally, it was hearing “rave reviews” from its customers, Ulevitch said.</p>
<p>“The feedback was overwhelmingly positive and affirmed the fact that Vitally simply had the best product on the market since it actually mapped to how businesses operated and interacted with customers, particularly businesses with a long-tail of paying customers,” he added. “The first dollar into a SaaS company is great, but it’s the renewal and expansion dollars that really set the winners apart from everyone else. Vitally is in the best position to help companies get that renewal, help their customers expand accounts and ultimately win the space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DNSFilter, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> startup that provides DNS protection to enterprises, has secured $30 million in Series A funding from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/insight-partners/">Insight Partners</a>.</p>
<p>DNSFilter, as its name suggests, offers DNS-based web content filtering and threat protection. Unlike the majority of its competitors, which includes the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/palo-alto-networks/">Palo Alto Networks</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/Webroot/">Webroot</a>, the startup uses proprietary AI technology to continuously scan billions of domains daily, identifying anomalies and potential vectors for malware, ransomware, phishing, and fraud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Most of our competitors either rent or lease a database from some third party,&#8221; Ken Carnesi, co-founder and CEO of DNSFilter tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We do that in-house, and it’s through artificial intelligence that’s scanning these pages in real-time.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The company, which counts the likes of Lenovo, Newegg, and Nvidia among its 14,000 customers, claims this industry-first technology catches threats an average of five days before competitors and is capable of identifying 76% of domain-based threats. By the end of 2021, DNSFilter says it will block more than 1.1 million threats daily.</p>
<p>DNSFilter has seen rapid growth over the past 12 months as a result of the mass shift to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/remote-work/">remote working</a> and the increase in cyber threats and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attacks that followed. The startup saw eightfold growth in customer activity, doubled its global headcount to just over 50 employees, and partnered with Canadian software house N-Able to push into the lucrative channel market. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“DNSFilter’s rapid growth and efficient customer acquisition are a testament to the benefits and ease of use compared to incumbents,” Thomas Krane, principal at Insight Partners, who has been appointed as a director on DNSFilter&#8217;s board. “The traditional model of top-down, hardware-centric network security is disappearing in favor of solutions that readily plug in at the device level and can cater to highly distributed workforces”</p>
<p>Prior to this latest funding round, which was also backed by Arthur Ventures (the lead investor in DNSFilter’s seed round), CrowdStrike co-founder and former chief technology officer  Dmitri Alperovitch also joined DNSFilter’s board of directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Carnesi said the addition of Alperovitch to the board will help the company get its technology into the hands of enterprise customers. &#8220;He’s helping us to shape the product to be a good fit for enterprise organizations, which is something that we’re doing as part of this round — shifting focus to be primarily mid-market and enterprise,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company also recently added former CrowdStrike vice president Jen Ayers as its chief operating officer. &#8220;She used to manage their entire managed threat hunting team, so she’s definitely coming on for the security side of things as we build out our domain intelligence team further,&#8221; Carnesi said.</p>
<p>With its newly-raised funds, DNSFilter will further expand its headcount, with plans to add more than 80 new employees globally over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot more that we can do for security via DNS, and we haven’t really started on that yet,” Carnesi said. “We plan to do things that people won’t believe were possible via DNS.”</p>
<p>The company, which acquired Web Shrinker in 2018, also expects there to be more acquisitions on the cards going forward. &#8220;There are some potential companies that we’d be looking to acquire to speed up our advancement in certain areas,&#8221; Carnesi said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1411/life-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than half</a> of the U.S. population has stayed away from considering life insurance because they believe it&#8217;s probably too expensive, and the most common way to buy it today is in person. A startup that&#8217;s built a platform that aims to break down those conventions and democratize the process by making life insurance (and the benefits of it) more accessible is today announcing significant funding to fuel its rapidly growing business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ethoslife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethos</a>, which uses more than 300,000 data points online to determine a person&#8217;s eligibility for life insurance policies, which are offered as either term or whole life packages starting at $8/month, has picked up $100 million from a single investor, SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Peter Colis, Ethos&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, said that the funding brings the startup&#8217;s valuation to over $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>This is a quick jump for the the company: it was only <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insurtech-leader-ethos-secures-200-million-investment-round-valuation-exceeds-2-billion-301288194.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two months ago</a> that Ethos picked up a $200 million equity round at a valuation of just over $2 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s now raised $400 million to date and has amassed a very illustrious group of backers. In addition to SoftBank they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/the-jay-z-backed-life-insurance-startup-ethos-has-raised-35-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> General Catalyst, Sequoia Capital; Accel; GV; Jay-Z&#8217;s Roc Nation; Glade Brook Capital Partners; <span class="xn-person">Will Smith</span> and <span class="xn-person">Robert Downey Jr</span>.</p>
<p>This latest injection of funding &#8212; which will be used to hire more people and continue to expand its product set into adjacent areas of insurance life critical illness coverage &#8212; was unsolicited, Colis said, but comes on the heels of very rapid growth.</p>
<p>Ethos &#8212; which is sold currently only in the U.S. across 49 states &#8212; has seen both revenues and user numbers grow by over 500% compared to a year ago, and it&#8217;s on track to issue some $20 billion in life insurance coverage this year. And it is approaching $100 million in annualized growth profit. Ethos itself is not yet profitable, Colis said.</p>
<p>There are a couple of trends going on that speak to a wide opportunity for Ethos at the moment.</p>
<p>The first of these is the current market climate: globally we are still battling the Covid-19 global health pandemic, and one impact of that &#8212; in particular given how Covid-19 has not spared any age group or demographic &#8212; has been more awareness of our mortality. That inevitably leads at least some part of the population to considering something like life insurance coverage that might not have thought about it previously.</p>
<p>However, Colis is a little skeptical on the lasting impact of that particular trend. &#8220;We saw an initial surge of demand in the Covid period, but then it regressed back to normal,&#8221; he said in an interview. Those who were more inclined to think about life insurance around Covid-19 might have come around to considering it regardless: it was being driven, he said, by those with pre-existing health conditions going into the pandemic.</p>
<p>That, interestingly, brings up the second trend, which goes beyond our present circumstances and Colis believes will have the more lasting impact.</p>
<p>While there have been a number of startups, and even incumbent providers, looking to rethink other areas of insurance such as car, health and property coverage, life insurance has been relatively untouched, especially in some markets like the U.S. Traditionally, someone taking out life insurance goes through a long vetting process, which is not all carried out online and can involve medical examinations and more, and yes, it can be expensive: the stereotype you might best know is that only wealthier people take out life insurance policies.</p>
<p>Much like companies in fintech who have rethought how loan applications (and payback terms) can be rethought and evaluated afresh using big data &#8212; pulling in a new range of information to form a picture of the applicant and the likelihood of default or not &#8212; Ethos is among the companies that is applying that same concept to a different problem. The end result is a much faster turnaround for applications, a considerably cheaper and more flexible offer (term life insurance lasts for only as long as a person pays for it to), and generally a lot more accessibility for everyone potentially interested. That pool of data is growing all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every month, we get more intelligent,&#8221; said Colis.</p>
<p>There is also the matter of what Ethos is actually selling. The company itself is not an insurance provider but an &#8220;insuretech&#8221; &#8212; similar to how neobanks use APIs to integrate banking services that have been built by others, which they then wrap with their own customer service, personalization and more &#8212; Ethos integrates with third-party insurance underwriters, providing customer service, more efficient onboarding (no in-person medical exams for example) and personalization (both in packages and pricing) around them. Given how staid and hard it is to get more traditional policies, it&#8217;s essentially meant completely open water for Ethos in terms of finding and securing new customers.</p>
<p>Ethos&#8217;s rise comes at a time when we are seeing other startups approaching and rethinking life insurance also in the U.S. and further afield. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/yulife-nabs-70m-at-a-346m-valuation-for-its-gamified-wellness-oriented-approach-to-life-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YuLife</a> in the UK raised a big round to further build out its own take on life insurance, which is to sell policies that are linked to an individual&#8217;s own health and wellness practices &#8212; the idea being that this will make you happier and give more reason to pay for a policy that otherwise feels like some dormant investment; but also that it could help you live longer (<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sproutt-launches-uses-data-and-ai-to-finally-reward-life-insurance-customers-who-live-healthy-300973985.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sproutt</a> is another also looking at how to emphasize the &#8220;life&#8221; aspect of life insurance). Others like  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/deadhappy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeadHappy</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/bima-nabs-30m-more-for-micro-health-and-life-insurance-aimed-at-emerging-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIMA</a> are, like Ethos, rethinking accessibility of life insurance for a wider set of demographics.</p>
<p>There are some signs that Ethos is catching on with its mission to expand that pool, not just grow business among the kind of users who might have already been considering and would have taken out life insurance policies. The startup said that more than 40% of its new policy holders in the first half of 2021 had incomes of $60,000 or less, and nearly 40% of new policy holders were under the age of 40. The professions of those customers also speak to that democratization: the top five occupations, it said were homemaker, insurance agent, business owner, teacher, and registered nurse.</p>
<p>That traction is likely one reason why SoftBank came knocking.</p>
<p>“Ethos is leveraging data and its vertically integrated tech stack to fundamentally transform life insurance in the U.S.,&#8221; said Munish Varma, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;Through a fast and user-friendly online application process, the company can accurately underwrite and insure a broad segment of customers quickly. We are excited to partner with Peter Colis and the exceptional team at Ethos.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo (which the company says is an extension of the Spanish word “valor,” meaning to add value), acquires merchants that operate their own brands and primarily sell on online marketplaces such as Amazon and Mercado Libre. The company targets brands that offer “category-leading products” and which it believes have “significant growth potential.” It also develops brands in-house to offer a broader selection of products to the end customer.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was founded in late 2020 and has since swelled to more than 100 employees throughout Latin America. It has also since completed “multiple” acquisitions of local brands operating across a variety of industries, such as beauty, fitness and home goods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California-based </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/presight-fund-two/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presight Capita</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">l and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kingsway-capital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kingsway Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of the United Kingdom co-led the round, which also included participation from existing backers such as Kaszek, Upper90 and FJ Labs. The company declined to break down how much equity it raised in its seed round, but including debt, Valoreo has secured $80 million since inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use the new capital mostly to continue acquiring e-commerce brands across Mexico, Brazil and Colombia as well as to do more hiring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its model differs from that of its U.S.-based competitors (such as Thrasio and Perch) in that it is tailored to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the specific needs of the Latin American market and is specifically focused on the Latin American end customer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo aims to help entrepreneurs who may lack the resources and access to capital to take their businesses to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its seed raise, co-founder and co-CEO Stefan Florea told TechCrunch that the company takes less than five weeks typically from its initial contact with a seller to a final payout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the acquired and developed brands are integrated into the company’s consolidated holding. By tapping its team of “specialists” in areas such as digital marketing and supply chain management, it claims to be able to help these brands “reach new heights” while giving the entrepreneurs behind the companies “an attractive exit,” or partial exit in some cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally Valoreo acquires the majority of the business, with the purchase price typically being a combination of an upfront cash payment and a profit share component so sellers can still earn money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hernan Kazah, co-founder and managing partner of Kaszek, said the firm doubled down on its investment in the startup after seeing its “impressive growth over the past few months.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo is not the only Latin American startup focused on this space. In April, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/merama-lands-160m-to-grow-e-commerce-product-business-in-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced it had raised $60 million in seed and Series A funding and secured $100 million in debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money was raised “at well over a $200 million valuation,” co-founder and CEO Sujay Tyle said at the time.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicle technology startup Argo AI and its backer and customer Ford plan to launch up to 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years starting with Miami and Austin.</p>
<p>The first Ford self-driving vehicles, which are equipped with Argo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology, will become available on Lyft&#8217;s app in Miami later this year. Ford and Argo have had a presence in Miami for years now and have an active fleet of test vehicles.</p>
<p>Austin will follow in next year with the remaining U.S. cities being added to the Lyft app in 2023 and beyond, according to Jody Kelman, who heads up Lyft’s Autonomous, the company self-driving deployment business unit. Argo currently tests in Detroit, Palo Alto, Pittsburgh and Washington D.C.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest deployment certainly that we&#8217;re doing and that I think anyone else is doing,&#8221; Kelman said. &#8220;One thousand cars across six markets is a  big leap forward in terms of scaled commercialization.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just about Argo and Ford jumping on the Lyft network. Lyft will also provide access to driving data from its entire network in exchange for a 2.5% stake in Argo AI, under terms of the agreement announced Wednesday. Lyft already captures driving data, which includes telemetry information such as hard-braking events and even collisions. Argo is most interested in two areas of data: safety information around human drivers on its app and more generally what trip movements look like across a city, Argo CEO Bryan Salesky told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will really help us hone and figure out where the demand is and what peak demand looks like, which helps us figure out where we need to map, where we need to go, where we need to operate,&#8221; Salesky said.  &#8220;It helps us spend our test resources wisely.&#8221;</p>
<p>For instance, the Lyft data should help Argo spot areas where public transit is plentiful and other neighborhoods where it&#8217;s less available or entirely absent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really want to take a holistic view of the demand picture using their data,&#8221; Salesky said. &#8220;That helps us really be precise about where to deploy in order to have the greater benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ford vehicles will be operated by Argo and include a human safety driver behind the wheel. Salesky did note that the vehicles will drive autonomously from pickup to drop-off point.</p>
<p>The agreement is an indication that Argo has made progress in its AV development and specifically its work with Ford. The automaker announced in February 2017 that it was investing $1 billion in Argo AI, which was not even six months old at the time. Since then, Argo has focused on developing the virtual driver system &#8212; all of the sensors, software and compute platform &#8212; as well as high-definition maps designed for Ford&#8217;s self-driving vehicles.</p>
<p>In July 2019, VW Group announced it was investing $2.6 billion in Argo. That deal, which was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/self-driving-startup-argo-ai-hits-7-5-billion-valuation/"> finalized last summer</a>, gives Ford and VW equal ownership stakes, which will be roughly 40% each over time. The remaining equity sits with Argo’s co-founders as well as employees. Argo’s board is comprised of two VW seats, two Ford seats and three Argo seats.</p>
<p>Lyft is also a beneficiary in the deal — and beyond that small equity stake. Lyft main goal is to become the go-to ride-hailing network and fleet management platform used by any and all commercial robotaxi services. Lyft already has partnerships with other AV developers, notably the $4 billion Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture known as Motional, as well as Waymo.</p>
<p>Motional vehicles are on the Lyft ride-hailing network in Las Vegas. All of the vehicles have human safety operators behind the wheel. The companies have an agreement deploy fully autonomous cars on the Lyft network in 2023.</p>
<p>Lyft&#8217;s intention was always to lock up the rest. Unclear with which companies might commercialize the tech first, Lyft also took on the expensive pursuit of developing autonomous vehicle technology internally through a division called Level 5. That self-driving division was acquired in April by Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">for $550 million</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the acquisition agreement, Woven Planet signed commercial agreements to use the Lyft platform and fleet data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s said on Wednesday it has acquired California-headquartered reading platform Epic for $500 million, the latest in a series of moves from India’s most valuable startup as it deepens its footprint in the U.S. market.</p>
<p>The deal involves both cash and stock and Epic founders &#8212; Kevin Donahue and Suren Markosian &#8212; will continue to run the business, they said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getepic.com/">Epic</a> operates an eponymous digital reading platform for kids aged 12 or younger. The platform, which has a presence across 90% of elementary schools in the U.S., has amassed over 2 million teachers and 50 million kids (up from 20 million last year).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Epic, which counts Evolution Media as an early backer, collects and analyzes real-time anonymized and aggregated data on how many children read a book, how deeply they engage with it and where their interest starts to wane. In a Netflix-esque move, the firm has also started to release several print versions of its own original titles.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in March that Byju’s was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/byjus-in-talks-to-acquire-us-based-reading-platform-epic/">talks to acquire Epic</a>. Donahue and Markosian are no strangers to Byju’s. They first met with Byju Raveendran, co-founder and chief executive of the eponymous Indian startup, four or five years ago, but conversations about an acquisition only began this year, they said.</p>
<p>Raveendran (pictured above) said in an interview that his son uses the app, which gave him the conviction to explore any opportunity with the startup more seriously.</p>
<p>“We started Epic about eight years ago with the goal of bringing books to every child. We thought through technology we can get kids excited about reading and we can remove any barrier between the child and book. We are now in almost every school in the U.S., reaching over 50 million kids and a billion books read,” said Markosian.</p>
<p>“It has been our personal passion to build this platform because we wanted our kids to read more, too. So when we got to this point, it really made sense for us to look at scaling globally and internationally. When we started to talk to Byju, we realized that we share a common passion for education and belief in technology helping solve this opportunity. Together with Byju, we can take Epic to the next level,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131700" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131700" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2131700 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="521" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=768,391 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=680,346 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epic-originals-1-1.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131700" class="wp-caption-text">Some original titles released by Epic. <strong>Image Credits</strong>: Epic</p></div></p>
<h3>U.S. expansion</h3>
<p>For Byju’s, the new product expands its current portfolio and brings expertise about a demographic of the U.S. that the startup has been looking for, said Raveendran. The addition of Epic to Byju’s offerings is “complimentary from a product standpoint as reading is a very powerful format for students to learn,” he said.</p>
<p>“The distribution they have will also help us offer more options to students in the U.S. and reach a demographic that we have also been working to serve. They understand this demographic very well,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Byju’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-to-expand-to-international-markets/">rebranded its international business as Byju’s Future School</a>, as part of which it is offering coding and math in synchronous and asynchronous formats to students and plans to add music, English, fine arts and science to the catalog. Raveendran said he hasn’t decided whether Epic will be rebranded, acknowledging that the California-headquartered startup has a strong brand awareness in the U.S.</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s, which <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/13/byjus-launches-disney-based-learning-app/">launched</a> a learning app featuring Disney characters in the U.S. earlier this month, now has three large offerings in the U.S. that Raveendran expects will generate $100 million each in revenue this year alone. &#8220;Our ambition is to make a global impact,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup plans to invest $1 billion in its North America business, he said. Byju&#8217;s also plans to bring Epic’s offering to India and other markets, he added.</p>
<h3>Acquisitions and fundraise</h3>
<p>Epic is the latest in a series of acquisitions by Byju’s. In the past two years, the startup has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/byjus-buys-osmo-for-120m/">acquired U.S.-based kids-focused “phygital” startup Osmo</a> (for $120 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">online coding platform WhiteHat Jr</a> (for $300 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">coaching centre chain Aakash</a> (for nearly $1 billion), and Indian edtech startups Toppr* and Gradeup*. (*Yet to be officially confirmed.)</p>
<p>“We have not done acquisitions not for the sake of doing it,” said Raveendran, who himself is a teacher, pointing to the growth and success of firms he has acquired post-acquisition and how these firms have been led by their original founding teams. “Our aspiration is very long-term. We work with the founders to help them turbo-charge their growth,” he said, adding that the startup is open to exploring more M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
<p>Byju’s, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">raised about $1.5 billion since the pandemic broke last year</a> and has attracted several high-profile investors including Blackstone, said the fundraise in recent years has helped the startup to acquire younger firms. He said the startup currently doesn’t plan to raise more external capital, but he didn’t rule out more fundraises in the next few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.fetchpackage.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fetch Package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a last-mile package delivery company for apartment communities, has raised $50 million in a Series C round of funding and closed on a $10 million venture debt facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Patton founded Fetch in May 2016 after being frustrated by having packages lost at the apartment community in which he was living. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I took the time to research how communities were handling packages. What I found was that some communities are receiving up to 300 to 400 packages a week and trying to manage that volume manually, adding a significant time burden on the team,” he told TechCrunch. “I knew there had to be a better way and that solution needed to be one that could easily handle the future of package delivery as e-commerce was gaining significant traction.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fetch launched its operations in Dallas in February of 2017 with the goal of solving “the package problem” for apartment communities. The startup, which later moved its headquarters to Austin, has seen impressive growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of 2017, the SaaS company was servicing approximately 2,000 apartments in the Dallas area. Over the next three years that number grew to almost 150,000 doors being serviced out of 25 warehouses in 15 markets, including Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Orlando, Portland, Phoenix, Arizona and Seattle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fetch currently has just over 200,000 doors, or around 700 communities, across the country under contract. It says it works with seven of the top 10 nationally recognized apartment management companies in the country, in addition to “a majority of the largest owners and developers.” Last December, it inked a national preferred vendor agreement with management giant Greystar. Fetch delivered about 3.5 million packages in 2020, and hit the 2.5 million mark for volume in June 2021. The company says it’s currently on track to deliver more than 8 million packages by the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company would not disclose hard revenue figures, Patton says it tripled its year-over-year ARR (annual recurring revenue) in 2020 and GAAP revenue grew 6x year-over-year. Over the last two years, Fetch has seen “record sales,” he added, and is on pace to surpass 300,000 units by year’s end. Austin-based Ocelot Capital led its Series C round, which also included participation from Greenpoint Partners, Alpaca VC and Rose Park Advisors. Existing backers Iron Gate Capital, Signal Peak Ventures, Venn Ventures, Pando Ventures and Seamless also put money in the round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the equity raise, Signature Bank provided the company with a $10 million venture debt facility. The latest financing brings Fetch’s total funding to more than $92 million, and triples its valuation from its </span><a href="https://www.fetchpackage.com/fetch-raises-18-million-in-series-b-funding-for-continued-expansion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$18 million Series B raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last August.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Townsend, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managing member at Ocelot Capital, believes that Fetch is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solving for a major bottleneck within the supply chain that is often overlooked.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expect e-commerce delivery volume to continue to grow for the foreseeable future and Fetch is the only scalable solution available to multifamily operators,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes Fetch stand out, in his view, is that the company can “efficiently” manage the fluctuations in package volume in ways that traditional parcel storage solutions cannot. It also provides apartment residents with the “unique convenience of on-demand doorstep delivery that aligns with the varied schedules of apartment dwellers,” Townsend added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All packages at Fetch’s client communities are sent to the company’s facilities using a unique code identifier. The company then coordinates scheduled, direct-to-door delivery with residents directly via its app in a time frame that it says “works best for their schedule.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This takes the property out of the package management business and provides residents with a convenient amenity,” Patton said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fetch works with a mix of W2 employees as well as 1099 contractors to fulfill their service. On the W2 side, Fetch has had a 50% increase in total employees since the middle of last year, with about 350 employees today. This is in addition to the “thousands” of independent contractors/gig economy workers who also serve as drivers in all their markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Fetch will use its new capital primarily to expand into new markets, with plans to launch in South Florida, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Nashville, Minneapolis and a “few other markets” over the next two quarters. Over the next 18 months, the company intends to launch around 20 new markets. The money will also go toward investing in its tech stack and operational infrastructure, Patton said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just as many other employee services have gone digital, so too is mental health. In the consumer space there are growing startups like <a href="https://www.equoogame.com/">Equoo</a>, but the race is now on for the employee.</p>
<p>And since telemedicine has gone digital and video-based, so too is mental health provision. A number of companies are already playing in this space, including Spill Chat, On Mind, Lyra Health, Modern Health, Ginger and TalkSpace For Business.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oliva.health/">Oliva’s</a> take on this is not to create a marketplace or pre-recorded videos, but to put trained professionals in front of employees to talk directly to them. And there is even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032713005120?via%3Dihub">science</a> to back it up. Indeed, some research suggests Psychotherapy via the internet <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130730091255.htm">is as good if not better</a> than face-to-face consultations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Oliva’s on-demand, professional-led mental healthcare for employees and managers has now attracted investment to the tune of a $2.2m pre-seed investment round, led by <a href="https://www.moonfire.com/">Moonfire Ventures</a>, the new seed-stage VC firm from Atomico co-founder Mattias Ljungman.</p>
<p>The UK and Spain-based startup has also attracted angel investment from tech executives from Amazon, Booking.com, DogBuddy, Typeform, Hotjar, TravelPerk, and more.</p>
<p>Oliva is founded by Javier Suarez, who previously co-founded TravelPerk, and Sançar Sahin, who previously led marketing teams at Hotjar and Typeform, so both are well blooded in startups.</p>
<p>Suarez says he was inspired to create a mental health startup after the rigors of TravelPerk: “Employees are a company&#8217;s greatest asset &#8211; the better they feel, the better your company performs. But organizations are not set up to support their employees’ mental health in and outside of the workplace, which creates a massive problem for teammates, managers, and the organization as a whole. We’ve launched Oliva to give employees access to comprehensive online mental healthcare and to help organizations overcome the related challenges—from attracting &amp; retaining talent and training managers to supporting remote workers.”</p>
<p>Privacy is addressed via the use of a secure and encrypted personal portal, where employees can chat with a care provider who matches them with a professional. They get  1-to-1 video therapy sessions from a range of mental health professionals, and can also track their progress. </p>
<p>The team has also attracted Dr. Sarah Bateup, who has spent over two decades teaching and training mental healthcare professionals, who is now Chief Clinical Officer.</p>
<p>She said: “Oliva improves the way mental healthcare is accessed, supported, and paid for, while also adding more ongoing oversight and accountability to the process. Our ambition is for Oliva to be viewed as a badge of quality and set a new standard for workplace mental healthcare.”</p>
<p>Mattias Ljungman, Founder at Moonfire Ventures, added: “Mental health has been an overlooked area of care and wellbeing, especially in the workplace. Oliva&#8217;s founders are the only team we’ve seen taking a holistic, impact-driven approach to supporting mental health. While employer-funded mental health is becoming a well-established model in the US, Oliva is the first to bring a truly comprehensive approach to UK and European businesses.”</p>
<p>Oliva platform is integrated with Slack, providing employees with mental health drop-in sessions, therapy courses, and dedicated training and support for managers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What with the planet collapsing and democracy under constant attack from all quarters &#8211; you know, just the usual &#8211; one or two members of the global population have, idly or not, wondered if the private sector might want to step up? I mean, as well as shooting billionaires into space. At the same time, even! Luckily, many businesses want to do better. But there are one or two hurdles. Incorporating “purpose” into their digital offering, such as donating to a non-profit at the end of a moving documentary, is harder than it looks. Businesses don’t have the capacity to build in donation software; they can’t continually verify and audit good causes; and processing donations is fraught with legal complications, compliance, and regulatory risk. What is to be done?</p>
<p> <a href="https://pennies.org.uk/">Pennies</a> is one organization that bills itself as the digital equivalent of the traditional charity collection box. However, perhaps what we need is… drum roll… an API?</p>
<p>Step forward <a href="https://poweredbypercent.com/">Percent</a>. Founded in 2017, Percent provides an API allowing firms to customers to donate to good causes, matching a donation made when making a payment, or rounding up a financial transaction, for instance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s now closed a $5M venture round led by Morpheus Ventures, allowing it to expand in the US, as well as its existing presence in the UK and Australia. The UK’s Nationwide Building Society &#8211; also an early investor and customer of the product &#8211; is a co-investor in the round.</p>
<p>The company says its API-first platform takes care of auditing and compliance processes to prevent fraud and money-laundering whilst also parsing tax-efficient disbursements of funds into 200 countries worldwide. It says 7 million non-profit causes have been added to the platform and it&#8217;s vetted the potential recipients of donations.</p>
<p>Henry Ludlam, Founder, and CEO of Percent, said: “Percent was founded to become the global API-first infrastructure behind all giving. This will be the foundation for a better, fairer future of capitalism in which every financial transaction has social and environmental good built into it.”</p>
<p>In an interview I asked him if the pandemic had accelerated the opportunity: “Because of COVID, suddenly now we have brands that are really desperate to build purpose into their business in a way that they just weren&#8217;t doing 18 months ago. It’s really been an amazing shift. We’ve just seen a huge shift in what consumers expect from businesses. Consumers expect businesses to build purpose into what they do now.”</p>
<p>He said that the product could be even built into &#8211; surprise! &#8211; streaming services: “Say you’ve seen a documentary. And at the end of the documentary, you feel particularly moved, like you watched a David Attenborough or something like that. You could then actually be able to quickly and easily build donations into the end of it. So using our API, it would pull up a list of nonprofits, so right there and then the customer could make a donation. We&#8217;re also working with a crypto platform where you can round down your transactions and donate to any nonprofit as well. There&#8217;s loads of really cool stuff we are working on which is coming out soon.”<br />
 <br />
Kristian Blaszczynski, Managing Partner of Morpheus Ventures, said: “With the events of the last several years, it has become more apparent that aligning brands with purpose is driving consumer behavior and spend. However, today, the process of donating to non-profits is incredibly archaic, manual, and inefficient… Percent’s API-first platform abstracts away all of these complexities and automates the processes, allowing businesses to align closer to their stakeholders and focus on their core business.”</p>
<p>Percent could well be pushing at an open door. Kantar Research says that only 22% of people could name a brand they thought was doing a good job addressing issues such as climate change, plastic waste, and water pollution. On the flip side, 95% of businesses <em>think</em> that “purpose” is at the heart of what they do. The disparity could not be more stark.</p>
<p>Is Percent the stripe for donations? We&#8217;re about to find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.yapily.com">Yapily</a> has raised a $51 million Series B funding round led by <a href="https://sapphireventures.com">Sapphire Ventures</a>. The company has been working on a single, unified open banking API for several European markets. Developers can leverage that programming interface to interact with third-party bank accounts directly from their own products.</p>
<p>“The core difference between us and most of the players in the space is our focus on the infrastructure,” founder and CEO Stefano Vaccino told me. Unlike Tink or TrueLayer, Yapily operates in the background. You never see a Yapily logo anywhere and the company provides no front-end interface.</p>
<p>Another difference is that Yapily focuses exclusively on API integrations. Due to recent regulatory changes in Europe (PSD2), banks now have to offer official APIs to integrate with third-party services. While some still don’t offer APIs, many of them are now complying with the rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By focusing on official APIs, Yapily can offer a snappier and more reliable experience. Other startups working on unified open banking APIs rely on a mix of official APIs, screen scraping and private APIs. Screen scraping can be particularly slow and private APIs sometimes stop working overnight.</p>
<p>When it comes to coverage, Yapily supports more than 1,500 banks across eight different countries. “We have between 90 and 99% coverage in the U.K., France, Spain, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Italy and the Netherlands,” Vaccino said. You can see the full list of banks on <a href="https://www.yapily.com/coverage/">this page</a>. According to Vaccino, only Tink has a similar level of coverage in Europe.</p>
<p>You can use Yapily’s API for several different purposes. For instance, the API lets you check the balance on a bank account, check the account holder name and fetch the last two years of transaction.</p>
<p>But the startup has also noticed that more and more customers rely on open banking to initiate payments from a bank account. Compared to card payments, account-to-account payments are cheaper. Cards also expire, leading to churn. Yapily’s API can be used for one-time payments, international payments, bulk payments and recurring payments.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand its commercial presence across Europe. In addition to the U.K., Germany and Italy, Yapily will hire new team members focused on France and Spain.</p>
<p>The startup will also build integrations with banks in new markets in Northern Europe and the Baltics — and then beyond Europe. “At the beginning of next year, we’re going to look at Latin America and especially Brazil,” Vaccino said. Brazilian banks already have a lot of open banking APIs.</p>
<p>Right now, Yapily has around 100 customers, such as American Express, QuickBooks, Bux, Vivid Money, Volt and Moneyfarm. By focusing on the infrastructure layer, other fintech startups are taking advantage of Yapily to build applications on top of the startup’s API. It&#8217;s an interesting go-to-market strategy and it seems to be working well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Expense management has long been a pain point for employees and accounting departments: for many, tracking and parsing how money is spent on behalf of a company is just too bogged down in legacy software ill-equipped to handle more modern demands. Today, a UK startup building solutions to bring the process into the 21st century is announcing a major round of funding to double down on its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.soldo.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soldo</a>, which provides a platform to issue employees with prepaid company cards that are linked through to an automated expense management system, has closed $180 million in funding. Soldo currently has some 26,000 customers, ranging from small medium-sized businesses, through to mid-market enterprises and up to large multinationals across 30 countries, with Mercedes Benz, GetYourGuide, Gymshark, Bauli, and Brooks Running among some of the more popular of them. Alongside that, by way of APIs, it also integrates <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">with the popular accounting packages used by organizations today &#8212;</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> NetSuite, QuickBooks, Zucchetti, and Xero, along with options to connect Soldo to more than 50 expense management platforms including Concur and Expensify.</span></p>
<p>The round, a Series C, is being led by Singapore&#8217;s Temasek, with Sunley House Capital, Advent International’s crossover fund, Citi Ventures, and previous backers Accel, Battery Ventures and Dawn Capital, also participating. Silicon Valley Bank also provided debt financing of an undisclosed amount.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>London-based Soldo also did not disclose its valuation is in a statement on this latest investment, but as a point of reference, when it started to raise this money, back in December, the company was valued at around $278 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/168373-90/company/profile#deal-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. In the event, Soldo said the round was oversubscribed on the back of strong growth for the company: spend volume on its platform has grown four-fold since its series B, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/07/soldo-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$61 million round in 2019</a>. (Note: Soldo&#8217;s main operations are in London, but it also has a small corporate HQ is in Dublin, as it picked up an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/fintexit/">e-money license</a> in Ireland in 2019, part of its Brexit hedging.)</p>
<p>More generally &#8212; and perhaps because many of us are spending more time away from the head office, or perhaps because some of us are finally getting out on the road again to meet people &#8212; expense management is getting a lot of attention at the moment. Just earlier this month, one of Soldo&#8217;s bigger competitors, Denmark&#8217;s Pleo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/pleo-raises-150m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-new-approach-to-managing-expenses-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $150 million at a $1.7 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>It is a massive market to play for: Europe’s addressable market for expense management runs at $170 billion, the company said.</p>
<p>The crux of the challenge that Soldo aims to fix is that expenses is usually a very fragmented, non-digitised business, and employees that rack up expenses are usually not accountants: that is to say, handling them correctly is not one of their core competencies. The expenses themselves, meanwhile, have evolved to cover a lot of different things, a by-product of everything becoming easier to buy online and also how we work today: they might include subscriptions, travel and entertainment, office supplies for your home office, and making purchases on behalf of your company for marketing campaigns or online advertising, and more.</p>
<p>When expenses are happening digitally, they are easier to track, but very often they are for services or goods being purchased IRL, and that is when the other issues arise: people often forget to get receipts, or lose them before they fill out their reports, or pay for things out of their own pocket, and more.</p>
<p>And on top of that, expenses are made on corporate cards, or by way of bank transfers. The former can be expensive and hard to control, while the latter has its own challenges: it&#8217;s a slow process and often requires multiple people to clear a payment.</p>
<p>Soldo&#8217;s approach to fixing this is to first of all make it easier to issue employees with cards, prepaid in order to control spend on them better. It then links the card to an app, which creates automatic prompts that pop up for you every time you make a purchase with a card, to be reminded to capture a receipt and upload it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soldo’s vision is manage the total spend across the breadth of a company, whether that be advertising, software subscriptions, travel and entertainment, vendor management or salaries across all payment methods. When we look at this way, expense management is only one of the many possible use cases and cards are only one of the many ways that a company might transfer money to suppliers,&#8221; Carlo Gualandri, CEO and founder of Soldo, told TechCrunch in an email. In contrast to competitors like Pleo, he noted &#8220;that we have a broader and more complete focus on managing all the possible needs of a company, way beyond travel and expenses. This is important because the value for the customer of using a spend management platform increases as a more significant share of company spend gets moved onto it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the company&#8217;s growth since being founded five years ago hit a big speed bump in the form of Covid-19. Its recovery from that is a testament to how it&#8217;s found a place even in the current market.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic did almost completely wipe out travel and expenses as a use case of companies’ spend – given limited numbers of workers were travelling, or expensing lunches, for example, in lockdown,&#8221; said Gualandri. &#8220;It was quite shocking to see all of Europe switch off, country by country, in the first weeks of March of last year as the lockdown kept people in their homes. And with that, a significant part of our financial services revenues also disappeared because business travel is the most common and widespread use of corporate cards.&#8221; But then, two things happened, he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of other company spend use cases grew significantly. We saw the global shift to ecommerce and the digitalisation of the finance department.  From supporting workers at home to other business activities there was a definite move toward online procurement and that requires a card for the payment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Also, many companies started distributing their products or services online and with that they shifted a large share of their spend toward online marketing, an example of a key spend which is normally paid for using cards.  So, there was definitely a case of certain spend categories going down and others going up and rapidly so. A number of pandemic related problems emerged that we realised we could solve.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Our experience in software and payments technology gives us deep insight and we are confident Soldo stands at the forefront of finance digitalisation,&#8221; said Simon Lambert, a director at Sunley House, Advent International’s crossover fund, said in a statement. &#8220;The company operates in a large and fast-growing market, and we are thrilled to partner with its outstanding management team as they seek to build Europe’s leading pay and spend automation platform.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.ut-ec.co.jp/english/">The University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners </a>(UTEC) is launching a new program to address a problem the venture capital fund says many deep-tech founders face. They may raise pre-seed capital from an incubator or accelerator program, but reach a funding gap before moving on to early-stage rounds. Without financial resources, it takes longer to commercialize their technology, no matter how promising.</p>
<p>UTEC, an independent venture fund associated with The University of Tokyo and other academic institutions, created the <a href="https://ufp.jp/en/">UTEC Founders Program</a> (UFP) to address that gap. It offers two tracks: equity, which invests up to $1 million with flexible terms, and grants, a non-dilutive donation of about $50,000 (or occasionally up to $100,000) awarded to recipients every six months.</p>
<p>UFP’s <a href="https://ufp.jp/en/apply/">applications</a> are open to deep-tech researchers and founders anywhere in the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>UTEC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/utec-one-of-asias-largest-deep-tech-investment-firms-launches-new-275m-fund/">launched a $275 million fund in May</a>, and typically writes first checks of about $1 million to $5 million. Its aggregated assets under management are about $780 million, which the firm says makes UTEC the largest venture capital fund in Japan for science and tech companies, and one of the largest deep-tech funds in Asia.</p>

<p>After getting feedback from deep-tech researchers and entrepreneurs, the fund’s partners realized that even though they might have developed potentially impactful tech, it might not be immediately ready for seed funding. Many teams would also benefit from swift funding to continue preparing their tech for commercialization, instead of waiting through a lengthy due diligence process.</p>
<p>In an email, UTEC principals and UFP leads Hiroaki Kobayashi and Kiran Mysore told TechCrunch, “Just like entrepreneurs who create new product offerings to cater to unmet market needs, we at UTEC endeavor to be more nimble and offer new investment products to serve science and technology researchers and entrepreneurs. UFP is UTEC’s attempt to channel over 15 years of deep-tech investing experience and learnings into an early-stage technology commercialization initiative.”</p>
<p>The equity track is primarily for seed and pre-Series A startups, and offers flexible investment terms like SAFE notes, KISS and J-KISS (the Japanese version of Keep It Simple Security), convertible notes and bonds, or common stocks. It accepts applications throughout the year, and successful candidates are contacted for a first interview within three days. Mysore said that the entire due diligence and investment committee process will be completed within four weeks of the first interview.</p>
<p>The grant track is aimed at pre-launch or early-stage startups, and the funds can be used for things like prototyping, testing the market and recruitment. Applications are opened every six months, with about five teams selected each time. The deadline for the first batch of applicants is July 31 and decisions will be made in September.</p>
<p>Deep-tech teams who participate in UFP also get access to UTEC’s network of more than 115 Japanese and global startups, academic institutions, government organizations and corporations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung just sent out invites for its next Unpacked event. There are those companies that like to sneak hints into their invites &#8212; and then there’s Samsung. The note leads with the big, bold words “Get ready to unfold” and features a pair of flat-colored objects that can reasonably be said to resemble the form factors of the Galaxy Z Fold and Flip, respectively.</p>
<p>In keeping with…the general state of the world over the past year-and-a-half, the event will be held virtually on Wednesday, August 11. Interestingly, the company is also opening up preorders on its “next flagship,” sights and specs unseen. Perks for early preorders include “12 free months of Samsung Care+, up to an extra $200 trade-in credit and a special pre-order offer.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/76CQYkwLD0Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But honestly, it’s generally best to wait until you actually see the thing and maybe even read a review or two.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack (so to speak) ahead of the event. First, I’m probably not alone in expecting that the company would focus its next big event on the upcoming Galaxy Watch. The big event at MWC was a bit of a dud (not unlike MWC itself), offering up more information on the upcoming wearable partnership with Google, in lieu of announcing any hardware.</p>
<p>As the company noted at the time, “The upcoming One UI Watch will debut at an upcoming Unpacked event later this summer, sporting the new UI, as well as the forthcoming joint Samsung/Google platform.”</p>
<p>It seems reasonably likely that this will be the event where that will occur, even if the new watch doesn’t get top billing. For one thing we’re running out of summer. For another, rumors have the new Galaxy Watch set for a late-August (the 27<sup>th</sup>) release.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>All told, this could well be a pretty huge summer event for the company, bucking last year’s trend of meting out devices one by one at virtual invents. Word on the street is we could be seeing a Galaxy Watch 4, Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3, Galaxy S21 FE (“Fan Edition” &#8212; basically the latest version of the company’s budget flagship) and even the Galaxy Buds Pro, which will more directly take on the AirPods Pro (which are getting a bit long in the tooth).</p>
<p>What’s missing in all of this? No points if you said the Note. Samsung’s well-loved phablet is<a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/reminder-galaxy-note-21-not-coming-2021/"> reportedly not coming this year</a>, as chip shortages continue to plague the industry. That would be a big hit to Samsung’s six-month cycle, though we’ll see how that all plays out soon enough.</p>
<p>The August 11<sup>th</sup> event kicks off at 10AM ET / 7AM PT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla will allow other electric vehicles to access its global network of chargers later this year, CEO Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday. The comment follows years of chatter by Musk that signaled the company was amenable to the idea.</p>
<p>Until now, there have never been any details about how or when the company would open up its Supercharger network of 25,000 chargers. Details are still slim. For instance, it&#8217;s unclear where it would initially open up, which automakers have reached agreements with Tesla and whether Tesla owners would get priority. However, Musk did finally attach a timeline of sorts by noting this would kick off before the end of 2021.</p>
<p>He later added in another tweet that its network would eventually be open to other EVs in every country that it has chargers. Tesla Superchargers are located in North America, Asia and Europe as well as Middle Eastern countries UAE and Israel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. </p>
<p>It’s one fairly slim connector for both low &amp; high power charging. </p>
<p>That said, we’re making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1417593502351826946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk has talked about either sharing the technology behind his Tesla Superchargers or opening them up for use to other EVs for years now. Way back in 2014, Musk said he&#8217;d be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/09/tesla-wants-to-open-its-supercharger-standard-to-other-electric-car-makers/">willing to open up the designs</a> in order to build a standard that can be used interchangeably across the industry. This would allow competing electric car models to charge up at the Supercharger network.</p>
<p>He has mentioned some version of this at various events and during earnings calls ever since. In 2018, Musk said in response to a question during an earnings call that the Supercharger network is not a walled garden, a reference meant to express that it is not designed to prevent other EVs from using it. However, it should be noted that Superchargers are not compatible to other EVs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always said that we&#8217;re &#8212; this is not intended to be a walled garden, and we&#8217;re happy to support other automakers and let them use our Supercharger stations,&#8221; Musk said in 2018. &#8220;They would just need to pay the share of the cost proportionate to their vehicle usage. And they would need to be able to accept our charge rate or at least &#8212; and our connector, at least have an adaptor to our connector. So this is something we&#8217;re very open to, but so far none of the other car makers have wanted to do this. But it&#8217;s like not because of opposition from us. This is not a walled garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two common connectors used for rapid charging are Combined Charging System (CCS) or CHAdeMO. CCS, a direct current connector that is an open international standard that in recent years has gained popularity in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Tesla has its own connector, which means automakers would have to provide or sell an adapter to owners of its EVs to access the Supercharger network. It&#8217;s a different story in Europe. Tesla uses the CCS direct current connector in Europe, making this the most likely region for Tesla to open up first.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is giving its users a tiny bit more power to see what they want — and not see what they <em>don&#8217;t</em> want — in its content discovery hub. The company introduced a new toggle called &#8220;Sensitive Content Control&#8221; on Tuesday that allows anyone to screen posts that it thinks could be offensive, hiding them from the Explore tab.</p>
<p>The new feature appears in the settings menu and lets users choose to either allow more content that could be &#8220;upsetting or offensive,&#8221; limit that content or &#8220;limit even more.&#8221; The phrasing is kind of weird but it acknowledges that the company&#8217;s moderation efforts aren&#8217;t perfect, and that&#8217;s realistic at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can think of sensitive content as posts that don’t necessarily break our rules, but could potentially be upsetting to some people – such as posts that may be sexually suggestive or violent,&#8221; Instagram explained in the <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-sensitive-content-control">announcement</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch asked the company to expand on what kinds of posts are screened out under each category and if human or algorithmic moderation determines what is sensitive, but did not receive a response.</p>
<p>We also asked if the company has any plans to create separate toggles for violence and sexual content, considering that a lot of people comfortable with the latter might be less inclined to see violence bubble up among the app&#8217;s makeup tutorials and influencer junkets.</p>
<p>On Instagram, &#8220;sensitive&#8221; content is a massive catch-all category for stuff it allows but doesn&#8217;t want to be seen as directly promoting. In its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/313829416281232">own guidelines on content it recommends</a>, Instagram states that sexually suggestive content like &#8220;pictures of people in see-through clothing&#8221; aren&#8217;t eligible for the Explore tab. Instagram&#8217;s definition of sensitive content also includes dangerous forms of content like &#8220;exaggerated health claims&#8221; and posts promoting weight loss supplements.</p>

<p>Instagram is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/arts/design/instagram-free-the-nipple.html">notorious</a> for over-policing content that the platform deems to be sexual. A campaign from Black plus-size model Nyome Nicholas-Williams <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/25/instagram-row-over-plus-size-model-forces-change-to-nudity-policy">successfully pressured the platform</a> into relaxing one of its overly restrictive nudity rules last year.</p>
<p>Instagram contextualized the new content controls as part of a new effort to give users more power to determine what shows up in their feed. &#8220;We believe people should be able to shape Instagram into the experience that they want,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, noting that recent changes like being able to disable comments also give users more choice.</p>
<p>While the company is giving users more control over its algorithm in some small ways, it&#8217;s also considering giving them less. Last month, Instagram<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/instagram-suggested-posts-test-topics/"> began testing algorithmic suggestions mixed into the main feed</a>, a design choice that would let the company inject the platform with even more of what it wants you to see.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 20, 2021. The markets have been active in the last few days, with stocks dropping yesterday before rebounding today. Cryptos have also been suffering from ups and downs. A bit like Jeff Bezos, though his were planned. More on that in a second. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">Bezos blasts off:</a> </strong>The billionaire space race reached its second stage today, as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos left the planet for a few minutes. There was a livestream, though the Blue Origin space company was a bit more salesy than I was comfortable with. Regardless, the humans went up and came down, and the rocket and everyone aboard survived. The crew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/bezos-and-crew-host-a-giddy-press-conference-after-blue-origins-inaugural-crewed-launch/">was pretty stoked about it all</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">European startups are thriving:</a> </strong>Of all the startup markets in the world, Europe’s is among the very hottest. And according to venture capitalists that TechCrunch spoke with, the pace of investing activity on the continent is not set to slow much in the back half of 2021. This year will set all-time records in the European startup market for capital raised.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/square-launches-business-bank-accounts/">Square builds a business bank:</a> </strong>What has lots of small-biz customers and big fintech aspirations? Well, a lot of tech companies, but also Square. The company has put together a business bank for its business customers. How long until Square is simply a bank for individuals and companies alike? A good rule of thumb for fintech: No matter where a startup <em>starts</em> in financial technology, it will end up doing all things. Or die trying.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Holy heck there were a lot of funding rounds announced today. TechCrunch covered a huge chunk of the total, so many that we can’t get to them all here. But after checking in on China, we have your speed-read all the same. Let’s go!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/"><strong>All about the Chinese startup scene:</strong></a> Are you a little behind on China’s technology regulatory crackdown? Don’t worry if so. Our own Rita Liao is on the case and has a brilliant roundup of what’s going on with Didi and other China-based companies that went public on the U.S. market. The gist is that data may not be the new oil, as some liked to say a few years back, but data is proving to be a geopolitical flashpoint. As it turns out, the Europeans were early on this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the venture capital rundown, in brief format to allow for the inclusion of more items:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/rxall-grabs-3-15m-to-scale-its-drug-checking-and-counterfeiting-tech-across-africa/"><strong>Taking on counterfeit drugs in Africa:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s what RxAll is doing, and it has landed $3.15 million to pursue its vision. Launched in 2016, the company wants to combat fake drugs and the health problems that they cause.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/chargepoint-to-buy-european-charging-software-startup-for-295m/">Charging consolidation:</a> </strong>TechCrunch covered the deal between ChargePoint and the frustratingly punctuated has·to·be, in which the first company spent $295 million to buy the latter. Our read is the deal will allow ChargePoint “a boost in its pursuit to gain market share beyond North America” in the EV charging market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/titan-valued-at-450m-as-a16z-leads-58m-series-b/"><strong>Titan raises $58M to bring active wealth management to the masses:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If Robinhood did a good job making retail investing open to the masses by cutting fees to zero, Titan wants to pull a similar trick with the active-management world of wealth management. The company raised a $12.5 million Series A earlier this year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/little-spoon-scoops-up-44m-to-grow-its-childrens-nutrition-delivery-service/"><strong>$44M for Little Spoon’s baby food mission:</strong></a> Feeding children is a daily challenge. Finding good things for them to eat that they will actually consume is even harder. Little Spoon wants to solve the matter by helping parents of young kids subscribe to D2C baby foods while also selling vitamins and the like.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/path-robotics-raises-another-100m/"><strong>Path Robotics raises (again):</strong></a> The Ohio-based Path Robotics is back at the fundraising well this week, picking up a $100 million Series C. The round comes after the startup raised a $56 million Series B in May. What does it do? Welding robots!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/capchase-raises-280m-to-scale-its-financing-platform-for-subscription-businesses/"><strong>More money raised to buy SaaS revenue:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Capchase has put together a $280 million round of funding (debt and equity) to grow its business of buying future software revenues for present-day cash. It’s a big market that Pipe also plays in.</li>
</ul>
<p>To close out our startup and venture capital news, some updates on venture capitalists that want to fund startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/hyper-is-a-new-fund-that-offers-300k-checks-and-promises-of-a-media-slingshot-for-founders/"><strong>Hyper’s $60M concept:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Part venture firm, part venture-funded media group, the Product Hunt sister company is looking to put capital and connections to work. TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino has the details.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/pillar-vc-closes-192m-for-two-funds-targeting-saas-crypto-biotech-manufacturing/"><strong>New Boston funds:</strong></a> Pillar VC has raised new capital in two chunks, including $169 million for its Pillar III capital pool and a $23 million second fund. The VC firm intends to invest broadly, including into SaaS, hardware and other categories. The investing group is perhaps best known for buying <em>common</em> stock in companies it backs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the operators out there, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/marketing-cube-founder-maya-moufareks-lessons-for-customer-focused-startups/">TechCrunch has a chat</a> with Maya Moufarek, the founder of Marketing Cube, who spent more than 15 years working for companies like Google and American Express before launching her own growth consultancy about startup marketing. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>How we built an AI unicorn in 6 years</h2>
<p>Few startups go to market with the exact product their founders first envisioned.</p>
<p>Today, Tractable is known for developing tech that allows drivers to upload photos of their vehicles after a collision so its AI can assess the damage. Its first paying customer, however, used Tractable to inspect plastic pipe welds.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, that customer also fired them just as the founders were raising their first round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We struck gold with car insurance,&#8221; says co-founder Alex Dalyac, as it was &#8220;a huge and inefficient market in desperate need of modernization.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an Extra Crunch guest post, he shares several takeaways from the last six years spent scaling a unicorn that have value founders of all stripes. Step one?</p>
<p>&#8220;Search for complementary co-founders who will become your best friends,&#8221; advises Dalyac.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/facebook-onboards-another-31-newsletter-writers-on-bulletin/">Facebook is really doing the newsletter thing:</a></strong> The newsletter push is not slowing down, with Facebook’s Bulletin service bringing on 31 new writers. That’s a pretty big haul. Of course, Facebook is using the service as a way to drive Facebook Pay usage, among other goals. But as a writer, seeing major companies argue over my professional cohort is certainly a turn of the tables.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/venmo-removes-its-global-public-feed-in-a-significant-app-redesign/">Venmo admits that its default-public feed was bad:</a></strong> Ah, the public Venmo activity feed. It never made sense, but Venmo stuck to it through thick and thin until now. Now you will merely see a more friend-focused feed. Progress!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/youtubes-newest-monetization-tool-lets-viewers-tip-creators-for-their-uploads/">YouTube embraces tips:</a> </strong>Want to tip a YouTube creator for their work? You will be able to thanks to a new feature on the social video service called Super Thanks. It’s a one-time tip of between $2 and $50. Hopefully this helps musical groups that use the platform for distribution.</li>
