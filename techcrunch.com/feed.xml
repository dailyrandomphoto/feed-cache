										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thomabravo.com/">Thoma Bravo</a> must really like <a href="https://www.flexera.com/">Flexera</a>, an IT asset management company out of Chicago. The private equity firm bought the company for the second time today. Sources told TechCrunch the price was $2.85 billion.</p>
<p>Technically, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/thoma-bravo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="thoma-bravo">Thoma Bravo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is getting a majority stake in the company, buying it from previous owners TA Associates and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board. The firm <a href="https://www.revenera.com/about-us/press-center/thoma-bravo-completes-acquisition-macrovision-software-business.html">originally bought Flexera in 2008</a> from Macrovision for just $200 million. It turned it around just three years later in 2011 for $1 billion profit, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2019/10/02/meet-wall-streets-best-dealmaker-new-billionaire-orlando-bravo/?sh=2ed3a34442ec">according to reports</a>.</p>
<p>While reports last year had the company&#8217;s investors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-06/flexera-owners-are-said-to-pursue-sale-for-as-much-as-3-billion">looking for $3 billion</a>, they didn&#8217;t quite reach that mark, but it&#8217;s still a hefty profit as the company continues to change hands, giving each of its owners a substantial return on investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At $2.85 billion, Thoma Bravo will have a bigger challenge on its hands to make that same kind of return, but it sees a company it liked before and it still likes it, especially the management team, which to some degree at least remains intact.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Jim [Ryan] and his team have positioned <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flexera-software" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flexera-software">Flexera <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for sustained growth by focusing on the strategic challenges enterprises face with complex IT infrastructures,&#8221; Seth Boro, managing partner at Thoma Bravo said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ryan was pleased to see the company&#8217;s value continue to rise and to connect once again with Thoma Bravo. &#8220;This is a resounding vote of confidence in the growth Flexera has shown and the strategic initiatives we’ve undertaken to address the exponential challenges faced by organizations today,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2008 and has bought 12 companies along the way including five in the last couple of years, according to Crunchbase data. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next subject to regulatory approvals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Decentralized exchange protocols that allow crypto traders and investors to trade across different blockсhains have been in development for a while. A significant new development now comes with the launch of the ‘Testnet’ from <a href="https://injectiveprotocol.com/">Injective Protocol</a>. Injective has been backed by Binance, one of the biggest centralized exchanges in the Crypto world.</p>
<p>Injective Protocol is one of the first universal ‘DeFi’ (Decentralised Finance) protocols for cross-chain derivatives trading, so the launch of the testnet is an important milestone. Injective&#8217;s main competitors (centralized and decentralized exchanges) include CME Group, BitMEX, LedgerX and OKEx among others.</p>
<p>As well as being incubated by Binance Labs, Injective Protocol is also backed with $3M in funding from noted blockchain investors Pantera, Hashed, and others. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pantera-capital">Pantera</a> has had some successful exits including Kik, Bitstampt and Blockfolio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paul Veradittakit, Partner at Pantera Capital, said in a statement: “Injective’s Solstice testnet trades and feels like a state of the art derivatives exchange but it’s actually entirely supported by a fully decentralized infrastructure. With a 1 second blocktime, instant finality, and full EVM support, I’m confident that Injective will be able to pioneer the next wave of decentralized derivatives trading”</p>
<p>Injective&#8217;s team emerged from Stanford University and has been building and testing its platform privately since 2018, while validating it with several large largest funds, market makers, and institutional traders. Prior to Injective, Eric Chen, CEO and сo-founder, was working at hedge funds and worked in cryptographic research at a blockchain-focused fund.</p>
<p>Injective has been working towards a mainnet and has already announced partnerships with top blockchain companies such as Elrond, Ramp DeFi, Findora, and Frontier. Its layer-2 decentralized exchange protocol lets traders trade across Ethereum, Cosmos, and others, using  Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to facilitate cross-chain derivatives trading.</p>
<p>Centralized exchanges have been known for operational failures like front running, exit scams, and exchange hacks. At the same time, existing DEXs are still facing problems such as high transaction fees, low liquidity, inconvenient UI/UX, and slow speeds. But the trading volume of decentralized exchanges reportedly grew 70% in the middle of 2020, setting a recent record high of $1.52 billion. So there&#8217;s clearly an appetite for this approach.</p>
<p>The advantage of the approach used by Injective combines the advantages of decentralized exchanges: resistance to front running, scams, and hacks, with the speed, low transaction fees and no gas fees, only previously available with centralized platforms. Developers can also create their own derivatives and markets to trade.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin reaching an all-time-high at around $18k, the blockchain and crypto world is once again taking off.</p>
<p>Paypal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-bought-70-of-all-newly-mined-bitcoin-last-month-as-demand-rockets/">bought</a> up to 70% of all the newly mined bitcoin since the payments giant started offering cryptocurrency services.  And Guggenheim Funds Trust <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/guggenheim-fund-files-to-be-able-to-invest-up-to-almost-500m-in-bitcoin-through-gbtc">filed</a> an amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow its $5 billion Macro Opportunities Fund gain exposure to bitcoin by investing up to 10% of the fund’s net asset value in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube today announced it&#8217;s launching a new feature that will push commenters to reconsider their hateful and offensive remarks before posting. It will also begin testing a filter that allows creators to avoid having to read some of the hurtful comments on their channel that had been automatically held for review. The new features are meant to address long standing issues with the quality of comments on YouTube&#8217;s platform &#8212; a problem creators have complained about for years.</p>
<p>The company said it will also soon run a survey aimed at giving equal opportunity to creators, and whose data can help the company to better understand how some creators are more disproportionately impacted by online hate and harassment.</p>
<p>The new commenting feature, rolling out today, is a significant change for YouTube.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature appears when users are about to post something offensive in a video&#8217;s comments section and warns to &#8220;Keep comments respectful.&#8221; The message also tells users to check the site&#8217;s Community Guidelines if they&#8217;re not sure if a comment is appropriate.</p>
<p>The pop-up then nudges users to click the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button and revise their comment by making &#8220;Edit&#8221; the more prominent choice on the screen that appears.</p>
<p>The feature will not actually prevent a user from posting their comment, however. If they want to proceed, they can click the &#8220;Post Anyway&#8221; option instead.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082631" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082631" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082631" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?w=654" alt="" width="654" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=288,300 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=768,799 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=654,680 654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>The idea to put up roadblocks to give users time to pause and reconsider their words and actions is something several social media platforms are now doing.</p>
<p>For instance, Instagram last year launched a feature that would<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/instagram-anti-bullying-features/"> flag offensive comments</a> before they were posted. It later expanded that to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/instagram-to-now-flag-potentially-offensive-captions-in-addition-to-comments/"> include offensive captions</a>. Without providing data, the company claimed that these &#8220;nudges&#8221; were helping to reduce online bullying. Meanwhile, Twitter this year began to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/">push users to read the article linked in tweets</a> they were about to share before tweeting their reaction, and it stopped users from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">being able to retweet with just one click</a>.</p>
<p>These intentional pauses built into the social platforms are designed to stop people from reacting to content with heightened emotion and anger, and instead push users to be more thoughtful in what they say and do. User interface changes like this leverage basic human psychology to work, and may even prove effective in some percentage of cases. But platforms have been hesitant to roll out such tweaks as they can stifle user engagement.</p>
<p>In YouTube&#8217;s case, the company tells TechCrunch its systems will learn what&#8217;s considered offensive based on what content gets repeatedly flagged by users. Over time, this A.I.-powered system should be able to improve as the technology gets better at detection and the system itself is further developed.</p>
<p>Users on Android in the English language will see the new prompts first, starting today, Google says. The rollout will complete over the next couple of days. The company did not offer a timeframe for the feature&#8217;s support for other platforms and languages or even a firm commitment that such support would arrive in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, YouTube said it will also now begin testing a feature for creators who use YouTube Studio to manage their channel.</p>
<p>Creators will be able to try out a new filter that will hide the offensive and hurtful comments that have automatically been held for review.</p>
<p>Today, YouTube Studio users can choose to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/8829345?hl=en">auto-moderate potentially inappropriate comments,</a> which they can then manually review and choose to approve, hide or report. While it&#8217;s helpful to have these held, it&#8217;s still often difficult for creators to have to deal with these comments at all, as online trolls can be unbelievably cruel. With the filter, creators can avoid these potentially offensive comments entirely.</p>
<p>YouTube says it will also streamline its moderation tools to make the review process easier going forward.</p>
<p>The changes follow a year during which YouTube has been heavily criticized for not doing enough to combat <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/dennis-prager/youtube-removed-anti-trans-prageru-videos-violating-hate-speech-policies">hate speech</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations">misinformation</a> on its platform. The video platform&#8217;s &#8220;strikes&#8221; system for rule violations means that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/steve-bannons-show-pulled-off-twitter-and-youtube-over-calls-for-violence/"> videos may be individually removed</a> but a channel itself can stay online unless it collects enough strikes to be taken down. In practice, that means a YouTube creator could be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/steve-bannons-show-pulled-off-twitter-and-youtube-over-calls-for-violence/">as violent as</a> calling for government officials to be beheaded and and still continue to use YouTube. (By comparison, that same threat led to an account ban on Twitter.)</p>
<p>YouTube claims it has increased the number of daily hate speech comment removals by 46x since early 2019. And in the last quarter, of the more than 1.8 million channels it terminated for violating our policies, more than 54,000 terminations were for hate speech. That indicates a growing problem with online discourse that likely influenced these new measures. Some would argue the platforms have a responsibility to do even more, but it&#8217;s a difficult balance.</p>
<p>In a separate move, YouTube said it&#8217;s soon introducing a new survey that will ask creators to voluntarily share with YouTube information about their gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity. Using the data collected, YouTube claims it will be able to better examine how content from different communities is treated in search, discovery and monetization systems.</p>
<p>It will also look for possible patterns of hate, harassment, and discrimination that could affect some communities more than others, the company explains. And the survey will give creators to optionally participate in other initiatives that YouTube hosts, like #YouTubeBlack creator gatherings or FanFest, for instance.</p>
<p>This survey will begin in 2021 and was designed in consultation with input from creators and civil and human rights experts. YouTube says the collected data will not be used for advertising purposes, and creators will have the ability to opt-out and delete their information entirely at any time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Timnit Gebru, a leading researcher and voice in the field of ethics and artificial intelligence, says Google fired her for an email she sent to her direct reports.  According to Gebru, Google fired her because of an email she sent to subordinates that the company said reflected &#8220;behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gebru, the co-leader of Google Ethical Artificial Intelligence team, took to Twitter last night, shortly after the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-nlrb-labor-complaint/">Google alleging surveillance of employees and unlawful firing of employees</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was fired by <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDean?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JeffDean</a> for my email to Brain women and Allies. My corp account has been cutoff. So I&#39;ve been immediately fired :-)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) <a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334352694664957952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Gebru says no one explicitly told her she was fired, but that she received an email from one of her boss&#8217;s reports, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for making your conditions clear. We cannot agree to #1 and #2 as you are requesting. We respect your decision to leave Google as a result, and we are accepting your resignation.&#8221;</p>
<p>That email, according to Gebru, went on to say that &#8220;certain aspects of the email you sent last night to non-management employees in the brain group reflect behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I said here are the conditions. If you can meet them great I’ll take my name off this paper, if not then I can work on a last date. Then she sent an email to my direct reports saying she has accepted my resignation. So that is google for you folks. You saw it happen right here.</p>
<p>&mdash; Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) <a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334343577044979712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear what exactly was contained in the email. We&#8217;ve reached out to both Gebru and Google for comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/google-s-co-head-of-ethical-ai-says-she-was-fired-over-email">As Bloomberg reported</a>, Gebru has been outspoken about the lack of diversity in tech as well as the injustices Black people in tech face. According to Bloomberg, Gebru believes Google let her go to signal to other workers that it&#8217;s not ok to speak up.</p>
<p>Gebru is a leading voice in the field of ethics and artificial intelligence. In 2018, Gebru collaborated with Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, to study biases in facial recognition systems. <a href="http://gendershades.org/overview.html">They found</a> high disparities in error rates between lighter males and darker females, which led to the conclusion that those systems didn&#8217;t work well for people with darker skin.</p>
<p>Since Gebru&#8217;s announcement, she&#8217;s received an outpouring of support from those in the tech community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aws" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aws">AWS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> launched the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/global-startup/">APN Global Startup Program</a>, which is sort of AWS&#8217;s answer to an incubator for mid-to-late stage startups deeply involved with AWS technology. This year, the company wants to expand that offering, and today it announced some updates to the program at the Partner keynote today at AWS re:Invent.</p>
<p>While startups technically have to pay a $2500 fee if they are accepted to the program, AWS typically refunds that fee, says Doug Yeum, head of the Global Partner Organization at AWS &#8212; and they get a lot of benefits for being part of the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the APN has a $2,500 annual program fee, startups that are accepted into the invite-only APN Global Startup Program get that fee back, as well as free access to substantial additional resources both in terms of funding as well as exclusive program partner managers and co-sell specialists resources,&#8221; Yeum told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And those benefits are pretty substantial including access to a new &#8220;white glove program&#8221; that lets them work with a program manager with direct knowledge of AWS and who has experience working with startups. In addition, participants get access to an ISV program to work more directly with these vendors to increase sales and access to data exchange services to move third party data into the AWS cloud.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more, they can apply to the new AI/ML Acceleration program. As AWS describes it, &#8220;This includes up to $5,000 AWS credits to fund experiments on AWS services, enabling startups to explore AWS AI/ML tools that offer the best fit for them at low risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, they get partially free access to the AWS Marketplace, offsetting the normal marketplace listing fees for the first five offerings. Some participants will also get access to AWS sales to help use the power of the large company to drive a startup&#8217;s sales.</p>
<p>While you can apply to the program, the company also recruits individual startups that catch its attention. &#8220;We also proactively invite mid-to-late stage startups built on AWS that, based on market signals, are showing traction and offer interesting use cases for our mutual enterprise customers,&#8221; Yeum explained.</p>
<p>Among the companies currently involved in the program are HashiCorp, Logz.io and Snapdocs. Interested startups can apply on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/global-startup/">APN Global Startup website</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">VCs expect the companies they invest in to use data to improve their decision-making. So why aren’t they doing that when evaluating startup teams?</p>
<p>Sure, venture capital is a people business, and the power of gut feeling is real. But using an objective, data-backed process to evaluate teams — the same way we do when evaluating financial KPIs, product, timing and market opportunities — will help us make better investment decisions, avoid costly mistakes and discover opportunities we might have otherwise overlooked.</p>
<p>An objective assessment process will also help investors break free from patterns and back someone other than a white male for a change. Is looking at how we have always done things the best way to build for the future?</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0149206313493325">Sixty percent of startups fail because of problems with the team</a>. Instinct matters, but a team is too big a risk to leave to intuition. I will use myself as an example. I have founded two companies. I know what it takes to build a company and to achieve a successful exit. I like to think I can sense when someone has that special something and when a team has chemistry. But I am human. I am limited by bias and thought patterns; data is not.</p>
<p>You can (and should) take a scientific approach to evaluating a startup team. A “strong” team isn’t a vague concept — extensive research confirms what it takes to execute a vision. Despite what people expect, soft skills can be measured. VCVolt is a computerized selection model that analyzes the performance of companies and founding teams developed by Eva de Mol, Ph.D., my partner at CapitalT.</p>
<p>We use it to inform every investment decision we make and to demystify a common hurdle to entrepreneurial success. (The technology also evaluates the company, market opportunity, timing and other factors, but since most investors aren’t taking a structured, data-backed approach to analyzing teams, let’s focus on that.)</p>
<p>VCVolt allows us to reduce team risk early on in the selection and due diligence process, thereby reducing confirmation bias and fail rates, discovering more winning teams and driving higher returns.</p>
<p>I will keep this story brief for privacy reasons, but you will get the point. While testing the model, we advised another VC firm not to move forward with an investment based on the model’s findings. The firm moved forward anyway because they were in love with the deal, and everything the model predicted transpired. It was a big loss for the investors, and a reminder that hunch and gut feeling can be wrong — or at least blind you to some serious risk factors.</p>
<p>The platform uses a validated model that is based on more than five years of scientific research, data from more than 1,000 companies and input from world-class experts and scientists. Its predictive validity is noted in top-tier scientific journals and other publications, including<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/what-makes-a-successful-startup-team"> Harvard Business Review</a>. By asking the right questions — science-based questions validated by more than 80,000 datapoints — the platform analyzes the likelihood that a team will succeed. It considers:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/atlassian" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="atlassian">Atlassian <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/devops/new-devops-metrics">launching</a> an update to its ubiquitous Jira issue and project tracking service today &#8212; and specifically the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira Software Cloud</a> version &#8212; that brings a number of new features for visualizing and measuring how code moves through the development pipeline. With this, project managers and developers will be able to get deeper insights into the code teams are working on, for example, and where that code is in the deployment pipeline. Users of Jira Software Premium will also be able to track deployment frequency and cycle times right inside of the service now, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the quest to reach that near-mythical land of &#8216;insights,&#8217; many teams mistake consolidation for control. But the challenge is not the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">number</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of tools; it’s the way they&#8217;re integrated,&#8221; the Jira team writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;No single vendor will ever deliver all the products an agile software team needs, so the burden still lies on the team to manually connect the dots.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082569" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082569" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2082569" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png" alt="" width="1024" height="666" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png 3088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=1536,999 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=2048,1332 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cycle-Time-Deployment-Frequency.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2082569" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This update, Atlassian argues, helps those teams do just that. For most teams, Jira is already the central repository where each piece of work is documented in some form or another, after all. Some of that work happens in Atlassian tools, but most of it happens in the context of third-party services. The idea here is to pull all of this DevOps work together and provide more visibility and insights into the state of a company&#8217;s development pipeline.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are four different updates here. The first is &#8216;code in Jira,&#8217; which may sound like you can now code inside of Jira, but in reality, it&#8217;s about seeing which repos in B<span style="font-weight: 400;">itbucket, GitHub, GitLab or Git Integration for Jira are currently actively worked on. With the new &#8216;deployments&#8217; feature, users can now get a real-time view of all of their deployment information across CI/CD services like Bitbucket Pipelines, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Circle CI, Octopus Deploy and JFrog.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082570" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082570" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2082570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png" alt="" width="1024" height="666" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png 3088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png?resize=1536,999 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png?resize=2048,1332 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Code-in-Jira.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2082570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you’re a product manager looking to see which features have deployed to which environment or a team lead looking to understand the average time it takes for your team to go from idea to production within a certain project, you’ll find your answer in the Deployments in Jira tab,&#8221; the company explains.</p>
<p>The last two features, only available in the pricier and more enterprisey <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing">Jira Software Premium</a>, will soon provide more in-depth metrics about deployment frequency and cycle times. The idea here is simply to provide more metrics to help teams better understand trends and identify outliers in their processes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you want to make a machine learning system, you need data for it, but that data isn&#8217;t always easy to come by. <a href="https://mlcommons.org/">MLCommons</a> aims to unite disparate companies and organizations in the creation of large public databases for AI training, so that researchers around the world can work together at higher levels, and in doing so advance the nascent field as a whole. Its first effort, the People&#8217;s Speech dataset, is many times the size of others like it, and aims to be more diverse as well.</p>
<p>MLCommons is a new non-profit related to <a href="https://www.mlperf.org">MLPerf</a>, which has collected input from dozens of companies and academic institutions to create industry-standard benchmarks for machine learning performance. The endeavor has met with success, but in the process the team encountered a paucity of open datasets that everyone could use.</p>
<p>If you want to do an apples-to-apples comparison of a Google model to an Amazon model, or for that matter a UC Berkeley model, they really all ought to be using the same testing data. With computer vision one of the most widespread datasets is ImageNet, which is used and cited by all the most influential papers and experts. But there&#8217;s no such dataset for, say, speech to text accuracy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Benchmarks get people talking about progress in a sensible, measurable way. And it turns out that if the goal is the move the industry forward, we need datasets we can use — but lots of them are difficult to use for licensing reasons, or aren&#8217;t state of the art,&#8221; said MLCommons co-founder and executive director David Kanter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hHHo4RuDeB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/microsoft-amazon-back-a-socal-company-making-microchips-specifically-for-voice-based-apps/">Microsoft, Amazon back a SoCal company making microchips specifically for voice-based apps</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft, Amazon back a SoCal company making microchips specifically for voice-based apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/microsoft-amazon-back-a-socal-company-making-microchips-specifically-for-voice-based-apps/embed/#?secret=hHHo4RuDeB" data-secret="hHHo4RuDeB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Certainly the big companies have enormous voice datasets of their own, but they&#8217;re proprietary and perhaps legally restricted from being used by others. And there are public datasets, but with only a few thousand hours their utility is limited — to be competitive today one needs much more than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building large datasets is great because we can create benchmarks, but it also moves the needle forward for everyone. We can&#8217;t rival what&#8217;s available internally but we can go a long way towards bridging that gap,&#8221; Kanter said. MLCommons is the organization they formed to create and wrangle the required data and connections.</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Speech Dataset was assembled from a variety of sources, with about 65,000 of its hours coming from audiobooks in English, with the text aligned with the audio. Then there are 15,000 hours or so sourced from around the web, with different acoustics, speakers, and styles of speech (for example conversational instead of narrative). 1,500 hours of English audio were sourced from Wikipedia, and then 5,000 hours of synthetic speech of text generated by GPT-2 were mixed in (&#8220;A little bit of the snake eating its own tail,&#8221; joked Kanter). 59 languages in total are represented in some way, though as you can tell it is mostly English.</p>
<p>Although diversity is the goal — you can&#8217;t build a virtual assistant in Portuguese from English data — it&#8217;s also important to establish a baseline for what&#8217;s needed for present purposes. Is 10,000 hours sufficient to build a decent speech-to-text model? Or does having 20,000 available make development that much easier, faster, or effective? What if you want to be excellent at American English but also decent with Indian and English accents? How much of <em>those</em> do you need?</p>

<p>The general consensus with datasets is simply &#8220;the larger the better,&#8221; and the likes of Google and Apple are working with far more than a few thousand hours. Thus the 86,000 hours in this first iteration of the dataset. And it is definitely the first of many, with later versions due to branch out into more languages and accents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we verify we can deliver value, we&#8217;ll just release and be honest about the state it&#8217;s in,&#8221; explained Peter Mattson, another co-founder of MLCommons and currently head of Google&#8217;s Machine Learning Metrics Group. &#8220;We also need to learn how to quantify the idea of diversity. The industry wants this; we need more dataset construction expertise — there&#8217;s tremendous ROI for everybody in supporting such an organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization is also hoping to spur sharing and innovation in the field with MLCube, a new standard for passing models back and forth that takes some of the guesswork and labor out of that process. Although machine learning is one of the tech sector&#8217;s most active areas of research and development, taking your AI model and giving to someone else to test, run, or modify isn&#8217;t as simple as it ought to be.</p>
<p>Their idea with MLCube is a wrapper for models that describes and standardizes a few things, like dependencies, input and output format, hosting and so on. AI may be fundamentally complex, but it and the tools to create and test it are still in their infancy.</p>
<p>The dataset should be available now, or soon, from <a href="https://mlcommons.org/">MLCommons&#8217; website</a>, under the CC-BY license, allowing for commercial use; a few reference models trained on the set will also be released.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launching things to space doesn&#8217;t have to mean firing a large rocket vertically using massive amounts of rocket-fuel powered thrust – startup <a href="https://www.aevumspace.com">Aevum</a> breaks the mould in multiple ways, with an innovative launch vehicle design that combines uncrewed aircraft with horizontal take-off and landing capabilities, with a secondary stage that deploys at high altitude and can take small payloads the rest of the way to space.</p>
<p>Aevum&#8217;s model actually isn&#8217;t breaking much new ground in terms of its foundational technology, according to founder and CEO Jay Skylus, who I spoke to prior to today&#8217;s official unveiling of the startup&#8217;s Ravn X launch vehicle. Skylus, who previously worked for a range of space industry household names and startups including NASA, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boeing-7321" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boeing-7321">Boeing, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Moon Express and Firefly, told me that the startup has focused primarily on making the most of existing available technologies to create a mostly reusable, fully automated small payload orbital delivery system.</p>
<p>To his point, Ravn X doesn&#8217;t look too dissimilar from existing jet aircraft, and bears obvious resemblance to the Predator line of UAVs already in use for terrestrial uncrewed flight. The vehicle is 80 feet long, and has a 60-foot wingspan, with a total max weight of 55,000 lbs including payload. 70% of the system is fully reusable today, and Skylus says that the goal is to iterate on that to the point where 95% of the launch system will be reusable in the relatively near future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2082461" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082461" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2082461" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ravn-X-on-Taxi-FINAL-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082461" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aevum</p></div></p>
<p>Ravn X&#8217;s delivery system is design for rapid response delivery, and is able to get small satellites to orbit in as little as 180 minutes – with the capability of having it ready to fly and deliver another again fairly shortly after that. It uses traditional jet fuel, the same kind used on commercial airliners, and it can take off and land in &#8220;virtually any weather,&#8221; according to Skylus. It also takes off and lands on any 1-mile stretch of traditional aircraft runway, meaning it can theoretically use just about any active airport in the world as a launch and landing site.</p>
<p>One of they key defining differences of Aevum relative to other space launch startups is that what they&#8217;re presenting isn&#8217;t theoretical, or in development – the Ravn X already has paying customers, including over $1 billion in U.S. government contracts. It&#8217;s first mission is with the U.S. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">Space <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Force, the ASLON-45 small satellite launch mission (set for late 2021), and it also has a contract for 20 missions spanning 9 years with the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center.  Deliveries of Aevum&#8217;s production launch vehicles to its customers have already begun, in fact, Skylus says.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense has been actively pursuing space launch options that provide it with responsive, short turnaround launch capabilities for quite some time now. That&#8217;s the same goal that companies like Astra, which was originally looking to win the DARPA challenge for such systems (since expired) with its Rocket small launcher. Aevum&#8217;s system has the added advantage of being essentially fully compatible with existing airfield infrastructure – and also of not requiring that human pilots be involved or at risk at all, as they are with the superficially similar launch model espoused by Virgin Orbit.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HtCFZyc9wR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/astra-targets-december-for-next-orbital-launch-attempt/">Astra targets December for next orbital launch attempt</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Aevum isn&#8217;t just providing the Ravn X launcher, either; its goal is to handle end-to-end logistics for launch services, including payload transportation and integration, which are parts of the process that Skylus says are often overlooked or underserved by existing launch providers, and that many companies creating payloads also don&#8217;t realize are costly, complicated and time-consuming parts of actually delivering a working small satellite to orbit. The startup also isn&#8217;t &#8220;re-inventing the wheel&#8221; when it comes to its integration services – Skylus says they&#8217;re working with a range of existing partners who all already have proven experience doing this work but who haven&#8217;t previously had the motivation or the need to provide these kinds of services to the customers that Skylum sees coming online, both in the public and private sector.</p>
<p>The need isn&#8217;t for another <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Skylus says; rather, thanks to SpaceX, there&#8217;s a wealth of aerospace companies who previously worked almost exclusively with large government contracts and the one or two massive legacy rocket companies to put missions together. They&#8217;re now open to working with the greatly expanded market for orbital payloads, including small satellites that aim to provide cost-effective solutions in communications, environmental monitor, shipping and defense.</p>
<p>Aevum&#8217;s solution definitely sounds like it addresses a clear and present need, in a way that offers benefits in terms of risk profile, reusability, cost and flexibility. The company&#8217;s first active missions will obviously be watched closely, by potential customers and competitors alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced this morning Android phones will receive an update this winter that will bring some half-dozen new features to devices, including improvements to apps like Gboard, Google Play Books, Voice Access, Google Maps, Android Auto, and Nearby Share. The release is the latest in a series of update bundles that now allow Android devices to receive new features outside of the usual annual update cycle.</p>
<p>The bundles may not deliver Android&#8217;s latest flagship features, but they offer steady improvements on a more frequent basis.</p>
<p>One of the more fun bits in the winter update will include a change to &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/googles-gboard-introduces-emoji-kitchen-a-tool-to-mash-up-emojis-to-use-as-stickers/">Emoji Kitchen</a>,&#8221; the feature in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Gboard</a> keyboard app that lets users combine their favorite emoji to create new ones that can be shared as customized stickers. To date, users have remixed emoji over 3 billion times since the feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/googles-gboard-introduces-emoji-kitchen-a-tool-to-mash-up-emojis-to-use-as-stickers/">launched</a> earlier this year, Google says. Now, the option is being expanded. Instead of offering hundreds of design combinations, it will offer over 14,000. You&#8217;ll also be able to tap two emoji to see suggested combinations or double tap on one emoji to see other suggestions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2082533" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082533" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082533" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-10.46.00-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="283" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-10.46.00-AM.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-10.46.00-AM.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-10.46.00-AM.jpg?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-10.46.00-AM.jpg?resize=768,320 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-10.46.00-AM.jpg?resize=680,283 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-10.46.00-AM.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082533" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>This updated feature had been live in the Gboard <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.inputmethod.latin">beta</a> app, but will now roll out to Android 6.0 and above devices in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Another update will expand audiobook availability on Google Play Books. Now, Google will auto-generate narrations for books that don&#8217;t offer an audio version. The company says it worked with publishers in the U.S. and U.K. to add these auto-narrated books to Google Play Books. The feature is in beta but will roll out to all publishers in early 2021.</p>
<p>An accessibility feature that lets people use and navigate their phone with voice commands, Voice Access, will also be improved. The feature will soon leverage machine learning to understand interface labels on devices. This will allow users to refer to things like the &#8220;back&#8221; and &#8220;more&#8221; buttons, and many others by name when they are speaking.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.voiceaccess&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">new version of Voice Access</a>, now in beta, will be available to all devices worldwide running Android 6.0 or higher.</p>
<p>An update for Google Maps will add a new feature to one of people&#8217;s most-used apps.</p>
<p>In a new (perhaps Waze-inspired) &#8220;Go Tab,&#8221; users will be able to more quickly navigate to frequently visited places &#8212; like a school or grocery store, for example &#8212; with a tap. The app will allow users to see directions, live traffic trends, disruptions on the route, and gives an accurate ETA, without having to type in the actual address. Favorite places &#8212; or in the case of public transit users, specific routes &#8212; can be pinned in the Go Tab for easy access. Transit users will be able to see things like accurate departure and arrival times, alerts from the local transit agency, and an up-to-date ETA.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082531" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082531" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082531" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android_WinterSpotlight_GoTab_001.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android_WinterSpotlight_GoTab_001.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android_WinterSpotlight_GoTab_001.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android_WinterSpotlight_GoTab_001.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android_WinterSpotlight_GoTab_001.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android_WinterSpotlight_GoTab_001.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android_WinterSpotlight_GoTab_001.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android_WinterSpotlight_GoTab_001.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082531" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>One potentially helpful use case for this new feature would be to pin both a transit route and driving route to the same destination, then compare their respective ETAs to pick the faster option.</p>
<p>This feature is coming to both Google Maps on Android as well as iOS in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p><a href="http://android.com/auto">Android Auto</a> will expand to more countries over the next few months. Google initially said it would reach 36 countries, but then updated the announcement language as the timing of the rollout was pushed back. The company now isn&#8217;t saying how many countries will gain access in the months to follow or which ones, so you&#8217;ll need stay tuned for news on that front.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082530" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082530" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-12.13.57-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-12.13.57-PM.png 2112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-12.13.57-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-12.13.57-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-12.13.57-PM.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-12.13.57-PM.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-12.13.57-PM.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-12.13.57-PM.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-12.13.57-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082530" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The final change is to <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/nearby-share/">Nearby Share</a>, the proximity-based sharing feature that lets users share things like links, files, photos and and more even when they don&#8217;t have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection available. The feature, which is largely designed with emerging markets in mind, will now allow users to share apps from Google Play with people around them, too.</p>
<p>To do so, you&#8217;ll access a new &#8220;Share Apps&#8221; menu in &#8220;Manage Apps &amp; Games&#8221; in the Google Play app. This feature will roll out in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Some of these features will begin rolling out today, so you may receive them earlier than a timeframe of several &#8220;weeks,&#8221; but the progress of each update will vary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has always gone out of its way to build features for users with disabilities, and Voiceover on iOS is an invaluable tool for anyone with a vision impairment — assuming every element of the interface has been manually labeled. But the company just unveiled a brand new feature that uses machine learning to identify and label every button, slider, and tab automatically.</p>
<p>Screen Recognition, available now in iOS 14, is a computer vision system that has been trained on thousands of images of apps in use, learning what a button looks like, what icons mean, and so on. Such systems are very flexible — depending on the data you give them, they can become expert at spotting cats, facial expressions, or as in this case the different parts of a user interface.</p>
<p>The result is that in any app now, users can invoke the feature and a fraction of a second later every item on screen will be labeled. And by &#8220;every,&#8221; they mean <em>every</em> — after all, screen readers need to be aware of every thing that a sighted user would see and be able to interact with, from images (which iOS has been able to create one-sentence summaries of for some time) to common icons (home, back) and context-specific ones like &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; menus that appear just about everywhere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is not to make manual labeling obsolete — developers know best how to label their own apps, but updates, changing standards, and challenging situations (in-game interfaces, for instance) can lead to things not being as accessible as they could be.</p>

<p>I chatted with Chris Fleizach from Apple&#8217;s iOS accessibility engineering team, and Jeff Bigham from the AI/ML accessibility team, about the origin of this extremely helpful new feature. (It&#8217;s described in a paper due to be presented next year.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2082611" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg" alt="A phone showing a photo of two women smiling and voiceover describing the photo" width="328" height="326" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple-voiceover.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /></a>&#8220;We looked for areas where we can make inroads on accessibility, like image descriptions,&#8221; said Fleizach. &#8220;In iOS 13 we labeled icons automatically &#8211; Screen Recognition takes it another step forward. We can look at the pixels on screen and identify the hierarchy of objects you can interact with, and all of this happens on device within tenths of a second.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is not a new one, exactly; Bigham mentioned a screen reader, Outspoken, which years ago attempted to use pixel-level data to identify UI elements. But while that system needed precise matches, the fuzzy logic of machine learning systems and the speed of iPhones&#8217; built-in AI accelerators means that Screen Recognition is much more flexible and powerful.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have been possibly just a couple years ago — the state of machine learning and the lack of a dedicated unit for executing it meant that something like this would have been extremely taxing on the system, taking much longer and probably draining the battery all the while.</p>
<p>But once this kind of system seemed possible, the team got to work prototyping it with the help of their dedicated accessibility staff and testing community.</p>
<p>&#8220;VoiceOver has been the standard bearer for vision accessibility for so long. If you look at the steps in development for Screen Recognition, it was grounded in collaboration across teams — Accessibility throughout, our partners in data collection and annotation, AI/ML, and, of course, design. We did this to make sure that our machine learning development continued to push toward an excellent user experience,&#8221; said Bigham.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDm7GiKra28?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It was done by taking thousands of screenshots of popular apps and games, then manually labeling them as one of several standard UI elements. This labeled data was fed to the machine learning system, which soon became proficient at picking out those same elements on its own.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as simple as it sounds — as humans, we&#8217;ve gotten quite good at understanding the intention of a particular graphic or bit of text, and so often we can navigate even abstract or creatively designed interfaces. It&#8217;s not nearly as clear to a machine learning model, and the team had to work with it to create a complex set of rules and hierarchies that ensure the resulting screen reader interpretation makes sense.</p>
<p>The new capability should help make millions of apps more accessible, or just accessible at all, to users with vision impairments. You can turn it on by going to Accessibility settings, then VoiceOver, then VoiceOver Recognition, where you can turn on and off image, screen, and text recognition.</p>
<p>It would not be trivial to bring Screen Recognition over to other platforms, like the Mac, so don&#8217;t get your hopes up for that just yet. But the principle is sound, though the model itself is not generalizable to desktop apps, which are very different from mobile ones. Perhaps others will take on that task; the prospect of AI-driven accessibility features is only just beginning to be realized.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As businesses gather, store and analyze an ever-increasing amount of data, tools for helping them discover, catalog, track and manage how that data is shared are also becoming increasingly important. With <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/purview/">Azure Purview</a>, Microsoft is launching a new data governance service <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/shape-your-future-with-data-and-analytics/">into public preview today</a> that brings together all of these capabilities in a new data catalog with discovery and data governance features.</p>
<p>As Rohan Kumar, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> corporate VP for Azure Data told me, this has become a major paint point for enterprises. While they may be very excited about getting started with data-heavy technologies like predictive analytics, those companies&#8217; data- and privacy- focused executives are very concerned to make sure that the way the data is used is compliant or that the company has received the right permissions to use its customers&#8217; data, for example.</p>
<p>In addition, companies also want to make sure that they can trust their data and know who has access to it and who made changes to it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;[Purview] is a unified data governance platform which automates the discovery of data, cataloging of data, mapping of data, lineage tracking &#8212; with the intention of giving our customers a very good understanding of the breadth of the data estate that exists to begin with, and also to ensure that all these regulations that are there for compliance, like GDPR, CCPA, etc, are managed across an entire data estate in ways which enable you to make sure that they don&#8217;t violate any regulation,&#8221; Kumar explained.</p>
<p>At the core of Purview is its catalog that can pull in data from the usual suspects like Azure&#8217;s various data and storage services but also third-party data stores including Amazon&#8217;s S3 storage service and on-premises SQL Server. Over time, the company will add support for more data sources.</p>
<p>Kumar described this process as a &#8216;multi-semester investment,&#8217; so the capabilities the company is rolling out today are only a small part of what&#8217;s on the overall roadmap already. With this first release today, the focus is on mapping a company&#8217;s data estate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082559" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/portal-azure-security-center-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082559" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2082559" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/portal-azure-security-center-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/portal-azure-security-center-1.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/portal-azure-security-center-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/portal-azure-security-center-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/portal-azure-security-center-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/portal-azure-security-center-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/portal-azure-security-center-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2082559" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Next [on the roadmap] is more of the governance policies,&#8221; Kumar said. &#8220;Imagine if you want to set things like &#8216;if there&#8217;s any PII data across any of my data stores, only this group of users has access to it.&#8217; Today, setting up something like that is extremely complex and most likely you&#8217;ll get it wrong. That&#8217;ll be as simple as setting a policy inside of Purview.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to launching Purview, the Azure team also today launched Azure Synapse, Microsoft&#8217;s next-generation data warehousing and analytics service, into general availability. The idea behind Synapse is to give enterprises &#8212; and their engineers and data scientists &#8212; a single platform that brings together data integration, warehousing and big data analytics.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s Azure Synapse Analytics bridges the gap between data lakes and warehouses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/microsofts-azure-synapse-analytics-bridges-the-gap-between-data-lakes-and-warehouses/embed/#?secret=gTEKkZx60R" data-secret="gTEKkZx60R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;With Synapse, we have this one product that gives a completely no code experience for data engineers, as an example, to build out these [data] pipelines and collaborate very seamlessly with the data scientists who are building out machine learning models, or the business analysts who build out reports for things like Power BI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among Microsoft&#8217;s marquee customers for the service, which Kumar described as one of the fastest-growing Azure services right now, are FedEx, Walgreens, Myntra and P&amp;G.</p>
<p>&#8220;The insights we gain from continuous analysis help us optimize our network,&#8221; said Sriram Krishnasamy, senior vice president, strategic programs at FedEx Services. &#8220;So as FedEx moves critical high value shipments across the globe, we can often predict whether that delivery will be disrupted by weather or traffic and remediate that disruption by routing the delivery from another location.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, TechCrunch covered the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">latest venture round for AgentSync</a>, a startup that helps insurance agents comply with rules and regulations. But while the product area might not keep you up tonight, the company&#8217;s growth has been incredibly impressive, scaling its annual recurring revenue (ARR) 10x in the last year and 4x since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Little surprise, then, that the company&#8217;s latest venture deal was raised just months <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/agentsync-raises-4-4m-for-its-insurtech-compliance-service/">after its last.</a> Investors wanted to get more money into AgentSync rapidly, boosting a larger venture-wide wager on insurtech startups that we&#8217;ve seen throughout 2020.</p>

<hr />
<p>But private investors aren&#8217;t the only ones getting in on the action. Public investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/high-flying-ipos-for-lemonade-and-accolade-may-encourage-other-unicorns-to-go-public/">welcomed the Lemonade IPO earlier this year</a>, giving the rental insurance unicorn a strong debut. Root also went public, but has lost around half of its value after a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/root-targets-6b-valuation-in-pending-ipo-a-boon-for-insurtech-startups/">strong pricing run</a>, comparing recent highs with its current price.</p>

And, per a TechCrunch data analysis this morning and some external data work on the insurtech venture capital market, it appears that private insurtech investment is matching the attention public investors are also giving the sector.</p>
<p>This morning let&#8217;s do a quick exploration of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/metromile" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="metromile">Metromile <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> deal and take a look at the insurtech venture capital market to better understand how much capital is going into the next generation of companies that will want to replicate the public exits of our three insurtech pioneers.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll link public results and recent private deal activity to see if both sides of the market are currently aligned.</p>
<h2>Metromile</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with Metromile&#8217;s debut. It&#8217;s going public via a SPAC, namely INSU Acquisition Corp. II. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819035/000121390020039409/fs42020_insuacqcorp2.htm#T999">the equivalent of an S-1 from both parties</a>, going over the economics of the blank-check company and Metromile itself.</p>
<p>On the economics front for the insurtech startup, we have to start with some extra work. During nearly every 2020 IPO we&#8217;ve spent lots of time examining how quickly the company in question is growing. We&#8217;re not doing that today because Metromile is not growing in GAAP terms and we need to understand why that&#8217;s the case.</p>
<p>In simple terms, a change to Metromile&#8217;s reinsurance setup last May led to the company ceding &#8220;a larger percentage of [its] premium than in prior periods,&#8221; which resulted &#8220;in a significant decrease in our revenues as reported under GAAP,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Ceded premiums don&#8217;t count as revenue. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lemonade" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lemonade">Lemonade, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in its <a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/139015699/files/doc_downloads/2020/11/Q3-2020-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">recent earnings results</a>, explained the concept well from the perspective of its own, related change to its business:</p>
<blockquote><p>While our July 1, 2020 reinsurance contracts deliver a significant improvement in the fundamentals of our business, they also result in a significant change in GAAP revenue, <strong>as GAAP excludes all ceded premiums</strong> (and proportional reinsurance is fundamentally about ceding premium). <strong>This led to a spike in GAAP gross margin and a dip in GAAP revenue</strong> on July 1 — even though no corresponding change in the scope or profitability of our business took place at midnight on June 30.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Lemonade has shaken up its business, cutting its revenues and tidying its economics. The impact has been sharp, with the company&#8217;s GAAP revenues falling from $17.8 million in the year-ago quarter to $10.5 million in Q3 2020.</p>
<p>Root has <a href="https://ir.joinroot.com/static-files/2bbfd172-5dd2-470a-a3c9-654bffc10e14">undertaken similar steps</a>. Starting July 1, it has &#8220;transfer[ed] 70% of [ … ] premiums and related losses to reinsurers, while also gaining a 25% commission on written premium to offset some of our up-front and ongoing costs.&#8221; The result has been falling GAAP revenue and improving economics once again.</p>
<p>All neoinsurance companies that have provided financial results while going public have changed their reinsurance approach, making their results look a bit wonky in the short term, leaving investors to decipher what they are really worth.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If only 10% of the world had enough power to run a cell phone, would mobile have changed the world in the way that it did?</p>
<p>It’s often said the future is already here — just not evenly distributed. That’s especially true in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Many powerful AI/ML applications already exist in the wild, but many also require enormous computational power — often at scales only available to the largest companies in existence or entire nation-states. Compute-heavy technologies are also hitting another roadblock: Moore’s law is plateauing and the processing capacity of legacy chip architectures are running up against the limits of physics.</p>
<p>If major breakthroughs in silicon architecture efficiency don’t happen, AI will suffer an unevenly distributed future and huge swaths of the population miss out on the improvements AI could make to their lives.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The next evolutionary stage of technology depends on completing the transformation that will make silicon architecture as flexible, efficient and ultimately programmable as the software we know today. If we cannot take major steps to provide easy access to ML we’ll lose unmeasurable innovation by having only a few companies in control of all the technology that matters. So what needs to change, how fast is it changing and what will that mean for the future of technology?</p>
<h2>An inevitable democratization of AI: A boon for startups and smaller businesses</h2>
<p>If you work at one of the industrial giants (including those “outside” of tech), congratulations — but many of the problems with current AI/ML computing capabilities I present here may not seem relevant.</p>
<p>For those of you working with lesser caches of resources, whether financially or talent-wise, view the following predictions as the herald of a new era in which organizations of all sizes and balance sheets have access to the same tiers of powerful AI and ML-powered software. Just like cell phones democratized internet access, we see a movement in the industry today to put AI in the hands of more and more people.</p>
<p>Of course, this democratization must be fueled by significant technological advancement that actually makes AI more accessible — good intentions are not enough, regardless of the good work done by companies like <a href="https://itpeernetwork.intel.com/intel-announces-strategic-alliance-google-accelerate-multi-cloud-adoption-democratize-ai/">Intel and Google</a>. Here are a few technological changes we’ll see that will make that possible.</p>
<h2>From dumb chip to smart chip to &#8220;genius&#8221; chip</h2>
<p>For a long time, raw performance was the metric of importance for processors. Their design reflected this. As software rose in ubiquity, processors needed to be smarter: more efficient and more commoditized, so specialized processors like GPUs arose — “smart” chips, if you will.</p>
<p>Those purpose-built graphics processors, by happy coincidence, proved to be more useful than CPUs for deep learning functions, and thus the GPU became one of the key players in modern AI and ML. Knowing this history, the next evolutionary step becomes obvious: If we can purpose-build hardware for graphics applications, why not for specific deep learning, AI and ML?</p>
<p>There’s also a unique confluence of factors that makes the next few years pivotal for chipmaking and tech in general. First and second, we’re seeing a plateauing of Moore’s law (which predicts a doubling of transistors on integrated circuits every two years) and the end of Dennard scaling (which says performance-per-watt doubles at about the same rate). Together, that used to mean that for any new generation of technology, chips doubled in density and increased in processing power while drawing the same amount of power. But we’ve now reached the scale of nanometers, meaning we’re up against the limitations of physics.</p>
<p>Thirdly, compounding the physical challenge, the computing demands of next-gen AI and ML apps are beyond what we could have imagined. Training neural networks to within even a fraction of human image recognition, for example, is surprisingly hard and takes huge amounts of processing power. The most intense applications of machine learning are things like natural language processing (NLP), recommender systems that deal with billions or trillions of possibilities, or super high-resolution computer vision, as is used in the medical and astronomical fields.</p>
<p>Even if we could have predicted we’d have to create and train algorithmic brains to learn how to speak human language or identify objects in deep space, we still could not have guessed just how much training — and therefore processing power — they might need to become truly useful and “intelligent” models.</p>
<p>Of course, many organizations are performing these sorts of complex ML applications. But these sorts of companies are usually business or scientific leaders with access to huge amounts of raw computing power and the talent to understand and deploy them. All but the largest enterprises are locked out of the upper tiers of ML and AI.</p>
<p>That’s why the next generation of smart chips — call them &#8220;genius&#8221; chips — will be about efficiency and specialization. Chip architecture will be made to optimize for the software running on it and run altogether more efficiently. When using high-powered AI doesn’t take a whole server farm and becomes accessible to a much larger percentage of the industry, the ideal conditions for widespread disruption and innovation become real. Democratizing expensive, resource intensive AI goes hand-in-hand with these soon-to-be-seen advances in chip architecture and software-centered hardware design.</p>
<h2>A renewed focus on future-proofing innovation</h2>
<p>The nature of AI creates a special challenge for the creators and users of AI hardware. The amount of change itself is huge: We’re living through the leap from humans writing code to software 2.0 — where engineers can train machine learning programs to eventually “run themselves.” The rate of change is also unprecedented: ML models can be obsolete in months or even weeks, and the very methods through which training happens are in constant evolution.</p>
<p>But creating new AI hardware products still requires designing, prototyping, calibrating, troubleshooting, production and distribution. It can take two years from concept to product-in-hand. Software has, of course, always outpaced hardware development, but now the differential in velocity is irreconcilable. We need to be more clever about the hardware we create for a future we increasingly cannot predict.</p>
<p>In fact, the generational way we think about technology is beginning to break down. When it comes to ML and AI, hardware must be built with the expectation that much of what we know today will be obsolete by the time we have the finished product. Flexibility and customization will be the key attributes of successful hardware in the age of AI, and I believe this will be a further win for entire market.</p>
<p>Instead of sinking resources into the model du jour or a specific algorithm, companies looking to take advantage of these technologies will have more options for processing stacks that can evolve and change as the demands of ML and AI models evolve and change.</p>
<p>This will allow companies of all sizes and levels of AI savvy to stay creative and competitive for longer and prevent the stagnation that can occur when software is limited by hardware — all leading to more interesting and unexpected AI applications for more organizations.</p>
<h2>Widespread adoption of real AI and ML technologies</h2>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit to tech’s fascination with shiny objects. There was a day when big data was the solution to everything and IoT was to be the world’s savior. AI has been through the hype cycle in the same way (arguably multiple times). Today, you’d be hard pressed to find a tech company that doesn’t purport to use AI in some way, but chances are they are doing something very rudimentary that’s more akin to advanced analytics.</p>
<p>It’s my firm belief that the AI revolution we’ve all been so excited about simply has not happened yet. In the next two to three years however, as the hardware that enables “real” AI power makes its way into more and more hands, it will happen. As far as predicting the change and disruption that will come from widespread access to the upper echelons of powerful ML and AI — there are few ways to make confident predictions, but that is exactly the point!</p>
<p>Much like cellphones put so much power in the hands of regular people everywhere, with no barriers to entry either technical or financial (for the most part), so will the coming wave of software-defined hardware that is flexible, customizable and future-proof. The possibilities are truly endless, and it will mark an important turning point in technology. The ripple effects of AI democratization and commoditization will not stop with just technology companies, and so even more fields stand to be blown open as advanced, high-powered AI becomes accessible and affordable.</p>
<p>Much of the hype around AI — all the disruption it was supposed to bring and the leaps it was supposed to fuel — will begin in earnest in the next few years. The technology that will power it is being built as we speak or soon to be in the hands of the many people in the many industries who will use their newfound access as a springboard to some truly amazing advances. We’re especially excited to be a part of this future, and look forward to all the progress it will bring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ben Ling is as done with 2020 as the rest of us, but certainly for him, the year could be worse.</p>
<p>Ling, who founded his own venture outfit in 2018 &#8212; naming it <a href="https://www.blingcap.com/">Bling Capital</a> (a nickname from way back) &#8212; just closed on $113 million in capital commitments across two new funds: a seed-focused $77 million fund, and an opportunity fund focused on breakout companies from his portfolio that closed with $36 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a decent amount of money for a so-called solo GP fund, especially coming as it does just two years after Bling closed on two very similar-size funds: a <span style="font-weight: 400;">$61 seed-stage fund and a $35 opportunities-type fund. Yet </span>Ling says it could have been twice as much committed capital, given demand. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to basically kick people out,&#8221; he says of those willing to write him a check.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not so hard to believe, considering the track record of Ling, a former exec at Google, then Facebook, then YouTube, then Google again before Ling turned to venture capital in 2013, joining Khosla Ventures.</p>
<p>Between the more than five years that Ling spent with Sand Hill Road firm and the &#8220;nearly 80&#8221; investments he made as an angel investor before that, he says he has invested in 10 &#8220;unicorns&#8221; altogether so far, including Rippling, Airtable, Udemy, Quora, Instacart, Gusto, and the now publicly traded companies Pagerduty, Square, Lyft, and Palantir.</p>
<p>A Stanford PhD in computer science, Ling insists that by working as a lone GP &#8212; one supported by three principals &#8212; he can continue getting into more hot deals, too. &#8220;It&#8217;s<span style="font-weight: 400;"> important because you can make decisions much more quickly, whereas in partnerships, you have to get a partner looped in, and all those days can cost you an investment opportunity.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Having a powerful network is surely helpful, too. Ling says that roughly 100 limited partners make up Bling&#8217;s investor base, and that these individuals are largely the h<span style="font-weight: 400;">eads of product, the heads of growth, and even the founders </span>of many major startups. Among Bling&#8217;s backers, for example, is Affirm CEO Max Levchin, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>Such contacts matter because <span style="font-weight: 400;">when they see reports who are leaving to start new things, they will ostensibly point Bling in the founders&#8217; direction. As for possible conflicts of interest, Ling is clear that there is a &#8220;wall, in that our LPs don&#8217;t receive any proprietary confidential information about a company unless its CEO says, &#8216;I want to meet these five to seven people&#8217; who are investors in the fund.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In the meantime, Ling is continuing to write checks, saying that in seed stage deals, Bling&#8217;s investments typically range from $400,000 to $1 million for a 10% to 12% stake in a company, and that for later-stage deals, he&#8217;s writing checks of between $1 million and $3 million.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious, some of the later-stage bets in Bling&#8217;s portfolio include the micro-mobility company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">Lime</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/mirror-competitor-tempo-raises-a-60m-series-b/">Tempo</a>, a home fitness company that involves a wall-mounted screen and is focused on weight lifting; and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/sequoia-capital-led-14-5m-series-a-brings-vise-out-of-stealth/">Vise</a>, which automate aspects of investment management for financial advisers using artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>More nascent bets include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/infeedo-raises-3-2m-led-by-bling-capital-delivers-1-1m-exit-to-early-employees-and-investors/">InFeedo</a>, a four-year-old, Gurgaon, India-based company that&#8217;s focused on employee retention; <a href="https://www.builtinsf.com/2020/07/21/sprout-therapy-raises-10m-autism-care">Sprout Therapy</a>, a year-old, Bay Area startup that&#8217;s using tech to expand healthcare access to autistic children; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/supersonic-aircraft-startup-hermeus-raises-16-million-series-a/">Hermeus</a>, a 2.5-year-old, Atlanta, Ga.-based company attempting to build a Mach 5 aircraft that would be capable of making the trip from New York to London in just 90 minutes. (Bling has written checks into both Hermeus&#8217;s seed and Series A rounds.)</p>
<p>If it seems like Bling is investing all over the place &#8212; at least within the U.S. &#8212; it is.</p>
<p>Ling credits his background, where he worked for among the world&#8217;s largest consumer-facing companies but where, internally, he was developing commerce and SaaS tools for the companies&#8217; small and medium-size business customers. Indeed, Ling says some of the only areas that are off limits for Bling are &#8220;rockets, ag tech, biotech or crypto, because we don&#8217;t have a comparative advantage in those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Bling is &#8220;pitched on a biotech startup from London, that&#8217;s because every biotech investor and every London-based investor has already passed and we&#8217;re the dumb money,&#8221; he says with a laugh.</p>
<p>As for whether Bling will stay headquartered in the Bay Area, Ling says he&#8217;s not sure, that he&#8217;s considering a move to either Austin or Miami like a growing number of other founders and investors. He&#8217;s worried right now about the <a href="https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/stay-safe/crime-data/crime-dashboard">state of San Francisco</a>, where he has family. But also, after this very strange year, he&#8217;s maybe ready for a change.</p>
<p>From Ling&#8217;s perspective, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. There&#8217;s &#8220;still a lot of white space in tech,&#8221; no matter where one is investing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Compensation within private venture-backed startups can be a confusing minefield that if unsuccessfully navigated can lead to inconsistent salaries and the kind of ambiguity that breeds an unhappy workforce.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pave.com/">Pave</a>, a San Francisco-based startup that recently graduated from YC Combinator is aiming to end the pay and equity gap with a software tool it developed to make it easier to track, measure, and communicate how and what they pay their employees.</p>
<p>The question is whether Silicon Valley, which has a history of pay inequity and gender disparities, is ready for that kind of transparency?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investors certainly think so. Andreessen Horowitz has poured millions into Pave’s $16 million Series A round, at a post-money valuation of $75 million, confirming our reports from August. The round also includes the a16z Cultural Leadership Fund, Bessemer Venture Partners, Bezos Expeditions (a personal investment company of Jeff Bezos), Dash Fund, and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Kristina Shen, a GP at A16z, will be joining the board. Marc Andreessen will take a board observer seat.</p>
<h2>A rebrand and re-focus</h2>
<p>Pave, known until now as Trove, is trying to build an online market of data and real-time tools that bring more fairness in compensation to the startup world. The tools allow a company to track, measure and ultimately communicate compensation on an employee-by-employee basis. It does so by integrating HR tools such as Workday, Carta and Greenhouse into one unified service that CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-schulman-15911861/">Matt Schulman</a> says it only takes the customer 5 minutes to set up with Pave.</p>
<p>The service can then help companies figure out how to manage their employees’ pay, from promotion cycles and compensation adjustments to how to reward a bonus and how much equity to grant a new employee.</p>
<p>Employees, meanwhile, can see data on their entire compensation package as well as predictive analytics on how they can grow their stake in the company. The tool is called Total Rewards, and its closest competitor, Welcome (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">which raised $6 million this week)</a> launched a tool with the same name, and same goal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082507" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082507" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2082507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Total-Rewards-Portal.png" alt="" width="720" height="645" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Total-Rewards-Portal.png 3588w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Total-Rewards-Portal.png?resize=150,134 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Total-Rewards-Portal.png?resize=300,269 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Total-Rewards-Portal.png?resize=768,688 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Total-Rewards-Portal.png?resize=680,609 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Total-Rewards-Portal.png?resize=1536,1375 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Total-Rewards-Portal.png?resize=2048,1834 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Total-Rewards-Portal.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082507" class="wp-caption-text">Pave&#8217;s Total Rewards Portal for employees.</p></div></p>
<p>Schulman says that all startups struggle with figuring out stock options, equity, benchmarking data and promotion cycles because it’s an offline (and cumbersome) process. Clear communication about these details, though, helps with both hiring and retention.</p>
<p>Pave’s biggest challenge, is convincing its startup customers to share data on their payment structures. While data is anonymized so employees can’t see their colleagues salaries, it does require buy-in from a company to track potential inequity in the first place.</p>
<p>“I imagine there will be some late adopters that are not fully aligned with that vision at first,” Schulman admits. “How can we really change how compensation works as something that has been stagnant for decades upon decades? That’s not an easy challenge.” Right now, Pave is working with companies on a case by case basis to see how much they want to communicate with employees. Long-term, Schulman wants there to be a standard.</p>
<h2>Is the industry ready to be benchmarked?</h2>
<p>And the founder is optimistic that he can get there. Schulman pointed to Carta, a cap management tool, as an example of widespread adoption.</p>
<p>“There were companies that at first resisted Carta, and they were not comfortable putting all of their records into one centralized database,” he said. “Now, it’s ubiquitous. Every company uses Carta among venture-backed companies.”</p>
<p>But,even Carta has struggled with what it wants other companies to do: pay their employees fairly. Carta is currently facing a lawsuit from its former vice president of marketing, Emily Kramer, for gender discrimination. In the lawsuit, Kramer notes that she was paid $50,000 less relative to her peers, and her equity grant was one-third the amount of shares than her male counterparts. The company also laid off 16% of its employees, citing a lack of new customers.</p>
<p>If Carta, valued at $3 billion, has difficulties, then an early-stage startup such as Pave will also come up against big hurdles around transparency. The startup is hoping that its new industry-wide benchmark project will help kickstart the conversation and nudge companies in the right direction.</p>
<p>Launching today, Pave has teamed up with the portfolio companies of a16z, Bessemer Venture Partners, NEA, Redpoint Ventures and YC to gather compensation data. The data, which is opt-in, will allow Pave to release a compensation benchmark survey to show how companies pay their employees. The survey will be public but will aggregate all company responses, so there is no way to see which company is doing better than others.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2082509" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Compensation-Analytics-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="440" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Compensation-Analytics-2.png 4674w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Compensation-Analytics-2.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Compensation-Analytics-2.png?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Compensation-Analytics-2.png?resize=768,330 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Compensation-Analytics-2.png?resize=680,292 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Compensation-Analytics-2.png?resize=1536,661 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Compensation-Analytics-2.png?resize=2048,881 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pave-Compensation-Analytics-2.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Other platforms have tried to do measure pay across roles, such as Glassdoor and Angellist. Schulman says that “companies don’t trust that data” because it&#8217;s crowdsourced and therefore has a survey bias.</p>
<p>The tool would help companies go from doing a D&amp;I analysis once a year to being able to do it consistently, “so they don’t drift away from a fair and equitable state,” he said.</p>
<p>While Pave tries to convince other startups to share intimate information, as a company it is still figuring out how to do the same. The company declined to share the diversity break-down of its team, which grew from five to 13 employees in just months and has a 30-person target by end of year. Based on LinkedIn, Pave’s team skews white and male.</p>
<p>A push from the rise of remote work might make transparency happen sooner than later. The rise of distributed workforces has forced companies to start asking questions around compensation, Schulman said.</p>
<p>“How do you pay your San Francisco engineer who wants to move to Wyoming?” Schulman said. “That’s the question that’s on everyone’s mind.” The shift is making compensation become a mainstream conversation, the company has found interest in its service from companies including Allbirds, Checkr, Tide, and Instabase. Schulman says early adopters have been bullish about transparency.</p>
<p>Once Pave can figure out how to support venture-backed startups, it’s looking outwards to other geographies and types of businesses.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s 3 billion humans in the world that work in a part of the labor market,” he said. “And right now it’s a black box in how they’re compensated.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An update to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street">Street View app</a> on Android will now let anyone contribute their photos to help enhance Google Maps, the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/anyone-can-share-their-world-with-street-view/">announced</a> this morning. Using a &#8220;connected photos&#8221; tool in the new version of the Street View app, users are able to record a series of images as they move down the street or a path. The feature requires an <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar">ARCore</a>-compatible Android device, and for the time being, will only support image capture and upload in select geographic regions.</p>
<p>ARCore is Google&#8217;s platform for building augmented reality experiences. It works by allowing the phone to sense its environment, including the size and location of all types of surfaces, the position of the phone in relation to the world around it, and the lighting conditions of the environment. This is supported on a<a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices"> variety of Android devices</a> running Android 7.0 (Nougat) or higher.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google&#8217;s Street View app has been around for half a decade. Initially, it was designed to allow users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/03/googles-new-street-view-app-less-you-browse-360-degree-imagery-share-your-own-panoramic-photos/">share their own panoramic photos</a> to improve the Google Maps experience. But as phones have evolved, so has the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The updated version of the Street View app allows users to capture images using ARCore &#8212; the same AR technology Google users for its own<a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/new-sense-direction-live-view/"> Live View</a> orientation experiences in Maps, which helps phones &#8220;see&#8221; various landmarks to help users get their bearings.</p>
<p>After the images are published in the Street View app, Google will then automatically rotate, position and create a series of connected photos using those images, and put them in the correct place on Google Maps so others can see them.</p>
<p>It will also use the same privacy controls on these contributed photos as are offered on its own Street View images (the ones it captured by driving the Street View car around). This include blurring people&#8217;s faces and license plates, and allowing users to report imagery and other content for review, if needed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082491" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082491" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082491" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Government_Camp_OR_recording_4.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082491" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The new system of connected photos won&#8217;t be as polished as Google&#8217;s own Street View images, but it does make the ability to publish to Street View more accessible. Now, the image capturing process no longer requires a <a href="https://www.google.com/streetview/contacts-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://www.google.com/streetview/contacts-tools/&quot;}">360-degree camera</a> or other equipment mounted to a top of car, for example. And that means users who live in more remote regions will be able to contribute to Street View, without needing anything more than a supported Android phone and internet connection.</p>
<p>Google says it will still default to showing its own Street View imagery when it&#8217;s available, which will be indicated with a solid blue line. But in the case where there&#8217;s no Street View option, the contributed connected photos will appear in the Street View layer as a dotted blue line instead.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082492" style="width: 308px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082492" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2082492" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Maldives_Connected_Photos.gif?w=298" alt="" width="298" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082492" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The company will also use the data in the photos to update Google Maps with the names and addresses of businesses that aren&#8217;t already in the system, including their posted hours, if that&#8217;s visible on a store sign, for instance.</p>
<p>During early tests, users captured photo using this technology in Nigeria, Japan and Brazil.</p>
<p>Today, Google says it&#8217;s officially launching the connected photos feature in beta in the Street View app. During this public beta period, users will be able to try the feature in Toronto, Canada, New York, NY and Austin, TX, along with Nigeria, Indonesia and Costa Rica. More regions will be supported in the future as the test progresses, Google says.</p>
