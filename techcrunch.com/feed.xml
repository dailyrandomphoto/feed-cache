										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in the halcyon days of 2019, we piloted a new format for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">Extra Crunch</a> we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1/">dubbed the EC-1</a>. Modeled after the Form S-1 filing that late-stage startups submit to the SEC as part of the IPO process, EC-1s are authoritative, deep analyses into growth-stage startups. We profiled and analyzed a number of companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/patreon-ec-1/">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">Niantic</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/roblox-ec1/">Roblox</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/09/kobalt-ec1/">Kobalt</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/how-unity-built-the-worlds-most-popular-game-engine/">Unity</a>, looking at everything from their product design, to their customer relations, to their events strategy and to the changing economics of music licensing.</p>
<p>They were very popular and we had huge ambitions for the series, but then 2020 hit, COVID-19 swept in, and suddenly our ability to travel and meet with a dozen executives in-person at a company was curtailed (there was also just a wee bit of breaking news to cover as well!) We didn’t want to cut back on quality, so we bided our time.</p>
<p>Well, with some level of normality finally kicking in, we’re excited to restart this series in 2021. We have nearly ten EC-1s in the works right now, and I am excited to introduce our first EC-1 profile of this new batch — a company that has truly skyrocketed amidst that dark pandemic year.</p>
<p><b>Tonal</b> is a unique entrant in the upscale fitness market, using a proprietary blend of hardware, software, and content to bring comprehensive strength training to the home in as small and efficient of a package as possible. Sales have zoomed the past year as gyms shut down worldwide, and the company has been pelted by interest from both customers and investors.</p>
<p>That success today, though, occludes a lengthy process of iteration over years against the droning negativity of most VCs who never expected a corporate enterprise infrastructure founder to be capable of building a popular consumer hardware device. Tonal is not just a story of willpower, but also an example of how much effort it takes to build a major startup, from product design and launch strategy to careful marketing and building the moats to protect itself from competition in a ferocious market.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s writer and analyst for this EC-1 is <b>JP Mangalindan</b>. Mangalindan has been covering technology for years now, previously serving as chief tech correspondent for our corporate sister site Yahoo Finance and also publishing across a plethora of other tech publications. He brings a wealth of insight not just into startups and Tonal, but the wider fitness market as well. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the copyeditor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Tonal had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advanced access to it. Mangalindan has no financial ties to Tonal or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Tonal EC-1 is comprised of four main articles representing about 10,600 words and a reading time of about 43 minutes. Let’s get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part 1: Origin Story</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">How a homegrown experiment became one of the fastest-growing companies in fitness tech</a>” (3,200 words / 13 minutes) — we start with the history of Tonal, the multi-year effort to raise VC funds and iterate on a product while reinventing the definition of strength-training equipment</li>
<li><b>Part 2: Product launch</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-launch/">Millions of dollars and 3.5 years, and it all came down to this</a>” (2,800 words / 11 minutes) — explores the tradeoffs and tactics Tonal used to launch its product, a launch that as a hardware company, it couldn’t afford to mess up</li>
<li><b>Part 3: Community building</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-community/">Building online communities for fun, profit and product</a>” (2,200 words / 9 minutes) — analyzes Tonal’s early forays into community building and how it uses community to improve its products while also retaining customers for its critical subscription business</li>
<li><b>Part 4: Competitive landscape and future</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-future/"> Can Tonal become the luxury fitness market champion?</a>” (2,400 words / 10 minutes) — evaluates the keen competition confronting Tonal in this market, and analyzes the company’s next steps to continue its successful growth</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fitness is about resistance — running against the wind, firing up muscles against the dead gravity of weights, fortifying the mind against that nagging feeling that a park bench and a scoop of ice cream would probably be just a bit more enjoyable.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			For Tonal, resistance isn’t just a value proposition, it’s the very ingredient that conditioned this startup to become one of the darlings of the fitness tech world.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.tonal.com/">Tonal</a>, resistance isn’t just a value proposition, it’s the very ingredient that conditioned this startup to become one of the darlings of the fitness tech world.</p>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves. The company has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tonal/company_financials">raised about $200 million to date</a> from venture capitalists and is becoming a household name with a $2,995 wall-mounted device that employs a digital weight system that can emulate various traditional gym stations. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/16/tonal-launches-at-home-digital-strength-training-system/">Since Tonal launched in August 2018</a>, the company has carved out a reputation among fitness enthusiasts seeking a strength-training solution at home that saves on space without compromising serious weight-lifting capabilities.</p>
<p>As at-home fitness sales have boomed during the pandemic, Tonal equipment has been one of the beneficiaries, seeing its sales surge 800% from December 2019 to December 2020. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/tonal-triples-its-physical-stores-with-nordstrom-partnership/">The company also announced a partnership with Nordstrom this month</a> which will place 50-square-foot sales stations in the women’s activewear department of at least 40 Nordstrom stores across America, bringing the total number of Tonal physical locations to 60 by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Like all great athletes though, Tonal’s visible victories belie its massive exertion against the resistance of the world to innovation. Aly Orady, the company’s founder and CEO, had to overcome his own burnout and weight gain while kindling the energy to strike his own path. The company that would become Tonal had to fight through multiple VC rounds of skeptical investors ready to say that two-letter word that stops all progress.</p>
<p>It’s that resistance and its ability to overcome barriers that makes understanding Tonal’s story so compelling.</p>
<h2>A founder lifting the weight of the past</h2>
<p>The morning after Christmas in 2013, Orady woke up feeling downright abysmal. Over the past 17 years or so, he had toiled as an engineer at companies like Samsung, Sun Microsystems, HP and three enterprise startups, work that had taken a heavy toll on him. His corporate exertions had left behind a slew of health problems; he had become grossly overweight and had developed Type II diabetes and sleep apnea.</p>
<p>“It felt like I was heading toward this point of no return, and I just wasn&#8217;t going to be able to reclaim my health if I didn&#8217;t do something about it,” he recalls.</p>
<p>The only viable path Orady saw to fixing the situation was a major lifestyle change. A few days later after the holidays, he dialed back his hours as a full-time consultant for Samsung’s TV and display division — a role that meant frequent trips to Korea — and embarked on an ambitious workout plan involving four hours of exercise a day six days a week, usually split between mornings and evening, plus intermittent fasting two days a week.</p>
<p>Many mornings, Orady woke up at 6 a.m. and drove to a Gold’s Gym in San Francisco, where he initially hit the elliptical and also went for outdoor bike rides. He scoured the internet and read books about strength training, and the more he worked out, the more he integrated strength training into his six-days-a-week workout schedule until strength training became the core of his routine. Over the course of nine months in 2014, Orady lost a whopping 70 pounds, all while winding down his consulting work with Samsung.</p>

Photo via Tonal.</p></div></p>
<p>Yet, although he’d already made significant progress getting in shape — and the results truly spoke for themselves — Orady loathed trekking to the gym each day and wished he could do the same workout at home. Perched on a gym bench one day in March 2015, Orady found himself staring at a cable crossover machine, a 5 foot by 3 foot by 7 foot gym mainstay that lets users perform various exercises with removable weight plates.</p>
<p>“I was looking at this thing, and I realized the reason this thing was so big was because it relied on big metal plates and gravity to work,” he explains. “I thought to myself, if I could replace those big metal plates and gravity with electricity, I could shrink it down and create something really small.”</p>
<p>That was his cue. That same month, Orady founded Ripped Labs, a name he would later change to the simpler and catchier moniker, Tonal.</p>
<h2>The many reps of product iteration</h2>
<p>The same day Orady observed that cable crossover machine, he began brainstorming ways he could bring weight stations into the home while cutting out most of the bulk. Traditional gym stations often use large, unwieldy weight plates to offer enough resistance for strength training. But what if, Orady thought, he could devise a product that swapped out those big metal plates for something smaller and more compact and bundled that technology with intelligent software that tracked a user’s workout?</p>
<p>“I bet if we could make electromagnetics work, it would be completely revolutionary,” says Orady. “It already is the technology that spins the motors in electric cars, propels high-speed trains … but no one had ever used it for this, and the questions started swirling in my head of whether we could use electromagnetics to make a device feel like a real weight machine.” Having received a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering from McMaster University, Orady had studied the theory of electromagnetics, but he had never actually developed electromagnetic devices in his prior work.</p>
<p>Orady ordered a number of parts online to build his first prototype, a rudimentary device strapped to a wooden workbench in his home that had a cable you pulled back and forth. But those first two versions of “digital weights” didn’t work very well — there was too much friction when pulling the cables and not enough magnets to replicate a wide range of weight like traditional gym equipment. The first version contained one magnet and a usable range of 25-40 pounds, while the second prototype used dozens of magnets, which allowed the resistance to be generated by the magnets themselves and not as much from the cables.</p>
<p>After two more iterations, he had managed to create his own kind of electromagnetic technology that created resistance comparable to weights. By then, the prototype had reached a point where he felt the device replicated the feeling of doing some weight station movements like single-arm cable rows and bicep curls.</p>
<h2>A marathon of investor meetings</h2>
<p>Parallel to working on the prototype that would one day become Tonal, the Ripped Labs founder started an arduous nine-month process of pitching investors. Orady was an enterprise guy with an enterprise rolodex, having worked at three enterprise infrastructure startups and also serving as an advisor at Mayfield Fund for six months in 2013. He pitched his vision of a compact at-home strength-training product, but investors simply scoffed at the idea.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Company building, brand building, launch strategy and marketing tactics are key to the success of most startups — and that’s what this second part of the Tonal EC-1 is all about.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launching a product is a nonevent for many startups. In software, it’s not uncommon to put together a flimsy working prototype over a couple of hours and publish it immediately to start generating feedback from early users and get that iterative flywheel spinning.</p>
<p>Launching has a very different meaning, though, for hardware. Once that physical product leaves the warehouse, the design team can’t patch the hardware itself. It’s got to work reliably, be easy to use and most importantly, be safe for users straight out of the box. Even more important than readying the product itself is the sales and marketing engine that accompanies a launch. For hardware startups, a mislaunch may well lead straight to bankruptcy as hardware inventory piles up and cash flow becomes constrained. You just can’t get a launch wrong.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Getting to a point where the prototype was usable and somewhat reflected the final product in its feature set was a lengthy process.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">In part one of this EC-1</a>, we looked at the three-and-a-half years of Tonal’s origins and how a scrappy entrepreneur in the form of founder and CEO Aly Orady continued to iterate upon prototypes of an all-in-one strength-training device powered by electromagnetics — a technology he had never worked on before. We also saw how he eventually won over several investors including Bolt, Mayfield, Shasta and Sapphire Ventures, who saw the potential in his device once they experienced it for themselves.</p>
<p>Tonal’s individual components were all ready, but how should it bring them together and create a successful launch?</p>
<p>Company building, brand building, launch strategy and marketing tactics are key to the success of most startups — and that’s what this second part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">the Tonal EC-1</a> is all about. We will look at how Tonal’s designers changed the product based on feedback during its beta period. We’ll look at how Tonal’s product focus on strength training forced it to adapt a typical hardware launch strategy to optimize for the consumers it was hoping to target. Finally, we will explore the company’s marketing and launch strategy — and one key and seemingly smart decision at the time that proved to be an early blunder and humbling lesson in hindsight.</p>
<h2>Iterating when a build isn’t one click</h2>
<p>Unlike, say, productivity software where a user might be logged in for much of a work day spewing out usage data, Tonal is a strength training device, which means that users only use it for a limited period of time a couple of days per week. That made receiving sufficient authentic feedback on early units challenging.</p>
<p>Getting to a point where the prototype was usable and somewhat reflected the final product in its feature set was therefore a lengthy process. Following the small alpha trial in 2016 that Ripped Labs (later renamed Tonal) performed in a San Francisco apartment, the startup began an extensive year-long beta trial in early 2017 that placed prototype devices into 25 homes with at least two people in each home, and the company tracked those users for a year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Once a fitness tech company like Tonal launches its product, it immediately faces another challenge: how to keep those users engaged.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Once a fitness tech company like Tonal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-launch/">launches its product</a>, it immediately faces another challenge: how to keep those users engaged. It’s not enough that a customer purchased the device; it’s equally as important to keep them using it over the long term so they continue to pay the monthly subscription fees required for access to classes. In Tonal’s case, recurring revenues generated from those monthly subscription fees are significant, as the startup charges each user $49 per month with a minimum 12-month commitment to start.</p>
<p>To keep their users engaged, at-home fitness companies energize online communities by building Facebook Groups and significant Instagram and Twitter accounts. Since it launched its first bike in 2014, Peloton has catered to its large audience with a robust Facebook group that numbers nearly the population of San Francisco. Likewise, newer entrants such as Mirror and Tempo also developed their Facebook presence with nearly 86,900 and 11,200 followers, respectively.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			While it has pursued a tried-and-true community engagement strategy, Tonal has also had to evolve its tactics as it learns the unique tastes of its strength-training demographic and how they differ from other fitness users.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Tonal is no different. Across social media channels, Tonal currently has over 155,000 followers, with its own private Facebook Group, “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/officialtonalcommunity/">Official Tonal Community</a>,” having roughly 12,900 members. At this point in Tonal’s lifespan, the community experience is decent, but more along the lines of Peloton’s engagement three to four years ago.</p>
<p>Yet, while it has pursued a tried-and-true community engagement strategy, Tonal has also had to evolve its tactics as it learns the unique tastes of its strength-training demographic and how they differ from other fitness users. In this third part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">the Tonal EC-1</a>, we will look at how the company grew its nascent community, how it shifted its strategy of engaging users, how the team uses community to hone its product, and how the future of Tonal’s community will look like as the company continues its rapid ascent.</p>
<h2>A planned community, but what to build?</h2>
<p>With its online community, Tonal’s strategy was deliberate and staggered, mirroring the approach it took with its August 2018 launch, in which the startup first launched in the San Francisco Bay Area and expanded to all of California before going nationwide in March 2019.</p>
<p>The startup hired its first community manager, Sarah Johnson, in October 2017 — nearly a year before that public launch. Her initial focus was monitoring users during Tonal’s alpha and beta trials, and she regularly called users to solicit feedback about their experiences working out with the device. Among Johnson’s early observations: Unlike the gym, which inherently has a more physical social element, Tonal users, who may have partners or families, wanted their at-home classes to be the most efficient workout possible in the shortest amount of time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why should any customer spend upward of $3,000 on a Tonal device? The answer will determine Tonal’s eventual success, and that’s the theme we will explore in this fourth and final part of the EC-1.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last three sections of this EC-1, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">we’ve seen the genesis of Tonal</a>, transforming from a series of prototypes in the mind of CEO and founder Aly Orady into a unique strength-training entrant in the luxury at-home fitness market. We’ve also seen how the company extensively alpha and beta tested its device, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-launch/">designed a launch and marketing strategy</a>, and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-community/">cultivated a nascent community</a> to hone the company’s products while engaging customers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Yet, with Peloton such a dominant force in this market and multiple other fitness upstarts targeting the same affluent customer, there’s a natural question to be asked: Why should any customer ultimately spend upward of $3,000 on a base Tonal device? The answer to that question will determine Tonal’s eventual success, and that’s the theme we will explore in this fourth and final part of the EC-1 as we consider the competitive landscape of this white-hot market.</p>
<h2>So what’s the product really like?</h2>
<p>While the market is huge and the competitors are hungry, Tonal’s success pivots exclusively on whether the device itself is worth its quite prohibitive price. For me, using Tonal has been largely a positive experience, although it’s worth noting I received my Tonal loaner device within 14 days, far faster than the 10-12 week timeline that many customers have experienced in the pandemic-induced surge. The startup works with a third-party delivery service, which reminds the user the day before via email and also calls 30 minutes ahead of arrival.</p>

Photo via Tonal.</p></div></p>
<p>Compact as the Tonal device is compared to gym weight stations, it was still a squeeze finding a spot in my crowded 900-square-foot apartment, and using it still requires me to move some dining chairs around to make space for my workout. While this probably won’t be an issue for many Tonal owners who live in larger homes (particularly in the suburbs), I suspect city dwellers may encounter similar challenges as I did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cameo, the celebrity video site you’re probably familiar with if you’ve celebrated a birthday in the last three years, <a href="https://cameoblog.medium.com/fueling-the-future-of-the-connection-economy-165556a860cc">announced this morning</a> that it’s raised a $100M Series C. The round, which was led by Jonathan Turner with e.ventures, puts the site’s value at just north of $1 billion.</p>
<p>Cameo has been building a good deal of steam in recent years, but the service is among those that managed to get a major boost amid the pandemic, as celebrities and normals alike suddenly found themselves with a lot more time on their hands.</p>
<p>“The pandemic put extra stress on the already unstable business models supporting talent across sports and entertainment ecosystems,&#8221; CEO Steven Galanis said in a Medium post tied to the news. &#8220;It catalyzed a massive shift in awareness and widespread adoption of direct-to-fan models, which has, in turn, created a new foundation for fan engagement. We exist in an entirely different world today — one in which talent actually want to connect more deeply with their fans, and fans expect unprecedented access to the talent they admire most. This funding will help us create the access and connections that will define the future of the ‘connection economy’ on a global scale.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest round more than doubles the service’s total funding, bringing it up to $165 million. Google Ventures, Amazon Alexa Fund, UTA, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Valor Equity Partners and Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley) join existing investors, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins, The Chernin Group, Origin Venture and Spark Capital. There are also some “talent investors” on board, as well, including skateboarding legend, Tony Hawk. Because, you know, Cameo.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fq6UX9YE2U0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Cameo says some 80% of its standard video requests are booked as gifts, to celebrate things like birthdays. In total, around two million videos have been created through the offering. But the site is looking to grow into additional categories. Last year it added the ability to book celebrities as guests for Zoom video chats (a very pandemic-focused offering).</p>
<p>Some of the funding will go toward ramping up <a href="https://biz.cameo.com/">Cameo for Business (C4B)</a>, which brings celebrity videos to events and conferences, as well as ads and sales. Effectively, the service works as a pipeline between businesses and famous people. The company will also be expending its international offering, growing beyond the approximately 20% of videos currently purchased outside the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is set to make a change to its Crew Dragon spacecraft for its forthcoming history-making all-civilian launch, currently set for September 15. That Dragon will replace its International Space Station docking mechanism with a transparent dome, through which passengers will be able to take in an awe-inspiring surround panorama of space and the Earth from an orbital perspective.</p>
<p>The glass dome will be at the &#8216;nose&#8217; of the Dragon capsule, or its topmost point when it&#8217;s loaded upright on top of a Falcon 9 rocket readying for launch. There should be space for one passenger to use it at a time, and it&#8217;ll be opened up once the spacecraft is safely out of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, exposed by a protective cover that can be flipped back down to protect the observation deck when the spacecraft re-enters on its return trip.</p>
<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called it &#8220;the most &#8216;in space&#8217; you could possibly feel&#8221; in a tweet sharing a concept render of the new modification in use. During a press briefing for the upcoming tourist flight, which is called &#8216;Inspiration4&#8217; and led by billionaire Jared Isaacman, it was described as being similar to the exiting cupola on the International Space Station in terms of the views it affords.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The ISS cupola is an observatory module built by the European Space Agency (ESA) and installed in 2010. Based on these renders from SpaceX, the Dragon version will be a continuous unbroken transparent surface, whereas the ISS cupola is made up of segmented panes separated by support structure, so that could mean Dragon provides a better view.</p>

<p>This modification could pave the way for a more permanent alternate configuration of Dragon, one best-suited for SpaceX&#8217;s planned commercial passenger missions, most of which will likely aim to do orbital tours without any actual docking at the ISS. It&#8217;s possible the company will make further cabin modifications when the vehicle isn&#8217;t configured for crew delivery to the orbital science station.</p>
<p>SpaceX also revealed new details about the Inspiration4 mission today, including its planned launch date of September 15, and a three-day mission flight duration. The r<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission/">emaining two passengers on board the four-person crew were also revealed this morning</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://stockly.ai">Stockly</a>, a French startup that keeps the inventory of various e-commerce websites in sync. When you see an out-of-stock item on an e-commerce website, chances are you leave that website and try to find the same item on another site.</p>
<p>If you operate an e-commerce website, Stockly lets you sell items even when they’re currently out of stock. The startup automatically finds a third-party Stockly supplier with that specific item.</p>
<p>The order will go through and be sent by that supplier directly. Stockly tells its partners to use neutral packaging so that the end consumer isn’t confused.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This could be particularly useful for small scale e-commerce companies that don’t have a healthy marketplace of third-party retailers. For instance, Amazon can already sell you an out-of-stock item if a supplier has listed that specific item on Amazon’s own marketplace. But that’s not the case for most e-commerce websites.</p>
<p>The main challenge for Stockly is that it has to sort through various catalog formats and match the different inventories of different retailers. It is focusing on clothing items at first. When an order is routed through Stockly, it selects a specific supplier based on different criteria, such as logistics, delivery time and historical data.</p>
<p>So far, Stockly has been working with Galeries Lafayette, Go Sport, Foot Shop and others. The startup has recently raised a $6 million (€5.1 million) funding round from <a href="https://www.idinvest.com">Idinvest Partners</a>, <a href="https://daphni.com">Daphni</a>, <a href="https://www.techstars.com">Techstars</a>, Checkout.com CEO Guillaume Pousaz and various business angels.</p>
<p>With this funding round, the company plans to expand its team to 20 people, add new clients and iterate on its product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The autonomous vehicle startup Aurora Innovation said Tuesday it has reached an agreement with Volvo to jointly develop autonomous semi trucks for North America.</p>
<p>The partnership, which the two companies say will span several years and is through Volvo&#8217;s Autonomous Solutions unit, will focus on trucks built to operate autonomously on highways between hubs for Volvo customers. The Aurora Driver technology stack – Aurora’s self-driving software, computer and sensor suite – will be integrated into Volvo trucks.</p>
<p>The announcement comes fresh on the heels of the startup’s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">acquisition of Uber’s self-driving subsidiary</a> and a separate deal with Toyota to develop self-driving minivans. Aurora now has partnerships with two of the three largest trucking manufacturers – Paccar and Volvo – that produce and sell nearly 50% of all Class 8 trucks in the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our previously announced collaborations with partners such as PACCAR will continue in parallel to the collaboration with Volvo,” an Aurora spokesperson told TechCrunch. “As Paccar’s first self-driving technology partner, the unique nature of our partnership enables us to build Paccar’s first redundant truck that will be able to operate without a safety driver, bring it to market first, and deploy it broadly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aurora said its Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave lidar  — through its acquisitions of companies Blackmore and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/aurora-acquires-a-second-lidar-company-in-push-to-bring-self-driving-trucks-to-the-road/">OURS Technology</a> — will be key to solving autonomous long-range trucking. Lidar, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/12/wtf-is-lidar/">light detection and ranging radar</a>, is considered to be a necessary component of self-driving systems. Aurora&#8217;s pitch&#8217;s is that unlike traditional time-of-flight lidar, its technology provides the long-range visibility needed to be able to spot hazards with enough time to stop or slow down.</p>
<p>The announcement also marks a major acceleration for Volvo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle arm, Volvo Autonomous Solutions. It&#8217;s the business unit&#8217;s first deal to bring autonomous trucking to the road.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2017, Aurora has rapidly become one of the leaders in self-driving tech, attracting backing from Amazon, Sequoia Capital and Greylock Partners. The company was founded by former executives of Uber, Tesla and Google.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MobiKwik said on Tuesday it was investigating claims of data breach after a website claimed to have exposed private information of nearly 100 million users of the Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/mobikwik-ebidta-positive/">mobile payments startup</a>.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, a site on the dark web claimed it had 8.2 terabytes of MobiKwik user data. The data included phone numbers, email addresses, scrambled passwords, transactions logs, and partial payment card numbers.</p>
<p>The website also claimed that it had &#8220;know your customer&#8221; (KYA) documents of 3.5 million users, and each visit to the website displayed four random images from the data dump. KYC documents are required in India for users who want to access certain services without any limitations. Local law requires a mobile wallet firm in India, for instance, to support monthly transactions exceeding a certain limit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The dark web site features a searchable database that allows users to look up their phone number or email to verify the authenticity of the data breach claim. TechCrunch was able to verify the accuracy of the data in several cases.</p>
<p>A seller on a well-known cybercrime forum claims to be selling access to the database for 1.2 bitcoin — about $70,000.</p>
<p>The Sequoia Capital India-backed startup says it can&#8217;t yet prove if the data actually belongs to MobiKwik users. “It is incorrect to suggest that the data available on the darkweb has been accessed from MobiKwik or any identified source,” the startup <a href="https://blog.mobikwik.com/message-from-the-company/">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Rajshekhar Rajaharia, a security researcher, told TechCrunch that he alerted MobiKwik about this alleged security breach last month. In a statement, MobiKwik said the company had conducted a thorough investigation and did not find any evidence of a breach.</p>
<p>However, a screenshot leaked to TechCrunch shows a MobiKwik official asking an Amazon representative last month for logs relating to its cloud service after the startup &#8220;came to know that our S3 [cloud storage] data is downloaded by some other person outside the organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup said its legal team will take “strict action against the so-called security researcher.” Rajaharia told TechCrunch that it’s his right as a user to know if his financial data is safe and that he doesn’t have the resources to fight legal battles.</p>
<p>MobiKwik said it was closely working with authorities and was confident that security protocols to store sensitive data are “robust and have not been breached.” It added that it was getting a third-party to conduct a forensic data security audit. &#8220;We are committed to a safe and secure Digital India.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.capitolis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitolis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which makes technology for capital markets players such as investment and merchant banks, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has closed on a $90 million Series C funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing included participation from existing backers Index Ventures, Sequoia Capital, S Capital, Spark Capital, SVB Capital, Citi, J.P. Morgan and State Street and brings Capitolis’ total funding to date to $170 million. SVB Capital and Spark Capital co-led a $40 million Series B for the company in November 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitolis CEO and founder Gil Mandelzis said the company’s mission since its 2017 inception has been to “fundamentally re-imagine how the capital markets operate&#8221;</span> after the last financial crisis and the &#8220;bold steps taken by regulators&#8221; in its aftermath.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup says that its <span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced workflow technology and proprietary algorithms</span> allows banks, hedge funds and asset managers to eliminate, move or create trading positions by collaborating with other financial institutions. <span style="font-weight: 400;">That results in freed up capital, open credit lines and access to capital from a bigger pool of sources, the company claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Capitolis&#8217; network software is designed to help financial institutions optimize their balance sheets and reduce risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-five financial institutions currently use the Capitolis platform, according to the company’s website. The company says it grew its revenue run rate by &#8220;sixfold&#8221; in 2020. Since 2019, Capitolis has experienced a 230% increase in the number of users of its platform. To date, Capitolis says it has optimized $9 trillion in terms of gross notional balances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Rampell, partner at a16z, said that his firm believes that what sets Capitolis apart from other financial services players “is the sheer scale of management’s ambition and the substantial talent, technology and capital milestones they have achieved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York-based company says it plans to use its new capital toward product development and to boost its customer support and sales staff. It plans to increase its headcount from 90 today to over 150 by year’s end.</span></p>
<p>Capitolis currently covers foreign exchange products and equity swaps. It says it could expand into others if there is client demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Self-driving and robotics startup Cartken has partnered with REEF Technology, a startup that operates parking lots and neighborhood hubs, to bring self-driving delivery robots to the streets of downtown Miami.</p>
<p>With this announcement, Cartken officially comes out of stealth mode. The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/the-engineers-behind-googles-bookbot-have-launched-a-delivery-robot-startup/">founded by ex-Google engineers and colleagues behind the unrequited Bookbot</a>, was formed to develop market-ready tech in self-driving, AI-powered robotics and delivery operations in 2019, but the team has kept operations under wraps until now. This is Cartken&#8217;s first large deployment of self-driving robots on sidewalks.</p>
<p>After a few test months, the REEF-branded electric-powered robots are now delivering dinner orders from REEF&#8217;s network of delivery-only kitchens to people located within a 3/4-mile radius in downtown Miami. The robots, which are insulated and thus can preserve the heat of a plate of spaghetti or other hot food, are pre-stationed at designated logistics hubs and dispatched with orders for delivery as the food is prepared.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to show how future-forward Miami can be,&#8221; Matt Lindenberger, REEF&#8217;s chief technology officer, told TechCrunch. &#8220;This is a great chance to show off the capabilities of the tech. The combination of us having a big presence in Miami, the fact that there are a lot of challenges around congestion as Covid subsides, still shows a really good environment where we can show how this tech can work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lindenberg said Miami is a great place to start, but it&#8217;s just the beginning, with potential for the Cartken robots to be used for REEF&#8217;s other last-mile delivery businesses. Currently, only two restaurant delivery robots are operating in Miami, but Lindenberger said the company is planning to expand further into the city and outward into Fort Lauderdale, as well as other large metros the company operates in, such as Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles and eventually New York.</p>
<p>Lindenberger is hoping the presence of robots in the streets can act as a &#8220;force multiplier&#8221; allowing them to scale while maintaining quality of service in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing an explosion in deliveries right now in a post-pandemic world and we foresee that to continue, so these types of no-contact, zero-emission automation techniques are really critical,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TqGiLbVMaq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starship-technologies-ceo-lex-bayer-on-focus-and-opportunity-in-autonomous-delivery/">Starship Technologies CEO Lex Bayer on focus and opportunity in autonomous delivery</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Starship Technologies CEO Lex Bayer on focus and opportunity in autonomous delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starship-technologies-ceo-lex-bayer-on-focus-and-opportunity-in-autonomous-delivery/embed/#?secret=TqGiLbVMaq" data-secret="TqGiLbVMaq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cartken&#8217;s robots are powered by a combination of machine learning and rules-based programming to react to every situation that could occur, even if that just means safely stopping and asking for help, Christian Bersch, CEO of Cartken, told TechCrunch. REEF would have supervisors on site to remotely control the robot if needed, a caveat that was included in the<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/1027/BillText/er/PDF"> 2017 legislation that allowed for the operation of self-driving delivery robots in Florida</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology at the end of the day is very similar to that of a self-driving car,&#8221; said Bersch. &#8220;The robot is seeing the environment, planning around obstacles like pedestrians or lampposts. If there&#8217;s an unknown situation, someone can help the robot out safely because it can stop on a dime. But it&#8217;s important to also have that level of autonomy on the robot because it can react in a split second, faster than anybody remotely could, if something happens like someone jumps in front of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>REEF marks specific operating areas on the map for the robots and Cartken tweaks the configuration for the city, accounting for specific situations a robot might need to deal with, so that when the robots are given a delivery address, they can make moves and operate like any other delivery driver. Only this driver has an LTE connection and is constantly updating its location so REEF can integrate it into its fleet management capabilities.</p>

<p>Eventually, Lindenberger said, they&#8217;re hoping to be able to offer the option for customers to choose robot delivery on the major food delivery platforms REEF works with like P<span style="font-weight: 400;">ostmates, UberEats, DoorDash or GrubHub. Customers would receive a text when the robot arrives so they could go outside and meet it. However, the tech is not quite there yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently the robots only make it street-level, and then the food is passed off to a human who delivers it directly to the door, which is a service that most customers prefer. Navigating into an apartment complex and to a customer&#8217;s unit is difficult for a robot to manage just yet, and many customers aren&#8217;t quite ready to interact directly with a robot. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an interim step, but this was a path for us to move forward quickly with the technology without having any other boundaries,&#8221; said Lindenberger. &#8220;Like with any new tech, you want to take it in steps. So a super important step which we&#8217;ve now taken and works very well is the ability to dispatch robots within a certain radius and know that they&#8217;re going to arrive there. That in and of itself is a huge step and it allows us to learn what kind of challenges you have in terms of that very last step. Then we can begin to work with Cartken to solve that last piece. It&#8217;s a big step just being able to do this automation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Substack didn&#8217;t invent the paid newsletter, but the startup&#8217;s early success with the model is enticing previous backers to more than double down on the media startup.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Last evening, <a href="https://www.axios.com/substack-andreessen-horowitz-newsletter-36cb98ea-a7b3-43b1-883a-fa45586eaad4.html">Axios reported</a> that Substack is &#8220;raising $65 million in new venture capital&#8221; at a valuation of &#8220;around $650 million.&#8221; As you&#8217;ve already guessed, Axios goes on to report that Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) will likely lead the investment.</p>
<p>That we&#8217;re seeing a16z pour more capital into what we could call the alt-media space is not a surprise. The investing group is ladling <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/01/25/doubling-down-marketing-update-new-media/">even more cash</a> into its in-house media efforts and has put a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">small archipelago of capital</a> into audio-based social media app Clubhouse. Its internal publishing schedule is in part an attempt to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/SMFL4US">get around traditional media</a>; the Clubhouse universe is an inverted one in which tech investors are celebrities, producers and gatekeepers. And Substack is a place where publications have bled some well-known talent, shifting the center of gravity in media.</p>

<p>Regardless, Substack&#8217;s new valuation and investment are eye-catching. This morning, I want to collect all that we can regarding Substack&#8217;s historical growth so that we can chew on its new valuation from the best vantage point. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2> $650 million?</h2>
<p>A little history to kick us off. Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/substack/company_financials">counts</a> Substack&#8217;s total funding to date at $17.4 million. <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> puts the number at $21.21 million, inclusive of debt. Both sources agree that the company&#8217;s most recent round came in July 2019. PitchBook pegs the company&#8217;s valuation at $48.65 million at that date.</p>
<p>Raising $17 million in cash around 20 months ago, regardless of debt, is an amount of capital that the company could easily have burned through by now. Raising more funds is therefore not a surprise.</p>
<p>But the size of the new round is notable, as is its constituent valuation. Series A and B rounds have been <a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/Q4_2020_PitchBook_NVCA_Venture_Monitor.pdf">growing in size</a> in recent years. But a $65 million Series B would stand out, even by 2021 standards. Not shockingly so, but enough that any company raising that sum at its implied level of maturity would demand our attention. That we&#8217;re all familiar with Substack only makes the sum more curious.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal this morning <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-03-30-PayPal-Launches-Checkout-with-Crypto">announced</a> the launch of Checkout with Crypto, a new feature that will allow consumers to check out at millions of online businesses using cryptocurrency. The feature expands on PayPal&#8217;s current investments in the cryptocurrency market, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">include its partnership</a> with <a href="https://www.paxos.com/">Paxos</a> to power its service that allows customers to buy, sell and hold a range of cryptocurrencies, and more recently, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/paypal-to-acquire-cryptocurrency-custody-startup-curv/">acquisition</a> of cryptocurrency security startup Curv.</p>
<p>According to PayPal, customers with cryptocurrency holdings in the U.S. will be able to check out using their cryptocurrency at millions of businesses. The company plans to expand the service to reach PayPal&#8217;s 29 million global online businesses in months ahead. The feature will also work without any additional integrations or fees required by the businesses themselves.</p>
<p>Essentially, Checkout with Crypto allows the customers to sell their cryptocurrency through PayPal at the time of checkout, then settle the actual transaction in U.S. dollars. For the businesses, that means nothing really changes on their end &#8212; they&#8217;re still being paid in USD, not cryptocurrency. But PayPal&#8217;s feature makes it possible for this transaction to take place within the same checkout flow, making it easier on shoppers to quickly make their purchases using cryptocurrency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At launch, the service will support Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash &#8212; but only one type of cryptocurrency can be used for each purchase.</p>
<p>If the customer has enough cryptocurrency to pay for their online purchase, then the Checkout with Crypto feature will appear, alongside other traditional payment methods, like the customer&#8217;s bank account, PayPal balance, or credit or debit card. Like other payment methods, Checkout with Crypto will also include PayPal&#8217;s safety and security benefits, including fraud protection, return shipping and purchase protection on eligible items, PayPal notes.</p>
<p>After the transaction completes, the customer will receive both a record of the cryptocurrency sale, as well as their purchase receipt.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">had announced its plans</a> to launch support for checkout with cryptocurrency last year, when it first entered the cryptocurrency market. It said that after providing support for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, it would launch a checkout feature in 2021.</p>
<p>Today, PayPal makes makes money by <a href="https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees">charging transaction fees</a> when customers buy or sell their cryptocurrencies, which is why it&#8217;s not placing any fees on their merchants themselves.</p>
<p>PayPal&#8217;s launch will help to dramatically expand the number of places where cryptocurrency can be used for real-world purchases, which could help accelerate mainstream adoption of digital currencies.</p>
<p>According to Jim Magats, PayPal SVP, Omni Payments, it&#8217;s historically been difficult for businesses to offer cryptocurrency as a payment option due to integration requirements, technical barriers, and general lack of awareness among consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Checkout with Crypto allows businesses to accept the proceeds from sales of cryptocurrency as a payment type, all within the current PayPal integration, removing the need for any additional action for businesses,&#8221; Magats said. &#8220;PayPal handles the crypto sale and conversion with the consumer and passes on U.S. dollars to the business for the purchase, streamlining the process for businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>PayPal&#8217;s move comes shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/elon-musk-declares-you-can-now-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin-in-the-u-s/">last week&#8217;s announcement from Tesla</a>, which said U.S. customers could now buy a car using bitcoin, and Japanese e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/e-commerce-giant-rakuten-now-lets-users-shop-with-cryptocurrency">Rakuten&#8217;s news earlier this month</a> where it said users could check out with online merchants in Japan using cryptocurrencies. And Visa yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/visa-supports-transaction-settlement-with-usdc-stablecoin/">announced</a> it would allow payment settlements using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the use of digital payments and digital currencies accelerates, the introduction of Checkout with Crypto continues our focus on driving mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, while continuing to offer PayPal customers choice and flexibility in the ways they can pay using the PayPal wallet,&#8221; President and CEO Dan Schulman said, in a statement about the launch. &#8220;Enabling cryptocurrencies to make purchases at businesses around the world is the next chapter in driving the ubiquity and mass acceptance of digital currencies,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="note-details">
<p id="speakable-summary">From the early success of Crypto Kitties to the explosive growth of NBA Top Shot, <a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a> has been at the forefront of the cryptocurrency collectible craze known as NFTs.</p>
<p>Now the company is reaping the benefits of its trailblazing status with a new $305 million financing led by some of the biggest names in Hollywood, sports, and investing.</p>
<p>The new round values the company at a whopping $2.6 billion, according to multiple media reports, and comes at a time when NFTs<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc"> have captured the popular imagination</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrNOYudaMAc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Leading the company&#8217;s financing was Coatue, the financial services firm that&#8217;s behind many of the biggest later stage tech deals. But heavy hitters from the entertainment world also took their cut &#8212; these are folks like NBA legend Michael Jordan as well as current players and funds including Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Kyle Lowry, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Drummond, Alex Caruso, Michael Carter-Williams, Josh Hart, Udonis Haslem, JaVale McGee, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Klay Thompson, Nikola Vucevic, Thad Young, and Richard Seymour’s 93 Ventures.</p>
<p>Entertainment and music heavyweights including Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary&#8217;s Sound Ventures, Will Smith and Keisuke Honda&#8217;s Dreamers VC, Shawn Mendes and Andrew Gertler&#8217;s AG Ventures, Shay Mitchell, and 2 Chainz also bought in on the action.</p>
<p>And from the venture world comes other strategic investors like Andreessen Horowitz, The Chernin Group, USV, Version One, and Venrock.</p>
<p>The company said it would use the funds to continue building out NBA Top Shot and expanding the updated digital trading card platform to other sports and a broader creator community.</p>
<p>Top Shot has already notched over $500 million in sales for its animated trading cards featuring things like LeBron James dunking and the sky (at least for now) is seemingly the limit for the collectible applications of blockchain.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like the one thing that cryptocurrency can do really well and it&#8217;s been embraced far beyond the world of sports collectibles. The recent $69 million sale of a digital piece of art at Christies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">also marks a watershed moment for art world</a>.</p>

<p>“NBA Top Shot is successful because it taps into basketball fandom – it’s a new and more exciting way for people to connect with their favorite teams and players,” said Roham Gharegozlou, CEO of Dapper Labs. “We want to bring the same magic to other sports leagues as well as help other entertainment studios and independent creators find their own approaches in exploring open platforms. NFTs unlock a new model for monetization that benefits the fans much more than advertising or sponsorships.”</p>
<p>Powering the Top Shot system and Dapper Labs&#8217; other offerings is a new blockchain protocol called Flow, which purports to handle mainstream consumer applications at scale, and can support mass adoption.</p>
<p>Flow also allows for transactions using fiat currency and credit cards in addition to provide a much needed ease of cryptocurrency, and can keep customers safe from the fraud or theft common in cryptocurrency systems, according to a statement from Dapper Labs.</p>

<p>Flow enables NFT marketplaces and other decentralized applications that need to scale to handle mainstream demand without extremely high transaction costs (“gas fees”) or environmental concerns, the company said.</p>
<p>“NBA Top Shot is one of the best demonstrations we’ve seen of how quickly new technology can change the landscape for media and sports fans,” said Kevin Durant, Co-Founder of Thirty Five Ventures. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to follow the progress with everything happening on Flow blockchain and use our platform with the Boardroom to connect with fans in a new way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already companies like Warner Music Group, Ubisoft, Warner Media, and the UFC, as well as thousands of third party developers, artists, and other creators are using the Flow mainnet to sell collectible cards, and develop custodial wallets.</p>
<p>Additional investors in the round include: MLB players like Tim Beckham and Nolan Arenado; NFL players: Ken Crawley, Thomas Davis, Stefon Diggs, Dee Ford, Malcom Jenkins, Rodney McLeod, Jordan Matthew, Devin McCourty, Jason McCourty, DK Metcalf, Tyrod Taylor, and Trent Williams; team ownership including Vivek Ranadive (Kings), and notable sports investors Bolt Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://slicelife.com">Slice</a>, the online ordering platform for independent pizzerias, announced two new offerings this morning — a point-of-sale system designed specifically for those businesses, as well as a rewards program for diners.</p>
<p>The launch of the new <a href="https://register.slicelife.com">Slice Register</a> builds on last year&#8217;s acquisition of point-of-sale company Instore, and <a href="https://blog.slicelife.com/slice-welcomes-matt-niehaus-svp-payments/">the appointment of its CEO Matt Niehaus</a> as Slice&#8217;s senior vice president for payments.</p>
<p>Pizzerias might seem to be a narrow focus for a point-of-sale system, particularly given all the other POS products out there, but Niehaus suggested that many of the 15,000 pizzerias in Slice&#8217;s network are still relying on cash registers and pen-and-paper: &#8220;If you run a pizzeria, you are certainly great at making pizza, but you are typically less comfortable with the accounting side.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He also said that existing POS systems aren&#8217;t really designed for the needs and workflows of a pizzeria. Slice founder and CEO Ilir Sela added that most of them were designed for offline ordering first, with online support added later. And Niehaus suggested that the average local pizzeria is only seeing 19% of their orders coming from online sources (compared to 75% for the average Domino&#8217;s location), that&#8217;s a real problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Domino&#8217;s is really the competition, not the POS companies,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131877" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131877" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2131877" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Slice-Register.jpg?w=680" alt="Slice Register" width="680" height="459" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Slice-Register.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Slice-Register.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Slice-Register.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Slice-Register.jpg?resize=768,518 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Slice-Register.jpg?resize=680,459 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Slice-Register.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131877" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Slice</p></div></p>
<p>So the Slice Register is a combined software and hardware (including an iPad) solution. Naturally, it integrates with Slice&#8217;s online ordering and also includes support for email and mobile marketing, as well as a consolidated view of each customer. Niehaus said that among other things, it&#8217;s designed to &#8220;grab those customers on one platform and nudge them online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slice Register is available to pizzerias at no initial charge for the hardware or software. The only fee in 2021 will be for payment processing, with additional pricing announced coming next year.</p>
<p>As for the new Slice Rewards program, diners who order pizzas through Slice will get a free large cheese pizza for every eight orders of $15 or more. (Slice, not the restaurant, is paying for the free pizza.) Sela described this as a &#8220;very Domino&#8217;s-like program,&#8221; except that it works across independent pizzerias.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we’re learning the local consumer has up to four local favorites, and they love all of these locations equally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What we think is really cool is, you&#8217;re going to get rewarded for buying at all four of your local favorites.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Spotify are up a fraction this morning after the company <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-30/spotify-acquires-locker-room-and-announces-plans-for-a-new-live-audio-experience/">announced</a> that it will acquire <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betty-labs">Betty Labs</a>, the company behind the Locker Room, which focuses on live audio. Prior to the deal, Betty Labs had raised more than $9 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betty-labs">per Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<p>Spotify is best known for its music streaming business, but has expanded into new audio formats while hunting for both a competitive edge in its core market, and methods of generating pricing leverage.</p>
<p>The European tech giant has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/why-spotify-is-betting-big-on-podcasting/">spent heavily in recent years</a> on its podcast efforts, bringing marquee shows to its platform on an exclusive basis. By making its own audio-world as differentiated as possible, Spotify may be able to charge more over time, creating future growth opportunities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Swedish public company was not shy in describing its goals for the Betty Labs deal, writing on its own blog that it will &#8220;evolve and expand Locker Room into an enhanced live audio experience for a wider range of creators and fans,&#8221; with forthcoming content including &#8220;a range of sports, music, and cultural programming, as well as a host of interactive features that enable creators to connect with audiences in real time.&#8221;</p>
<p>A mix of radio and Clubhouse, perhaps? TechCrunch will tinker with the tech when possible, as we have in recent weeks with Clubhouse and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter&#8217;s equivalent product, Spaces</a>.</p>
<p>Clubhouse, which helped boost the present-day audio craze to new heights, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">attracted heavyweight backers</a> and a good number of early fans. But the app has also seen its audience level off in recent weeks (<a href="https://www.appannie.com/">AppAnnie data</a>), perhaps leaving room in the market for Spotify or another audio incumbent to step in and steal its thunder.</p>
<p>Spotify has a history of entering new audio categories and taking over. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/#:~:text=Podcast%20listeners%20will%20also%20account,benefit%20Spotify%20at%20Apple's%20expense.">TechCrunch reported</a> earlier this month, &#8220;Spotify’s U.S. podcast listenership will surpass Apple Podcasts for the first time this year when 28.2 million U.S. users will listen to podcasts on Spotify at least monthly, compared with 28.0 million via Apple Podcasts,&#8221; <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-podcast-listener-numbers-will-surpass-apples-this-year">per data from eMarketer</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, it wasn&#8217;t cheap, but Spotify wants to lead all audio categories it appears, so its planned move into Clubhouse territory should worry current startups in the space.</p>
<p>If Spotify&#8217;s distribution advantage of working on every platform, and having a huge install base, will work in its efforts to own a new slice of the audio world is something we&#8217;ll find out this year. Until then, if you have an iOS device, you can still use Clubhouse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple this morning announced that it will be returning to an all-virtual format for a second year. The company went online-only for the first time in 2020, as Covid-19 ground in-person events to a halt. While vaccine rollouts have begun in much of the world, the return of the in-person event industry still seems iffy for most of the rest of the year. The event will run June 7-11.</p>
<p>“We are working to make WWDC21 our biggest and best yet, and are excited to offer Apple developers new tools to support them as they create apps that change the way we live, work, and play,” Developer Relations VP Susan Prescott said in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-is-back-in-its-all-online-format/">release tied to the news</a>.</p>
<p>The virtual format certainly has its advantage &#8212; accessibility being at the top of the list. Apple said last year&#8217;s was its &#8220;biggest ever,&#8221; and expects roughly 28 million developers from around the world at this one. In addition to not having to deal with traveling &#8212; not to mention the South Bay hotel crunch &#8212; the company offers up free access to the event for all qualified developers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The event spans Apple&#8217;s different operating systems, bringing new versions of iOS/iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. Last year also delivered the big, long awaited arrival of Apple&#8217;s transition to first-part silicon for its Macs. Hardware news has otherwise been fairly hit or miss at the event, but after a bottleneck in H1 2020, the company could have some surprises on the way on that front.</p>
<p>Along with the big keynote and a week&#8217;s worth of developer-themed programming, the company hosts events like the Swift Student Challenge, a competition focused on young coders. Apple notes that it will also being using the opportunity to donate $1 million to SJ Aspires, an education initiative based in San Jose, where the in-person event has been held in recent years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI has become a fundamental cornerstone of how tech companies are building tools for salespeople: they are useful for supercharging (and complementing) the abilities of talented humans, or helping them keep themselves significantly more organised; even if in some cases &#8212; as with chatbots &#8212; they are replacing them altogether. In the latest development, <a href="https://6sense.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6sense</a>, one of the pioneers in using AI to boost the sales and marketing experience, is announcing a major round of funding that underscores the traction AI tools are seeing in the sales realm.</p>
<p>The startup has raised $125 million at a valuation of $2.1 billion, a Series D being led by D1 Capital Partners, with Sapphire Ventures, Tiger Global and previous backer Insight Partners also participating.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the funding to expand its platform and its predictive capabilities across a wider range of sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For some context, this is a huge jump for the company compared to its last fundraise: at the end of 2019, when it raised $40 million, it was valued at a mere $300 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/63251-83/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from PitchBook.</a></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not a big surprise: at a time when a lot of companies are going through &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; and investing in better tools for their employees to work more efficiently remotely (especially important for sales people who might have previously worked together in physical teams), 6sense is on track for its fourth year of more than 100% growth, adding 100 new customers in the fourth quarter alone. It caters to small, medium, and large businesses, and some of its customers include Dell, Mediafly, Sage and SocialChorus.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s approach speaks to a classic problem that AI tools are often tasked with solving: the data that sales people need to use and keep up to date on customer accounts, and critically targets, lives in a number of different silos &#8212; they can include CRM systems, or large databases outside of the company, or signals on social media.</p>
<p>While some tools are being built to handle all of that from the ground up, 6sense takes a different approach, providing a way of ingesting and utilizing all of it to get a complete picture of a company and the individuals a salesperson might want to target within it. It takes into account some of the harder nuts to crack in the market, such as how to track &#8220;anonymous buying behavior&#8221; to a more concrete customer name; how to prioritizes accounts according to those most likely to buy; and planning for multi-channel campaigns.</p>
<p>6sense has patented the technology it uses to achieve this and calls its approach building an &#8220;ID graph.&#8221; (Which you can think of as the sales equivalent of the social graph of Facebook, or the knowledge graph that LinkedIn has aimed to build mapping skills and jobs globally.) The key with 6sense is that it is building a set of tools that not just sales people can use, but marketers too &#8212; useful since the two sit much closer together at companies these days.</p>
<p>Jason Zintak, the company&#8217;s CEO (who worked for many years as a salesperson himself, so gets the pain points very well), referred to the approach and concept behind 6sense as &#8220;revtech&#8221;: aimed at organizations in the business whose work generates revenue for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our AI is focused on signal, identifying companies that are in the market to buy something,&#8221; said Zintak in an interview. &#8220;Once you have that you can sell to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>That focus and traction with customers is one reason investors are interested.</p>
<p class="p1">“Customer conversations are a critical part of our due diligence process, and the feedback from 6sense customers is among the best we’ve heard,” said Dan Sundheim, founder and chief investment officer at D1 Capital Partners, in a statement. “Improving revenue results is a goal for every business, but it’s easier said than done. The way 6sense consistently creates value for customers made it clear that they deliver a unique, must-have solution for B2B revenue teams.”</p>
<p class="p1">Teddie Wardi at Insight highlights that AI and the predictive elements of 6sense&#8217;s technology &#8212; which have been a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/19/6sense-a-predictive-sales-intelligence-tool-exits-stealth-with-12m-led-by-battery-venrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent</a> part of the product since it was founded &#8212; are what help it stand out.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;AI generally is a buzzword, but here it is a key part of the solution, the brand behind the platform,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;Instead of having massive funnels, 6sense switches the whole thing around. Catching the right person at the right time and in the right context make sales and marketing more effective. And the AI piece is what really powers it. It uses signals to construct the buyer journey and tell the sales person when it is the right time to engage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX conducted yet another high-altitude test flight of its Starship prototype spacecraft on Tuesday, the fourth of these so far. Like all the flight testing and construction of Starship prototypes, this one took off from SpaceX&#8217;s Boca Chica, Texas development facility – a location recently renamed &#8216;Starbase&#8217; by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Unfortunately, things didn&#8217;t go great for SpaceX — the SN11 prototype was lost during its final descent. Reports from the scene suggest a large explosion that scattered debris around the landing site.</p>
<p>At this point in the program, SpaceX&#8217;s aim is to fly Starship to a high altitude (roughly 32,000 &#8211; 40,000 feet), execute a &#8216;belly flop&#8217; maneuver and then bring it back to Earth with a controlled re-orientation to vertical, followed by a soft landing on its feet. Before today, SpaceX has made progress towards that goal, with the first two attempts exploding on a harder-than-landing impact, and the third landing vertically, before also exploding just under 10 minutes later after resting apparently secure before that.</p>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s stated specific goals at this point are around testing is to gather data on the control flaps that Starship uses to control its orientation and prepare for that soft landing. SpaceX wants to study this with low altitude flights so that it has the data it needs to make it more likely to pull this off once it starts orbital flight testing later on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Because of foggy conditions this AM in Texas at the launch site, SpaceX didn&#8217;t have great views of the flight test, and the company hasn&#8217;t yet revealed what went wrong during the mission, but will be investigating and sharing details later on. <strong>UPDATE: Musk now says there was an issue on the second engine used during the landing burn:</strong></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed. </p>
<p>Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.</p>

<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted this shortly after the incident:</p>
