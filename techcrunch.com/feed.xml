	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Privacy is a word on everyone’s mind nowadays &#8212; even Big Tech is getting in on it. Most recently, Apple joined the user privacy movement with its App Tracking Transparency feature, a cornerstone of the iOS 14.5 software update. Earlier this year, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/29/tim-cook-says-privacy-one-of-the-top-issues-of-the-century">Tim Cook</a> even mentioned privacy in the same breath as the climate crisis and labeled it one of the top issues of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Apple’s solution is a strong move in the right direction and sends a powerful message, but is it enough? Ostensibly, it relies on users to get informed about how apps track them and, if they wish to, regulate or turn off the tracking. In the words of Soviet satirists Ilf and Petrov, “The cause of helping the drowning is in the drowning’s own hands.” It’s a system that, historically speaking, has not produced great results.</p>
<p>Today’s online consumer is drowning indeed &#8212; in the deluge of privacy policies, cookie pop-ups, and various web and app tracking permissions. New regulations just pile more privacy disclosures on, and businesses are mostly happy to oblige. They pass the information burden to the end user, whose only rational move is to accept blindly because reading through the heaps of information does not make sense rationally, economically or subjectively. To save that overburdened consumer, we have only one option: We have to kill the standard privacy notice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>A notice that goes unnoticed</h2>
<p>Studies show that online consumers often struggle with standard-form notices. A majority of online users <a href="http://kirstenmartin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JPPM-Martin-Privacy-Notices-as-Tabula-Rasa.pdf">expect</a> that if a company has published a document with the title “privacy notice” or “privacy policy” on its website, then it will not collect, analyze or share their personal information with third parties. At the same time, a similar majority of consumers have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401218307965">serious concerns</a> about being tracked and targeted for intrusive advertising.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Online businesses and major platforms gear their privacy notices and other relevant data disclosures toward obtaining consent, not toward educating and explaining.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s a privacy double whammy. To get on the platform, users have to accept the privacy notice. By accepting it, they allow tracking and intrusive ads. If they actually read the privacy notice before accepting, that costs them valuable time and can be challenging and frustrating. If Facebook’s privacy policy is as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html">hard to comprehend</a> as German philosopher Immanuel Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason,” we have a problem. In the end, the option to decline is merely a formality; not accepting the privacy policy means not getting access to the platform.</p>
<p>So, what use is the privacy notice in its current form? For companies, on the one hand, it legitimizes their data-processing practices. It’s usually a document created by lawyers, for lawyers without thinking one second about the interests of the real users. Safe in the knowledge that nobody reads such disclosures, some businesses not only deliberately fail to make the text understandable, they pack it with all kinds of silly or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/01/25/the-worlds-worst-privacy-policy/?sh=57c0b40022c7">refreshingly honest</a> content.</p>
<p>One company even claimed its users’ immortal souls and their <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0607/opinions-disclosure-legal-contracts-medical-ethics-ideas-opinions.html?sh=61e5c1795837">right to eternal life</a>. For consumers, on the other hand, the obligatory checkmark next to the privacy notice can be a nuisance &#8212; or it can lull them into a false sense of data security.</p>
<p>On the unlikely occasion that a privacy notice is so blatantly disagreeable that it pushes users away from one platform and toward an alternative, this is often not a real solution, either. Monetizing data has become the dominant business model online, and personal data ultimately flows toward the same Big Tech giants. Even if you’re not directly on their platforms, many of the platforms you <em>are</em> on work with Big Tech through plugins, buttons, cookies and the like. Resistance seems futile.</p>

<h2>A regulatory framework from another time</h2>
<p>If companies are deliberately producing opaque privacy notices that nobody reads, maybe lawmakers and regulators could intervene and help improve users’ data privacy? Historically, this has not been the case. In pre-digital times, lawmakers were responsible for a multitude of pre-contractual disclosure mandates that resulted in the heaps of paperwork that accompany leasing an apartment, buying a car, opening a bank account or taking out a mortgage.</p>
<p>When it comes to the digital realm, legislation has been reactive, not proactive, and it lags behind technological development considerably. It took the EU about two decades of Google and one decade of Facebook to come up with the General Data Protection Regulation, a comprehensive piece of legislation that still does not rein in rampant data collection practices. This is just a symptom of a larger problem: Today’s politicians and legislators do not understand the internet. How do you regulate something if you don’t know how it works?</p>
<p>Many lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic often do not understand how tech companies operate and how they make their money with user data — or pretend not to understand for various reasons. Instead of tackling the issue themselves, legislators ask companies to inform the users directly, in whatever “clear and comprehensible” language they see fit. It’s part laissez-faire, part “I don’t care.”</p>
<p>Thanks to this attitude, we are fighting 21st-century challenges &#8212; such as online data privacy, profiling and digital identity theft &#8212; with the legal logic of Ancient Rome: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2942873">consent</a>. Not to knock Roman law, but Marcus Aurelius never had to read the iTunes Privacy Policy in full.</p>
<p>Online businesses and major platforms, therefore, gear their privacy notices and other relevant data disclosures toward obtaining consent, not toward educating and explaining. It keeps the data flowing and it makes for great PR when the opportunity for a token privacy gesture appears. Still, a growing number of users are waking up to the setup. It is time for a change.</p>
<h2>A call to companies to do the right thing</h2>
<p>We have seen that it’s difficult for users to understand all the “legalese,” and they have nowhere to go even if they did. We have also noted lawmakers’ inadequate knowledge and motivation to regulate tech properly. It is up to digital businesses themselves to act, now that growing numbers of online users are stating their discontent and frustration. If data privacy is one of our time’s greatest challenges, it requires concerted action. Just like countries around the world pledged to lower their carbon emissions, enterprises must also band together and commit to protecting their users’ privacy.</p>
<p>So, here’s a plea to tech companies large and small: Kill your standard privacy notices! Don’t write texts that almost no user understands to protect yourselves against potential legal claims so that you can continue collecting private user data. Instead, use privacy notices that are addressed to your users and that everybody can understand.</p>
<p>And don’t stop there &#8212; don&#8217;t only talk the talk but walk the walk: Develop products that do not rely on the collection and processing of personal data. Return to the internet’s open-source, protocol roots, and deliver value to your community, not to Big Tech and their advertisers. It is possible, it is profitable and it is rewarding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bentley Motors, the 102-year-old ultra-luxury automaker under Volkswagen Group, revealed its newest hybrid model on Tuesday. The company says this latest iteration of the Flying Spur Hybrid is its most environmentally friendly vehicle yet.</p>
<p>This new model is part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/bentley-is-making-the-shift-to-an-all-electric-lineup/">Bentley&#8217;s Beyond100 plan</a> to become a carbon neutral organization with an entirely electrified range by 2023 and a totally electric lineup by 2030. That&#8217;s a tall order, given the fact that the British company&#8217;s first all-electric vehicle is expected come to market in 2025. So far, Bentley only has this hybrid and another, the Bentayga SUV.</p>
<p>Most major OEMs have made such commitments, with Ford, GM, Mercedes, Kia and Nissan already producing electric models. If automakers like Bentley want to reach their goals, their production of electric vehicles will need to increase exponentially, especially if they want to keep up with Tesla, which is currently owning the luxury EV market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to a statement released by the company, the new powertrain of the hybrid Flying Spur combines a 2.9 liter V6 engine with an electric motor. The engine achieves 410 bhp and 550 NM of torque up to 5650 rpm, and the motor, which is located between the transmission and the engine, provides up to 134 bhp and 400NM of torque. When combined, the Flying Spur delivers an additional 95 bhp in comparison to the Bentayga hybrid.</p>
<p>The 14.1 kWh lithium ion battery charges in about two and half hours. The Flying Spur can cover over 435 miles when fully fueled, and it can go from 0 to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds, which is nearly the same as the V8 version of the vehicle, at a top speed of 177 mph.</p>
<p class="p1">When in the drivers seat, customers can choose between three E modes to manage battery usage. The EV Drive mode is the default when the car is turned on. The hybrid mode relies on data from the car&#8217;s intelligent navigation system when the driver is following directions somewhere to predict usage of the different E-modes and engine coasting. The vehicle automatically switches to the right mode for each part of the journey depending on what&#8217;s more fuel efficient. For example, EV driving is best when in the city, but the car might engage the V6 engine more on the highway. The third E-mode, hold, balances power between the engine and the battery to conserve electric energy, holding onto it for later use. This mode is usually put in place when the driver selects Sport mode.</p>
<p class="p1">The Flying Spur&#8217;s infotainment screen shows energy flow, range, battery level and charging information. Bentley will deliver the hybrid with all the necessary charging cables and provides customers with a Bentley-branded wallbox at no extra cost to store the at-home charge unit and cables.</p>
<p class="p1">Flying Spur Hybrid is available to order in most markets, but is currently not available in the E.U., U.K., Switzerland, Israel, Ukraine, Norway, Turkey and Vietnam, according to Bentley.</p>
<p>On the same day, Bentley also announced a partnership with single malt Scotch whisky manufacturer Macallan to &#8220;develop distinctive collaborations and further their vision of a more sustainable future,&#8221; according to a statement released by the company. The point of the partnership was unclear (encourage high-end drinking and driving?), and Bentley did not respond in time to requests for more information, but one somewhat clear outcome of the announcement is a commitment from the Macallan Estate, Macallan&#8217;s distillery, to have a fully electric passenger vehicle fleet by 2025. In addition, this year, Macallan will order two hybrid Bentleys for the estate.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For China-based companies hoping to list in the United States, the market likely just got much, much colder.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Chinese ride-hailing business Didi are off 22% this morning after the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/didi-get-hit-by-chinese-government-and-pelo-raises-150m/">hit by more regulatory activity</a> over the holiday weekend. The recently public company traded as high as $18.01 per share since it held an IPO last week; today, shares of Didi are worth just $12.09, off around a third from their 52-week high.</p>

<strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The decline in value follows a review by a Chinese cybersecurity agency that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">led to Didi being unable to onboard new users,</a> a decision that arrived as last week rolled to a close.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Over the weekend, Didi was hit with more regulatory action. This time, the Cyberspace Administration of China <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-07/04/c_1627016782176163.htm">said</a>, via an internet translation, that &#8220;after testing and verification, the &#8216;Didi Travel&#8217; App [was found to have] serious violations of laws and regulations in collecting and using personal information,&#8221; which led the agency to command app stores &#8220;to remove the &#8216;Didi Travel&#8217; app, and required [the company] to strictly follow the legal requirements and refer to relevant national standards to seriously rectify existing problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being yanked from relevant app stores was enough for Didi to <a href="https://ir.didiglobal.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/DiDi-Announces-App-Takedown-in-China/default.aspx">alert investors</a> that its mobile app &#8220;had the problem of collecting personal information in violation of relevant PRC laws and regulations.&#8221; Didi said that the change in its app availability &#8220;may have an adverse impact on its revenue in China.&#8221;</p>
<p>Understatement of the year, I reckon.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more going on than what Didi is enduring. As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/what-you-need-to-know-if-youre-investing-in-a-chinese-stock-ipo.html">CNBC reported</a>:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-launches-at-home-covid-19-test-collection-kit-for-customers">announced</a> this morning it would begin to sell its own brand of Covid-19 at-home tests to Amazon shoppers in the U.S. The test retails for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZR5XNBM/?ref_=dx_us_blog_0721_1">$39.99 on the Amazon.com website</a> and is available to any U.S. customer without a prescription. The Covid-19 PCR collection kit is shipped to the customer&#8217;s home via Amazon Prime, offering everything needed to perform a nasal swab. Customers will then return the collection tube with the swab inside via the included return box. Amazon says it will be able to provide results within 24 hours of receiving the sample at its lab.</p>
<p>The collection kit will be processed by Amazon&#8217;s in-house laboratory, which the company created during the pandemic as part of its <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazons-covid-19-testing-lab-processes-more-than-1-million-tests-for-front-line-employees">in-house Covid-19 testing program</a> for its frontline workers. To date, Amazon&#8217;s labs in the U.S. and U.K. have processed millions of tests from over 750,000 of its employees, the company says. With the new at-home kit, Amazon is expanding its U.S. lab&#8217;s capabilities to its retail shoppers.</p>
<p>Amazon says it&#8217;s using the more accurate <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antigen-tests-guidelines.html">PT-PCR method</a>, which means you will have to wait for the lab to process your results. It also notes the kits have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>According to the Amazon.com listing for the new<span class="Enhancement-inline"><span class="Enhancement-item"><a class="Link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZR5XNBM/?ref_=dx_us_blog_0721_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cms-ai="0"> Amazon COVID-19 Test Collection Kit DTC</a>, the kit will includes the swab, a collection tube with saline, a plastic bag with an absorbent pad, and the return box with shipping label. The return shipping is handled by UPS at no additional charge to the customer, and is sent to Amazon&#8217;s CAP accredited and CLIA-certified lab in Hebron, Kentucky. </span></span></p>
<p>The kit additionally includes instructions on how to get your results via Amazon&#8217;s secure website, AmazonDx.com, and access to documents needed for testing verification. These tests will meet any requirements for testing when traveling within the US (except Hawaii), and when traveling from the U.S. to many international locations, Amazon says. And the kits are FSA and HSA eligible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even as Covid-19 vaccinations continue, widespread access to reliable and affordable Covid-19 testing remains a critical tool in the fight against the spread of the virus, said Cem Sibay, the Amazon VP heading the company’s Covid-19 testing work. &#8220;The Amazon collection kit offers customers the convenience they’ve come to expect from Amazon.com by providing access to COVID-19 testing whenever and wherever they need it. The test collection kit provides highly accurate and timely results, helping customers feel more confident as they safely return to travel, work, college, and daily life,&#8221; Sibay added.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity <del>Monday</del> Tuesday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>What a busy weekend we missed while mostly hearing distant explosions and hugging our dogs close. Here&#8217;s a sampling of what we tried to recap on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Didi vs. China:</strong> The Chinese government&#8217;s crackdown on Didi continued over the weekend, after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">cybersecurity review of the company on Friday</a>. That decision blocked new user signups. Now Didi has had its app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/04/didi-app-pulled-from-app-stores-after-suspension-order/">removed from pertinent app marketplaces</a>. That&#8217;s going to hit revenue. Shares of the company are sharply lower in pre-marketing trading here in the United States. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/why-is-didi-worth-so-much-less-than-uber/">company went public last week</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter vs. India:</strong> India&#8217;s attempts to cow Twitter into not enacting its own content moderation policies continues. Now India has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says/">taken away legal protections from the well-known American company</a>. It&#8217;s not great news for India&#8217;s growing technology sector, or the investors backing the upstarts.</li>
<li><strong>Funding rounds:</strong> Lots of companies raised money, including Byrd, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/byrd-raises-19m-to-expand-amazon-style-fulfillment-and-logistics-to-more-e-commerce-merchants-in-europe/">with $19 million in a Series B</a>, Pleo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/pleo-raises-150m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-new-approach-to-managing-expenses-for-smbs/">with a huge $150 million unicorn round</a>, and Obviously AI, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/obviously-ai-a-no-code-startup-for-data-analysts-increases-its-seed-round-to-4-7m/">which just extended its Seed round</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a busy week! Chat tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video game platform Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/07/roblox-partners-sony-music-entertainment-bring-artists-metaverse/">announced</a> this morning it has partnered with Sony Music Entertainment on a deal that will allow the two companies to work together to create music experiences for the Roblox community, including opportunities that would give Sony Music artists a way to reach new audiences and generate revenue. The announcement follows last month&#8217;s news of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/music-publishers-sue-roblox-for-letting-game-creators-use-songs-11623271976">a $200 million lawsuit</a> filed by a group of music publishers who alleged Roblox was allowing creators to build virtual boomboxes inside their games that streamed copyrighted music without artists&#8217; permission or any payment.</p>
<p>The publishers in the lawsuit included Universal Music Publishing, Big Machine Records, Concord Music Group, Downtown Music Publishing, Kobalt Music Group and Hipgnosis Songs Fund<span class="company-name-type">.</span> Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/06/addressing-recently-filed-litigation-certain-music-publishers/">responded</a> to the litigation by saying it was &#8220;surprised and disappointed&#8221; by the action, which represented a &#8220;fundamental misunderstanding of how the Roblox platform operates.&#8221;</p>
<p>It claimed it doesn&#8217;t tolerate copyright infringement and uses filtering technology to prohibit unauthorized recordings. It also said it responds to valid Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown requests by removing any infringing content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the company&#8217;s deal with Sony Music indicates Roblox is aware of the value in partnering in a more official capacity with a music company.</p>
<p>Roblox didn&#8217;t detail what sort of &#8220;commercial activities&#8221; its has in mind for Sony Music artists and their fans, but it had worked with the music company on past events, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/roblox-to-host-its-first-virtual-concert-featuring-lil-nas-x/">its first-ever virtual concert</a> with Lil Nas X in November 2020, and this May, a virtual Zara Larsson Launch Party. The concert was attended by over 36 million players, while the launch party attracted over 4 million visits &#8212; the highest for any launch party on Roblox to date.</p>
<p>The Roblox platform, generally speaking, allows artists to reach fans through a variety of activities, including virtual concerts, merchandise sales, and other integrated in-game activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sony Music artists have been at the forefront of engaging the millions of music fans in Roblox’s massive user community with forward-looking initiatives like <span class="il">Lil</span> <span class="il">Nas</span> X’s industry-first virtual performance on the platform, and Zara Larsson’s recent listening party event,&#8221; said Sony Music Entertainment President of Global Digital Business and U.S. Sales, Dennis Kooker, in a statement. &#8220;With this new agreement, we look forward to expanding our successful partnership with the Roblox team to further unlock commercial opportunities at the intersection of music and gaming. Immersive online environments represent a meaningful opportunity for reaching a growing number of fans who want to use virtual communities to enjoy shared music experiences,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The deal comes at a time when Roblox&#8217;s audience is aging up. the company in its Q1 2021 earnings <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/10/roblox-hits-q1-bookings-of-652-3-million-up-161-in-first-report-as-public-company/">reported</a> a 128% increase in engagement from users over the age of 13 &#8212; a time when music is becoming a more important part of young people&#8217;s lives and they&#8217;re interested in connecting more directly with favorite artists. The gaming company&#8217;s daily active users also grew 79% to reach 42.1 million during the quarter while revenue climbed 140% to $387 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sony Music has been a fantastic partner and I am pleased to deepen and lengthen our relationship. They truly understand the massive opportunity that the metaverse presents for their artists and we are committed to helping them unlock new creative and commercial opportunities on Roblox,” said Jon Vlassopulos, Vice President and Global Head of Music at Roblox.</p>
<p>This is not Roblox&#8217;s first music label partnership. Last month, the company announced <a href="https://www.bmg.com/uk/news/BMG-Roblox-partnership.html">a similar deal with BMG</a>, also focused on future collaborations and revenue-generating opportunities for artists and songwriters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pet care industry has boomed over the past several years. From <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-on-its-fast-approaching-ipo-its-like-seeing-my-baby-graduate/">Chewy&#8217;s IPO</a> to the various veterinarian startups that have sprung up, VC money (and consumer cash) is flowing into the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://wagmo.io/">Wagmo</a> is no different. The pet insurance and perks startup has closed on a $12.5 million Series A financing, led by <a href="https://www.revolution.com/entity/ventures/">Revolution Ventures</a> with participation from Female Founders Fund, Clocktower Technology Ventures, and Vestigo Ventures. Angels, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, Jim Grube, Marilyn Hirsch, David Ronick, and Michael Akkerman, also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The company was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christie-horvath-6996877">Christie Horvath</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alison-foxworth-35a59a2/">Ali Foxworth</a>, who both came from the world of finance and insurance and realized the gap in the market when it comes to pet insurance. Most pet insurance providers cover the big emergencies, such as surgeries, broken bones, etc. But anyone with a pet, and especially a new puppy (like myself), knows that the costs of basic care can add up very quickly.</p>
<p>Wagmo offers the same basic coverage as your usual pet insurance, but also offers a wellness service. The Wellness Program reimburses pet parents for the more basic stuff, like vaccinations, grooming, regular vet visits, fecal tests, and bloodwork.</p>
<p>Users simply pay anywhere between $20/month and $59/month and submit photos of their receipts in the app. Wagmo then reimburses what&#8217;s covered via Venmo, PayPal, or direct deposit within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The premise here is two-fold. A healthy dog, who has access to all the basics listed above, is less likely to have major issues later on. The second piece is that the earliest costs associated with owning a dog are these basic ones, like vaccinations, vet visits, fecal tests and grooming.</p>
<p>Wagmo offers the wellness plan without an insurance plan. That means that users can onboard to the platform with what they need first, and upgrade to an insurance plan later on.</p>
<p>Wagmo generates revenue through both the wellness and insurance plan, but is actively looking into an enterprise model, as well, signing on larger organizations as part of their benefits package to employees.</p>
<p>The now-14-person team has onboarded thousands of users, with 20 percent user growth month over month since the beginning of the pandemic, and has processed 30,000 wellness claims.</p>
<p>The team is 58 percent female identifying, with Black, Asian and Latinx making up 17 percent of the workforce each.</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest challenge is figuring out how to break down the opportunity ahead of us, particularly in the employer benefit space,&#8221; said Horvath. &#8220;What keeps us up at night is thinking about where to start, what to prioritize, how to allocate limited resources and limited time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To compete with the myriad venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, <a href="https://ifly.vc/">iFly.vc</a> has a unique vantage point.</p>
<p>Its founder Han Shen has straddled the United States and China for several decades. He was the first hire on the investment team of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/03/formation-8-500-million-fund/">Formation 8</a>, the VC firm co-founded by Palantir&#8217;s Joe Lonsdale. After iFly.vc backed Weee! in a Series A round in <a href="https://medium.com/ifly-vc/congratulations-on-weee-s-series-c-6f5554f28df6">2018</a>, Shen arranged for the grocery startup to meet with China&#8217;s produce delivery leaders &#8212; two of which<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/chinese-online-grocery-firms-dingdong-missfresh-have-a-tough-ipo.html"> recently went public in the U.S.</a> &#8212; to learn what was applicable to the American market.</p>
<p>Weee! has since become the go-to grocery app for America&#8217;s Asian communities and raised hundreds of millions of dollars from Lightspeed Venture Partners, DST Global, Blackstone, Tiger Global and other major institutions. IFly.vc is still Weee!&#8217;s second-largest shareholder, and its first fund recorded a 10x rate of return, Shen told TechCrunch during an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the back of its cross-continental experiences and portfolio performance, iFly.vc recently closed its second fund with over $46 million, boosting the firm&#8217;s assets under management to more than $95 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The limited partners in Fund II include family offices across the U.S. and Asia as well as high-profile entrepreneurs such as Zhang Tao, founder of China&#8217;s Yelp counterpart Dianping, Free Wu, a founding member of Tencent who now manages Welight Capital, Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir, and Aayush Phumbhra, co-founder of Chegg.</span></p>
<p>IFly.vc made another big move during the pandemic, relocating its office from San Francisco to Austin, joining a wave of Californians fleeing the expensive area.</p>
<p>When it comes to investment focus, Shen said he tries to seek out the underdogs in North America&#8217;s trillion-dollar consumer market.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, enterprise services are growing very quickly. But on the other hand, the rise of enterprise software is helping consumer tech to grow even more quickly and easily. The consumer market is very diverse and serves an array of minority groups, so there is always a new opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this premise in mind, iFly.vc recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/cheese-raises-3-6m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-asian-american-community/">invested in Cheese Financial</a>&#8216;s seed round, a digital bank that started out by serving the underbanked Asian American populations.</p>
<p>IFly.vc prefers backing startups early on and seeing them through by providing hands-on, post-investment support. Rather than spray and pray, iFly.vc has invested in just about a dozen companies five years after its founding.</p>
<p>Shen&#8217;s background of growing up in China and working in Silicon Valley, where he eventually became a partner at Formation 8, led him to appreciate entrepreneurs with a similarly international background because they can learn from mistakes and successes on both sides. They also know how to leverage the different fields of talent across the world.</p>
<p>Cheese Financial, for instance, is setting up an engineering force in the founder&#8217;s hometown, Shenzhen, to take advantage of the Chinese city&#8217;s large pool of engineers at costs much lower than those of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about hiring cheaper programmers, though. As Shen puts it: &#8220;In the past, American companies were simply outsourcing technical tasks to China. Now Chinese engineers actually have valuable lessons to bring to American companies because many have worked at large, successful Chinese tech companies themselves.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/pittsburghs-locomation-puts-a-convoy-twist-on-autonomous-trucking/Pittsburgh is known as the Steel City, but these days, the city is turning to startups rather than steel. Mayor Bill Peduto lead this charge since taking office in 2014. He recently spoke at TechCrunch&#8217;s City Spotlight: Pittsburgh event, where he outlined the opportunity and challenges for entrepreneurs considering founding and running their companies in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>This is a trend across the United States as cities once again turn to small businesses, such as tech startups, to reinvigorate and inspire. But, as Peduto points out, there&#8217;s a desperate need for more venture capital. The region also struggles to retain and recruit talent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/cmus-president-discusses-how-pittsburgh-is-building-and-retaining-high-tech-startups/">echoed by CMU&#8217;s President Farnam Jahanian</a>, who spoke at the same event.</p>
<p>Peduto is leaving office in January 2022 after losing to Ed Gainey in his party&#8217;s primary race.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>The following is a transcript of key topics discussed in the interview. The questions and responses have been lightly edited.</em></p>
<p><strong>What do you say to entrepreneurs looking to move to Pittsburgh?</strong></p>
<p>I would say this, first and foremost: Find a city that can provide you with the talent so that you have a pipeline.</p>
<p>Andrew Carnegie set up along the shores of the rivers of Pittsburgh because he knew he could get iron ore from Minnesota and coal from West Virginia and utilize the rails in the rivers as the way to export his business. So when you&#8217;re creating and looking for a city, look for where the talent already is so you don&#8217;t have to worry about bringing the talent to the location.</p>
<p>Those river banks are still here in Pittsburgh. But the true iron ore and coal today are called Carnegie Mellon University in the University of Pittsburgh. So as we&#8217;re producing all of these engineers and others, our goal is to create a city with the livability of a city where people would want to stay with a cost of living where people can own their own home. And a city where it&#8217;s small enough that you can get something done; where you don&#8217;t have to get caught up in the city bureaucracy, but it&#8217;s large enough that the world will take notice.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;ll find is those cities exist throughout the country, but they&#8217;re not on the coasts. Instead, they&#8217;re cities like Nashville, Charlotte, Austin, and Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>No one would deny that Pittsburgh has the talent and the livability. It&#8217;s a beautiful city. I&#8217;ve been there a few times myself, and I love it. But what&#8217;s missing?</strong></p>
<p>Venture Capital.</p>
<p>Part of it is a psychological belief that investors from the coast need to move a company to the coast to guarantee their success. What they&#8217;re doing is raising all the incremental costs that have nothing to do with its technology. They&#8217;re wasting funds on everything from rent to the cost of food. The belief that you physically have to be located in California or in New York drives many venture capitalists to look elsewhere when a great idea is being discussed.</p>
<p>Another part that&#8217;s missing is the critical second phase of funding. Pittsburgh has become reliant upon creating its economic development structure to be able to get a lot of these startups off the ground. And I&#8217;m not just talking about angel investors. There&#8217;s a number of different ways that companies are being funded that we didn&#8217;t have just a few years ago, for that critical second wave of funding. Entrepreneurs are missing out. And investors and VCs are missing out on being able to get into a early stage company in Pittsburgh after it has started. And without that second round of funding, a lot of these companies die on the vine instead of being able to make it to a critical juncture point.</p>
<p><strong>What do you say to entrepreneurs with a great idea and a good business but need to leave because there is no VC funding?</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the hard part. Luis von Ahn from Duolingo had the opportunity, and probably a lot more money, to leave Pittsburgh than to stay in Pittsburgh and create his vision. He did it partly because of pride in being a part of this city. Part of the area we have to make up, when we&#8217;re not able to match dollar for dollar, with a different part of the country is going back to that quality of life. It goes much further than just being able to afford a house. It is the actual life that you are given by choosing to live in this area. It is a better lifestyle for many people than what they can find in saturated areas of the coasts.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m an outsider. And I&#8217;m not going to pretend I know Pittsburgh like a local journalist. I live just north of Detroit. And I see a lot of parallels between Detroit and Pittsburgh, Columbus and Austin, Nashville, and all these cities that are emerging as startup hubs, but sometimes this growth feels like it&#8217;s just surface level. What do you see in Pittsburgh that makes you hopeful that this growth will continue for years or decades to come?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s that there is now an entire ecosystem around it. We didn&#8217;t have that ten years ago. So somebody who would be coming to Pittsburgh to work at Google wouldn&#8217;t have an opportunity to stay in Pittsburgh, to have a parallel advancement. And then to continue in a career path that would leave them to having a very successful career without having to leave Pittsburgh. There is a strong structure now around cleantech.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re around renewable energy, which people are surprised when I say that, but there are more jobs in Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is in the renewable energy field, than coal, gas, and oil combined. The energy industry has shifted and in Pittsburgh &#8212; and with the Biden administration committed to investing in the areas that otherwise would be left behind &#8212; that opportunity is here to take off. Within each of those different sectors that I talked about earlier, advanced manufacturing, robotics and artificial intelligent life sciences, there is an expanded field instead of the focused field.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big difference that I have watched. And fortunately, I&#8217;ve had a part in over 30 years of seeing it expand. So what I would say to the people, and why it is different now, is that you are no longer coming to Pittsburgh to work one job and then leaving and going somewhere else. People are coming to Pittsburgh, and they&#8217;re staying. They&#8217;re starting their own companies, or they&#8217;re finding unlimited parallel advancement as they continue to go up the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s finish on Duolingo. They just filed to go public, and we were lucky enough to pre-record an interview with one of their directors before the quiet period. What&#8217;s your hope with Duolingo going public, and how is that going to change Pittsburgh?</strong></p>
<p>Well, first off, personally, as a friend of Luis and watching him and his team expand exponentially. I couldn&#8217;t be more proud for him and to see that expansion occur &#8212; with the idea of developing right here in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>I think the first part of it is the recognition that comes from within the tech industry itself &#8212; that a company of this magnitude, a billion-dollar company can be born, grow and continue to rise as a public corporation in Pittsburgh. Secondly, it brings top talent to the city. Third, it is a company that is committed to making the world a better place, not simply through their present technology of allowing us to learn a language, but the commitment of this company to invest in education across the board that will be equitable and available to anyone around the world, in where education can be utilized to create a better society. That&#8217;s something that makes every Pittsburgher proud.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The space SPAC frenzy might&#8217;ve died down, but it isn&#8217;t over: Earth observation startup Satellogic is the latest to go public via a merger with CF Acquisition Corp. V, a special purpose acquisition company set up by Cantor Fitzgerald. Satellogic already has 17 satellites in orbit, and aims to scale its constellation to over 300 satellites to provide sub-meter resolution imaging of the Earth updated on a daily frequency.</p>
<p>The SPAC deal values the company at $850 million, and includes a PIPE worth $100 million with funds contributed by SoftBank&#8217;s SBLA Advisers Group and Cantor Fitzgerald. It assumes revenue of around $800 million for the combined company by 2025, and Satellogic expects to have a cash balance of around $274 million resulting from the deal at close.</p>
<p>Satellogic has raised a total of just under $124 million since its founding in 2010, from investors including Tencent, Pitanga Fund and others. The company claims its satellites are the only ones that can provide imaging at the resolution it offers with a price tag that remains relatively affordable for commercial clients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So much for the big E3 reveal. Weeks after the big gaming show, Nintendo has finally taking the wraps off the latest iteration of its wildly popular hybrid gaming console. The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/oled-model/">Nintendo Switch (OLED model)</a> [parentheses theirs] will arrive on October 8, priced at $350. That is, the company&#8217;s quick to note, the same day it launches Metroid Dread, the long-awaited latest side scrolling entry in the long-standing franchise.<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2173903" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="578" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The system sports a 7-inch OLED, improved audio and 64 GB of internal storage. The hybrid dock sports a wired LAN port, and the system ships with an adjustable port for playing in tabletop mode. There&#8217;s a sharp black and white color scheme, though the remainder of the materials looks to be similar to the earlier model, with most of that price bump going to the display. The company will also be offering a separate carrying case, because you don&#8217;t want to get the fancy screen on your new $350 system scratched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mHq6Y7JSmg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>From the sound of it, the two existing Switch models are sticking around, as lower cost alternatives. Those models run $299 and $199, respectively, though it seems reasonable to expect there may be some price drops as the new model arrives, ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p>“The new Nintendo Switch (OLED model) is a great option for players who want to experience the new vibrant screen when playing in handheld and tabletop mode,” Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser said in a press release. “With the addition of this new model to the Nintendo Switch family of systems, people have an additional choice of a system that best fits the gaming experience they desire – whether it’s Nintendo Switch (OLED model), Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch Lite.”</p>
<p>The system will arrive in two color configurations. Per Nintendo,</p>
<ul class="m_5132463387734383408bwlistdisc">
<li>
<blockquote><p><em>Nintendo Switch (OLED model) white set, which features white Joy-Con controllers, a black main unit and a white dock.</em></p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p><em>Nintendo Switch (OLED model) neon red/neon blue set, which features neon red and neon blue Joy-Con controllers, a black main unit and a black dock.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>An upgraded version of the four-year-old system has been rumored for some time, carrying the decidedly less clunky name, Switch Pro. With both Sony and Microsoft releasing next-gen versions of their consoles last year, the time certainly seemed right for big refresh from Nintendo. A refreshed version of the standard Switch arrived in July 2019, addressing the original&#8217;s poor battery life &#8212; far and away the largest complaint of an otherwise well-received system.</p>

<p>Of course, in spite of growing a bit long in the tooth, the Switch<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/video-game-spending-increased-27-in-2020/"> continued to dominate</a> the sales charts ahead of the arrival of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox One X. Nintendo utterly dominated sales during the pandemic, after some initial supply chain shortages. That success was due in no small part to the arrival of a new Animal Crossing title that provided some much-needed social gaming during the pandemic. Such success &#8212; coupled with potential supply chain shortage &#8212; led to suggestions that the company had opted to delay the system&#8217;s release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has always liked to motivate his employees by saying every day <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/">is Day 1</a>. Well, it is actually Day 1 for his successor Andy Jassy, who officially moves into the corner office at Amazon today.</p>
<p>Bezos announced that he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">would be stepping down as CEO</a> in February to focus on other interests including his charities Day 1 Fund and the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, the billionaire&#8217;s space company and The Washington Post, the newspaper he bought in 2013.</p>
<p>As he steps away, he will remain as executive chairman, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">it will be Jassy</a>, who up until now has spent most of his career at Amazon building the tremendously successful AWS cloud infrastructure arm, to keep a good thing going.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jassy joined Amazon in 1997 and spent some time working as Bezos executive assistant and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/"> helped formulate the idea</a> that would become Amazon Web Services, a series of integrated web services. He has been at AWS since its earliest days, helping build it from the initial idea to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">a $50 billion juggernaut.</a> He was promoted to AWS CEO in 2016.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-primed-andy-jassy-to-be-ceo-can-he-keep-what-jeff-bezos-built-11625218225">Wall Street journal reported</a> the other day that AWS would be ranked 69th on The Fortune 500 if it were a stand-alone company with the cloud unit currently on a $54 billion run rate. While that&#8217;s impressive he is taking over the full company, which itself ranks #2 on the same list, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2021/02/02/amazons-net-profit-soars-84-with-sales-hitting-386-billion/?sh=5af104ba1334">which generated $386 billion</a> in revenue last year as the pandemic pushed shopping online and Amazon was able to increase sales dramatically.</p>
<p>Jassy will face a number of challenges as he takes over including keeping that growth going as COVID slows down and people can begin to shop in person again. He also needs to deal with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-newly-tech-skeptical-ftc-will-reportedly-review-amazons-acquisition-of-mgm/">a federal government antitrust movement</a> in the U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/europe-lays-out-antitrust-case-against-amazons-use-of-big-data/">and the EU</a>, a push <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/teamsters-plan-aggressive-push-to-unionize-amazon-logistics-workers/">to unionize Amazon warehouses</a> and a general fear of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/13/american-consumers-are-worrying-more-about-amazon-cnbc-survey.html">Amazon&#8217;s growing market clout</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the executive musical chairs such a shift in leadership tends to force, former Tableau CEO Adam Selipsky, who spent over a decade with Jassy helping to build the unit before moving to run Tableau in 2016,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tableau-ceo-adam-selipsky-is-returning-to-aws-to-replace-andy-jassy-as-ceo/"> will take over as AWS CEO</a> replacing Jassy.</p>
<p>In pre-market trading, Amazon stock was up 0.42% suggesting perhaps that Wall Street expects a smooth leadership transition at the company. Jassy has been a key member of the executive team for a number of years, and highly successful in his own right as he built AWS from humble beginnings to its current status, but now Amazon is his company to run and he will need to prove that he is up to the task.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Algorithmic management of gig workers has landed Glovo-owned on-demand delivery firm Foodinho in trouble in Italy where the country&#8217;s data protection authority issued a €2.6 million penalty (~$3M) <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9677377">yesterday</a> after an investigation found a laundry list of problems.</p>
<p>The delivery company has been ordered to make a number of changes to how it operates in the market, with the Garante&#8217;s order giving it two months to correct the most serious violations found, and a further month (so three months total) to amend how its algorithms function &#8212; to ensure compliance with privacy legislation, Italy&#8217;s workers&#8217; statute and recent legislation protecting platform workers.</p>
<p>One of the issues of concern to the data watchdog is the risk of discrimination arising from a rider rating system operated by Foodinho &#8212; which had some 19,000 riders operating on its platform in Italy at the time of the Garante&#8217;s investigation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Likely of relevance here is a long running litigation brought by riders gigging for another food delivery brand in Italy, Foodora, which culminated in a ruling by the country&#8217;s Supreme Court <a href="https://www.wired.it/economia/lavoro/2020/01/24/rider-foodora-dipendenti-cassazione/?refresh_ce=">last year</a> that asserted riders should be treated as having workers rights, regardless of whether they are employed or self-employed &#8212; bolstering the case for challenges against delivery apps that apply algorithms to opaquely micromanage platform workers&#8217; labor.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9675440">injunction against Foodinho</a>, Italy&#8217;s DPA says it found numerous violations of EU privacy legislation &#8212; including GDPR principles of transparency, notification, lawfulness of processing, security, privacy by design and more [an <a href="https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9677611">English extract of the injunction has now been published here</a>] &#8212; as well as a risk of discrimination against gig workers based on how Foodinho&#8217;s booking and assignments algorithms function, in addition to flagging concerns over how the system uses ratings and reputational mechanisms as further levers of labor control.</p>
<p>Article 22 of the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides protections for individuals against being solely subject to automated decision-making including profiling where such decisions produce a legal or similarly substantial effect (and access to paid work would meet that bar) &#8212; giving them the right to get information on a specific decision and object to it and/or ask for human review.</p>
<p>But it does not appear that Foodinho provided riders with such rights, per the Garante&#8217;s assessment.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9677377">press release</a> about the injunction (which we&#8217;ve translated from Italian with Google Translate), the watchdog writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Authority found a series of serious offences, in particular with regard to the algorithms used for the management of workers. The company, for example, had not adequately informed the workers on the functioning of the system and did not guarantee the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used for the evaluation of the riders. Nor did it guarantee procedures to protect the right to obtain human intervention, express one&#8217;s opinion and contest the decisions adopted through the use of the algorithms in question, including the exclusion of a part of the riders from job opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Guarantor has therefore required the company to identify measures to protect the rights and freedoms of riders in the face of automated decisions, including profiling.</p></blockquote>
<p>The watchdog also says it has asked Foodinho to verify the &#8220;accuracy and relevance&#8221; of data that feeds the algorithmic management system &#8212; listing a wide variety of signals that are factored in (such as chats, emails and phone calls between riders and customer care; geolocation data captured every 15 seconds and displayed on the app map; estimated and actual delivery times; details of the management of the order in progress and those already made; customer and partner feedback; remaining battery level of device etc).</p>
<p>&#8220;This is also in order to minimize the risk of errors and distortions which could, for example, lead to the limitation of the deliveries assigned to each rider or to the exclusion itself from the platform. These risks also arise from the rating system,&#8221; it goes on, adding: &#8220;The company will also need to identify measures that prevent improper or discriminatory use of reputational mechanisms based on customer and business partner feedback.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glovo, Foodinho&#8217;s parent entity &#8212; which is named as the owner of the platform in the Garante&#8217;s injunction &#8212; was contacted for comment on the injunction.</p>
<p>A company spokesperson told us they were discussing a response &#8212; so we&#8217;ll update this report if we get one.</p>
<p>Glovo acquired the Italian food delivery company Foodinho <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/31/spains-glovo-acquires-italys-foodinho-to-expand-on-demand-delivery-service/">back in 2016</a>, making its first foray into international expansion. The Barcelona-based business went on to try to build out a business in the Middle East and LatAm &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/glovo-exits-the-middle-east-and-drops-two-latam-markets-in-latest-food-delivery-crunch/">before</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/delivery-hero-picks-up-glovos-latam-ops-for-272m-in-latest-food-delivery-consolidation/">retrenching back</a> to largely focus on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/glovo-delivery-hero-brands-consolidation-chicken/">Southern and Eastern Europe</a>. (In <a href="https://www.ucima.it/uc-en/press-area/news/food-delivery-glovo-acquires-foodora-italia/">2018</a> Glovo also picked up the Foodora brand in Italy, which had been owned by German rival Delivery Hero.)</p>
<p>The Garante says it collaborated with Spain&#8217;s privacy watchdog, the AEDP &#8212; which is Glovo&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor under the GDPR &#8212; on the investigation into Foodinho and the platform tech provided to it by Glovo.</p>
<p>Its press release also notes that Glovo is the subject of &#8220;an independent procedure&#8221; carried out by the AEPD, which it says it&#8217;s also assisting with.</p>
<p>The Spanish watchdog confirmed to TechCrunch that joint working between the AEPD and the Garante had resulted in the resolution against the Glovo-owned company, Foodinho.</p>
<p>The AEPD also said it has undertaken its own procedures against Glovo &#8212; pointing to a <a href="https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00417-2019.pdf">2019 sanction</a> related to the latter not appointing a data protection officer, as is required by the GDPR. The watchdog later issued Glovo with a fined of €25,000 for that compliance failure.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s not clear why the AEDP has &#8212; seemingly &#8212; not taken a deep dive look at Glovo&#8217;s own compliance with the Article 22 of the GDPR. (We&#8217;ve asked it for more on this and will update if we get a response.)</p>
<p>It did point us to <a href="https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/la-proteccion-de-datos-en-las-relaciones-laborales.pdf">recently published guidance</a> on data protection and labor relations, which it worked on with Spain&#8217;s Ministry of Labor and the employers and trade union organizations, and which it said includes information on the right of a works council to be informed by a platform company of the parameters on which the algorithms or artificial intelligence systems are based &#8212; including &#8220;the elaboration of profiles, which may affect the conditions, access and maintenance of employment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the Spanish government<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/"> agreed upon a labor reform</a> to expand the protections available to platform workers by recognizing platform couriers as employees.</p>
<p>The amendments to the Spanish Workers Statute Law were approved by Royal Decree in May &#8212; but aren&#8217;t due to start being applied until the middle of next month, per <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy_and_business/2021-05-12/spain-approves-landmark-law-recognizing-food-delivery-riders-as-employees.html">El Pais</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, the reform also contains a provision that requires workers’ legal representatives to be informed of the criteria powering any algorithms or AI systems that are used to manage them and which may affect their working conditions &#8212; such as those affecting access to employment or rating systems that monitor performance or profile workers. And that additional incoming algorithmic transparency provision has evidently been factored into the AEPD&#8217;s guidance.</p>
<p>So it may be that the watchdog is giving affected platforms like Glovo a few months&#8217; grace to allow them to get their systems in order for the new rules.</p>
<p>Spanish labor law also of course remains distinct to Italian law, so there will be ongoing differences of application related to elements that concern delivery apps, regardless of what appears to be a similar trajectory on the issue of expanding platform workers rights.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/italian-court-rules-against-discriminatory-deliveroo-rider-ranking-algorithm/">January</a>, for example, an Italian court found that a reputation-ranking algorithm that had been used by another on-demand delivery app, Deliveroo, had discriminated against riders because it had failed to distinguish between legally protected reasons for withholding labour (e.g., because a rider was sick; or exercising their protected right to strike) and other reasons for not being as productive as they’d indicated they would be.</p>
<p>In that case, Deliveroo said the judgement referred to a historic booking system that it said was no longer used in Italy or any other markets.</p>
<p>More recently a tribunal ruling in Bologna &#8212; found a Collective Bargaining Agreement signed by, AssoDelivery, a trade association that represents a number of delivery platforms in the market (including Deliveroo and Glovo), and a minority union with far right affiliations, the UGL trade union, to be unlawful.</p>
<p>Deliveroo told us it planned to appeal that ruling.</p>
<p>The agreement attracted controversy because it seeks to derogate unfavorably from Italian law that protects workers and the signing trade body is not representative enough in the sector.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Zooming out, EU lawmakers are also looking at the issue of platform workers rights &#8212; kicking off a consultation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">in February</a> on how to improve working conditions for gig workers, with the possibility that Brussels could propose legislation later this year.</p>
<p>However platform giants have seen the exercise as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">an opportunity to lobby for deregulation</a> &#8212; pushing to reduce employment standards for gig workers across the EU. The strategy looks intended to circumvent or at least try to limit momentum for beefed up rules coming a national level, such as Spain&#8217;s labor reform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not often that you hear DNA described as a wafer – but that’s the analogy that Grant Aarons, the founder of FabricNano, a cell-free biomanufacturing company uses to describe his company’s major product. That DNA, the company hopes, will make a dent in a growing global petrochemical industry that currently relies on fossil fuels and their byproducts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FabricNano is a London based company founded in 2018 through Entrepreneur First, a technology startup accelerator. FabricNano is invested in the creation of cell-free biomanufacturing. Biomanufacturing, simply, uses the enzymes within a cell or microbe to produce an end-product. FabricNano’s approach is to place those enzymes on the DNA wafer instead (that process is called enzyme immobilization). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those enzymes, Aarons argues, can produce chemicals, like those used to make drugs or plastics, with higher efficiency compared to cell-based systems, and without the reliance on fossil fuels that are currently used to make those chemicals en masse.The heart of the company is the DNA scaffold, which can house enough enzymes to scale up those reactions. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, FabricNano announced $12.5 million in Series A funding this week complete with a cadre of high profile angel investors. The round was led by Atomico, and included investment from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, actress, UN Sustainability Ambassador Emma Watson, and former Bayer CEO Alexander Moscho. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went out and actively tried to get the right angels for the company,” says Aarons. “We also looked at a few different technology angels. Because at the end of the day what we&#8217;re manufacturing is an enabling technology for manufacturers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not looking to manufacture bio-based plastics or bio-based monomers, at any sufficient scale,” he continues. “We&#8217;re looking to provide [manufacturers] with the technology that they can then use to manufacture at scale and at a low enough cost. It is a scalable and sustainable way to make low-value molecules, like bioplastics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of FabricNano’s identity hinges on creating a bio-based alternative within the growing petrochemical sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, about 14 percent of global oil demand goes towards making plastics. Petrochemicals, or chemicals obtained from oil and gas that can be used to make plastics or other materials, are expected to drive about half of the world’s oil demand by 2050, according to The International Energy Agency’s </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/news/petrochemicals-set-to-be-the-largest-driver-of-world-oil-demand-latest-iea-analysis-finds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 projections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plastics, a major end-product of the petrochemical industry, contribute to climate change at nearly every point in their life cycles – when they’re manufactured by heating up oil or ethane or when they’re burned as waste. If both plastic production and use continue at their current pace, emissions are projected to reach 1.34 gigatons by 2030 (the equivalent of 295 coal fired power plants), according to the </span><a href="https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-Executive-Summary-2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for International Environmental Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, making</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more plastic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no matter how it is made, will contribute to ecological catastrophe in its own way (</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/01/call-for-global-treaty-to-end-production-of-virgin-plastic-by-2040"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientists have called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for phase out of “virgin” plastic production by 2040). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the nebulous term “bioplastic” can refer to anything from a biodegradable plastic to a plastic created without the use of fossil fuels (even one that is not biodegradable), That makes the world of environmentally-friendly plastics highly susceptible to greenwashing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question that remains is how big an impact biomanufacturing can make on reducing petrochemicals’ contribution to climate change? At this point that’s unclear. Aarons argues that part of the appeal of cell-free manufacturing can pull the industry away from using petroleum (or in the US, ethanol) to make plastics or other commodity chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really talking about a new technology to take over a lot of the commodities sector, and pull a lot of those petroleum-based products away from petroleum and into the biological realm,” says Aarons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there are also clear concerns with the production of plastics as-is, leaving room for alternatives to emerge if they prove to be scalable and cost-effective enough to supplant the existing petrochemical industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some evidence that cell-free manufacturing has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">already </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">scaled well. For instance, high fructose corn syrup is made when corn starch is broken down by enzymes into glucose. The final step requires one enzyme, glucose isomerase. Aarons calls high fructose corn syrup production “the largest implementation of cell-free in the world.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FabricNano is partially looking to build upon that concept to offer a greater suite of available chemicals. At the moment, FabricNano can already create chemicals like 1,3 propanediol, an ingredient that can be used to replace polyethylene glycol in toothpaste or shampoo. The input needed to create that product is glycerin, a major waste product of biodiesel manufacturing, which may help keep costs down and provide an alternative feedstock to fossil fuels.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aarons says that FabricNano has proved capable of making four additional products, but didn’t disclose what kinds. He says FabricNano is “interested in the pharmaceutical space”, and in commodity chemicals. “There are a lot of commodity chemicals we can manufacture. 1,3 propanediol is just the tip of the iceberg,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, FabricNano’s distinguishing approach probably isn’t the commodity chemicals it has made so far, but the actual DNA scaffold. If the enzymes that stick to that DNA wafer and help produce chemicals are software, the DNA scaffold is FabricNano’s hardware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hardware is a major way the company hopes to bring cell-free into the world of commodity chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The real missing piece, and why [cell-free manufacturing] has been a niche technology for a long time is that there has been no generalizable technology to immobilize all of these proteins,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the newest round of funding FabricNano plans to increase its employee workforce from 12 to thirty people, and move into a new London-based office. Total investment in the company stands at $16 million. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influential entrepreneurs like Paul Graham and Naval Ravikant always preach the need for startups to have founders-turned-investors on their cap table</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ravikant puts it, “founders want to know that the people they are taking money from have first-hand experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His platform AngelList has helped individual founders-cum-investors source and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in deals via collectives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some venture firms have taken this up a notch by bringing founders to create a fund and invest together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, one of such,</span><a href="https://www.magic.fund/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a global collective of founders, is announcing that it has raised a second fund of $30 million to continue backing early-stage startups across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the firm&#8217;s first fund launched in 2017, MAGIC has invested in 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across these emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these companies include <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-20/retool-nears-1-billion-valuation-with-funding-from-sequoia">Retool</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/novo-a-neobank-for-smbs-banks-41m/">Novo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/payfazz-gets-53-million-to-give-more-indonesians-access-to-financial-services/">Payfazz</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/">Mono</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC Fund has 12 founders who act as general partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch caught up with managing partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adegokeolubusi">Adegoke Olubusi</a> and operating partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greenleafmatt">Matt Greenleaf</a> to learn more about the fund&#8217;s thesis and activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olubusi, who had built and exited a couple of startups over the years, also dabbled with angel investing for some time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2017, Olubusi&#8217;s current startup Helium Health got accepted into Y Combinator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was there he met more founders like him who were angel investors with impressive portfolios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The interesting bit? Each founder wanted to invest in other companies during YC&#8217;s Demo Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So about three years ago, I was at YC, and I was going to invest in my own batch. I was pitching on the day, but I was also listening to other pitches. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it wasn&#8217;t just me; there were many other founders as well,&#8221; Olubusi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After building and exiting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups, some founders turn into angel investing to support startups and their ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, most of them tend to go alone and are stuck with cutting checks in their local markets, which limits opportunities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a scenario. In 2016, when unicorns Flutterwave and Kavak raised their seed rounds in Nigeria and Mexico respectively, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an African biotech founder who knew about Kavak and a Latin American edtech founder interested in African fintech would not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have had the capacity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> those deals even if they wanted; the reason being a lack of reach and experience in both the industry or geography</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olubusi and the other founders knew this would be a limitation in the long run if they went solo. Thus, they decided to create MAGIC. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was to bring global founders together with diverse skillsets in diverse industries and geographies to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deals better and drive value for each other</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hence, they can participate in two unicorns instead of one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Instead of us investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we have somewhat limited capacity </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how much time we have as founders because of our respective companies, why don&#8217;t we collaborate on a strategy together and co-invest together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way we thought of MAGIC was a fund of micro funds built by founders for founders,&#8221; Greenleaf continued.</span></p>
<h2>Fund of micro funds but more than money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some of the personal conversations I&#8217;ve had with founders about their investors, a recurring theme has been that the most useful investors didn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sign the biggest checks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s a theme Olubusi also relates to all too well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was like every time we think about it, everyone who gave the most money rarely had time for us. It was so frequent that we all identified this as an actual thing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What actually drove value for us were other investors who were founders and operators, and other experienced people who were able to help us find product-market fit and fight regulators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These were actually the people in the trenches with us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olubusi believes the early-stage part of investing, particularly in pre-seed and seed, is where VCs who are founder-operators find their sweet spot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are precious when startups are trying to figure out product-market fit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unlike traditional investors who are looking to get multiples on investments, Olubusi argues that for founders-investors, what matters is how much value they can drive for startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC&#8217;s play is even more essential considering that it also plays in emerging markets where on-the-ground operational help </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in industries with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">numerous</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unknowns and uncertainties</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is so much money in the market now and early-stage decision making at pre-seed and seed should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the hands of founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because think about it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make an evaluation of whether I should invest in a healthcare or fintech company in Africa, it makes sense to have those who&#8217;ve spent years battling through it in the trenches make those decisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what we&#8217;re trying to do with the fund is publish as much information as possible and keep performing at the 100 percentile and say this is still the best strategy and is very scalable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million and Olubusi says the investments performed 5x over the period of three years. As some of these companies exited, their founders invested in MAGIC and came on board as Fund 2 partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC has also enlisted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors who, according to Olubusi, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are respected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their investing abilities and ecosystem support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the African tech ecosystem as a founder who goes out of his way to help established and up-and-coming fintech companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hendra Kwik of Payfazz has such a reputation in Southeast Asia as well. They, alongside other founders, join MAGIC as limited partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the firm&#8217;s statement, one-third of the entire fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was contributed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the founder GPs. For its LPs, diversity play </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is considered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as 50% of them are black while 33% are women. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them include Michael Seibel, Tim Draper, Rappi&#8217;s Andres Bilbao, Paystack&#8217;s Shola Akinlade, Katie Lewis, and Octopus Ventures&#8217; Kirsten Connell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For its partners, MAGIC has brought on the likes of Stitchroom&#8217;s Tom Chen, Medumo&#8217;s Adeel Yang, Juice&#8217;s Michael Lisovetsky, and Troy Osinoff, and Evercare&#8217;s Temi Awogboro.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages focusing on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women&#8217;s health, developer tools</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does the fund look for in founders? Olubusi gives two answers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, MAGIC wants to back founders with incentives to stick through the hard times of a company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At pre-seed and seed, you don&#8217;t have enough data about a company to make an investment decision. Your bet is entirely on the founder and the founding team. What we know, having done this several times, is that things get harder. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when we&#8217;re looking at the founder, we&#8217;re evaluating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the founder has the grit to stick through the toughest times which are going to come up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second indicator factors if the founder has the willingness, openness, the flexibility to learn and use that knowledge to succeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenleaf believes these strategies have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped the firm fund exceptional companies and maintain good relationships with founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most of these founders don&#8217;t view us as their investors. They view us as fellow founders who are helping them along their journey. I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that also ties into them keeping it real with us and allows us to see them as people, and not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That&#8217;s one of the things that have worked in our favor,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fittingly, we don’t know a lot about Nothing. The young hardware startup has, however, done a stellar job building hype around precisely that fact. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555247/nothing-ear-1-true-wireless-earbuds-july-27th-launch-oneplus-carl-pei">the lead up to the July 27 launch</a> of the company’s first product, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/nothings-first-product-the-ear-1-earbud-launches-in-june/"> Ear (1)</a>, the Nothing marketing machine has released information in drabs and drabs.</p>
<p>Ahead of the event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothing-founder-carl-pei-on-ear-1-and-building-a-hardware-startup-from-scratch/">we sat down with founder Carl Pei</a> for a wide ranging interview about launching his latest hardware company. During the conversation, he revealed some additional information about the upcoming fully wireless earbuds.</p>
<p>“It’s going to have leading features like noise cancellation and great build quality,” Pei told TechCrunch. “Because we&#8217;re primarily going to be focused on online sales channels, we are going to be able to [make it] &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t say ‘affordable,’ but quite a fair price to consumers. With the Ear (1), it&#8217;s a much more costly design to realize than a standard, non-transparent design. I think it&#8217;s going to be a good price at $99 USD, €99 Euros and £99. Feature-wise, it’s similar to the AirPods Pro, but the AirPods Pro is $249.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Pricing in the earbud market is all over the place at the moment, of course. Apple is holding up the high end of the mainstream with its AirPods Pro. Sony’s latest manage to edge that out into truly premium pricing at $280. At the other end of the spectrum, meanwhile, it’s easy to snag a pair of buds for well under $50, though at the low end of the market, your mileage will vary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173825" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173825" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2173825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173825" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nothing</p></div></p>
<p>The Ear (1)s are aggressively priced at $99 – putting them in the same pricing category as the Samsung Galaxy Buds and the recently released Google Pixel Buds-A. Though Pei promises Nothing’s product will have the upper hand with an AirPods Pro-like feature set, including active noise cancelling. In an email to TechCrunch, the company says the ANC will arrive via three &#8220;high definition&#8221; mics. Pei added that the IP purchased from Essential won&#8217;t appear in this first product.</p>
<p>&#8220;[B]efore we were called Nothing, &#8216;Essential&#8217; was one of the names we were brainstorming, internally,&#8221; said Pei. &#8220;So that’s why we&#8217;ve acquired the trademark. We don&#8217;t have any plans to do anything with Essential.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still, he stresses that it’s not a features race for Nothing. “If you look at what kids want to become today, they want to be TikTokers, or YouTubers,” Pei tells TechCrunch. “Maybe it&#8217;s because technology isn&#8217;t as inspiring as before. We talked to consumers, and they don&#8217;t care as much as a couple of years ago, either. If you look at what brands are doing in their communication, it&#8217;s all about features and specs. There&#8217;s nobody in this space trying to like with a higher purpose.”</p>
<p>The ‘higher purpose’ here is Nothing’s broader ecosystem play, connectivity and making users’ “digital lives more seamless.” It’s also, as the name implies, an attempt to make tech that gets out of its own way. That’s, in part, is the job of the aesthetics. We do know that the buds will be transparent – a design decision that contributed to the delayed launch.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9w7HHB5PJlY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>“It turns out, there&#8217;s a reason why there&#8217;s not a lot of transparent consumer tech products out there,” Pei said. “It’s really, really hard to make it high quality. You need to ensure that everything inside looks just as good as the outside. So that&#8217;s where the team has been iterating. You probably wouldn&#8217;t notice the differences between each iteration. It could be getting the right magnets &#8212; as magnets are usually designed to go inside of a product and not be seen by the consumer &#8212; to figuring out the best type of gluing. You never have to solved that problem if you have a non-transparent product, but what kind of glue will keep the industrial design intact?”</p>
<p>Nothing is relying on direct sales to drive down costs, with an initial focus on U.K., India, Europe and North America, followed by Japan, Korea and other countries. Pei says the company is still in process of negotiating additional markets. The Ear (1) are the first of three products the company currently has in its pipeline.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["If we take a take a step back and think about it from a consumer perspective, we feel like, as a whole consumer, tech is quite, quite boring.">]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On July 27, hardware maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothings-ear-1-earbuds-will-feature-noise-cancelling-and-run-99/">Nothing will debut its first product, wireless earbuds dubbed Ear (1)</a>. Despite releasing almost no tangible information about the product, the company has managed to generate substantial buzz around the launch — especially for an entry into the already-crowded wireless earbud market.</p>
<p>The hype, however, is real — and somewhat understandable. Nothing founder Carl Pei has a good track record in the industry — he was just 24 when he co-founded OnePlus in 2013. The company has done a canny job capitalizing on heightened expectations, meting out information about the product like pieces in a puzzle.</p>
<p>We spoke to Pei ahead of the upcoming launch to get some insight into Ear (1) and the story behind Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I know there was a timing delay with the launch. Was that related to COVID-19 and supply chain issues?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CP:</strong> Actually, it was due to our design. Maybe you&#8217;ve seen the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/carl-peis-nothing-shows-of-the-tobacco-pipe-inspired-concept-1/">concept image of this transparent design</a>. It turns out there&#8217;s a reason why there aren&#8217;t many transparent consumer tech products out there. It’s really, really hard to make it high quality. You need to ensure that everything inside looks just as good as the outside. So that&#8217;s where the team has been iterating, [but] you probably wouldn&#8217;t notice the differences between each iteration.</p>
<p>It could be getting the right magnets — as magnets are usually designed to go inside of a product and not be seen by the consumer — to figuring out the best type of gluing. You never have to solve that problem if you have a non-transparent product, but what kind of glue will keep the industrial design intact? I think the main issue has been getting the design ready. And we&#8217;re super, super close. Hopefully, it will be a product that people are really excited about when we launch.</p>
<p><strong>So, there were no major supply chain issues?</strong></p>
<p>Not for this product category. With true wireless earbuds, I think we&#8217;re pretty fine. No major issues. I mean, we had the issue that we started from zero — so no team and no partners. But step by step, we finally got here.</p>
<p><strong>That seems to imply that you&#8217;re at least thinking ahead towards the other products. Have you already started developing them?</strong></p>
<p>We have a lot of products in the pipeline. Earlier this year, we did a community crowdfunding round where we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/want-to-invest-in-nothing-carl-pei-opens-investment-opportunity-to-community/">allocated $1.5 million</a> to our community. That got bought up really quickly. But as part of that funding round, we had a deck with some of the products in development. Our products are code-named as Pokemon, so there are a lot of Pokemon on that slide [Editor&#8217;s note: <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-community-carl-pei-interview-1227393/">The Ear 1 was</a> <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Aipom_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">“Aipom.”</a>]. We have multiple categories that we&#8217;re looking at, but we haven&#8217;t really announced what those are.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9w7HHB5PJlY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Why were earbuds the right first step?</strong></p>
<p>I think this market is really screaming for differentiation. If you look at true wireless today, I think after Apple came out with the AirPods, the entire market kind of followed. Everybody wears different clothes. This is something we wear for a large part of the day. Why wouldn&#8217;t people want different designs?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working with Teenage Engineering — they&#8217;re super, super strong designers. I think true wireless is a place where we can really leverage that strength. Also, from a more rational business perspective, wireless earbuds is a super-fast growing product category. I think we&#8217;re going to reach 300 million units shipped worldwide this year for this category. And your first product category should be one with good business potential.</p>
<p><strong>“Screaming for differentiation” is an interesting way to put it. When you look at AirPods and the rest of the industry, are aesthetics what the market primarily lacks? Is it features or is it purely stylistic?</strong></p>
<p>If we take a take a step back and think about it from a consumer perspective, we feel like, as a whole, consumer tech is quite, quite boring. Kids used to want to become engineers and astronauts and all that. But if you look at what kids want to become today, they want to be TikTokers or YouTubers. Maybe it&#8217;s because technology isn&#8217;t as inspiring as before. We talked to consumers, and they don&#8217;t care as much as a couple of years ago either. If you look at what what brands are doing in their communication, it&#8217;s all about features and specs. <div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The upside of the Open Banking regulations which have swept jurisdictions like the UK and the EU is that many more challenger banks have appeared. The headache for either incumbent banks or for upstart startups is the very proliferation of these new banks and financial tech products. But as we know, in gold rushes, the people selling the picks and shovels usually win. Thus, startups have turned their attention, not to launching full-stack banks, but to full-stack platforms that other people can launch their fintech startups and products upon.</p>
<p>The latest to join this brigade is <a href="https://toqio.co/">Toqio</a>, a fintech platform with a white label digital finance SaaS that allows anyone to launch a new fintech product.</p>
<p>The London-based startup has now secured an €8M / $9.4M seed round of funding led by Seaya Ventures and Speedinvest, with SIX FinTech Ventures participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Eduardo Martínez and Michael Galvin, the teams behind Toqio previously built a small business SaaS startup, Geniac, which was acquired by Grant Thornton.</p>
<p>Eduardo Martínez, co-Founder and CEO, of Toqio, said: “Businesses and banks are looking to innovate in the FinTech sector, but to date, they have had to create and maintain complex software solutions to do this. This has also kept smaller niche businesses out of the market. We don’t want FinTech to end up like banking just with a new set of big incumbents trying to take control of financial services. We want to level the playing field.”</p>
<p>Toqio says its customers get access to pre-built products to create applications that can go to market quickly. Products include digital banking, card, and financing solutions, and a marketplace, aimed at financial institutions, FinTech startups, banks, and corporate brands.</p>
<p>Headquartered in London and Madrid, Toqio says it already has customers across Europe, including new Spanish bank Crealsa, business banking service Wamo in Malta, and alternative business lender Just Cash Flow in the UK.</p>
<p>Aristotelis Xenofontos, Principal at Seaya Ventures, said: ”We have spent many years following the Embedded Finance space and finally found the missing piece, a seamless enabler that glues everything together. Toqio is a truly end-to-end platform that provides a complete plug-and-play bank and allows any organization to offer a full suite of digital financial services in a rapid, painless, future-proof, and low-cost way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stefan Klestil, General Partner at Speedinvest, added: “We’ve seen the rise of neo-banks, the change of regulations across multiple markets, and now we’re starting to see traditional businesses and big brands looking to embed financial products within their existing offerings. Financial services are going to change and expand at an unprecedented rate, and Toqio will be instrumental in enabling it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce in Europe is set to <a href="https://internetretailing.net/rxgeu/rxgeu/european-ecommerce-revenues-jump-30-to-us465bn-in-2021#:~:text=European%20eCommerce%20revenues%20jump%2030%25%20to%20US%24465bn%20in%202021,-Europe%20is%20experiencing&amp;text=The%20COVID%2D19%2Dled%20boom,and%20the%20number%20of%20users.&amp;text=Statistics%20show%20that%20European%20eCommerce,US%2471bn%20increase%20YoY." target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow 30% percent this year</a>, with the online shopping surge that started at the rise of Covid-19 showing little sign of abating. Today, a startup that&#8217;s building infrastructure in the region to help merchants fill and deliver those orders &#8212; and present an alternative to using Amazon for fulfillment &#8212; is announcing funding to expand its footprint to meet that demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://getbyrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd</a>, which builds software to manage warehouses and logistics operations, and also runs a service to help online merchants store, pick and deliver their orders, has picked up €16 million ($19 million), a Series B that it will be using to expand to five more markets in eastern, northern and southern Europe in addition to the five countries where it&#8217;s already active. Founded in Vienna, Austria in 2016, Byrd is also in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, where together it has some 15 fulfillment centers and 200 customers, including Durex, Freeletics, Scholl, Your Superfoods and other D2C brands in health and wellness, consumer packaged goods, cosmetics and fashion.</p>
<p>Mouro Capital &#8212; a strategic fintech/e-commerce VC that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/mouro-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spun out from banking giant Santander last year</a> &#8212; led the round, with Speedinvest, Verve Ventures, Rider Global and VentureFriends also participating. Byrd isn&#8217;t disclosing its valuation but has raised some €26 million to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The gap in the market that Byrd is going after is a growing one, not just in terms of size but in terms of retailers&#8217; demand, and what they are looking for in a fulfillment partner.</p>
<p>E-commerce is a deceptively complex business &#8212; deceptive, because as consumers all we ever really see or care about is the ability to find what we are looking for at a decent price, click on it, buy it without too much fuss and have it appear at our doors, ideally asap.</p>
<p>But the steps needed behind the scenes to make all of that possible are many, and mostly complex, and not usually in the core competency of a typical small retailer, who may have identified a product it thinks the world wants, but not how to get it to them. They include marketing, payments, user interface designs, personalization, manufacturing and other supply chain concerns, and yes, the logistics and fulfillment to get orders to customers. As e-commerce continues to become a bigger channel, all of these segments in the chain represent ever-growing opportunities.</p>
<p>Typically, retailers will look to third-party tech companies to provide these different services, and this is where Byrd comes in, as an outsourced partner to handle companies&#8217; logistics and fulfillment. The company has built a set of APIs that let retailers essentially plug in and shift the whole fulfillment operation to Byrd.</p>
<p>That includes integrating with Byrd&#8217;s warehouses to receive, store and pick items; and it also includes connecting with a company&#8217;s merchant network, which could include a merchant&#8217;s own online storefront, but also Amazon and other marketplaces where items are sold. When an order comes in and it is time to pick and ship an item, Byrd also uses its tech to taps into a network of different shipping companies &#8212; the list includes the likes of UPS, DHL, Amazon, postNL and others &#8212; to find the cheapest and easiest way of getting an item to the buyer.</p>
<p>To be totally clear, Byrd is not the only one doing this. But alongside other independent companies that compete with Byrd &#8212; one of the biggest, ShipBob, last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/shipbob-nabs-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-help-e-commerce-companies-run-logistics-like-amazons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a big round of $200 million on a $1 billion valuation</a> &#8212; is a big elephant in the room in the form of Amazon. The e-commerce giant has positioned itself as something of a one-stop shop for merchants, providing not just fulfillment (via <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBA</a>), but storefront visibility, marketing and much more.</p>
<p>The size of Amazon is such that it typically accounts for a large market share, and many merchants can&#8217;t <em>not</em> have a presence there even if it&#8217;s primarily as a customer acquisition channel, said Petra Dobrocka, co-founder and CCO of Byrd, in an interview.</p>
<p>But the problem is that the Amazon option, and some of the other third-party providers, don&#8217;t leave much to personalization. Indeed, as e-retailers continue to mature, and find themselves facing their own stiff competition, they are looking for more ways of getting an edge, and to stand out from the crowd. Byrd provides something here for them, too, giving them the option to customize packaging so that customers are essentially experiencing a direct service, even when it&#8217;s actually coming from Byrd, and to give them options to go for more sustainable delivery and more if they choose.</p>
<p>That has possibly meant a slower rate of scaling for the startup, but it comes as a quality option, and that counts for something in a world that is teetering on very poor quality control, and definitely lack of distinct identity, in some marketplaces particularly as they continue to scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could say we are an alternative to Amazon, but also quite different. Our sellers are very brand-focused and want to provide a total experience total to customers,&#8221; Dobrocka said. &#8220;We also have smaller customers who appreciate this.&#8221; Indeed, as is so often the case, smaller businesses get short-changed on service levels compared to bigger businesses, so having a fulfillment service that treats even smaller retailers like bigger ones is a plus.</p>
<p>This is also part of a bigger trend, where a wave of tech companies are emerging to help those retailers build more distinct online presence and personalization, too. (The online storefront design platform Shogun, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/shogun-a-front-end-e-commerce-page-builder-nabs-67-5m-as-retailers-look-for-alternatives-to-marketplaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also announced funding last week</a>, is another example of a startup playing into this trend.)</p>
<p>All of this has led to Byrd seeing some very strong growth &#8212; revenues are up 300% compared to a year ago &#8212; with &#8220;hundreds of thousands of parcels per month&#8221; being handled, the company said.</p>
<p>Although its primary business is in catering to the very big B2C opportunity one obvious adjacent area where Byrd could work is in B2B, and Dobrocka said that will also be coming online in the coming months. Alongside that, while the company hasn&#8217;t specified which countries it will build out its fulfillment in next, given Mouro&#8217;s involvement, I&#8217;m guessing that Spain might be one of the next countries on the list.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to be leading Byrd’s Series B funding round, particularly as the pandemic has brought the need for flexible, digital e-commerce fulfilment solutions into sharp relief,&#8221; said Manuel Silva Martínez, general partner at Mouro Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Byrd’s end-to-end capabilities, focus on sustainability, and household brand customers set it apart from its competitors, and we look forward to seeing the successes that the geographic expansion enabled by this investment will bring.”</p>
