										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It would be an understatement to say that enterprise-focused startups have fared well during the pandemic. As organizations look to go remote, and the way we work has been flipped on its head, quickly-growing tech companies that simplify this transition are in high demand.</p>
<p>One such startup has, in fact, raised $61.5 million in the last 12 months alone. <a href="https://www.electric.ai/">Electric</a>, a company looking to put IT departments in the cloud, just announced the close of a $40 million Series C round. This comes after an extension of its Series B in March of 2020, when it raised $14.5 million, and then an additional $7 million from 01 Advisors in May of 2020.</p>
<p>This Series C round was led by Greenspring Associates, with participation from existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, GGV Capital, 01 Advisors, Primary Venture Partners as well as new investors including Atreides Management and Vintage Investment Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Electric launched in 2016 with a mission to make IT much simpler for small and medium-sized businesses. Rather than bringing on a dedicated IT department, or contracting out high-priced local service providers, Electric&#8217;s software allows one admin to manage devices, software subscriptions, permissions and more.</p>
<p>According to founder Ryan Denehy, the vast majority of IT&#8217;s work is administration, distribution, and maintenance of the broad variety of software programs at any given company. Electric does most of that job on behalf of IT, meaning that a smaller business only needs to worry about desk-side troubleshooting when it comes up, rather than the whole kit and caboodle.</p>
<p>Electric charges a flat price per seat per month, and Denehy says the company more than doubled its customer base in the last year. It now supports around 25,000 users across more than 400 individual customer organizations, which puts Electric just shy of $20 million ARR.</p>
<p>This is the first time Denehy has come anywhere close to sharing revenue numbers publicly, but it&#8217;s a good time to flex. The company has recently introduced a new lighter-weight offering that includes all of the same functionality as its more expensive product, but without access to chat functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;The name of the game is just simplicity, simplicity, simplicity,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;Part of this is in response to the fact that people are realizing the permanence of hybrid work. During the pandemic, people stopped paying their landlords but they didn&#8217;t stop paying us. So in the summer, we started to focus on how we can create more offerings that we can get in the hands of more businesses and let them start their journey with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denehy says that a little less than half of Electric&#8217;s client base are tech startups, which makes sense considering the company launched in New York in a tech and media-centric ecosystem. As a way to expand into other verticals, Electric acquired Sinu, an IT service provider who happened to have an impressive roster of clients outside of Electric&#8217;s comfort zone, such as legal, accounting and non-profit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Denehy said at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Organic market entry, even in adjacent markets can be extremely time consuming and expensive. Sinu&#8217;s team has done an excellent job winning and pleasing customers in a lot of industries where we currently don&#8217;t play but probably should. The combination of our two companies is a massive shot in the arm to our national expansion strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside growth, both of the Electric team and its customer base, the company is also investing in expanding its diversity programs and philanthropic efforts.</p>
<p>The Electric team is currently made up of just under 250 full-time employees, with 32.5 percent women and around 30 percent of employees being non-white. Specifically, nearly 12 percent of employees are Black and 10 percent are Latinx.</p>
<p>Denehy explained that he thinks of the company&#8217;s payroll, which is in the tens of millions of dollars, as one of the biggest ways he can make a change in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will wait longer to fill a role to make sure that we have the most diverse pipeline of candidates possible,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;A lot of founders will say that nobody applied. Well, the reality is you didn&#8217;t look hard enough. We&#8217;ve just accepted that like it may take us longer to fill certain roles.&#8221;</p>
<p>This latest round brings Electric&#8217;s total funding to more than $100 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Flurostat and Dagan, two startups that both are tackling the monitoring and management of agricultural inputs and outputs for a better understanding of the role sustainable agriculture can play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, have merged and are launching a package of services under a new brand,<a href="https://www.regrow.ag/"> Regrow</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The merge, announced yesterday, will create a company that combines Flurostat&#8217;s data driven agriculture management services with Dagan&#8217;s soil biogeochemical modeling technology, the companies said in a joint statement.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combined companies will have the ability to provide satellite collected data to optimize crop management and adoption of conservation practices along with site-specific analysis and custom interventions for different crops, fields, farms, and regions. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dagan co-founder Dr. William Salas said that the combined companies will be able to have a better handle on the market for carbon emissions &#8212; thanks in no small part to Dagan&#8217;s work on soil carbon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Soil carbon sequestration is finally emerging as a globally relevant strategy for drawing down excess </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">atmospheric carbon dioxide. Shortcuts, misconceptions and over-hyping have the potential to stunt the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tremendous potential of soil carbon,â Salas said in a statement. âBut the merger of FluroSat and Dagan will give the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">industry the confidence and integrity it needs with best-in-class soil health data that can prescribe site-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specific strategies and provide accuracy and transparency that will help companies succeed in carbon markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Terms of the merger were not disclosed, but FluroSat had previously raised roughly $8.6 million in equity and grant funding led by Microsoft&#8217;s M12 venture fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flurosat/company_financials">according to data from Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOver the next decade, we need to grow and produce enough food to nourish 10 billion people around </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world in a way that protects our land and stems climate change,â says Ranveer Chandra, Chief </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientist, Azure Global at Microsoft. âRegrowâs computational agriculture, using machine learning and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientific modeling, will help improve the accuracy of accounting for soil carbon, and bring farmers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closer to benefitting from carbon markets.â</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new investment fund is coming to Midwest cities, and it&#8217;s lead by names familiar to the local scenes. The aptly-named Midwest Fund targets early-stage startups from Pittsburgh to Chicago, from Detroit to Cincinnati, and everywhere in between. Unlike traditional venture capital funds, this one gets its funding from successful entrepreneurs looking for ways to reinvest in their regions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thefund.vc/community/midwest/">The Midwest Fund</a> was born from <a href="https://www.thefund.vc">The Fund</a>, an NYC-based venture capital group. Founded in 2018 by an all-star cast of Jenny Fielding, Katie Hunt, Adam Carver, and Matthew Brimer, The Fund has since expanded with micro-funds in Los Angeles, London, and the Boulder/Denver region. And with each expansion, local founders and investors are tapped to lead each region.</p>
<p>The Midwest Fund&#8217;s founding general partners are familiar names to the Midwest. This includes Ted Serbinski and Tops Kataria of Detroit, Chris Bergman of Cincinnati, Lynsie Campbell of Pittsburgh, Jennifer Fried of Chicago. With this diverse team, The Midwest Fund follows the example set-out by The Fund of having equal gender representation on investment committees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Fund has always set out to have equal gender representation on the investment committee,&#8221; said Ted Serbinski, a GP at The Midwest Fund, &#8220;and believed that this composition, not an explicit mandate, would lead to more balanced investing. Three years in and across the other geographies, The Fund has invested in over 40 percent female founders. We think the same will be true in The Midwest, and we&#8217;re excited to advance this mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Midwest area has long been a foundry of notable industries and startups, with more popping up every day. Nearly eight years ago, Ted Serbinki, then a partner at Detroit Venture Partners, mapped this area, calling it a diamond with key cities at each point. Now with The Midwest Fund, he&#8217;s part of a team ready to write seed-stage checks to young companies.</p>
<p>Serbinski tells TechCrunch this fund is unique to this area because of its speed. He explains the fund intends to invest in two Midwest companies a month for two years, which he believes would make it the most active in the region.</p>
<p>The Midwest Fund&#8217;s limited partners come from the local areas in which the fund operates including Chicago&#8217;s Amanda Lannert, CEO of Jellyvision, Pittsburgh&#8217;s Patrick Colletti, founder of Newthealth, and Cincinnati&#8217;s Charlie Key, founder of Losant. Across all six funds ran by The Fund, notable LPs come from Zillow, ClassPass, Soundcloud, Casper, Quartz, and InVision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Much of our daily lives have been transformed in one way or another by technology â and often through intentional efforts to innovate thanks to the advent of new technology. Now more than ever, we rely on shared collaboration platforms and digital workspaces in our professional lives, and yet most of the changes wrought by tech on our home and family lives seem like the accidental effects of broader trends, rather than intentional shifts. <a href="https://www.growmaple.com">Maple</a>, a new startup launching today, aims to change that.</p>
<p>Founded by former Shopify product director and Kit (which was acquired by Shopify in 2016) co-founder Michael Perry, Maple is billed as &#8220;the family tech platform,&#8221; and hopes to ease the burden of parenting, freeing up parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and kids to spend more quality time together. The startup, which is launching its app on iPhone and Android for all and onboarding new users from its waitlist over the next few weeks, has raised $3.5 million in seed funding â an impressive round for a company just about seven months into its existence. The round was led by Inspired Capital, and includes participation by Box Group, but is also supported by a number of angels who were Perry&#8217;s former colleagues at Shopify, including Shopify President Harley Finkelstein.</p>
<p>Perry and his co-founder Mike Taylor, who also co-founded Kit, decided to leave Shopify in order to pursue Perry&#8217;s vision of a platform that can help parents better manage their family lives â a platform made up of a social layer, a task-focused list of shared responsibilities, and a bourgeoning service marketplace that looks and feels a lot like the ecosystem Shopify has built for empowering e-commerce entrepreneurs. That&#8217;s by design, Perry says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re gonna see a lot of Shopify inspiration in this product â we think we&#8217;re the back office of every family,&#8221; Perry told me in an interview. &#8220;And we think we&#8217;re building the app ecosystem of apps, services, all kinds of things that are going to live on this platform that&#8217;s going to revolutionize parenting.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its current early incarnation, Maple&#8217;s primary interface for parents is a list of various tasks they need to take care of during the day. During onboarding, Maple asks parents what they&#8217;re typically responsible for in the household, and then uses some basic machine learning behind the scenes to build a customized schedule for getting those things done. Maple has signed on three initial partners to assist with accomplishing some of these tasks, including Evelyn Rusli&#8217;s Yumi food and nutrition brand for infants; Lalo, a DTC baby and toddler furniture and gear brand; and Haus, which will be providing date night packages for parents to enjoy for some getaway time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116461" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116461" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116461" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Michael_headshot.jpg?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Michael_headshot.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Michael_headshot.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Michael_headshot.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Michael_headshot.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Michael_headshot.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Michael_headshot.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Michael_headshot.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Michael_headshot.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116461" class="wp-caption-text">Maple co-founder Micheal Perry with his son.</p></div></p>
<p>The platform will offer users the ability to tap others for help with tasks â these could be other family members added to the household, or the partners mentioned above (the plan is to bring on more, but to gate admittance initially while developing API endpoints that any company can potentially tap into). When interacting with family members, Maple also encourages smalls social interactions, like thanking someone for their help on a particular task or just showing general appreciation. Perry says this is a key ingredient he prioritized in product design.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have this cool thing that every day at eight o&#8217;clock, we give you an end of the day recap with your family,&#8221; Perry said. &#8220;So you click on it, and it will show me that, for example, Alex [Perry&#8217;s wife] completed three responsibilities for our family today, and how many I did for my family today, and how much help I received from other people today. And directly in app, you can send these cool little &#8216;Thank you &#8216;messages and say, you know, I love you, I appreciate you â we&#8217;re a great team. And Alex will get those messages. We believe in a world where this can be incredibly dynamic, in many different ways kto kind of bring some love and appreciation and make parenting feel more rewarding and easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perry is quick to note that what Maple offers today is only the beginning, and it&#8217;s clear he has bold ambitions for the platform. He talked about building &#8220;the family graph,&#8221; or a trove of data that can be used to not only build intelligent recommendations and develop ever more advanced machine learning to optimize family management, but also to provide partners with the tools they need to build products to best serve families. I asked Perry what that means for privacy, given that people are likely to be far more reluctant to share info around their families than they are about their work lives. He said the they team plans to go slow in terms of what it exposes to partners, when, and how, and that they&#8217;ll have user privacy in mind at each step â since, after all, Perry himself is a father and a husband and is wary of any incursions on his own private life.</p>
<p>For now, partners like Yumi only receive what users share with them through their own account creation and login mechanism, and they only pass back a basic attribution token â essentially letting Maple know the task was completed so it can mark it off in a user&#8217;s list.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116460" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116460" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116460" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Help-What-To-Cook.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="786" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Help-What-To-Cook.jpg 3650w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Help-What-To-Cook.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Help-What-To-Cook.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Help-What-To-Cook.jpg?resize=768,589 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Help-What-To-Cook.jpg?resize=680,522 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Help-What-To-Cook.jpg?resize=1536,1178 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Help-What-To-Cook.jpg?resize=2048,1571 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Help-What-To-Cook.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116460" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Maple</p></div></p>
<p>Maple&#8217;s partners today are representative of the kind of businesses that might make use of the platform in future, but Perry has a much broader vision. He hopes that Maple can ultimately help parents handle their responsibilities across a wide range of needs and income levels. Right now, Perry points out, a lot of what&#8217;s available to parents in terms of support is only available to higher income brackets â ie., nannies and dedicated caregivers. Perry says that his experience growing up relatively poor with a single mother supporting the entire family led him to want to provide something better.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have 125 million households in America, you have 3 million children being born every year, you have 30% of the households in America being single parent-run households,&#8221; Perry said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard. Some people are working one two jobs, most couples are working couples. Every industry that&#8217;s changed has been about making things more accessible. In the case of Shopify, at one point building, an online store required hundreds of thousands of dollars and a bunch of skilled people. Now you can start a store for $20 in five minutes â 20 years ago, that was unfathomable.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Perry, Maple represents a path to that kind of shift in the economics of parenting and a network of family services, including goods, care, leisure and more. The startup has plans to eventually enlist other parents to provide services, which Perry says will unlock part-time income generation for full-time parents, allowing parents to help each other at the same time.</p>
<p>I asked him if he thought people would be reluctant to treat their family lives with the same kind of optimization approach favored by enterprise and commercial platform tools, but he suggested that in fact, not taking advantage of those same technologies in our personal lives is a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that, uniquely, we&#8217;re living through a generation where we can start creating more time for people,&#8221;Â Perry said. &#8220;I think what makes Maple so unique is that no company has approached this by asking &#8216;How do we create more time for you so that you can spend more time with your kids?&#8217; in the consolidated way that we have.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: I worked at Shopify from 2018 to 2019 while Perry was employed there, but we did not work together directly.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://burrow.com">Burrow</a>, a startup that first launched with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/burrow-wants-to-bring-caspers-mattress-concept-to-couches/">a modular sofa</a>, eventually aims to sell you furniture for every room in your home. Today, it&#8217;s announcing that it&#8217;s raised $25 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>Burrow participated in the Y Combinator accelerator in 2016 with an initial aim of building sofas that, by virtue of being modular, were easier to move and adapt to a variety of living spaces. Now its product lineup also includes armchairs, ottomans, tables, rugs, lights and other accessories. In fact, the company says it launched 19 new products last year, including a modular shelving system.</p>
<p>When I asked via email about this expansion, co-founder and CEO Stephen Kuhl told me that the company follows &#8220;a very rigorous research process&#8221; involving customer surveys, focus groups, online search data and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The goal is to match the largest customer needs with the biggest market opportunities,&#8221; Kuhl said. &#8220;Once itâs clear what category to enter, we use our research to define how weâre going to develop the best version(s) of each product for our customer base, and how weâre going to build the best end-to-end customer experience around that product. Iâm probably going to jinx it, but every single product weâve ever launched has exceeded projections, a testament to our customer-centric, research-driven design process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burrow says it saw triple-digit revenue growth last year, a trend it anticipates continuing in 2021. Kuhl suggested that the startup is also benefitting from broader trends accelerated during the pandemic, including the shift to e-commerce, an increased focus on the home and people moving to the suburbs (and buying more furniture in the process).</p>

<p>&#8220;Over the last 18 months, we launched innovative new products in every category of living room furniture,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In 2021, weâll continue that expansion into every room of the home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has now raised a total fo $55 million. Its Series C was led by Parkway Venture Capital, with Managing Partner Gregg Hill joining Burrow&#8217;s board of directors. NEA, Red &amp; Blue Ventures, Winklevoss Capital and Michael Seibel also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Burrow says it will use the new funding to launch new products while also investing in operations and building out its international supply chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parkway looks for brands that are changing how we live today as well as innovating to stay ahead,&#8221; Hill said in a statement. &#8220;We believed in Burrowâs business model from the beginning, having invested in their Series B round, and recognize all their future potential.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miami-based </span><a href="https://www.admobilize.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdMobilize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its spin-off, </span><a href="https://www.matrix.one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced this morning that they are being acquired for $19.5 million. The buyer is <a href="https://www.rokk3r.com/">Rokk3r</a>, a Miami-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">holding company that invests in creating, acquiring and integrating companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdMobilize quantifies digital advertising in the physical world, so marketers can better reach their target audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âIf youâre walking on 5th Avenue and you pass by a bus shelter that has a digital screen, AdMobilize analyzes [peoplesâ] age, gender, emotion and even how long the person was looking at the ad. We created a platform that mimics the click-through rate. So we kind of created Google Analytics for the outside world,â said Rodolfo Saccoman, CEO and founder of AdMobilize.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which has raised $13 million since its launch in 2012, also has offices in Saccomanâs native Brazil, as well as Colombia and London.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdMobilize operates as a SaaS with an average monthly subscription fee of $50 per screen or billboard.Â </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Subscription-based pricing is dead: Smart SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based models&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/embed/#?secret=VrCeef3F8c" data-secret="VrCeef3F8c" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOur tech is 95% accurate, and itâs based on undeniable computer vision data,â Saccoman said. If a digital ad screen doesnât have a camera built-in, AdMobilize can provide one. But Saccoman made it very clear that the company doesnât do any facial recognition and really is only interested in the data in a broader sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix Labs, on the other hand, is a hardware company with products that look similar to Raspberry Pi, but with a lot more oomph.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOur Matrix Labs development boards give the Raspberry Pi superpowers. It transforms the Pi to be AI-ready for computer vision, sensor fusion, voice recognition and more. It democratizes AI at the edge by removing barriers to entry, shortening the learning curve, and increases adaptability,â Saccoman said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company offers two boards. One is called the Matrix Creator and sells for $99, while the other is the Matrix Voice which goes for $75.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âIt [Matrix boards] enables people to not spend millions of dollars making a piece of hardware,â Saccoman said. In fact, it levels the playing field for developers, he added. âIt allows them to create solutions in the physical world with inexpensive edge AI hardware.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rokk3r was an early investor in AdMobilize, along with Azoic Ventures, Fuel Venture Capital, VAS Ventures and Axel Springer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âRokk3r has always believed in the potential of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and computer vision, hence it seeded and helped build AdMobilize. Where we stand today with what AdMobilize/Matrix Labs has achieved, it is clear that the technology created is critical to the future of AI/IOT/CV, and with Rokk3râs focus on AI/IOT and IP creation, the fit was clear,â said Nabyl Charania, chairman and CEO of Rokk3r.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saccoman is a Brazilian-born serial entrepreneur who moved to the U.S. to attend college at Cornell in 1995 and never left. He made his way down to South Florida with his first job out of college, where he was head of Digital Innovation at the ultra-lux Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach. While the AdMobilize/Matrix Labs deal is his first exit, his first âventureâ was when he was just 13 years old. It was called the PiPi bag. SÃ£o Paulo, the financial capital of Brazil, is notorious for awful traffic. It can often take people three hours to get to the airport, and when youâre trying to catch a flight, stopping to use the restroom isnât usually an option. As the name suggests, the Pipi bag was a handheld portable toilet of sorts for those moments when nature calls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years later, in 2007, Saccoman also founded a company with his brother who has a PhD in psychology. It was called MyTherapyJournal.com and was the first online journaling platform with cognitive behavior therapy.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âIt would measure your varying emotions when you answered key questions. For example, people could start to understand what would trigger their anxiety. It had early traces of AI,â Saccoman said. MyTherapyJournal closed in 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of his various ventures, he said, âMy mind was always running to find problems.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saccoman will stay on board and lead Rokk3râs AI and IoT division.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After going over four years without raising any capital, coding class platform<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"> Codecademy</a> has raised a new tranche of money: a $40 million Series D round led by Owl Ventures, with participation from Prosus and Union Square Ventures.</p>
<p>The startup is the latest edtech business to bring on capital after years without it, a list that includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">ClassDojo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/">CourseHero</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/quizlet-valued-at-1-billion-as-it-raises-millions-during-a-global-pandemic/">Quizlet</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/udacity-raises-75m-in-debt-says-its-tech-education-business-is-profitable-after-enterprise-pivot/">Udacity</a>. But founder <a href="https://twitter.com/zsims?lang=en">Zach Sims</a>, who began the company in 2011 as a Columbia student, says that Codecademyâs growth, and hunger for new capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">isnât due to a pandemic bump.</a></p>
<p>âA lot of that edtech bump came in K-12 and college solutions, or in leisure educational things like MasterClass,â Sims said. âOurs was less pandemic-induced.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The business, which helps students and employees learn how to code in an interactive environment, is currently bringing in $50 million in annual recurring revenue. That figure is on track with Codecademyâs normal growth trajectory, which has been doubling since 2018. The startup has still seen some areas of growth. It took Codecademy four years to reach their first 100,000 users; however, they added 50,000 more paying users in their fifth year alone.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Udacity raises $75M in debt, says its tech education business is profitable after enterprise pivot&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/udacity-raises-75m-in-debt-says-its-tech-education-business-is-profitable-after-enterprise-pivot/embed/#?secret=YBUUxYrDxf" data-secret="YBUUxYrDxf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Codecademyâs funding signals that investors arenât just looking for exponential growth, they are looking for sustainable, historical growth. The startup has been cash-flow positive for years, and has $20 million of its $30 million Series C, closed in 2016, still in the bank. Two-thirds of todayâs capital is going straight to the bank, Sims says.</p>
<p>Still, raising itself costs money in the form of equity for founders and a startup. So why raise if you still have cash and arenât struggling to keep up demand?</p>
<p>Sims says that the new cash will be used to acquire businesses, grow internationally in India and other countries, and hire. He also wants to âinvest deeplyâ in a paid product it launched in the wake of the pandemic, Codecademy For Business. The product is Codecademyâs foray into selling coding classes for the enterprise, a shift from its direct-to-consumer route.</p>
<p>Codecademy For Business launched in beta last year and grew to 600 paying clients. Half of those customers are non-technology companies like banks, consulting firms and small businesses that want to train employees in data literacy and tech-specific programing. Sims says that the product was launched due to customer demand, and piggybacks on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">what investors see</a> as an awakening among companies that it is necessary to train and reskill employees.</p>
<p>The growth mirrors the gains recently enjoyed by Udemy. The re-skilling company similarly has an enterprise and consumer product, but is seeing more monetary gains in the former. We scooped last month that Udemy for Business has secured 7,000 customers, and is bringing in roughly $200 million in ARR.</p>

<p>Sims says that its enterprise operation, which competes with products like Udemy or Coursera, requires upfront research and development âbefore it starts to pay itself back.â He thinks that building a bottoms-up enterprise product, fueled by tens of millions of Codecademy users, will be both the big opportunity and a big challenge for the company. The end goal here for Codecademy is to have a 50% split between its consumer and enterprise business.</p>
<p>âThe number one biggest differentiator has been interactivity,â Sims said. â<a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/ ">Everyone is tired of Zoom</a>, and our thesis since the beginning is that video is not the best way to learn, and that learning by doing is.â</p>
<p>While the startup wouldnât disclose valuation, Codecademyâs growth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/edtech-startups-flirt-with-unicorn-style-growth/">feels mature and unicorn-like. </a>The startup is diversifying revenue, adding offensive cash to its bank, and even not-so-subtly added a CFO from Chegg to its ranks. IPOs are in the air.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While usage of telehealth services have surged during the COVID-19 epidemic, there are some times when health professionals need to be around in person to conduct diagnostics tests. To help those telehealth companies bridge that gap is <a href="https://www.axlehealth.com/">Axle Health</a>, a company currently enrolled in the latest cohort from the Y Combinator accelerator.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of the professionals that we send in home, they&#8217;re phlebotomists, NAs, RVNs, and RNs as well,&#8221; said Axle co-founder Connor Hailey.</p>
<p>In a sad reflection of the times, most of the calls the company&#8217;s getting are COVID-19 related, Hailey said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while the company currently doesn&#8217;t accept insurance, many of the companies on the platform choose a price they want to charge their patients and then seek reimbursement from insurers from those costs, according to Hailey.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are very few patients that are paying cash. Our services in the home are what would come out of pocket,&#8221; Hailey said. Those fees vary by the licensure level of the visiting health care worker. An in-home COVID-19 test could be $40 and a phlebotomist providing a blood draw would cost about the same amount, said Hailey.Â Â </span></p>
<p>The company launched its service at the end of January and is seeking to expand its treatment options to more than just COVID-19 testing, but for now, it&#8217;s simply responding to market demand.</p>
<p>Hailey <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/announcing-axle-health-next-generation-in-home-connor-hailey/">launched the business</a> after spending a few years working at ZocDoc and then spending some time at Uber. What motivates Hailey and company co-founder Adam Stansell is providing similar concierge services at lower costs for a broader base of patients, Hailey said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The rich have access to in-home care can we make it economical enough so that we can bring it to everyone,&#8221; he said.Â </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year of life under a global health pandemic has seen a massive surge of people working from home &#8212; a shift that has thrown a stark light on the iffy quality of our broadband networks. Today a startup called <a href="http://plume.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plume</a> &#8212; which has built a mesh-WiFi platform that helps optimize broadband connectivity and then uses it to deliver a range of smarter home services to some 22 million homes globally &#8212; is announcing a major funding round of $270 million that underscores the opportunity to fix that, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weâre the best at optimizing WiFi connectivity in the home, but that is not what weâre about,&#8221; said Fahri Diner, Plume&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We see it as the foundation. We cut our teeth on it but have gone way beyond that to services like advanced parental controls, secure access controls, which devices can access networks and what passwords they use. We focus on sophisticated security, which we believe will be the next big area that consumers will start paying attention to.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ultimate product for Plume is a comprehensive, cloud-driven platform that enables consumers to curate, manage and deliver these services. Thatâs what the company is about.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment, a Series E, is coming from a single investor, Insight Partners, and values the company at $1.35 billion. This is a significant step up for the company, which almost exactly a year ago <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/plume-r-secures-85-million-in-financing-852091305.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $85 million</a> in a combination of equity and debt at a valuation of $510 million.</p>
<p>Unless you have been following the business of home broadband networking, you may not be familiar with the name Plume. But if you are not already be using it, chances are that you may be getting pitched a service using its technology, or will be soon.</p>
<p>The company, based out of Palo Alto, has deals in place with some 170 carriers around the globe that provide residential broadband services, reselling Plume&#8217;s mesh technology as a way to improve home WiFi connectivity &#8212; especially critical in older or bigger homes, and dwellings where you have many people connecting to and straining your broadband network &#8212; providing Plume-powered services like network security, parental access controls and motion awareness on top of that.</p>
<p>Plume brands those added services as HomePass, and on top of this it also provides a cloud-based operations tools to carriers, Haystack and Harvest, which help them with customer support, to manage their networks, glean better performance analytics and provide insights on customer usage and churn.</p>
<p>Plume also works with a number of big and less well-known hardware makers who design the routing devices and the processors and related software that power them.</p>
<p>Some of its customers, like Comcast, Charter, Qualcomm, Belkin, Cablevision, Liberty Global and Shaw Communications have become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/comcast-invests-in-mesh-router-maker-plume-launches-xfinity-xfi-for-managing-your-homes-wireless-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategic investors</a> in the company over the years, which speaks to its traction with the big players in the market. (It has raised $397 million to date.)</p>
<p>There have been a number of efforts over the years to improve WiFi in the home, from faster networks through to better routers and WiFi extenders.</p>
<p>Plume&#8217;s technology is based on one of those alternatives, mesh architecture &#8212; also used by others like Google in its Nest WiFi system &#8212; which uses a single router and then a series of nodes that operate as if they are a single device on the network (extenders by contrast use different SSIDs and passwords).</p>
<p>On top of the mesh architecture, Plume then runs a software-defined network to identify and better measure the traffic, using automation to, for example, then detect and fix when a device is on the network, may need more power to work properly, and so on.</p>
<p>In all, it appears that Plume has some <a href="https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Plume+Design+Inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">170 patents and patent applications</a> in play to underpin what it has built.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that at one time Plume was compared to Eero, the mesh-based wifi router startup that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/amazon-is-buying-home-mesh-router-startup-eero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually acquired by Amazon</a>, which now resells its routers as part of its own mesh WiFi solution.</p>
<p>But the two have some critical differences, based mainly on the business premise behind the two. As Diner points out, Plume&#8217;s service stack is based not around a router (as Eero&#8217;s primarily was) but on mesh technology that plus an open source silicon-to-cloud framework platform for building services to run on the mesh network that it calls <a href="http://opensync.io">OpenSync</a>. This essentially allows service providers to build their own services on top of Plume&#8217;s mesh architecture.</p>
<p>(Diner, I should point out, has a pretty long-standing and deep understanding of what carriers need, what they actually use and also how they think. He himself trained as an engineer and worked in increasingly senior roles at a number of vendors at the cusp of when carriers were making their switch from legacy copper to fiber and optic networks. In the heyday of telecoms capital expenditures, he sold a previous company that he founded, Qtera, a pioneer in long-haul photonic networking solutions, to now-defunct Nortel for $3.2 billion. He&#8217;s also a long-standing investor and board member at a range of major next-generation communications vendors.)</p>
<p>In a telecoms world that has long fretted over the idea of being cannibalized and relegated to the role of a &#8220;dumb pipe&#8221;, it provides a way for those carriers to build services &#8212; apps, as it were &#8212; on top of that WiFi connectivity.</p>
<p>That existential crisis has been even more compounded as the promise of &#8220;triple play&#8221; &#8212; carriers selling voice, broadband and video services to their customers &#8212; has failed to deliver not least because no one is particularly interested in using or keeping their fixed landlines, and carriers have been completely outplayed on content by the giant rush of tech and media companies building their own, more attractive alternatives for consumers.</p>
<p>That has left carriers with a focus on broadband, which itself then gets commoditized on price, with everyone more or less offering the same speeds and reliability.</p>
<p>&#8220;How to differentiate?&#8221; is the question they all ask now, said Diner. Plume&#8217;s answer: &#8220;We differentiate inside the home, with a new bundle of services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Realistically, however, Diner points out that only the very biggest carriers (and not even all of them) might have the resources and appetite to do so. Of the 170 customers it has today, only five are building their own customized services on top of the platform, he said.</p>
<p>This is why Plume builds services that it white-labels and resells to carriers to sell on to consumers, and why those services have seen a lot of traction among those service providers. OpenSync, Plume says, now covers some 26 million access points and is seeing a sharp rise as more people fill out their homes with more equipment that they use throughout the day.</p>
<p>You might argue that those home services will also start to look too similar to each other as well, and so frankly the hope is that the open platform will eventually lead to more companies and services innovating around it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it&#8217;s a win-win for Plume.</p>
<p>âGrowth in the smart home category is exploding, but the quality of consumer experience has fallen short,â said Insight Partners Managing Director Ryan Hinkle, in a statement. âWe are convinced that Plume, with its scalable cloud data platform approach, highly efficient go-to-market strategy, strong momentum, top-quartile financial performance across all SaaS KPIs â including revenue, growth rates, gross margin, efficiency and retention metrics â and world class team is transforming this category. Weâre delighted to join and support this exciting journey.â Hinkle is joining Plume&#8217;s board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.anuviaplantnutrients.com/">Anuvia Plant Nutrients</a> has raised $103 million to commercialize its novel fertilizer technology.</p>
<p>The company, backed by investors like <a href="https://www.tpg.com/platforms/tpgart"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TPG ART,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â <a href="https://www.pontifaxagtech.com/">Pontifax Global Food and Agriculture Technology Fund</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <a href="https://generatecapital.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Capital</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><a href="http://www.piva.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piva</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is now ready to roll out its tech, which is already used on roughly 1200 farms and is projected to be on 20 million acres of farmland by 2025.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now led by longtime agriculture executive Amy Yoder, who represents the sixth generation of a Michigan farm family, Anuvia pitches its tech as a supplement for crops that can boost productivity by taking excrement, food waste and agricultural processing waste and converting that into useful fertilizer using a proprietary catalytic process.Â </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By treating the waste with a specific blend of chemicals Yoder said Anuvia&#8217;s technology can control the release of nutrients as plants grow to make more productive crops and reduce leaching into soil, protecting groundwater and restoring carbon to the soil.</p>
<p>Anuvia is one of a growing number of agriculture technology companies trying to juice crop productivity and capture carbon to provide additional revenues from more abundant crops and carbon capture and storage. Other startups, including Pivot Bio, Indigo Agriculture, AgBiome, and Agrinos, are all developing other crop treatments that can purportedly boost agricultural production.</p>
<p>&#8220;M<span style="font-weight: 400;">ost of what I see would be very complimentary to us,&#8221; said Yoder. &#8220;Because we put the carbon back into the soil, because the nutrients are held in different way. You could utilize the pivot technology and the Anuvia technology. Those things when they could piggyback together could make really nice solutions in the longterm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Winter Garden, Fla.-based company has a 1.2 million ton facility for production, but the company wants to build out additional capacity and continue developing new fertilizers to take to market, Yoder said.</p>
<p>Farmers using the product see increased yields of around five times their previous production levels and the product can be used on all the main row crops, according to Yoder.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That claim has been verified by Environmental Resources Management (ERM), a leading global environmental consulting firm, versus traditional fertilizer on corn, rice, and cotton.</span></p>
<p>Anuvia&#8217;s treatment can also reduce greenhouse gases on production by up to 32% compared to commercial fertilizers. Anuvia estimates that its products could provide emissions reductions equivalent to removing 30,000 cars from roads. If the company can get farmers to apply its treatment to the 90 million acres of corn in the U.s. that would reduce the equivalent emissions of 1.8 million cars, according to a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWith the worldâs population expected to hit 10 billion by 2050, we need technology-enabled, large-scale agriculture to meet this growing demand,â says Dr. Geoff Duyk, Founder and Managing Partner of Circularis and Anuvia Board Member. âAnuviaâs technology will help farms continue to feed the world, while also advancing the circular economy, increasing sustainability, and enhancing resource efficiency.âÂ </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile advertising company <a href="http://ironsource.com">ironSource</a> is announcing its second acquisition of the year â <a href="https://lunalabs.io">Luna Labs</a>, a startup that that&#8217;s built a platform allowing app developers to create and manage video and playable ads.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/luna-labs-creates-playable-ads-directly-from-unity/">first wrote about the startup in 2019</a>, its main selling point was the ability to create those ads directly from from the Unity game engine used by many developers. Since then, it has expanded its platform to support the creation of both playable and video ads (including unlimited variations of a gameplay video), manage their entire ad library, analyze their performance and even automatically optimize them based on install data. Its customers include Crazy Labs, Supersonic Studios, Lion Studios, Kwalee and Voodoo.</p>
<p>IronSource, meanwhile, has built a platform for mobile user growth and monetization. It was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/ironsource-a-mobile-adtech-startup-confirms-400m-raise-at-1-valuation/">valued at more than $1 billion</a> in its most recent funding round of more than $400 million, and in January it announced <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/ironsource-acquires-ad-measurement-firm-soomla/">the acquisition of ad measurement company Soomla</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, ironSource&#8217;s co-founder and chief revenue officer Omer Kaplan said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our vision at ironSource is to build the most comprehensive growth platform for app developers, allowing them to focus on content creation and on building a great user experience, while we provide the infrastructure for their business expansion. Creatives are a key part of that and have only become more important as competition for user attention grows. But ad creative development and testing at scale is incredibly difficult and costly. Luna Labs solves that by bringing high quality end-to-end ad creation management to app developers, and weâre excited to be able to add that capability into the ironSource platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. IronSource says that the Luna Labs team (currently based in the United Kingdom) will remain in its current offices, where it will continue developing its technology &#8220;under the ironSource umbrella.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://constellr.space/">ConstellR</a>, a SpaceTech startup with a technology that can monitors land surface temperatures from space, has raised a â¬1m pre-seed round led by FTTF, with the participation of strategic investor OHB Venture Capital, Baden-WÃ¼rttembergâs state bank L-Bank and an undisclosed investor. The first system is due to go into orbit in December 2021. The company was a finalist for Hottest Ag/FoodTech Startup at the prestigious <a href="http://theeuropas.com">Europas Awards 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The Freiburg, Germany-based startup monitors the land via a constellation of 30 CubeSats with thermal infrared payloads. The data generated is used by farmers to reduce water and fertilizer usage, and could help them reduce existing monitoring costs by 97%, says the company. ConstellR has a patent-pending miniaturization architecture with âfree-form opticsâ and claims to be able to make it much cheaper to monitor the infrared part of the spectrum than traditional satellite systems.</p>
<p>Dr. Max Gulde, CEO, ConstellR, said: âOur mission is to monitor every single field on the planet every single day of the year and provide precision farming companies with highly accurate temperature data to safeguard the worldâs food supply. With our strong financial and technology partners on board, I am looking forward to a time of quantum leaps in our constellation development to change agriculture on the global planetary scale.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tobias Schwind, Managing Partner at FTTF, Fraunhoferâs Technology Transfer Fund, said: âConstellRâs unique technology and business case as well as its passionate team convinced us to make this exciting pre-seed investment.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It turns out, where&#8217;s there&#8217;s flies there&#8217;s brass. <a href="http://betterorigin.co.uk">Better Origin</a> is a startup that converts waste food into essential nutrients using insects fed to chickens inside a standard shipping container. Itâs now raised a Seed Series $3 million funding round led by Fly Ventures and solar entrepreneur Nick Boyle, while previous investor Metavallon VC is also participating. Its competitors include Protix, Agriprotein, InnovaFeed, Enterra, Entocycle.</p>
<p>Better Originâs product is an âautonomous insect mini-farm.â Its X1insect mini-farm is dropped on site. A farmer adds food waste &#8211; gathered from nearby factories or from the farm &#8211; into a hopper to feed the larvae of black soldier flies.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, the insects are fed directly to the chickens as an alternative to the soy feed they normally get. To add to the ease of use, everything inside the container is automated and remotely controlled by Better Originâs engineers in Cambridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This process has a double effect. Not only does it take care of the food waste product as a by-product of farming practices, but it also drives down the use of soy, the growth of which is contributing to deforestation and habitat loss in countries like Brazil.</p>
<p>Plus, given the pandemic has exposed the fragility of the global food supply chain, the company says its solution is way of decentralizing food and feed production, thus safeguarding the food supply chain and food security.</p>
<p>Better Origin says it is tackling a real problem, and itâs a fair assessment. Western economies waste around a third of all food produced annually, but, on average, the demands of a growing population means food production will need to increase by 70%. Food waste is also the third-largest emitter of Green House Gas (GHG) after the US and China.</p>
<p>Founder Fotis Fotiadis was working in the Oil &amp; Gas industry when he decided heâd rather work in a sustainable, non-polluting. After studying Sustainable Engineering at Cambridge University, and meeting cofounder Miha Pipan, the two set out to work on a sustainable startup.</p>
<p>The company was launched in May 2020, now has five commercial contracts, and plans to expand across the UK.</p>
<p>Better Origin says its differentiation with competitors is the nature of its âdecentralizedâ approach to insect farming, as a result of the way its units are, effectively, âDrag-and-dropâ into a farm. In some sense, itâs not dissimilar to adding a server to a server farm.</p>
<p>The business model will be to either lease or sell systems to farms, likely with a subscription model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When people ask me which robotics categories are poised for the biggest growth, I often point to agriculture. The technology already has a strong foothold in places like warehouse and logistics, but itâs impossible to look at the American â and global â farming community and not see a lot of potential for human-assisted automation.</p>
<p>The category still seems fairly wide open â but not for lack of interest. There are a number of companies both large and small carving out niches in the category. For now, at least, it seems thereâs room for a number of different players. After all, needs vary greatly from farm to farm and crop to crop.</p>
<p>Santa Monica-based Future Acres is launching today, with plans to tackle grape picking. An outgrowth of Wavemaker Partners &#8212; the same firm that gave the world burger-flipping Miso Robotics â the startup is also announce its first robot, Carry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116227" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116227" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116227" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116227" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Future Acres</p></div></p>
<p>âWe see Carry as a kind of harvesting sidekick for workers. Itâs an autonomous harvesting companion,â CEO Suma Reddy tells TechCrunch. âWhat it can do in the real world is transport up to 500 lbs. of crops in all terrain and all weather. It can increase production efficiency by up to 80%, which means it pays for itself in only 80 days.â</p>
<p>Carry relies on AI to transport hand-picked crops, working alongside humans rather than attempting to replace the delicate picking process outright. The company is expecting that farms will purchase multiple machines that can work in tandem to speed up their process and help reduce the human strain of moving the crops around manually.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116228" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116228" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116228" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116228" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Future Acres</p></div></p>
<p>The company is still in early stages, having developed a prototype of Carry. Itâs also exploring some partnerships for development. The systems would run $10,000-$15,000 up front, though the company says itâs looking at a RaaS (robotics as a service) model, as a way to defer that cost.</p>
<p>Interest in agricultural robotics has only increased during the pandemic, amid health concerns and labor issues. The company is building on that interest by launching a campaign on SeedInvest, in hopes of raising $3 million, in addition to funding already provided by Wavemaker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The onset of the pandemic has led to increased demand across customer income groups around the world for digital banking options. We&#8217;ve seen how digital banks like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/">Zolve</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/fintech-darling-nubank-raises-blockbuster-400m-series-g-at-25b-valuation/">Nubank</a> have raised money in recent months to fill this need. This time, a startup from Africa has joined the party.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tymebank.co.za/">TymeBank</a>, a South African digital bank, announced today that it has secured an R1.6 billion (~$109 million) investment from new investors in the UK and Philippines. The company made this known via a statement. This investment will be used to bolster TymeBank&#8217;s growth and drive its commercial expansion across the country.</p>
<p>However, this investment will come in two tranches. According to the company, R500 million ($34 million) has already been invested in the business, while the rest &#8212; R1.1 billion ($75 million) &#8212; will be invested over the next 12 to 15 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TymeBank offers a transactional bank account with zero or low monthly fees and a savings product. Most of its customers are onboarded via physical kiosks, usually in Pick n Pay and Boxer stores around the country. Since launching in February 2019, TymeBank has grown rapidly and now has about 2.8 million customers. The company says that it&#8217;s on track to reach 3 million by the end of next month.</p>
<p>The investors for this unnamed round include Apis Growth Fund II, a private equity fund managed by Apis Partners, and Gokongwei-owned JG Summit Holdings, one of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines. Both these investors are experienced in financial services in emerging markets; Apis, for instance, is a private equity asset manager that supports growth-stage financial services and financial infrastructure businesses.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that this is one of the largest raises, if not the largest, for a digital bank on the continent. Tauriq Keraan, the CEO of TymeBank, considers this to be largely due to more investors buying into the importance of digital banking and also the company&#8217;s value propositions &#8212; the first which is improving access to underbanked and underserviced customers in South Africa, and the other, satisfying customer demand for low and transparent bank fees which is generally viewed as both costly and difficult to understand across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The establishments of digital banks in South Africa is in its infancy. Growth in this particular segment of financial services is only possible with investments from partners who understand and support the growth trajectory of digital banks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With already existing shareholders like African Rainbow Capital (founded by South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe), TymeBank says these new investors will grow the company into a top tier retail bank in South Africa. The investment will also help the company expand its range of banking products and grow its lending portfolio. Diversification of offerings is key as well as TymeBank seeks to enhance its propositions in insurance and credit cards to its customers.</p>
<p>âAs the controlling shareholder in TymeBank, African Rainbow Capital is delighted to have our new co-investors onboard. Equally important, Apis and the Gokongwei family invest in TymeBank at a time when significant uncertainty reigns globally and in South Africa as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; said Dr Patrice Motsepe, the majority owner of TymeBank and chairman of African Rainbow Capital. âThe invested amount of R1.6 billion is no small feat both in terms of drawing investment into South Africaâs financial services sector as well as investing into a fledgling part of the sector in our country.â</p>

<p>TymeBank claims to onboard an average of 110,000 new customers per month. This makes it globally recognized for digital banking in emerging markets, and the plan is to reach 4 million customers next year. In terms of growth, TymeBank currently outpaces its competitors in Africa and can be argued to be one of the fastest-growing digital banks in the world at the moment. The company is the first bank in South Africa to be fully operated off a cloud-based infrastructure network and the first to be granted a commercial banking license in the country since 1999.</p>

<p>TymeBank isn&#8217;t indigenously South African though. It is a member of the Tyme group of companies headquartered in Singapore. The holding company, Tyme, focuses on designing, building, and operating digital banks for emerging markets. With its success in South Africa, Tyme is planning to launch operations in Asia and has entered into an agreement to launch a digital bank in the Philippines in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Based in Singapore, <a href="https://www.erudifi.com/">ErudiFi</a> wants to help more students in Southeast Asia stay in school by giving them affordable financing options. The startup announced today it has raised a $5 million Series A, co-led by Monkâs Hill Ventures and Qualgro.</p>
<p>ErudiFi currently works with more than 50 universities and vocational schools in Indonesia and the Philippines. Co-founder and chief executive officer Naga Tan told TechCrunch that students in those countries have limited financing options, and often rely on friends or family, or informal payday lenders that charge high interest rates.</p>
<p>To provide more accessible financing options, ErudiFi partners with accredited universities and schools to offer subsidized installment plans, using tech to scale up while keeping costs down. Interest rates and repayment terms vary between institutions, but can be as low as 0%, with loans payable in 12 to 24 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>By providing their students with affordable financing plans, ErudiFi can increase retention rates at schools, helping them keep students who would otherwise be forced to drop out because of financial issues.</p>
<p>Tan said ErudiFiâs value proposition for educational institutions is &#8220;being able to offer a data-driven financing solution that helps with student recruitment and retention. Students also greatly benefit because our product is one of the few, if not the only, affordable financing option they have access to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a press statement, Peng T. Ong, co-founder and managing partner of Monkâs Hill Ventures, said, &#8220;Access to affordable tertiary education remains a huge pain point in Southeast Asia where the cost is nearly double then the average GDP per capita. ErudiFi is tackling an underserved market that is plagued with high-interest rates by traditional financial institutions and limited reach from peer-to-peer lending companies.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new VC fund, &#8220;<a href="https://www.2150.vc/">2150</a>&#8220;, is launching with the first close of a â¬200m ($240m) fund which will back technologies aimed largely at reducing the carbon footprint of cities. For example, startups that inject carbon into concrete, or monitor the energy of buildings. The final close is anticipated by mid-2021.</p>
<p>The advisory board for 2150 comprises the former chief sustainability officer in the Obama administration and renowned urbanist and academic, Richard Florida. 2150 is based around the idea that <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html">half of the worldâs population lives in cities</a>, and this will increase to two-thirds by 2050,Â creating a growing environmental impactÂ that the world canÂ ill-afford, given the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Based across London, Copenhagen and Berlin, the fundâsÂ Limited Partners include a mix of institutional capital and family offices includingÂ Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker,Â DenmarkâsÂ Green Future FundÂ andÂ Novo Holdings. 2150Â says it has otherÂ LP partners who are building or managing &#8220;over 16 million square meters of real estate&#8221;, who will come in handy, kicking the tires on the efficacy of 2150Â investments.Â  The anchor funding has come from <a href="https://nrep.com/">NREP</a>, a sustainable real estate fund manager with a large Northern European footprint and platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founding partners include Mikkel BÃ¼low-Lehnsby,Â Chairman and co-founder ofÂ large real estateÂ logisticsÂ company NREP;Â Jacob Bro,Â former Chief Product Officer at Rocket Internet;Â Christian JÃ¸lck, the founder and former Chairman of industry climate advocacy group SYNERGI;Â Christian Hernandez, former Facebook executive and VC;Â Nicole LeBlanc,Â formerly with Alphabetâs urban product incubator Sidewalk Labs;Â Rahul Parekh, founder of VC-backed foodtech startup EatFirst and former executive director at Goldman Sachs; andÂ Alexandra Perez, who incubated and launched urban tech startups at Tech City Ventures.</p>
<p>2150 will focus on startups that can make cities more resilient, efficient and sustainable, investing in tech associated with the urban environment, materials, automation, and sensor-based monitoring to improve the health, safety, and productivity of building occupants. It says it will only invest where sustainability impact can be measured, aiming for a first portfolio of around 20 companies. Ticket sizes will be â¬4-5m series A for startups, but it will also invest in existing companies that want to expand.</p>
<p>Its first investment is in <a href="https://www.carboncure.com/">CarbonCure Technologies</a> &#8211; a Canadian company lowering the CO2 footprint of concrete &#8211; in which 2150 participated in a funding round for last year, investing alongside Amazonâs Climate Pledge Fund, Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and Microsoftâs Climate Innovation Fund. At present, concrete accounts for 8% of all global CO2 emissions</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Hernandez said 2150 was particularly interested in whatâs coming to be known as âESG Analyticsâ or âCarbon Accountingâ. In other words, platforms that can analyze the impact of developments for an ESG and CO2 perspective.</p>
<p>The other background data which inspired the creation of the fund includes the fact that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/the-world-needs-to-build-more-than-two-billion-new-homes-over-the-next-80-years">two billion</a> new homes will need to be built over the next 80 yearsâ¨; cities <a href="https://www.c40.org/why_cities">consume</a> over two-thirds of the worldâs energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions;Â 13% of global GDP is <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Operations/Our%20Insights/Reinventing%20construction%20through%20a%20productivity%20revolution/MGI-Reinventing-Construction-In-Brief.pdf">spent</a> on construction, but the industry is slow to adopt new technology; and the UN has <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/05/1039461">said</a> ground-breaking innovation is needed in cities, where the battle for sustainable development will be &#8220;won or lost&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mikkel BÃ¼low-Lehnsby, Partner at 2150 and Chairman and co-founder of NREP, said: âWith NREP we have been on a 15-year mission of making real estate and cities more efficient, customer-centric and sustainable. With 2150 we are leveraging all of NREP&#8217;s learnings and ambitions and partnering with our industry peers to identify and accelerate technology that can help us support our purpose of making real estate better. I am convinced that 2150&#8217;s mission-aligned team will play an important role in designing a future in which the convergence of entrepreneurship, technology and sustainability will reverse the built environmentâs negative impact on the planet.â</p>
<p>Christian Hernandez, Partner at 2150, said: âCities are complex living systems that are constantly expanding, evolving and adapting, with half the worldâs population now living in urban environments and rising. Cities, while vehicles for the betterment of humanity, currently emit 70% of the worldâs greenhouse gases and generate the vast majority of the planet&#8217;s waste. We see a huge opportunity to make a serious impact on the way cities are developed and the way our citizens live, work and are cared for by completely reimagining and reshaping the urban environment for good.â</p>
<p>The advisory board for 2150 includes technologists, scientists and designers including well-known architect, Bjarke Ingels; the Director of Princetonâs Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, Dr. Lynn Loo; Unityâs head of AI, Danny Lange; the former Chief Sustainability Officer in the Obama Administration, Christine Harada and the founder of sustainable developer EDGE Technologies, Coen van Oostrom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spreadsheet software &#8212; led by products like Microsoft&#8217;s Excel, Google&#8217;s Sheets and Apple&#8217;s Numbers &#8212; continues to be one of the most-used categories of business apps, with Excel alone clocking up more than a billion users just on its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.excel&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android version</a>. Now, a startup called <a href="http://rows.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rows</a> that&#8217;s built on that ubiquity, with a low-code platform that lets people populate and analyze web apps using just spreadsheet interfaces, is announcing funding and launching a freemium open beta of its expanded service.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based startup &#8212; which <a href="https://medium.com/armilar-venture-partners/dashdash-is-now-rows-and-other-news-8644e659dc72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded from dashdash</a> at the end of last year &#8212; closed a Series B round of $16 million, money that it is using to continue investing in its platform as well as in sales and marketing. The platform&#8217;s move into an open beta comes with some 50 new integrations with other platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram and more, as well as 200 new features (using known spreadsheet shortcuts) to use in them.</p>
<p>The round was led by Lakestar, with past investors Accel (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/dashdash-a-platform-to-create-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills-nabs-8m-led-by-accel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led its $8 million Series A in 2018</a>) and Cherry Ventures also participating. Christian Reber has also invested in this round. Reber knows a thing or two about software disrupting legacy productivity software &#8212; he is the co-founder and CEO of presentation software startup Pitch and the former CEO and founder of Microsoft-acquired Wunderlist &#8212; and notably he is joining Rows&#8217; Advisory Board along with the investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A little detail about this Series B: CEO Humberto Ayres Pereira, who is based out of Porto, Portugal, where some of the staff is also based, tells us that this round actually was quietly closed over a year ago, in January 2020 &#8212; just ahead of the world shutting down amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The startup chose to announce that round today to coincide with adding more features to its product and moving it into an open beta, he said.</p>
<p>That open beta is free in its most basic form &#8212; the free tier is limited to 10 users or less and a minimal amount of integration usage. Paid tiers, which cover more team members and up to 100,000 integration tasks (which are measured by how many times a spreadsheet queries another service), start at $59 per month.</p>
<p>One strong sign of interest in this latest iteration of the software is the lasting popularity of spreadsheets. Another is Rows&#8217; traction to date: in invite-only mode, it picked up 10,000 users off its waitlist, and hundreds of companies, as customers. Currently most of those are free, Ayres Pereira said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to have 1,000 paying companies as customers in the 12 months,&#8221; he said. That process has only just started, he added, with paying numbers in the modest &#8220;dozens&#8221; for now. He emphasized though that the company is very cash efficient and has, even without raising more funding, two years of runway on the money it has in the bank now.</p>
<h2>The growing appeal of low-code</h2>
<p>No-code and low-code software, which let people create and work with apps and other digital content without delving deep into the lines of code that underpin them, have continued to pick up traction in the market in the last several years.</p>
<p>The reason for this is straightforward: non-technical employees may not code, but they are getting increasingly adept at understanding how services function and what can be achieved within an app.</p>
<p>No-code and low-code platforms let them get more hands-on when it comes to customizing and creating the services that they need to use everyday to get their work done, without the time and effort it might take to get an engineer involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;People want to create their own tools,&#8221; said Ayres Pereira. &#8220;They want to understand and test and iterate.&#8221; He said that the majority of Rows&#8217; users so far are based out of North America, and typical use cases include marketing and sales teams, as well as companies using Rows spreadsheets as a dynamic interface to manage logistics and other operations.</p>
<p>Stephen Nundy, the partner at Lakestar who led its investment, describes the army of users taking up no-code tools as &#8220;citizen developers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rows is precisely the kind of platform that plays into the low-code trend. For people who are already au fait with the kinds of tools that you find in spreadsheets &#8212; and something like Excel has hundreds of functions in it &#8212; it presents a way of leaning on those familiar functions to trigger integrations with other apps, and to subsequently use a spreadsheet created in Rows to both analyse data from other apps, as well as update them.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/rows-example.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="387" /></p>
<p>You might ask, why is it more useful, for example, to look at content from Twitter in Rows rather than Twitter itself? A Rows document might let a person search for a set of Tweets using a certain chain of keywords, and then organise those results based on parameters such as how many &#8220;likes&#8221; those Tweets received.</p>
<p>Or users responding to a call to action for a promotion on Instagram might then be cross referenced with a company&#8217;s existing database of customers, to analyze how those respondents overlap or present new leads.</p>
<p>You might also wonder why existing spreadsheet products may not have already build functionality like this.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Microsoft did dabble in building a way of linking up Excel with some rudimentary computing functions, in the form of Visual Basic for Applications. This however reached the dubious distinction of topping developers&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most dreaded</a>&#8221; languages list for two years running, and so as you might imagine it has somewhat died a death.</p>
<p>However, it does point to an opportunity for incumbents to disrupt their disruptors.</p>
<p>Apart from those most obvious, entrenched competitors, there have been a number of other startups building tools that are providing similar no- and low-code approaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/london-based-gyana-raises-3-9m-for-a-no-code-approach-to-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gyana</a> is focusing more on data science, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/tray-io-brings-in-50m-more-at-a-600m-valuation-for-its-workflow-automation-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tray.io</a> provides a graphical interface to integrate how apps work together, Zapier and Notion also provide simple interfaces to integrate apps and APIs together, and Airtable has its own take on reinventing the spreadsheet interface. For now, Ayres Pereira sees these more as compatriots than competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we overlap with services like Zapier and Notion,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I&#8217;d say we are friends. We&#8217;re all raising awareness about people being able to do more and not having to be stuck using old tools. It&#8217;s not a zero sum game for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we covered Rows&#8217;s Series A two years ago, the startup had built a platform to let people who are comfortable working with data in spreadsheets to use that interface to create and populate content in web apps. It had a lot of extensibility, but mainly geared at people still willing to do the work to create those links.</p>
<p>Two years on, while the spreadsheet has remained the anchor, the platform has grown. Ayres Pereira, who co-founded the company with Torben Schulz (both pictured above), said that there are some 50 new integrations now, including ways to analyse and update content on social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, CrunchBase, Salesforce, Slack, LinkedIn and Twitter, as well as some 200 new features in the platform itself.</p>
<p>While people can import into Rows data from Google Sheets, he noted that the big daddy of them all, Excel, is not supported right now. The reason, he said, is because the vast majority of users of the product use the desktop version, which does not have APIs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rows also has a number of <a href="https://rows.com/templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">templates</a> available for people to guide them through simple tasks, such as looking up LinkedIn profiles or emails for a list of people; tracking social media counts and so on.</p>
<p>One of the most common aspects of spreadsheets, however, has yet to be built. The interface is still banked around rows and columns, but with no graphical tools to visualize data in different ways such as pie charts or graphs as you might have in a typical spreadsheet program.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for this reason that Rows has yet to exit beta. The feature is one that is requested a lot, Pereira admitted, describing it as &#8220;the final frontier.&#8221; When Rows is ready to ship with that functionality, likely by Q3 of this year, it will tick over to general &#8220;1.0&#8221; release, he added.</p>
<p>âHumberto and Torben have really impressed us with their ambition to disrupt the market with a new spreadsheet paradigm that tackles the significant shortcomings of today&#8217;s solutions,&#8221; said Nundy at Lakestar. &#8220;Data integrations are native, the collaboration experience is first class and the ability to share and publish your work as an application is unique and will create more &#8216;Citizen developers&#8217; to emerge. This is essential to the growing needs of today&#8217;s technology literate workforce.Â The level of interest theyâve received in their private beta is proof of the desirability of platforms like Rows, and weâre excited to be supporting them through their public beta launch and beyond with this investment.â Nundy is also joining Rows&#8217; board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://katanamrp.com/">Katana</a>, an Estonian startup that has built manufacturing-specific enterprise resource planning (ERP) software for SMBs, has raised $11 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is European venture capital firm Atomico, with participation from angel investors Ott Kaukver (Checkout.com CTO), Sten Tamkivi (CPO Topia, formerly Skype), Sergei Anikin (CTO, Pipedrive) and Kairi Pauskar (former TransferWise HR Architect). Previous backer 42Cap also followed on, bringing the total investment raised by the company to date to $16 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Kristjan Vilosius (CEO), Priit Kaasik (engineering lead) and Hannes Kert (CCO), Katana positions itself as the &#8220;entrepreneur manufacturerâs secret weapon&#8221; with a plug-and-play ERP for small to medium-sized manufacturers. The idea is to wean companies off existing antiquated tools such as spreadsheets and legacy software to manage inventory and production. The startup is also playing into macro trends, such as the advent of online marketplaces and D2C e-commerce, that are resulting in an explosion of independent makers, spanning cosmetics to home dÃ©cor, electronics to apparel, and food and beverages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing a global renaissance of small manufacturing driven by the rise of e-commerce tools and consumer demand for bespoke products produced locally,&#8221; says Vilosius. &#8220;Just walk around any big city from London to San Francisco, and youâll see workshops all around you. Someoneâs making organic cosmetics here; over there, someone is making electric bikes. These companies are run by passionate entrepreneurs selling through traditional channels, but also selling through direct-to-consumer channels, e-commerce stores and marketplaces, etc. This is a massive boom of makers wanting to create products and sell them globally, and it is not a trend that will disappear tomorrow&#8221;.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that small and medium-sized manufacturers donât have the right software to support workflows necessary to sell through multiple channels &#8212; and this is where Katana comes in. The plug-and-play software claims a superior UX designed specifically to power boutique manufacturing, including functionality supporting the workflows of modern manufacturers, i.e. inventory control and optimization, and purchasing materials, managing bill-of-materials, tracking costs and more. It also offers an API and integrations with popular e-commerce sales channels and accounting tools such as Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce, QuickBooks, Xero and others.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meet the makers of modular&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/28/meet-the-makers-of-modular/embed/#?secret=X0vZ7FWSos" data-secret="X0vZ7FWSos" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We have built the worldâs most self on-board-able manufacturing ERP, and thatâs a very important differentiation between us and competitors,&#8221; explains Vilosius. &#8220;Implementation is so simple that more than half of Katanaâs users self-onboard. It takes less than a week on average to get Katana up and running, compared to months for competitors&#8221;.</p>
<p>As an example of how a company might use Katana, imagine a boutique manufacturer using Shopify as their main sales channel. Once configured, Katana pulls in orders from Shopify and knows whether or not the product is available so it can be shipped immediately. If it&#8217;s unavailable, Katana displays if the necessary raw materials needed to manufacture are in stock and by when the product could be finished. &#8220;We handle the entire process from getting the raw materials in the warehouse to planning manufacturing activities, executing and shipping when the product is done,&#8221; says Vilosius.</p>

<p>Cue statement from Atomico partner Ben Blume, who joins the Katana board: âAtomico has always believed in the strength of Estonian-built engineering and product, and as we got to know the team at Katana, we saw a familiar pattern: a relentlessly product-focussed team with the incredible ability to build and think from their customerâs point of view, and an unwavering belief that a new generation of manufacturers with big ideas shouldnât have to settle for less than world-class technology to support them.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook said it will begin restoring news sharing to Australian users&#8217; feeds in &#8220;the coming days&#8221; after reaching an agreement with the country&#8217;s government. The social media giant made the drastic move of restricting news content in Australia last Wednesday after a dispute over a <a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;page=0;query=BillId:r6652%20Recstruct:billhome">proposed media bargaining code</a> that is expected to be voted into law soon. The code requires Facebook, and other major tech companies like Google, to make revenue-sharing agreements with publishers for content posted to their social media platforms.</p>

<p>Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg said changes have been made to the code to &#8220;provide further clarity to digital platforms and news media businesses about the way the Code is intended to operate and strengthen the framework for ensuring news media businesses are fairly remunerated,&#8221; <a href="https://7news.com.au/technology/facebook/australian-facebook-users-to-begin-seeing-news-content-on-their-feeds-in-the-coming-days-c-2223181">reported Seven News</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The amendments mean the code now includes a two-month mediation period to allow digital platforms like Facebook and publishers to agree on deals before they are forced to enter into arbitration. The Australian government will also consider commercial agreements tech platforms have already made with local publishers before deciding if the code applies to them, and give them one monthâs notice before reaching a final decision.</p>
<p>William Easton, managing director of Facebook Australia and New Zealand, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">said in a statement</a> that the company was &#8220;satisfied&#8221; with the changes, adding that they addressed Facebookâs &#8220;core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebookâs restrictions last week meant Australian publishers were restricted from sharing or posting content from Facebook Pages, and users in Australia were unable to view or share Australian or international news content.</p>
<p>The Australian government announced in April 2020 it would adopt a mandatory code ordering Google, Facebook and other tech giants to pay local media for reusing their content, after an earlier attempt to create a voluntary code with the companies stalled.</p>
<p>As it lobbied against the proposed law, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/facebook-threatens-to-block-news-sharing-in-australia-as-it-lobbies-against-revenue-share-law/">first threatened to restrict</a> the public sharing of news content in Australia last September. Google also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/google-warns-users-in-australia-free-services-are-at-risk-if-its-forced-to-share-ad-revenue-with-big-media/">claimed that user experience in Australia would suffer</a> and suggested it may no longer be able to offer free services in the country.</p>
