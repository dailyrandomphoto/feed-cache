										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 204 billion total downloads and $120 billion in global consumer spend in 2019. Not including Chinese third-party app stores, iOS and Android users in 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">downloaded</a> 130 billion apps and spent a record $112 billion. In 2019, people <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/average-us-time-spent-with-mobile-in-2019-has-increased" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spent</a> three hours and 40 minutes per day using apps, rivaling TV.</p>
<p>Due to COVID-19, time spent in apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">jumped</a> 25% year-over-year on Android. Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week (after a week off for the holidays), we&#8217;re taking a look at holiday app store spending, how the Chinese gaming licensing rules have impacted the App Store, Apple&#8217;s move to ban a party app that could have helped spread COVID, and the collaborative musical created by TikTok users, among other things.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h2>Christmas Day app spending grows 35% year-over-year</h2>
<p>Global app spending didn&#8217;t seem to be impacted by the pandemic in 2020, <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-christmas-2020">according to data from Sensor Tower.</a> The firm reports that consumers spent $407.6 million in apps from the iOS App Store and Google Play on Christmas Day, 34.5% from the $303 million spent in 2019. The majority of the spending was on mobile games, up 27% year-over-year to $295.6 million. Tencent&#8217;s Honor of Kings led the games category, while TikTok led non-game apps with $4.7 million in spending on Christmas Day.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091741" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091741" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2091741" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png 1516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/global-christmas-spending-2020.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091741" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>As in prior years, Apple accounted for the majority of the spending, or 68.4% ($278.6M) vs Google Play&#8217;s $129M. The spending was led by the U.S., who accounted for ~$130 million of the total</p>
<h2>Apple takes a stand on pandemic parties</h2>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Store Review guidelines don&#8217;t specifically detail how the company will handle apps that could contribute to the spread of COVID-19, but Apple found a way to draw the line when it came to a social app that encouraged unsafe gatherings. This past week, Apple banned the app Vybe Together, which had allowed people to locate &#8220;secret&#8221; indoor house parties in their area, sometimes including those held in violation of state guidelines.</p>
<p>NYT reporter Taylor Lorenz first called attention to the problem with a <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1343994810714058753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1343995285869977600%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Ftech-policy%2F2020%2F12%2Fprivate-party-app-pulled-from-app-store-by-apple%2F">tweet</a>. The app had been posting to TikTok to gain attention, but its account has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vybe-together-tiktok-promote-nye-parties-amid-covid-19-2020-12">since been removed</a>. Following its removal, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205298/apple-tiktok-vybe-together-pandemic-underground-party-app-removed">defended itself</a> by saying that it was <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_dimcevski/status/1344832455572922369">only meant for small get-togethers</a> and the founder <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/were-canceled-liberal-media-inside-020754388.html">lamented</a> being &#8220;canceled by the liberal media.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no good defense, really, for the unnecessary and ill-timed promotion of an app that encouraged people from different households to gather, which spreads COVID. And what the founder seemed to not understand, by nature of his recent tweets and statements on the app&#8217;s <a href="https://vybetogether.com/">website</a>, is that many cities and states also <em>already</em> <em>prohibit</em> small private gatherings of varying degrees, including those <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_dimcevski/status/1344832455572922369">he believes are fine</a>, like small parties in folks&#8217; &#8220;own apartments with people in your area.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. is coping with 346,000 COVID deaths, and in New York, where the app was promoting NYE parties,<a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/cuomo-nearly-74-of-new-covid-19-cases-linked-to-private-gatherings/34944141"> 74% of all COVID-19 cases</a> from Sept.-Nov. 2020 have been linked to private gatherings.</p>
<p>The media may have reported on what the app was doing, but ultimately the decision to &#8220;cancel&#8221; it was Apple&#8217;s. And it was the correct one.</p>
<h2>Apple removes 39K games from its China App Store.</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-china-games-idUSKBN2950P1">Apple on Thursday, Dec. 31, 2020 removed 39,000+ games from China App Store</a>. This was the biggest removal of games in a single day, Reuters reported, citing <a href="https://www.qimai.cn/zhuanlan/article/id/1489">data from Qimai</a>.</p>
<p>iOS games have long been required to obtain a Chinese gaming license in order to operate in the country, but Apple skirted this rule for years by hosting unlicensed titles even as Android app stores complied. Apple began to enforce the rule in 2020 and gave publishers a Dec. 31, 2020 deadline to obtain the license &#8212; a process that can be tedious and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Clearly, a large number of publishers were not able to meet the deadline. Included in the new sweep were Ubisoft&#8217;s Assassin’s Creed Identity and NBA 2K20. Qimai says only only 74 of the top 1,500 paid games remained following the removals. To date, Apple purged more than 46,000 titles from the China App Store, the report said.</p>
<h3>TikTok births a &#8220;Ratatousical&#8221;</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/12/29/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-stars/">The TikTok musical version of Ratatouille has become a real thing.</a> The pandemic forced a lot of creative types out of work in 2020, leading them to find new ways to express themselves online. On TikTok, this collective pent-up energy turned into a large-scale collaborative event: <a href="https://ratatousical.com/">a musical version</a> of Disney&#8217;s <em>Ratatouille</em>. (Or <em>Ratatousical</em>, as it was nicknamed.) TikTokers composed music, wrote lyrics and dialogue, choreographed dances, designed costumes, sets and more, as they worked together through the app.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Disney is allowing a charity version of this collaboration to become a real event without any interference or lawsuits. The <em>Ratatouille</em> musical <a href="https://ratatousical.com/">live-streamed on Jan. 1 at 7 p.m. Eastern,</a> and will be available via video-on-demand through Jan. 4, for a minimum $5 donation to The Actors Fund.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-9dH9FKqtI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent&#038;listType=playlist&#038;list=RD8CYCPVe9NIE' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The musical itself was lighthearted fun for a younger, Gen Z crowd. It also cleverly incorporated actual TikTok videos that featured the app’s well-known visual effects — like cloning yourself or the flashing colored lights typically associated with TikTok’s “you think you can hurt me” meme, for example. That made it more accessible and familiar to kids who had spent the past year being entertained via the internet.</p>
<p>TikTok users, of course, aren&#8217;t the only ones designing, creating and editing productions through remote and collaborative processes in 2020 &#8212; Hollywood itself has had <a href="https://www.protocol.com/hollywood-working-home-streaming-video">to reorient itself for remote work at a much larger scale</a>. TikTok was simply the platform of choice for theater kids looking for something to do.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the TikTok-based collaborative process that birthed this musical ultimately becomes a one-off event that arose from the pandemic&#8217;s impacts &#8212; including the ability for many creative people to devote time and energy on side projects, for example, due to shuttered productions and stay-at-home orders. Or perhaps in-app collaborations have a real future? Time will tell.</p>
<p>TikTok has already proven it can drive the music charts, fashion trends, and app downloads, so it can probably generate an audience for this production, as well. But the cynic may wonder if such an event would have been as popular and buzzworthy had it been some entirely original production, rather than one based on already popular and beloved Disney IP.  But you may as well watch &#8212; it&#8217;s not like you have any other plans these days.</p>

<li><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/21/epic-and-samsung-send-free-fortnite-care-package-with-jacket-galaxy-tab-s7-to-influencers">Samsung teams up with Epic Games on Apple battle over Fortnite</a>. Samsung and Epic Games worked together on the &#8220;Free Fortnite&#8221; marketing campaign, which recently involving sending packages to influencers that contained a Free Fortnite bomber jacket and Samsung Galaxy Tab S7. Fortnite was the Samsung Galaxy Store game of the year in 2020, and the store also distributes the Epic Games app which distributes the Fortnite updates. This is an odd move as Epic alleges the app stores leverage their power to engage in monopolistic practices, but this makes it clear that Samsung is offering them distribution. Apple has the right to set its own pricing for its services (and it recently lowered commissions for small businesses, too). But even if Epic Games is not the knight in shining armor one would hope for, its lawsuit could help set precedent. And regulators may still decide one day that Apple can&#8217;t dictate rules about how businesses operate outside its app store &#8212; meaning, they should have the right to collect their own payments, for example.</li>

The game doles out $100,000 to whoever can keep their finger on their smartphone the longest, via an app designed for this purpose. Last year, it was a four-way tie after 70 hours, and the prize money was divided. The new app introduces in-app challenges to dissuade cheating. YouTuber Mr. Beast rose to fame for his philanthropic-based viral videos and stunts. He has made sizable donations to people in need and those impacted by the pandemic. But this year, the otherwise silly game has a darker tone as it involves competitors who will likely be in more desperate situations.</li>

The dating app found itself in the middle of a small controversy this week when a woman who wanted to pose in her bra had her photos taken down. The company said its existing policy prohibits things like shirtless bathroom mirror selfies and indoor photos of people wearing swimsuits and underwear. Bumble&#8217;s policies were crafted in response to user data and feedback, but may also help to prevent adult sites from spamming with fake profiles. However, there&#8217;s still something weird about an app that markets itself as female-friendly telling a woman to go put some clothes on.</li>

<p>This endless runner is BuzzFeed&#8217;s first mobile game, which makes it worth noting if not exactly recommending. The mental health-themed game, inspired by BuzzFeed&#8217;s animated series <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CIrDZVxDhVh/?utm_source=ig_embed">The Land of Boggs</a>, was created by BuzzFeed Animation Studios. In the game, characters try to avoid things like stress monsters and gremlins, which is a humorous take on the anxieties of 2020. However, early user reviews indicate the game&#8217;s controls are too difficult and complain the game is too hard to be fun. How stressful! $0.99 on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/run-boggo-run/id1544517293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BuzzFeed.RunBoggoRun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>.</p>

<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x">Tesla was able to reach the 500,000-vehicle target by ticking up production and sales in the fourth quarter — a final push that has mirrored numerous other end-of-the-quarter efforts by the company. Tesla delivered 180,570 in the fourth quarter, setting a new quarterly record and 30% higher than the previous quarter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s production and sales figures were also driven by the launch of the Model Y, its mid-sized SUV, and a new factory coming online in China.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter and annual figures shows the rise in demand for its more affordable and newer models and waning interest in its flagship Model S sedan and Model X SUV. The company delivered 18,920 Model S and Model X vehicles in the fourth quarter and 57,039 for the year. Sales of the Model 3 and Model Y hit nearly 162,000 in the fourth quarter and 442,511 for the year. Tesla doesn&#8217;t break out sales figures for each model, instead combining its older vehicles into one bucket and its newer Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in another. The company also doesn&#8217;t provide regional sales figures.</p>
<p>Producing and selling more than 500,000 vehicles a year seemed unreachable for Tesla just a handful of years ago. But Musk has taken a bullish view of the company, noting in 2015 that he remained confident that Tesla would be producing half a million cars in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s five years from now,&#8221; Musk said at the time. &#8220;If you go five years in the past for Tesla, we were producing 600 cars per year—now we can produce 600 cars in three days. So I think going from here to 500,000 cars a year is a much smaller leap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk has reiterated that target periodically, including in January of last year when he noted that deliveries should comfortably exceed 500,000 units. Tesla didn&#8217;t adjust that forecast even as the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy and forced the company, along with every other automaker, to temporarily pause production for several weeks last spring.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was predictable that Anthony — a fan of clunky-but-ambitious superhero sequels like &#8220;The Dark Knight Rises&#8221; and &#8220;Avengers: Age of Ultron&#8221; — enjoyed the film. Darrell, meanwhile, took the side of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wonder-woman-1984">most critics</a>, who found the movie exasperating and even, at times, mystifyingly bad.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise was Jordan, who disliked the first &#8220;Wonder Woman&#8221; and actually preferred the sequel, thanks in large part to Kristen Wiig&#8217;s portrayal of the villainous Cheetah.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everyone agreed that there were plenty of problems, including some slipshod and confusing plotting, as well as a portrayal of Wonder Woman that&#8217;s defined entirely by her longing for Steve Trevor, the Chris Pine character who died at the end of the first film but returns here under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>But where Anthony found the overall arc of the film — rewriting the melancholy love story of &#8220;Superman II&#8221; as a parable about capitalism and climate change — and its big emotional moments to be surprisingly affecting, Darrell thought the entire final act was ludicrous, with some of the worst CGI ever seen in a big-budget film.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> recently announced the astronauts who will be taking part in the Artemis missions, and among them is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/anne-c-mcclain/biography">Anne McClain</a>, who has spent 203 days in orbit and conducted two spacewalks on the ISS. With the space industry looking nothing like it did 10 years ago and new spacecraft and technologies on the rise, McClain share her thoughts about how she and other astronauts would be embracing the future.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. McClain&#8217;s time aboard the ISS spanned from December 2018 to June of 2019, meaning her ascent and descent were both aboard Russia&#8217;s Soyuz capsules, as astronauts have gotten to and from space since the Shuttle days. The Artemis missions, however, will use a variety of new launch vehicles and spacecraft. And while she didn&#8217;t get to fly a Dragon capsule, she did get to check one out while it was docked at the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so happy to have flown the Soyuz, because it is such a reliable, basic spacecraft — it&#8217;s almost like flying a piece of history — knowing I was going to be able to compare that to other vehicles to in the future,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had the opportunity when I was on Space Station when DM-1 flew. And so, being able to float into that and look at their screens, their monitors, you notice right away that the technology has advanced to where it looks like the inside of a commercial airliner.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were the first to pilot a Dragon in orbit, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/this-is-certainly-different-astronauts-on-controlling-the-dragon-spacecraft-via-touchscreen/">said afterwards that it was &#8220;certainly different,&#8221;</a> partly due to the reliance on touchscreens as primary interfaces for many spacecraft functions. McClain emphasized the difficulty of getting software to the point where it can be trusted with someone&#8217;s life.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8O5e1Sd3yf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/this-is-certainly-different-astronauts-on-controlling-the-dragon-spacecraft-via-touchscreen/">&#8216;This is certainly different&#8217;: Astronauts on controlling the Dragon spacecraft via touchscreen</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;This is certainly different&#8217;: Astronauts on controlling the Dragon spacecraft via touchscreen&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/this-is-certainly-different-astronauts-on-controlling-the-dragon-spacecraft-via-touchscreen/embed/#?secret=8O5e1Sd3yf" data-secret="8O5e1Sd3yf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Most of the vehicles that we&#8217;re using now are very heavy on software — lots of touchscreens, not so much valves that were physically moving, it&#8217;s more like a software relay. But that adds a huge amount of complexity, because as your readers are probably well aware, approving software and the reliability of software is difficult,&#8221; she explained. 	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We want to understand our systems well enough to be able to interact with them in ways that maybe they&#8217;re not directly designed to do.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	 &#8220;We&#8217;re always looking at the question of, when should a human be in the loop, and when should it be automated? And if it&#8217;s automated, how can we prove the software has reliability sufficient for human spaceflight? At some point you have to say, &#8216;You know what, if this happens, we&#8217;re going to put a human in the loop,&#8217; just so you&#8217;re not paralyzed by 10 years of software testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a pilot herself, McClain naturally has opinions on this, and like Hurley and Behnken, worked with SpaceX early on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was fortunate to work with Bob and Doug, advising SpaceX early on in their cockpit controls, and I think where they got, it&#8217;s a really incredible machine,&#8221; she said, while noting that the Orion and Starliner craft received similar attentions from experts like her.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1996397" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fistbump.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1996397" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1996397" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fistbump.gif" alt="" width="800" height="444" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1996397" class="wp-caption-text">Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley bump fists to celebrate their history-making launch on SpaceX&#8217;s Crew Dragon.</p></div></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Yes, that company name has not built a spacecraft — but there are people in those halls that have built spacecraft. The talent that built the Space Shuttle and Space Station is spread out all over the commercial industry now.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	 Flexibility was chief among the desired aspects; If things go even a little off script, they need the tools to be flexible and not self-limiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, pilots, we always want options, right? Whatever happens, we want options. As much as we try to predict scenarios on the ground, we&#8217;re always keenly aware that something could happen that wasn&#8217;t predicted, and at that point&#8230; we want <em>options</em>,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We want to understand our systems well enough to be able to interact with them in ways that maybe they&#8217;re not directly designed to do. So it&#8217;s really important for me that the software doesn&#8217;t take options off the table. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why, at NASA, they look at the Apollo 13 case, when we had to use hardware and software and the vehicle in ways that we&#8217;d never predicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I asked whether it was different or strange to work with newer companies like Blue Origin, McClain pointed out that really, the only new thing there is the name.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1983053" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg" alt="CG Render of what Blue Origin and Lockheed's lunar lander is expected to look like." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blue-origin-blue-moon.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked with these companies enough to know something, and that&#8217;s that yes, that company name has not built a spacecraft — but there are people in those halls that have built spacecraft. The talent that built the Space Shuttle and Space Station is spread out all over the commercial industry now, which is exactly what NASA wants to do. That is our human capital,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;The other thing I&#8217;m confident about is the way NASA partners with these companies, for test programs and design reviews, it&#8217;s extremely thorough. So by the time that rocket has me on top of it on a pad, I&#8217;m confident in in the checks and balances we have in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			That technology, it helps bring Earth up into the spaceship with us.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	Lastly I asked about whether any conveniences of modern consumer tech had made it more bearable to spend long periods of time in space, for instance the fairly recent capability to do video calls. McClain was quick to answer in the positive.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you said is exactly it. Imagine if we were in this pandemic and weren&#8217;t able to video chat — we&#8217;re already feeling disconnected from our loved ones. And you know, feeling disconnected is the same whether you&#8217;re on the other side of the country or you&#8217;re in space. So the ability for us to be able to see our parents&#8217; faces on the screen and talk to them, it really does wonders,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not just morale. You know, you start looking at six month, twelve month missions, it&#8217;s really maintaining the psyche, maintaining human mental health. So that technology, it helps bring Earth up into the spaceship with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>McClain is one of 18 astronauts who will take part in the missions leading up to the planned Moon landing. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis-team/">You can meet the rest here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sony">Sony <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said on Friday that it will launch the PlayStation 5 in India on February 2, suggesting improvements in the supply chain network that was severely impacted last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Japanese firm said it will begin taking pre-order requests for the new gaming console in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, on January 12. The console will be available for pre-order from a number of retailers including Amazon India, Flipkart, Croma, Reliance Digital, Games the Shop, Sony Center, and Vijay Sales, the company said.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 is priced at Indian rupees 49,990 ($685), while the digital edition of the console will sell at Indian rupees 39,990 ($550). Xbox Series X, in comparison, is priced at $685 in India, and Xbox Series S sells at $480. Both the consoles launched in India in November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, much like elsewhere in the world, Microsoft has been struggling to meet the demand for the new Xbox consoles in India. The Xbox Series X is facing so much shortage in the country that it&#8217;s not even easy to locate its page on Amazon India.</p>
<p>The announcement today should allay concerns of loyal PlayStation fans, some of whom &#8212; including, of course, yours truly &#8212; secured a unit from the gray market at a premium in recent months after India was not included in the first wave of nations for the PS5. Fans have also been frustrated at Sony and its affiliated partners for not offering clarification or providing conflicting accounts about the probable launch of the new gaming console in recent months.</p>
<p>In November, Sony suggested that it had delayed the launch of the PS5 in India due to local import regulations. Game news site The Mako Reactor <a href="https://themakoreactor.com/news/ps5-release-date-india-2021-launch-sony/20520/">reported</a> earlier this week that Sony is unlikely to offer warranty and after-sales support for PlayStation 5 accessories in India &#8212; as has been the case for several previous generations.</p>
<p>India is not yet a big market for full-fledged gaming consoles yet. According to industry estimates, Sony and Microsoft sold only a few hundred thousand units of their previous generation consoles in the country. Thanks to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/samsung-beats-xiaomi-to-reclaim-no-1-spot-in-indian-smartphone-market/">proliferation of affordable Android smartphones</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">world&#8217;s cheapest mobile data tariffs</a>, tens of millions of Indians have embraced mobile gaming in recent years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2020 comes to a long-awaited end, a series of filings indicate that venture capitalists are ending the year with fresh money. According to SEC paperwork, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/learncapital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="learncapital">Learn Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and USV have filed paperwork that shows the firms have raised new, multimillion-dollar funds.</p>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention to news this past year, it’s clear that much of venture capital isn’t just surviving 2020 &#8211; it’s flourishing through it. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/as-covid-19-era-drags-on-vcs-look-beyond-zoom-calls-for-due-diligence-and-sourcing/">Zoom investing</a>, it seems, is working just fine for cash-rich firms looking to double down on bets in categories from edtech to climate.</p>
<p>First up, New York-based USV submitted a pair of filings on late Thursday. The first filing shows that the firm has closed $151 million for USV Climate 2021, which one can assume is focused on climate-tech investments. As my colleague Jonathan Shieber has pointed out, climate tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other, more<a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001833921-20-000004/"> nebulous filing</a>, is the firm’s $22.4 million investment vehicle titled USV Bundled. It’s unclear what this is focused on, but a recent blog post suggests that the firm will continue to <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2020/12/hacking-education-2-0/">double down on its education investments.</a></p>
<p>Speaking of edtech, Learn Capital, an education-focused venture capital fund, filed paperwork indicating that it has closed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1797459/000179745920000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">$132 million in capital</a>. It plans to raise a total of $250 million for this fund, which will be the firm’s fourth investment vehicle to date. The edtech category has obviously been booming with interest, which also fueled Owl Ventures to close $585 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/owl-ventures-new-pair-of-funds-gives-edtech-a-585-million-boost/">new capital in September. </a></p>
<p>Finally, I’ll give an honorable mention to Lattice CEO Jack Altman’s New Years Eve filing, which shows that the executive <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1835920/000183592020000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">plans to raise $20 million</a> for a new fund. It’s unclear if this filing indicates <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/06/17/altman-brothers-launch-apollo-fund-to-back-startup-moonshots/?sh=62de3b5541eb">Apollo</a>’s next step, a venture fund started by the Altman brothers. The trio, beyond Jack, includes Max and Sam, the former president of Y Combinator who currently serves as the CEO of OpenAI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a strange year for sleep. For me, levels have fluctuated between too little and too much, but have – more often than not – tended toward the former. 2020 gave most of us no shortage of excuses for sleep deprivation, from personal stresses to larger societal concerns.</p>
<p>And, thankfully, the past few years have seen no shortage of technological solutions to the problem of sleeplessness. Of course, the underpinning issues can be hard to isolate and even harder to treat. There’s no silver bullet. That’s the lesson I keep relearning at this job – no single piece of technology is going to cure all of my ills. (I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s nothing that years of extensive and expensive therapy can&#8217;t fix.)</p>
<p>Sleep headphones are, in and of themselves, not an entirely new phenomenon. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bose" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bose">Bose <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> got into the space in earnest back in mid-2018, offering one of the more polished (and pricey) approaches to the category. The company went in an entirely different direction than, say, <a href="https://kokoon.io/">Kokoon</a>, which offers an over-ear solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Sleepbuds are – as the name suggests – fully wireless earbuds. This second generation allows Bose to address some of the bigger issues with the original – include some major battery complaints. That was a pretty big strike against a $250 pair of headphones with, quite literally, one job.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uU86vlur8G"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/bose-gets-into-the-business-of-sleep/">Bose gets into the business of sleep</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The battery and connections complaints, I can state, off the bat, seem to have been addressed. The units I’ve been wearing to sleep off and on for a few weeks now haven’t had any major connection issues to speak of (assuming you keep your phone near your bed and all that entails), and the battery generally gets me through a full night bit a bit under 20% remaining. After you wake up, you toss them in the case and let them charge for the next several hours.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091692" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091692" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091692" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bose_Sleepbuds_II-5.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091692" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bose</p></div></p>
<p>All told, the build is solid, as you’d expect/hope from the company name and accompanying price point. I really dig the design of these things, overall, from the illuminating metal charging case with its sliding lid to the earbuds themselves. As someone who finds the slightest irritants a major hurdle to falling asleep, I was pleasantly surprised by how unobtrusive the buds are. They slip on comfortably and stay flush with the ear, so nothing gets snagged. The soft and rubbery wings also do a great job keeping them in place.</p>
<p>The buds biggest limitation is actually by design. Like the originals, the Sleepbuds II only work with the included app. This is used to pair them, locate them and offers Bose’s library of music. The company generally does a good job curating its own sleep sounds, ranging from nature sounds like rain and wind to self-selected ambient tracks. I got in the habit of listening to the sounds of the ocean while reading <em>Moby Dick</em> each night. A pretty good way to fall asleep, all told.</p>
<p>I appreciate the decision to hamper the functionality to some degree – I suspect I would probably start listening to podcasts and TV shows on the thing, left to my own devices (so to speak). But I would love to see what the buds could do with, say, binaural beats or some other ambient selections. Ultimately, I think giving the consumer choice is ultimately a net positive.</p>
<p>That said, the headphones are well-tuned for their limited (but expanding) library of sounds. There’s no active noise canceling, but the passive cancelation of the buds themselves plus the on-board sound do a good job blocking out things like environmental noise or snoring. They’re probably no match for, say, construction noise, but do a good job with subtler barriers to sleep. They’ll also likely be a good choice for long flights, when we start doing those again.</p>
<p>There are a handful of headphones currently positioned for the sleep market, but Bose’s look to be the most polished package at the moment. The price will understandably be a barrier for many – and the limited sound library could be a dealbreaker for some. But if you have the money – and find getting and staying asleep tough – they’re well worth exploring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the Los Angeles-based extended reality data visualization company, <a href="https://badvr.com/">BadVR</a>, first heard that one of its earliest benefactors, Magic Leap, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/magic-leap-announces-layoffs-amid-covid-19-slowdown/">was about to shed 1,000 jobs and was fighting for its life</a>, the young startup was unfazed.</p>
<p>Despite the very public ties that BadVR had to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="magic-leap">Magic Leap, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as one of the enterprise applications on the platform, the startup was more insulated than other businesses from the pivot away from consumer-focused apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/my-experience-with-the-cares-act-was-frustrating-confusing-and-unfair/">The first step was finding money from the government&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program </a>to get more capital coming in and maintaining its headcount. Eventually, the company managed to land additional financing in the form of a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s the second grant that the company has taken from the NSF and is an example of how startups can turn to government funding for capital and avoid some of the pitfalls of fundraising from venture capital.</p>
<p>To be sure, even <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="magic-leap">Magic Leap&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> trip to the brink of collapse wouldn&#8217;t have been that bad for BadVR, which makes enterprise applications for extended reality devices.</p>
<p>What the Magic Leap story shows is that companies don&#8217;t need to take venture capital to make it. Indeed, as costs come down for equipment and remote work democratizes access to a country that&#8217;s still teeming with engineering talent, thrifty startups can get the capital they need from government sources and corporate innovation grants.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how BadVR got most of its $3.5 million in financing. Some money came from a grant from BadVR, while at least $1.25 million has come from the government in the form of two <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/national-science-foundation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="national-science-foundation">National Science Foundation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> cooperative agreements through the Small Business Innovation Research financing mechanisms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091683" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091683" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091683" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-York-City-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091683" class="wp-caption-text">A headset capture of BadVR’s climate change application, built for the Magic Leap One headset.<strong> Image Credit:</strong> <a href="https://badvr.com/">BadVR</a></p></div></p>
<p>BadVR uses virtual and augmented reality tools to visualize geospatial data for a range of government and commercial applications. The startup&#8217;s tech is already being used by big telecom companies to accelerate the planning and deployment of 5G networks. And, within the public safety sector, the company&#8217;s tech is used to improve situational awareness for first responders and to reduce training, staffing, and operational costs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Society has become aware of the power of data and the impact it has on our daily lives. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s critically important that we make the access of data easy to every organization, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regardless of technical skill level or background,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Suzanne Borders, the chief executive and f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ounder of BadVR, in a statement. </span></p>
<p>For Borders, the key to tapping government funding is all about proper advance planning. &#8220;Those take a long time,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;When you get awarded them, you&#8217;re looking at a year&#8217;s worth of effort. [Our grant] was a testament to us planning for that about a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>These grants are typically milestone-based, so as long as BadVR was hitting its targets, it could be fairly assured that the money would be there.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NSF is proud to support the technology of the future by thinking beyond incremental  developments and funding the most creative, impactful ideas across all markets and  areas of science and engineering,” said Andrea Belz, Division Director of the Division of  Industrial Innovation and Partnerships at NSF. “With the support of our research funds,  any deep technology startup or small business can guide basic science into meaningful  solutions that address tremendous needs.”  </span></p>
<p>Other government competitions are providing the company with additional non-dilutive cash and a chance to kcik the tires on new capabilities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091680" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091680" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="568" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg 2878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=1536,852 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=2048,1136 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BadVR-AROC.Image_.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091680" class="wp-caption-text">A capture from BadVR’s augmented reality geospatial data environment, which allows users to visualize multiple live and historical datasets via overlays relevant to their environment. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> <a href="https://badvr.com/">BadVR</a></p></div></p>
<p>That has translated into traction for the company&#8217;s Augmented Reality Operations Center. The AROC is a new offering for the product that visualizes data for first responders. Through a challenge hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, BadVR was able to work with the Eureka, Mo. Fire Department to develop a prototype for a specific emergency situation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an evolution of an early product the company had developed where enterprises can create digital twins of their factories or stores in virtual reality and do a walk-through to examine different conditions.</p>
<p>The visualization work that BadVR does isn&#8217;t necessarily all geo-spatial. The company can take all kinds of data and integrate that into an environment that makes the data easier to see. Borders sees the company&#8217;s services extending into creating all kinds of collaborative environments for companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The system highlights things that are important to look at,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;It&#8217;s virtualizing the data visualization experience and bringing it into an immersive environment &#8212; and building a more collaborative aspect to that experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced businesses across the country to operate virtually, Borders said the demand for the kinds of. products her company is building &#8212; with the government&#8217;s help &#8212; has only increased.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s been due to increased demand for remote collaboration tools,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;We’ve had increased interest in people across the board &#8212; but tools that have remote collaboration capabilities &#8212; and bring people together to one immersive data experience… those are taking off.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While much of what made 2020 such an absolute nightmare will still be with us on January 1 (sorry!), we will really, truly be leaving Adobe <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flash">Flash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and FarmVille behind as we enter the new year.</p>
<p>The end of Flash has been a long time coming. The plugin, which was first released in 1996 and once supported a broad swath online content, has become increasingly irrelevant in a smartphone-centric world: iPhones never supported Flash, and it&#8217;s been just over 10 years since Apple&#8217;s then-CEO Steve Jobs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/29/steve-jobs-tells-the-world-just-what-he-thinks-of-flash/">published an open letter</a> outlining the technology&#8217;s shortcomings.</p>
<p>Adobe has been planning for the end, announcing in 2017 that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/get-ready-to-say-goodbye-to-flash-in-2020/">phase out Flash by the end of this year</a>. Most web browsers have already stopped supporting Flash, and today is the official end date, with Adobe ending support itself — although there&#8217;s still one last &#8220;death of Flash&#8221; milestone on January 12, when the company will begin to block Flash content from playing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In related news, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zynga" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zynga">Zynga <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://zyngasupport.helpshift.com/a/farmville/?s=announcements&amp;f=important-announcement&amp;l=en">announced recently</a> that the end of Flash would also mean the end of FarmVille, since the game relies on the Flash plugin.</p>

<p>Like Flash, FarmVille feels like a remnant of a bygone internet era (a fact that makes me feel incredibly old, since I wrote plenty of words about both of them at the beginning of my career). <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Launched in 2009, FarmVille&#8217;s popularity <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/31/technology/farmville-zynga-facebook.html">paved the way for the ascendance of Zynga and of Facebook gaming</a>, but both Zynga and gaming have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/zynga-q3-earnings/">largely moved on</a>.</span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and former CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-pincus" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mark-pincus">Mark Pincus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> commemorated the occasion with <a href="https://twitter.com/markpinc/status/1344742344948498432">a series of tweets</a> outlining the game&#8217;s early development (<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2009/08/07/zynga-buys-virtual-home-startup-myminilife/">spurred by the acquisition of startup MyMiniLife</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;FarmVille demonstrated that a game could be a living, always-on service that could deliver daily surprise and delight, similar to a favorite TV series,&#8221; Pincus wrote. &#8220;Games could also connect groups of people and bring them closer together.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just in case there are any FarmVille fans reading this story, don&#8217;t worry: you can still play FarmVille 2: Tropic Escape, FarmVille 2: Country Escape right now, and FarmVille 3 is still coming to mobile. Today is just the final day for the original game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the last day of 2020, New York City’s Metro Transit Authority announced that it <a href="https://www.pix11.com/news/local-news/mta-milestone-omny-rollout-to-be-completed-thursday-al-putre-interview">has finished its roll out</a> of contactless payment systems. With the addition of a final stop in Brooklyn, every MTA subway station and bus in the five boroughs now sports the OMNY “Tap and Go” system.</p>
<p>We got an early demo of the Grand Central terminals when the project rollout began last May. The system involves a major infrastructure overhaul as the transit authority looks beyond the iconic Metro Card to mobile payment systems from vendors like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Google, Samsung and Fitbit – allowing users to use smartphones and smartwatches to swipe their way through the turn style.</p>

<p>The MTA had expected to finish the project by October – though COVID-19 put the kibosh on those plans along with so much else. The goal was pushed back to December, and it appears it&#8217;s been met with no time to spare.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us for a major announcement about the rollout of OMNY, our state-of-the-art payment system that will replace MetroCard completely in 2023.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>MetroCards are sticking around for the time being – though the MTA expects they will be phased out at some point in 2023. Part of the transition involves the arrival of the OMNY Card, which use the new technology but function similarly to MetroCard. A reduced far version of the card is set to arrive for riders who qualify at some point in 2021. The new readers are also coming to the Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I edited hundreds of stories in 2020, so choosing my favorites would be an exercise in futility.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;ve tried to gather a sample of Extra Crunch stories that taught me something new. (Which means this top 10 list betrays my ignorance, a humbling admission for a know-it-all like myself.)</p>
<p>While narrowing down the field of candidates, I realized that we&#8217;re covering each of the topics on this list in greater depth next year. We already have stories in the works about no-code software, the emergence of edtech, proptech and B2B marketplaces, to name just a few.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some readers are skeptical about paywalls, but without being boastful, Extra Crunch is a premium product, just like Netflix or Disney+. I know: We&#8217;re not as entertaining as a historical drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II or a space western about a bounty hunter.</p>
<p>But, speaking as someone who&#8217;s worked at several startups, Extra Crunch stories contain actionable information you can use to build a company and/or look smart in meetings — and that&#8217;s worth something.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a very happy new year.</p>

<p>Managing Editor Danny Crichton spearheaded the development of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/">The TechCrunch List</a> earlier this year to help seed-stage founders connect with VCs who write first checks.</p>
<p>The TechCrunch List has no paywall and contains details and recommendations about more than 400 investors across 22 verticals. Once it launched, Danny crunched the data to pick out 11 investors for which &#8220;founders were particularly effusive in their praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm uses his weekday column The Exchange to keep a close eye on &#8220;private companies, public markets and the gray space in between,&#8221; but one effort stood out: An overview of six API-based startups that were &#8220;raising capital in rapid-fire fashion&#8221; when many companies were trying to find their COVID-19 footing.</p>
<p>For me, this was particularly interesting because it helped me better understand that an optimal pricing structure can be key to a SaaS company&#8217;s initial success.</p>

<p>Two stories about the advent of no-code/low-code software that we ran in July take the third and fourth position on this list.</p>
<p>I have been a no-code user for some time: Using Zapier to send automated invitations via Slack for group lunches was a real time-saver in the pre-pandemic days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprise expenditure on custom software is on track to double from $250 billion in 2015 to $500 billion in 2020,&#8221; so we&#8217;ll definitely be diving deeper into this topic in the coming months.</p>

<p>In 2018, B2B marketplaces saw an estimated $680 billion in sales, but that figure is expected to reach $3.6 trillion by 2024.</p>
<p>As companies shifted their purchasing online, these platforms are adding a range of complementary services like payment management, targeted advertising and logistics while also hardening their infrastructure.</p>

<p>Reporter Lucas Matney spoke to Caryn Marooney in August at TechCrunch Early Stage about how startup founders who hope to expand their reach need to do a better job of connecting with journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;People just fundamentally aren’t walking around caring about this new startup,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Actually, nobody does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who&#8217;s been on both sides of this equation, I most appreciated her advice about focusing on &#8220;simplicity and staying consistent&#8221; when it comes to messaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t let the complexity of your intellect cloud what needs to be simple,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>According to Miura-Ko, a co-founding partner at Floodgate, startups can only reach this stage when their business model, value propositions and ecosystem are in balance.</p>
<p>Using lessons learned from her portfolio companies like Lyft, Refinery29 and Twitch, this article should be required reading for every founder. As one commenter posted, &#8220;I read this thinking, &#8216;<strong><em>I need to add some slides to my deck!&#8217;</em></strong>&#8221;</p>

<p>Although we posted this in April, each of these forecasts seem spot-on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Future of work: promoting intimacy and trust.</li>
<li>Healthcare IT: telemedicine and remote patient monitoring.</li>
<li>Robotics and supply chain.</li>
<li>Cybersecurity.</li>

<p>I&#8217;ve always found the concept of total addressable market (TAM) hard to embrace fully — the arrival of a single disruptive company could change an industry&#8217;s TAM in a week.</p>
<p>However, several factors are combining to transform the construction industry: high fragmentation, poor communication, a skilled labor shortage and a lack of data transparency.</p>
<p>Startups that help builders manage aspects like pre-construction, workflow and site visualization are making huge strides, but because &#8220;construction firms spend less than 2% of annual sales volume on IT,&#8221; the size of this TAM is not at all speculative.</p>

<p>As a bonus, I&#8217;m including a TechCrunch op-ed written by insurtech founder Kevin Henderson that describes the myriad challenges he has faced as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Some of the discussions about the lack of diversity in tech can feel abstract, but his post describes its concrete consequences. For starters: he&#8217;s <strong>never</strong> had an opportunity to pitch at a VC firm where there was another Black person in the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black founders have a better chance playing pro sports than they do landing venture investments,&#8221; says Henderson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank Group is reportedly investing $200 million to bail out <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/katerra" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="katerra">Katerra, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a startup that had hoped to remake the construction industry with a vertically integrated approach, according to a report in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-agrees-to-200-million-bailout-of-katerra-11609366612?mod=hp_lista_pos3">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>Katerra&#8217;s shareholders reportedly approved the new investment on Wednesday, with the new lifeline from SoftBank coming on top of roughly $2 billion that the Japanese technology conglomerate had already committed to the venture.</p>
<p>Funds for the bailout, which will save Katerra from bankruptcy, will be coming from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 1, the Journal quoted Katerra chief executive Paal Kibsgaard as telling company shareholders in a message.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the funding, the SoftBank-financed financial services firm, Greensill Capital, is cancelling around $435 million in debt in exchange for a 5% stake in the company, according to the Journal&#8217;s reporting.</p>
<p>This new bailout actually marks the second time that SoftBank has stepped in to dole out $200 million to Katerra this year alone.</p>
<p>In May, when Kibsgaard, the former head of oil services developer <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/schlumberger" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="schlumberger">Schlumberger, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was brought in to fix the company&#8217;s finances, SoftBank poured $200 million into the company so Kibsgaard could right the ship there, according to the Journal&#8217;s reporting.</p>
<div>
<p>Katerra has raised multiple hundreds of million dollar rounds from the Japanese technology conglomerate since its launch in 2015. Back in 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/24/construction-startup-katerra-gets-865m-in-softbanks-latest-mega-round/">when the company closed on $865 million in financing</a>, Katerra was claiming bookings for $1.3 billion worth of commercial and residential projects ranging from hospitality to student housing. That&#8217;s a large number, but a fraction of the $1 trillion spent on construction in the month of November 2018 alone, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

<div class="paywall">
<p>Katerra has been hit by delays and cost overruns on some projects, while the COVID-19 pandemic delayed others. And irregularities that the company discovered in accounting practices also added to headaches, according to the Journal.</p>
<p>Despite its missteps, Katerra is on track to make serious cash this year, with revenue between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to details Kibsgaard gave to the Journal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["We're going to start to see a lot of real value and ROI generated by AI across more and more businesses,"]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/scale-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="scale-2">Scale AI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Alexandr Wang doesn&#8217;t need a crystal ball to see where artificial intelligence will be used in the future. He just looks at his customer list.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The four-year-old startup, which recently hit a valuation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/scale-ai-hits-3-5b-valuation-as-its-turns-the-ai-boom-into-a-venture-bonanza/">more than $3.5 billion</a>, got its start supplying autonomous vehicle companies with the labeled data needed to train machine learning models to develop and eventually commercialize robotaxis, self-driving trucks and automated bots used in warehouses and on-demand delivery.</p>
<p dir="ltr">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The wider adoption of AI across industries has been a bit of a slow burn over the past several years as company founders and executives begin to understand what the technology could do for their businesses.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2020, that changed as e-commerce, enterprise automation, government, insurance, real estate and robotics companies turned to Scale&#8217;s visual data labeling platform to develop and apply artificial intelligence to their respective businesses. Now, the company is preparing for the customer list to grow and become more varied.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How 2020 shaped up for AI</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Scale AI&#8217;s customer list has included an array of autonomous vehicle companies including Alphabet, Voyage, nuTonomy, Embark, Nuro and Zoox. While it began to diversify with additions like Airbnb, DoorDash and Pinterest, there were still sectors that had yet to jump on board. That changed in 2020, Wang said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scale began to see incredible use cases of AI within the government as well as enterprise automation, according to Wang. Scale AI began working more closely with government agencies this year and added enterprise automation customers like States Title, a residential real estate company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wang also saw an increase in uses around conversational AI, in both consumer and enterprise applications as well as growth in e-commerce as companies sought out ways to use AI to provide personalized recommendations for its customers that were on par with Amazon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Robotics continued to expand as well in 2020, although it spread to use cases beyond robotaxis, autonomous delivery and self-driving trucks, Wang said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;A lot of the innovations that have happened within the self-driving industry, we&#8217;re starting to see trickle out throughout a lot of other robotics problems,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;And so it&#8217;s been super exciting to see the breadth of AI continue to broaden and serve our ability to support all these use cases.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The wider adoption of AI across industries has been a bit of a slow burn over the past several years as company founders and executives begin to understand what the technology could do for their businesses, Wang said, adding that advancements in natural language processing of text, improved offerings from cloud companies like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud and greater access to datasets helped sustain this trend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We&#8217;re finally getting to the point where we can help with computational AI, which has been this thing that&#8217;s been pitched for forever,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That slow burn heated up with the COVID-19 pandemic, said Wang, noting that interest has been particularly strong within government and enterprise automation as these entities looked for ways to operate more efficiently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There was this big reckoning,&#8221; Wang said of 2020 and the effect that COVID-19 had on traditional business enterprises.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the future is mostly remote with consumers buying online instead of in-person, companies started to ask, &#8220;How do we start building for that?,&#8221; according to Wang.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The push for operational efficiency coupled with the capabilities of the technology is only going to accelerate the use of AI for automating processes like mortgage applications or customer loans at banks, Wang said, who noted that outside of the tech world there are industries that still rely on a lot of paper and manual processes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">Salesforce acquired Quip</a> in 2016 for $750 million, it gained CEO and co-founder Bret Taylor as part of the deal. Taylor has since risen quickly through the ranks of the software giant to become president and COO, second in command behind CEO Marc Benioff. Taylor&#8217;s experience shows that startup founders can sometimes play a key role in the companies that acquire them.</p>
<p>Benioff, 56, has been running <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> since its founding more than 20 years ago. While he hasn&#8217;t given any public hints that he intends to leave anytime soon, if he wanted to step back from the day-to-day running of the company or even job share the role, he has a deep bench of executive talent including many experienced CEOs, who like Taylor came to the company via acquisition.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			One way to step back from the enormous responsibility of running Salesforce would be by sharing the role.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>He and his wife Lynne have been active in charitable giving and in 2016 <a href="https://givingpledge.org/Pledger.aspx?id=165">signed The Giving Pledge</a>, an initiative from the The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to give a majority of their wealth to philanthropy. One could see him wanting to put more time into pursuing these charitable endeavors just as Gates did 20 years ago. As a means of comparison, Gates founded Microsoft in 1975 and stayed for 25 years <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2000/01/13/mu7.html?sh=401547ad5d83">until he left in 2000</a> to run his charitable foundation full time.</p>
<p>Even if this remains purely speculative for the moment, there is a group of people behind him with deep industry experience, who could be well-suited to take over should the time ever come.</p>
<h2>Resurrecting the co-CEO role</h2>
<p>One way to step back from the enormous responsibility of running Salesforce would be by sharing the role. In fact, for more than a year starting in 2018, Benioff actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/salesforce-promotes-coo-keith-block-to-co-ceo/">shared the top job</a> with Keith Block until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/salesforce-co-ceo-keith-block-steps-down/">his departure last year</a>. When they worked together, the arrangement seemed to work out just fine with Block dealing with many larger customers and helping the software giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/as-block-exits-salesforce-forecasts-it-will-surpass-20b-in-revenue-in-fy2021/">reach its $20 billion revenue goal</a>.</p>
<p>Before Block became co-CEO, he had a myriad other high-level titles including co-chairman, president and COO &#8212; two of which, by the way, Taylor has today. That was a lot of responsibility for one person inside a company the size of Salesforce, but promoting him to co-CEO from COO gave the company a way to reward his hard work and help keep him from jumping ship (he eventually did anyway).</p>
<p>As Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research points out, the co-CEO concept has worked out well at major enterprise companies that have tried it in the past, and it helped with continuity. &#8220;Salesforce, SAP and Oracle all didn&#8217;t miss a beat really with the co-CEO departures,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If Benioff wanted to go back to the shared responsibility model and take some work off his plate, making Taylor (or someone else) co-CEO would be one way to achieve that. Certainly, Brent Leary, lead analyst at CRM Essentials sees Taylor gaining increasing responsibility as time goes along, giving credence to the idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since Quip was acquired Taylor seemed to be on the fast track, becoming president and chief product officer less than a year-and-a-half after the acquisition, and then two years later being promoted to chief operating officer,” Leary said.</p>
<h2>Who else could be in line?</h2>
<p>While Taylor isn&#8217;t the only person who could step into Benioff&#8217;s shoes, he looks like he has the best shot at the moment, especially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">in light of the $27.7 billion Slack deal</a> he helped deliver earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taylor being publicly praised by Benioff for playing a significant role in the Slack acquisition, Salesforce&#8217;s largest acquisition to date, shows how much he has solidified his place at the highest levels of influence and decision-making in the organization,&#8221; Leary pointed out.</p>
<p>But Mueller posits that his rapid promotions could also show something might be lacking with internal options, especially around product. &#8220;Taylor is a great, smart guy, but his rise shows more the product organization bench depth challenges that Salesforce has,&#8221; he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee faces a nine-year prison term in the bribery case that contributed to the downfall of former president Park Guen-hye. Prosecutors argued that the length of the sentence is warranted because of Samsung’s power as the largest chaebol, or family-owned conglomerate, in South Korea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Samsung is a group with such overwhelming power that it is said Korean companies are divided into Samsung and non-Samsung,&#8221; they said during a final hearing on Wednesday, <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20201230000736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> the Korea Herald. The final ruling is scheduled for January 18.</p>
<p>The bribery case is separate from another trial Lee is involved in, over alleged accounting fraud and stock-price manipulation. Hearings in that case began in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hearings begin in Samsung vice chairman Jay Y. Lee&#8217;s accounting fraud trial&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/hearings-begin-in-samsung-vice-chairman-jay-y-lees-accounting-fraud-trial/embed/#?secret=exs8HRsUoX" data-secret="exs8HRsUoX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The bribery case dates back to 2017, when Lee was convicted of bribing Park and her close associate Choi Soon-sil and sentenced to five years in prison. Prosecutors allege the bribes were meant to secure government backing for Lee&#8217;s attempt to inherit control of Samsung from his father Lee Kun-hee, then its chairman. The illegal payments were a major part of the corruption scandal that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/world/asia/park-geun-hye-sentenced-south-korea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">led to Park’s impeachment, arrest and 25-year prison sentence</a>.</p>
<p>Lee was freed in 2018 after the sentence was reduced and suspended on appeal, and returned to work as Samsung&#8217;s de facto head, a position he took after his father <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/16/as-samsungs-chairman-remains-hospitalized-south-korea-prepares-for-its-next-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had a heart attack in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>In August 2019, however, the Supreme Court overturned the appeals court, ruling that it was too lenient, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/world/asia/samsung-jy-lee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ordered that the case be retried in Seoul High Court</a>.</p>
<p>The elder Lee, who was reportedly South Korea’s wealthiest citizen, died in October. He was worth an estimated $20.7 billion and under the country’s tax system, he and his heirs could be liable for estate taxes of about $10 billion, <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/10/26/samsung-chairman-heir-tax-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Fortune</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You don’t need <a href="https://qoobo.info/index-en/">Qoobo</a> in your life. Nobody <em>needs</em> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/qoobo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="qoobo">Qoobo, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> exactly. In fact, first reactions tend to range from befuddlement to bemusement. The robotic cat pillow doesn’t make a ton of sense on the face of it — in part because Qoobo has no face.</p>
<p>The handful of times I’ve interacted with the original Qoobo in person, reactions have been pretty uniform. The initial confusion gives way to the question of why such a thing needs to exist. And then, inevitably, someone asks how they can buy one of their own.</p>
<p>The original, larger version was fairly difficult to get here in the States for a while, owing to the limitation of a small robotics company has in bringing its product to a brand new market. I suspect there was also a question of whether such an idiosyncratic product would translate. In the end, however, there’s nothing particularly confusing about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2091495" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091495" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091495" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110523.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110523.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110523.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110523.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110523.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110523.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110523.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110523.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110523.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091495" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>At its subtly beating heart is an attempt to deliver comfort in a small, furry package. It’s something we could all probably use more of these days. Following a successful Indiegogo campaign, the new Petit Qoobo delivers that in a smaller, more affordable design. “Petit Qoobo is a cushion-shaped robot with a tail,” the included user guide begins. “When stroked, the tail waves gently.”</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s kind of the whole deal here. It’s a furry pillow with a robotic tail that waves when pet. Pet it more vigorously and the tail responds in kind. The pillow has a built-in mic that listens for sound (though not specific words), which can elicit a wag. I’ve found that things like a knock on the door or loud music can also trigger this effect. It will also just wag at random “just to say ‘hello’.”</p>

<p>Petit Qoobo is sitting on my lap as I write this. And yes, it’s soothing. It’s not a replacement for a real pet — but I also know full well that my real pet (pictured above) would not be as chill about sitting on my lap while I try to get some work done. When I’m finished petting Qoobo, there’s no protest — the tail simply goes slack.</p>
<p>The robot will also “go to sleep” after extensive petting — in order to save on charge, one assumes. When time comes to recharge, there’s a port located — let’s just say it&#8217;s near the tail. A zipper along the outside makes it possible to remove the fur coat altogether for cleaning.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091494" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091494" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ezgif-1-b92a08625a88.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091494" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The tail mechanism isn’t loud, per se, but it’s audible. You can hear the actuators moving as it goes to work. Honestly, the buzzing is more charming than anything. The only time it’s an issue is when using the device as a pillow. Qoobo’s other clever trick is a quiet heartbeat that triggers when squeezed. It’s a nice, calming effect — though one that can sometimes be overpowered by the tail noise.</p>
<p>The device is part of a long and fascinating lineage of Japanese therapy robotics. The most notable example is probably Paro, which dates back to the 90s. The baby seal was designed to calm and comfort patients in hospitals and nursing rooms — essentially a way to bring the benefits of therapy animals without having to have actual animals involved. Of course, that project, which ultimately cost around $15 million in development, is on an entirely different scale than this product from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yukai-engineering" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yukai-engineering">Yukai Engineering <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091497" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091497" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091497" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110600.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110600.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110600.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110600.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110600.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110600.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110600.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110600.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201230_110600.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091497" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>But the result isn’t entirely dissimilar. There are just certain parts of us that are wired to want to pet something furry and hear a heartbeat — both boxes this strange little robot happily checks. I certainly feel a bit calmer writing this &#8212; and that&#8217;s probably the most you can ask for these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, Hyundai acquired a controlling stake in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-dynamics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-dynamics">Boston Dynamics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that valued the company at $1.1 billion. What’s most interesting about the news isn’t the acquisition itself (it does, after all, find Boston Dynamics switching hands for the third time in seven years), but rather what the company’s evolution tells us about the state of robotics in 2020.</p>
<p>When the Waltham, Massachusetts-based startup was acquired by Google in 2013, it was still a carefully cultivated mystery. That the internet’s response to the company was largely one of curiosity shaded with discomfort should come as little surprise. Boston Dynamics’ primary output from a public relations perspective was viral videos of impressive but imposing quadrupedal robots built with the aid of defense department contracts. It doesn’t take a giant leap to begin coloring in the gaps with dystopian sentiment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In instances where robotic deployment has been successful, the technology has helped ease the burden on an impacted workforce.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Some of that has continued to follow the company, of course. Even in the age of short attention spans, one doesn’t quickly forget an image of a man in a fleece vest unsuccessfully attempting to kick over a headless buzzing robot in an empty parking lot. Heck, to this day every post I do about the company is greeted with multiple gifs of the knife-wielding robot from the &#8220;Metalhead&#8221; episode of &#8220;Black Mirror.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the company is still committed to its more bleeding edge R&amp;D concepts, Hyundai didn’t purchase a strange little MIT-spinoff that makes viral internet videos. It purchased a company actively working to monetize those efforts. As CEO Robert Playter told me in a recent interview, the company has sold 400 Spots since opening initial availability around 15 months ago. It’s not a huge number, but it’s a sign that interest in the company’s products extend well beyond novelty.</p>
<p>Spot’s primary task at the moment involves surveying dangerous workplaces, from nuclear reactors to oil rigs. Boston Dynamics’ next product, Handle, will move boxes around a warehouse. That robot is set to go on sale at some point in 2022. “I think something like a robot every couple of years is a pace that we could manage,” Playter told me. “From clean sheet, we can build a new robot in under a year. “And then you have to go through an iterative process of refining that concept and starting to understand market fit.”</p>
<p>Maturity in this industry requires a level of pragmatism. Tasked with describing the state of robotics in 2020, I would probably say it’s something like, “Cool technology employed for uncool tasks.” You can, no doubt, identify exceptions (making special effects for movies like Bot &amp; Dolly is decidedly cool), but on the whole, Boston Dynamics is a perfect example of impressive robots doing boring stuff. Any roboticist will happily hammer into you the concept of the three Ds — the dull, dirty and dangerous jobs where the technology is most likely to be deployed.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will try a significantly different approach to landing its future reusable rocket boosters, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. It will <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1344327757916868608">attempt to &#8220;catch&#8221;</a> the heavy booster, which is currently in development, using the launch tower arm used to stabilize the vehicle during its pre-takeoff preparations. Current Falcon 9 boosters return to Earth and land propulsively on their own built-in legs — but the goal with Super Heavy is for the larger rocket <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1344344378974720000">not to have legs at all</a>, says Musk.</p>
<p>The Super Heavy launch process will still involve use of its engines to control the velocity of its descent, but it will involve using the grid fins that are included on its main body to help control its orientation during flight to &#8220;catch&#8221; the booster — essentially hooking it using the launch tower arm before it touches the ground at all. The main benefit of this method, which will obviously involve a lot of precision maneuvering, is that it means <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> can save both cost and weight by omitting landing legs from the Super Heavy design altogether.</p>
<p>Another potential benefit raised by Musk is that it could allow <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to essentially recycle the Super Heavy booster immediately back on the launch mount it returns to — possibly enabling it to be ready to fly again with a new payload and upper stage (consisting of Starship, the other spacecraft SpaceX is currently developing and testing) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1344342598694047744">in &#8220;under an hour.&#8221;</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The goal for Starship and Super Heavy is to create a launch vehicle that&#8217;s even more reusable than SpaceX&#8217;s current Falcon 9 (and Falcon Heavy) system. Eventually, the goal for Musk is to have Starship making regular and frequent flights — for point-to-point flight on Earth, for orbital missions closer to home and for long-distance runs to the moon and Mars. The pace at which he envisions these happening in order to make it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/elon-musk-says-building-the-first-sustainable-city-on-mars-will-take-1000-starships-and-20-years/">possible to colonize Mars</a> with a continuous human population requires the kind of rapid recycling and reflying of Super Heavy he described today with this proposed new landing method.</p>
<p>Starship prototypes are currently being constructed and tested in Boca Chica, Texas, where SpaceX has been flying the pre-production spaceship during the past year. The company is also working on elements of the Super Heavy booster, and Musk said recently that it intends to begin actively<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/elon-musk-says-spacex-to-double-launch-pad-usage-for-starship-tests-super-heavy-flights-coming-in-a-few-months/"> flight-testing that component of the launch system in a few months&#8217; time</a>.</p>
