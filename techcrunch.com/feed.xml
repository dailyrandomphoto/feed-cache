										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pangea.app/">Pangea</a>, a marketplace startup that wants to connect college freelancers and companies in need of digital help, is seeing its growth rate accelerate as it races toward the impending Y Combinator demo day.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s traditional around this time that startups in the accelerator reach out to say hello. Provided that they are willing to chat growth metrics, we&#8217;re willing to listen.</p>
<p>Pangea, based in Providence, Rhode Island, is one such company. TechCrunch previously covered the company when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/pangea-app-raises-400k-seed-round-to-help-connect-student-workers-with-businesses/">announced a $400,000 pre-seed round last April</a>. Now most of the way <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/22861">through the YC accelerator</a>, the company dished regarding its recent growth and the fact that it added more capital to its accounts late last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2121591" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121591" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121591 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="236" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg 3621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=300,236 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=768,604 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=680,535 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=1536,1208 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=2048,1611 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121591" class="wp-caption-text">The Pangea team, from their shared house/office. Via the company.</p></div></p>
<p>On the growth side of the coin, Pangea CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/the_pangean">Adam Alpert</a> told TechCrunch the company has grown its gross merchandise volume (GMV) sequentially by 35% in each of the last two months. That&#8217;s a steep pace of GMV expansion. And the growth is adding up to real numbers, with Pangea facilitating $50,000 in transactions between college freelancers and businesses in the last four weeks.</p>
<p>Alpert said that its year-ago number was around $3,000 or $4,000.</p>
<p>And the company has managed to expand its market take rate to around 25%, tinkering with how it charges for its service. The result is a model that might resonate with anyone familiar with Fiverr, and may help the company more rapidly expand its net revenue.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s recent growth comes after it secured another $350,000 in November 2020 at a higher cap to its previously known pre-seed round. And, of course, it raised $125,000 from Y Combinator, funds that landed in its accounts this January.</p>
<p>Pangea is now active in 600 campuses, Alpert said. And it has found where its service is most in-demand, namely among emerging brands and smaller tech startups. Those firms often need the types of services that college kids are good at &#8212; social media, design, etc. &#8212; making them a good fit.</p>
<p>The company was somewhat coy on upcoming product news but was clear that it&#8217;s looking for investing partners as it works toward Series A scale. Let&#8217;s see how Pangea does in a few weeks.</p>

<p>This morning, instead, we&#8217;re talking about an old favorite: software valuations. The folks over at <a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a> have compiled a lengthy dive into the 2020 software market that&#8217;s worth our time &#8212; you can <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/497410287/Battery-Ventures-Software-2021-Report">read along here;</a> I&#8217;ll provide page numbers as we go &#8212; because it helps explain some software valuations.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There&#8217;s little doubt that there is some froth in the software market, but it may not be where you think it is.</p>
<p>The Battery report has a lot of data points that we&#8217;ll also work through in this week&#8217;s newsletter, but this morning, let&#8217;s narrow ourselves to thinking about rising aggregate software multiples, the breakdown of multiples expansion through the lens of relative growth rates, and cap it off with a nibble on the importance, or lack thereof, of cash flow margins for the valuation of high-growth software companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1995213 size-medium alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;ll look at the changing public market perspective, and then ask ourselves if the aggregate image that appears is good or not good for software startups.</p>
<p>I chatted through pieces of the report with its authors, Battery&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/brandongleklen">Brandon Gleklen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neerajvc">Neeraj Agrawal</a>. So, we&#8217;ll lean on their perspective a little as we go to help us move quickly. This is our Friday treat. Or at least mine. Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>Rising multiples</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with an affirmation. Yes, software valuations have risen to record-high multiples in recent years. Here&#8217;s the Battery chart that makes the change clear:</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. It was yet another crazy week, but did our best to get through as much of it as we could. Here&#8217;s the rundown, in case you are reading along with us!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">Square is buying Tidal</a> in a deal that some are skeptical of, but one about which we found quite a lot to like.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/how-capital-as-a-service-can-help-you-get-your-first-check-in-2021/?tpcc=ECTW2020">How capital-as-a-service can get you your first check in 2021,</a> and a nod to Indie.VC, a pioneer in alternative financing for startups that announced it is shutting down net new investments this year.</li>
<li>Oscar Health <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/oscar-health-prices-ipo-at-39-and-secures-a-9-5b-valuation/">priced its IPO above its raised range</a>, which was good for it in terms of fundraising. However, since its debut the company has lost pricing altitude. Its declines mimic those of other public neo-insurance proivders in what could be a new trend.</li>
<li>And sticking to the insurtech beat, Hippo is going public via a SPAC. Because everyone else is?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/compass-files-for-ipo/">Compass filed its S-1</a>, which triggered a debate on how its different than OpenDoor.</li>
<li>Coupang&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/coupang-may-raise-up-to-3-6-billion-in-its-ipo-at-a-potential-valuation-of-51-billion/">is also coming</a>, replete with huge growth, an improving profitability picture, and a massive valuation. This is one to watch.</li>
<li>There was also a whole global news circuit around grocery delivery startups, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">Instacart raising at a $39 billion valuation</a>.</li>
<li>And we wrapped with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/surreal-profile/">the Surreal seed round</a> that we found to be more than a little spicy. As it turns out, commercialized deepfakes are not merely on the way; they are here.</li>
</ul>
<p>And with that we are back on Monday. Have a rocking weekend!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The man who arguably ushered in the current SPAC rush with the merger of Virgin Galactic with his Social Capital Hedosophia holding company has divested the remainder of his personal holdings in the space tourism company. Chamath Palihapitiya, who serves as the Chairman of Virgin Galactic&#8217;s board, still holds 6.2% ownership in the company in partnership with investor Ian Osborne, but his solo holdings are now at zero.</p>
<p>Palihapitiya provided the following statement to TechCrunch via Virgin Galactic:</p>
<blockquote><p>I sold 6M shares for $200M which I am planning to redirect into a large investment I am making towards fighting climate change. The details of this investment will be made public in the next few months. I remain as dedicated as ever to Virgin Galactic’s team, mission and prospects.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Palihapitiya sold 3.8 million shares in December 2020, noting that he was selling that equity &#8220;to help manage [his] liquidity&#8221; in order to provide funding for &#8220;several new projects starting in 2021.&#8221; At the time, Palihapitiya said he &#8220;remained committed and excited fore the future of SPCE [Virgin Galactic&#8217;s stock ticker on the NYSE].&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please note that I filed a Form 4 for the sale of 3.8M shares of SPCE. I sold these shares to help manage my liquidity as I fund several new projects starting in 2021. I remain committed and excited for the future of SPCE. Just wanted to be transparent.<a href="https://t.co/OsUaVgVwKF">https://t.co/OsUaVgVwKF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1339425375063953409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The sale this week comprised 6.2 million shares, netting Palihapitiya roughly $213 million in the process.</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic has had some setbacks in its testing program that pushed the projected date of its first paying commercial tourists flights out into 2022, from an earlier target of sometime this year. The company installed Disney Parks leader Michael Colglazier as its new CEO last July, replacing George Whitesides, who moved into a Chief Space Officer role, before it was <a href="https://spacenews.com/whitesides-steps-down-from-virgin-galactic/">revealed Thursday that he&#8217;s departing the company</a>. Whitesides&#8217; decision is said to due to a desire to pursue public service opportunities.</p>
<p>Space as a sector has been a hotbed of SPAC activity of late, with mergers from a number of companies including Astra, Spire, Rocket Lab, BlackSky, and Momentus announced over the course of the past year. Virgin Galactic, as one of the earliest, will be closely watched by anyone looking for a yard stick by which to measure the tactic. The company&#8217;s share value is down just over 5% pre-market, and has been on a steady decline since reaching an all-time peak around mid-February.</p>

<p>Takahasi told TechCrunch that Scrum Studio is currently focused on the startups in its current accelerator programs (Sports Tech Tokyo, SmartCityX and Food Tech Studio), but plans to launch new programs in the future that also center on specific verticals. Through Scrum Studio, startups will be able to establish subsidiaries in Japan, or form joint ventures with Japanese companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://startupgenome.com/article/rankings-top-40">Startup Genome</a>, Beijing, London, Silicon Valley, Stockholm, Tel Aviv are some of the world&#8217;s best startup ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data and research organisation uses factors like performance, capital, market reach, connectedness, talent, and knowledge to produce its rankings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup ecosystems from emerging markets excluding China and India didn&#8217;t make the organisations&#8217; top 40 list last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a known fact that these regions lag well behind in all six factors, and decades might pass before they catch up to the standards of the aforementioned ecosystems.</span></p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.pariti.io/">Pariti</a>, a Kenyan B2B management startup founded by<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/yacob-berhane-38981541"> Yacob Berhane</a> and <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/wayele">Wossen Ayele</a> wants to close the gap on three of the six factors &#8212; access to capital, knowledge, and talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These issues, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that of access to capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is heightened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, only 25% of funding goes to early-stage startups in Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://docs.preqin.com/reports/Preqin-Venture-Capital-In-Emerging-Markets-May-2018.pdf">compared to</a> more than 50% in Latin America,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MENA, and South Asia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to build a solution that will help startups be successful that otherwise would not have been able to get the resources they needed,&#8221; said CEO Berhane to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This problem is especially acute in Africa because it’s particularly nascent, but this platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is designed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for founders across emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anywhere that doesn’t have a mature, healthy startup ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how is the team at Pariti setting out to solve these problems? Ayele tells me that in one sense, Pariti is like an unbundled accelerator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a typical accelerator, founders will need to go through an intense program where they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are loaded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with information on all the things a startup will likely need to know at some point in their growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas with Pariti, founders get the needed information or resources that are immediately relevant to helping them get to the next stage of the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>A three-way marketplace</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a founder joins Pariti, they run their company through an assessment tool. There, they share pitch materials and information about their business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti then assesses each company across more than 70 information points ranging from the team and market to product and economics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Pariti benchmarks each company against its peers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies in the same industry, product stage, revenue, fundraising are some of the comparisons made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder gets a detailed assessment with feedback on their pitch materials, the underlying metrics that they can use to develop their business and, their ability to raise capital down the line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This approach gives us an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> granular view of their businesses, its strengths, weaknesses and allows us to triage the right resources to the founder based on their particular needs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn&#8217;t end there. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti also connects the founders for one-on-one sessions with members of its global expert community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their backgrounds, according to Ayele, run the gamut from finance and marketing to product and technology across a range of sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti also provides vetted professionals for hire from its community if a founder needs more hands-on support building a product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayele says founders can continue to go through this process </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> times, getting assessed, implementing feedback, and connecting with resources and talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On another end, Pariti allows investors to sign up on its platform, thereby collating data on their preferences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So once a startup wants to raise capital, the platform matches them with investors based on their profile and preferences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’ve built an algorithm-based matching platform where we curate relevant deals to VC investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also simplify the investor reach-out process for founders, which is a huge pain </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">point &#8212; especially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121502" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121502" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121502" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=768,559 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=680,495 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121502" class="wp-caption-text">Pariti&#8217;s investor platform</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Pariti helps founders connect with affordable talent, access capital and develop their businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professionals can find interesting opportunities to mentor startups and get paid gig opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also get more exposure to the early stage ecosystem while tracking their progress, verifying their skills and increasing earning potential. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nvestors can run </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lean operations with access to proprietary deal flow, automated deal filtering and on-demand experts to support due diligence, research and portfolio support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the COO, the company has seen a tremendous amount of value built through the platform so far. A testament to this is an experience shared by Kiiru Muhoya, founder of Kenyan fintech startup Fingo Africa with TechCrunch, on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the platform helped him raise a $250,000 pre-seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that after going through Pariti&#8217;s assessment ahead of a planned fundraiser, he realized that the market he was targeting was too small</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, he needed to learn more about what VCs were looking for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muhoya decided to switch to being at the other end of things. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the expert platform on Pariti, he began to review companies and provided feedback to other founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This led him to take some months off to pivot his business based on Pariti&#8217;s first feedback and what he had learned from the expert platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He took his startup through another assessment on the platform and thus closed the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has made significant strides since launching in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has over 500 companies across 42 countries, 100 freelance experts, and 60 investors using its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane also adds that five funds currently use Pariti&#8217;s operating system for their deal management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we’re building the rails for how ventures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and scaled in emerging markets. We have partners in place across emerging markets, including Latin America and India. We also have a strong interest in the United States, where we see a real need for our platform.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Berhane said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It charges a subscription model for investors, but Berhane wouldn&#8217;t disclose the numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He says that Pariti will begin to charge a subscription fee for founders as well. Another revenue stream comes when</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors or founders pay a certain transaction fee when using Pariti&#8217;s freelance experts for projects. The same happens when there&#8217;s any fundraise executed from the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about fundraising, the company recently secured an undisclosed pre-seed capital from angels and VCs like 500 Startups, Kepple Africa and Huddle VC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it hasn&#8217;t been smooth sailing for Pariti as one issue that has stood out in dealing with founders and investors is trust</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane says founders have shared some horror stories about engaging with investors, while investors have shared trust concerns about founders reporting false numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti tries to address this by providing NDAs for both parties where the company will not share founders data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with investors until they want it to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  And investors won’t get deals that Pariti hasn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thoroughly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vetted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both founders of East African descent &#8212; Berhane from Eritrea and Ayele from Ethiopia &#8212; crossed paths a couple of times but took different routes to be where they are now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121503" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121503" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121503" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG-20200203-WA0006.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="457" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG-20200203-WA0006.jpg 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG-20200203-WA0006.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG-20200203-WA0006.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG-20200203-WA0006.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG-20200203-WA0006.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG-20200203-WA0006.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121503" class="wp-caption-text">Wossen Ayele (COO) and Yacob Berhane (CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayele started his career at a consulting shop with offices across East Africa before moving back to the U.S. for law school</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, he got his first exposure to the early-stage startup world and worked with an emerging markets-focused VC fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I could see how technology and innovation could play a role in helping communities &#8211; whether it’s through financial inclusion, access to essential goods and services, connecting people at the base of the pyramid to markets,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon graduation and completion of his legal training, Ayele headed back to Nairobi to get involved with its growing African startup ecosystem, where he and Berhane founded the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO who studied finance and investment banking in the U.S. moved back to Africa to start a pan-African accelerator in Johannesburg, South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While he has worked in managerial positions for companies like the African Leadership University and Ajua, Berhane spent most of his time </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brokering deals for them which ultimately led him to start Pariti. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After helping businesses raise more than $20m and seeing how that money led to job creation and upward mobility for employees, I knew there was a path I could have that would be meaningful within finance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I continued to think about the growing asymmetry of access to capital, talent and knowledge in the startup ecosystem and the lack of infrastructure addressing it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pariti was how we wanted to solve it.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The annual meetings of the Chinese parliament and its advisory body are underway in Beijing this week. Top executives from some of China&#8217;s largest tech firms are among the thousands of delegates who attend and put forward their opinions. Here is a look at what the tech bosses are proposing for China&#8217;s digital economy.</p>
<h3><strong>Pony Ma</strong></h3>
<p>More regulatory scrutiny is needed for the country&#8217;s budding internet economy, Tencent&#8217;s founder and CEO Pony Ma says in one of his proposals, according to a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UhD7GBQiU_FsBYZ-bA9sAg">report</a> from the state-backed People’s Posts and Telecommunications News. As a delegate of the National People&#8217;s Congress, Ma has submitted over 50 proposals during the parliament meetings over nine consecutive years, said the report.</p>
<p>Specifically, Ma calls for strict governance on peer-to-peer finance, bike-sharing, long-term apartment rental and online grocery group-buying, fledgling areas that have also seen businesses go bust amid cash-hemorrhaging competition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ma&#8217;s comment comes at a time when regulators are tightening their grips on the country&#8217;s tech giants. In recent months, the government has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">launched probes into Alibaba</a> and other tech firms over anti-competitive practices and proposed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/chinas-internet-regulator-takes-aim-at-forced-data-collection/">a sweeping data law</a> that will limit how platforms collect user information.</p>
<h3>Lei Jun</h3>
<p>In China&#8217;s grand plan to move up the manufacturing value chain, Xiaomi, which makes smartphones and a slew of other hardware devices, has been keen to help factories upgrade.</p>
<p>Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, a delegate of the NPC, recognizes China is late to smart manufacturing, lacks home-grown innovation and is overreliant on foreign technologies, he says in his <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xC1AvwdjzyEbFGaOryitCA">proposal</a>. Research and development efforts should be directed to key components such as cutting-edge sensors and precision reducers for factory robots, he says.</p>
<p>China also lacks the talent for advancing factory innovation, Lei points out, thus government policies should support corporations in attracting foreign talent and cultivating collaboration between industries and academia.</p>
<h3>Robin Li</h3>
<p>As part of its artificial intelligence pivot, Baidu, China&#8217;s biggest search engine service, has invested heavily in smart driving tech. Regulation is a major hurdle for autonomous driving firms like Baidu that need large volumes of data to train algorithms, and the rate at which testing permits are issued varies greatly across regions.</p>
<p>Robin Li, CEO of Baidu and a member of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference, <a href="https://weibo.com/2525235360/K4se88o2o?refer_flag=1001030103_&amp;type=comment#_rnd1614923758760">urges</a> regulators to be more innovative and pave the way for legal and at-scale commercialization of autonomous driving. A mechanism should be created for various government agencies, industry players and academia to collectively promote the commercial deployment of autonomous driving.</p>
<p>In addition, Li calls for more senior-friendly technologies, greater public access to government data, and better online protection for underage users in China.</p>

The company’s last funding announcement was a <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/indonesian-logistics-startup-raised-southeast-asias-largest-series-rounds-50m">$50 million Series A in April 2019</a>.</p>
<p>In a press statement, The Kim Hai, founder and chief executive officer of SiCepat&#8217;s parent company Onstar Express, said the funding will be used to &#8220;further fortify SiCepat&#8217;s position as the leading end-to-end logistics service provider in the Indonesian market and potentially to explore expansion to other markets in Southeast Asia.&#8221; SiCepat claims to be profitable already and that it was able to fulfill more than 1.4 million packages per day in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The logistics industry in Indonesia is <a href="http://www.gbgindonesia.com/en/services/article/2013/indonesia_s_logistics_sector.php">highly fragmented</a>, which means higher costs for businesses. At the same time, demand for deliveries is increasing thanks to the growth of e-commerce, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>SiCepat is one of several Indonesian startups that have raised funding recently to make the supply chain and logistics infrastructure more efficient. For example, earlier this week, supply chain SaaS provider Advotics announced a $2.75 million round. Other notable startups in the space include Kargo, founded by a former Uber Asia executive, and Waresix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>Insurance agents spend hours handling paperwork and grabbing client information over the phone. A new seed-stage startup, <a href="https://www.insurgrid.com/">InsurGrid</a>, has developed a software solution to help ease the process, and make it easier for agents to serve existing clients &#8212; and secure new ones.</p>
<p>InsurGrid gives agents a personalized platform to collect information from clients, such as date of birth, driver’s license information and policy declaration. This platform helps agents avoid sitting on long calls or managing back-to-back emails, and instead gives them one spot to understand how all their different clients function. It is starting with property and casualty management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup integrates with 85 insurance carriers, serving as the software layer instead of the provider. Using the InsurGrid platform, insurers can ask clients to upload information and within seconds be registered as a policyholder. This essentially turns into a living Rolodex that insurers can use to access information on the account, and offer quotes on a faster rate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121451" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121451" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121451 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png" alt="" width="1024" height="589" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png 4170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=1536,884 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=2048,1179 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121451" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: InsurGrid</p></div></p>
<p>There’s a monetary benefit in providing better service. Eden Insurance, a customer of InsurGrid, said that people who submit information through the platform converted at an 82% higher rate than those who don’t. Jeremy Eden, the agency owner of Eden Insurance, said they were able to show consumers that its plan was $300 cheaper than its existing rate.</p>
<p>At the heart of InsurGrid is a bet from the founding team that legacy insurance agents aren’t going anywhere. Co-founder/CEO Chase Beach pointed out that the majority of the $684 billion of annual property and casualty insurance premiums in the United States is distributed by approximately 800,000 agents working in 16,000 brokerages. So far, InsurGrid works with more than 150 of those agencies.</p>
<p>When asked if InsurGrid ever had plans to offer its own insurance, similar to insurtech giants Hippo, Lemonade and Root, Beach said that it is solely working on innovating around the sales process for now. He said that these big companies, which have either recently gone public or are planning to, still rely on agents to be successful.</p>
<p>“Instead of us replacing the insurance agent, what if we gave them that same level of technology of a Hippo or large carrier,” Beach said. “And provide them with the digital experiences so they can compete in 2021.”</p>
<p>As time goes on, he sees insurance agents taking the same role that financial advisors or real estate agents take: “very much involved in the process because they are that expert.”</p>
<p>Other startups that have popped up in this space include Gabi, Trellis and Canopy Connect. The differentiator, the team sees, is that Beach comes from a 144-year-old insurance legacy, giving him key insights on how to sell to agents in a successful and effective way. It is starting with sales, but expect InsurGrid to expand to other parts of the insurance process as well.</p>
<p>To help them compete with new and old startups, InsurGrid recently raised $1.3 million in pre-seed financing to help it fulfill its goal to be the “underdog for the underdogs,” Beach said. Investors include Engineering Capital, Hustle Fund, Vess Capital, Sahil Lavingia and Trevor Kienzle.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, a host of European startups have launched with the promise of delivering grocery and other convenience store items within 10-15 minutes of ordering. They do this by building out their own hyper-local, delivery-only fulfilment centres &#8212; so-called &#8220;dark stores&#8221; &#8212; and recruiting their own delivery personnel. This full-stack or vertical approach and the visibility it provides is then supposed to produce enough supply chain and logistics efficiency to make the unit economics work, although that part is far from proven.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this week, Berlin-based Flink announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt. The company didn&#8217;t break out the equity-debt split, though one source told me the equity component was roughly half and half.</p>
<p>Others in the space include Berlin’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, London’s Jiffy and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, and France’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo</a>, all of which also claim to focus on fresh food and groceries. There’s also the likes of <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, which is still in stealth and more focused on a potentially higher-margin convenience store offering similar to U.S. unicorn goPuff. Related: goPuff itself is also looking to expand into Europe and is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">in talks to acquire or invest in the U.K.’s Fancy</a>, which some have dubbed a mini goPuff.</p>

<p>However, let&#8217;s get back to Dija. Founded by Alberto Menolascina and Yusuf Saban, who both spent a number of years at Deliveroo in senior positions, the company has opened up shop in central London and promises to let you order groceries and other convenience products within 10 minutes. It has hubs in South Kensington, Fulham and Hackney, and says it plans to open 20 further hubs, covering central London and Zone 2, by the summer. Each hub carries around 2,000 products, claiming to be sold at &#8220;recommended retail prices&#8221;. A flat delivery fee of £1.99 is charged per order.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only competitors that we are focused on are the large supermarket chains who dominate a global $12 trillion industry,&#8221; Dija&#8217;s Menolascina tells me when I ask about competitors. &#8220;What really sets us apart from them, besides our speed and technology, is our team, who all have a background in growing and disrupting this industry, including myself and Yusuf, who built and scaled Deliveroo from the ground up&#8221;.</p>
<p>Menolascina was previously director of Corporate Strategy and Development at the takeout delivery behemoth and held several positions before that. He also co-founded Everli (formerly Supermercato24), the Instacart-styled grocery delivery company in Italy, and also worked at Just Eat. Saban is the former chief of staff to CEO at Deliveroo and also worked at investment bank Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>During Dija&#8217;s soft-launch, Menolascina says that typical customers have been doing their weekly food shop using the app, and also fulfilling other needs, such as last-minute emergencies or late night cravings. &#8220;The pain points Dija is helping to solve are universal and we built Dija to be accessible to everyone,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It’s why we offer products at retail prices, available in 10 minutes &#8212; combining value and convenience. Already, Dija is becoming a key service for parents who are pressed for time working from home and homeschooling, as one example&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite the millions of dollars being pumped into the space, a number of VCs I&#8217;ve spoken to privately are skeptical that fresh groceries with near instant delivery can be made to work. The thinking is that fresh food perishes, margins are lower and basket sizes won&#8217;t be large enough to cover the costs of delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be the case for other companies, but almost everyone at Dija comes from this industry and knows exactly what they are doing, from buying and merchandising to data and marketing,&#8221; Menolascina says, pushing back. &#8220;It’s also worth pointing out that we are a full-stack model, so we’re not sharing our margin with other parties. In terms of the average basket size, it varies depending on the customer&#8217;s need. On one hand, we have customers who do their entire grocery shop through Dija, while on the other hand, our customers depend on us for emergency purchases e.g. nappies, batteries etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>On pricing, he says that, like any retail business, Dija buys products at wholesale prices and sells them at recommended retail prices. &#8220;Going forward, we have a clear roadmap on how we generate additional revenue, including strategic partnerships, supply chain optimisation and technology enhancements,&#8221; adds Menolascina.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, TechCrunch has learned that prior to launching its own app, Dija ran a number of experiments on takeout marketplace Deliveroo, including selling various convenience store items, such as potato chips and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. If you&#8217;ve ever ordered toiletry products from &#8220;Baby &amp; Me Pharmacy&#8221; or purchased chocolate sweets from &#8220;Valentine&#8217;s Vows,&#8221; you have likely and unknowingly shopped at Dija. Those brands, and a number of others, all delivered from the same address in South Kensington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going direct to consumer without properly testing pick &amp; pack is a big risk,&#8221; Menolascina told me in a WhatsApp message a few weeks ago, confirming the Deliveroo tests. &#8220;We created disposable virtual brands purely to learn what to sell and how to replenish, pick &amp; pack, and deliver&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Square acquires Tidal</strong></p>
<p>Square announced this morning that it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">purchased a majority stake in Tidal</a>, the music streaming service founded by Jay-Z. It sounds like an odd fit at first, which Square CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged in a tweet asking, &#8220;Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His answer: &#8220;It comes down to a simple idea: finding new ways for artists to support their work. New ideas are found at the intersections, and we believe there’s a compelling one between music and the economy. Making the economy work for artists is similar to what Square has done for sellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Square is paying $297 million in cash and stock for the deal, which will result in Jay-Z joining Square&#8217;s board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">it was acquiring Auth0</a> yesterday for $6.5 billion, the deal raised eyebrows. After all, it&#8217;s a substantial amount of money for one identity and access management (IAM) company to pay to buy another, similar entity. But the deal ultimately brings together two companies that come at identity from different sides of the market &#8212; and as such could be the beginning of a beautiful identity friendship.</p>

			The deal ultimately brings together two companies that come at identity from different sides of the market &#8212; and as such could be the beginning of a beautiful identity friendship.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>On a simple level, Okta delivers identity and access management (IAM) to companies who use the service to provide single-sign-on access for employees to a variety of cloud services &#8212; think Gmail, Salesforce, Slack and Workday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://auth0.com">Auth0</a> is a developer tool providing coders with easy API access to single-sign-on functionality. With just a couple of lines of code, the developer can deliver IAM tooling without having to build it themselves. It’s a similar value proposition to what Twilio offers for communications or Stripe for payments.</p>
<p>The thing about IAM is that it’s not exciting, but it is essential. That could explain why such a large number of dollars are exchanging hands. As Auth0 co-founder and CEO Eugenio Pace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/auth0-founder-code-boss/">told TechCrunch’s Zack Whittacker</a> in 2019, “Nobody cares about authentication, but everybody needs it.”</p>
<p>Putting the two companies together generates a fairly comprehensive approach to IAM covering back end to front end. We’re going to look at why this deal matters from an identity market perspective, and if it was worth the substantial price Okta paid to get Auth0.</p>
<h2>Halt! Who goes there?</h2>
<p>When you think about identity and access management, it’s about making sure you are who you say you are, and that you have the right to enter and access a set of applications. That’s why it’s a key part of any company’s security strategy.</p>
<p>Gartner found that IAM was a $12 billion business last year with projected growth to over $13.5 billion in 2021. To give you a sense of where Okta and Auth0 fit, Okta just closed FY2021 with over $800 million in revenue. Meanwhile Auth0 is projected to close this year with $200 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>

<p>Among the top players in this market according to <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/access-management-leader-gartner-magic-quadrant/?gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpLGH3w8bVX7Ef3yCO0qSXSiLhb4rVHEdcjcI93oRewG942kAAWxH0BoCEIMQAvD_BwE&amp;utm_campaign=search_google_amer_multiple_ao_it_nb-priority_bmm&amp;utm_content=482009063244&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_page={url}&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=%2Biam%20%2Bmagic%20%2Bquadrant">Gartner’s November 2020 Magic Quadrant</a> market analysis are Ping Identity, Microsoft and Okta in that order. Meanwhile Gartner listed Auth0 as a key challenger in their market grid.</p>
<p>Michael Kelley, a Gartner analyst, told TechCrunch that Okta and Auth0 are both gaining something from the deal.</p>
<p>“For Okta, while they have a very good product, they have marketing muscle and adoption rates that are not available to smaller vendors like Auth0. When having [IAM] conversations with clients, Okta is almost always on the short list. Auth0 will immediately benefit from being associated with the larger Okta brand, and Okta will likewise now have credibility in the deals that involve a heavy developer focused buyer,” Kelley told me.</p>
<p>Okta co-founder and CEO Todd McKinnon said he was enthusiastic about the deal precisely because of the complementary nature of the two companies’ approaches to identity. “How a developer interacts with the service, and the flexibility they need is different from how the CIO wants to work with [identity]. So by giving customers this choice and support, it&#8217;s really compelling,” McKinnon explained.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s no overstating it: 2020 was a hell of a year. When future generations learn about 2020, the pandemic, social tension and political unrest will take up most of the oxygen. But for those learning about the history of cybersecurity, 2020 and a midsize company from Austin, Texas — SolarWinds — will take center stage.</p>
<p>Malicious code in one update of a trusted software provider was the Trojan horse that enabled access to petabytes of private data across <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-russia-sanctions-solarwinds-hacks/2021/02/23/b77039d6-71fa-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html">18,000 organizations</a>, including Fortune 500s and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">government entities</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Every business leader must acknowledge what many in cybersecurity have been saying — cyber strategy is company strategy.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Why will SolarWinds be so generationally important, and why am I talking about it? Because the large (and growing) impact of the hack and the substantial (and mounting) losses mean that every business leader must acknowledge what many in cybersecurity have been saying — cyber strategy <em>is</em> company strategy. It is not an audit, but an important part of C-suite strategies and best practices ranging from employee onboarding to mundane everyday coding.</p>
<p>I believe generational startups will be created from this reckoning with cybersecurity, just as they’ve been created coming out of market disruptions in the past. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karanortman/2020/07/15/why-the-merging-of-the-devops-driven-cloud-and-cyber-security-will-create-dozens-of-new-category-leaders/?sh=7810663d347f">I’ve been thinking about this for a while</a>, but it is more clear than ever that we will see cyber go on a tear this next decade.</p>
<p>Forecasts suggest $100 billion of new market value by 2025 alone, putting total market size at close to $280 billion, but I think this figure is conservative. Cyber is — and will be — a massive business.</p>
<p>One key driver of growth in the cyber market is really easy to understand, but really hard to solve for: data. Cyber is often a second-order value proposition, after speed of development, managing IT assets or data. We’re familiar with the idea that “data is the new oil.” Since that phrase was coined by mathematician Clive Humby 15 years ago, the total amount of data in the world has increased 74x.</p>
<p>By 2025, IDC <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2018/11/27/175-zettabytes-by-2025/?sh=224587055459">forecasts</a> the data universe will consist of 175 zettabytes. In case you don’t know, one zettabyte is <em>1</em> <em>trillion</em> gigabytes. If you were to download 175 zettabytes of data on your computer, it would take you 1.8 billion years. Mind-boggling!</p>
<p>And it only increases exponentially from here. From likes, posts, profile views, follows and RTs for end consumers to time on site, conversion rate and bounce rate for websites to events, errors and anomaly tracking in IoT — all of this data is logged and tracked. We’ve seen billion-dollar companies built, taken public and acquired that ingest and visualize all of the data we capture.</p>
<p>The next generation of API startups is valuable proportionally to their ability to “talk” with apps in the ecosystem by sharing and ingesting data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For founder Najette Fellache, coming to the Bay Area a few years ago from Nantes, France was a way to grow a company she&#8217;d founded and which was already beginning to count major U.S. corporations like GE, Tesla, Amazon, and Medtronics as customers.</p>
<p>What that six-year-old outfit, <a href="https://speach.me/">Speach</a>, sells is essentially knowledge-sharing between colleagues via videos produced by the employees themselves, often to augment written instructions. The idea is to maximize learning, fast, and investors liked it enough to provide Speach with $14 million in funding.</p>
<p>But while the technology has only become more relevant in a world shut down by COVID-19, an internal project within the company began to interest Fellache even more after her children abruptly began attending school remotely from home. As she tells it, her aha moment came in the form of a drawing from her youngest son, who struggled to understand why his mother&#8217;s meetings kept taking precedent over him.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2121261" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121261" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121261 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121261" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credit:</strong> Najette Fellache</p></div></p>
<p>Like many parents trying to figure out how to balance work and family over the last year, Fellache wasn&#8217;t immediately sure of how to parent around the clock while also leading a company. Unlike a lot of parents, she had access to engineers who could create a technology that enabled her, along with other members of Speach&#8217;s team, to make short videos that could quickly communicate important information and be viewed at the recipient&#8217;s convenience &#8212; as well as saved for future reference.</p>
<p>In fact, as sometimes happens with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/"> internal projects</a>, the technology worked so well for Speach that it has since taken on a life of its own. Indeed, using a bit of that earlier funding from Speach &#8212; its backers are Alven and Red River West, a fund co-managed by Artémis, the investment company of the Pinault family &#8212; Fellache and a team of 10 employees this week launched <a href="https://beeweet.com/">Weet</a>, a new asynchronous video startup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y3ReoJo529"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/">The Slack origin story</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Slack origin story&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/embed/#?secret=y3ReoJo529" data-secret="y3ReoJo529" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s entering a crowded field. Fellache is hardly alone in recognizing the power of asynchronous meetings as an attractive alternative to phone calls, real-time meetings and even email, where tone is often lost and content can be misconstrued. <a href="https://www.loom.com/login">Loom</a>, for example, a six-year-old enterprise collaboration video messaging service that enables users to send short clips of themselves, has already raised at least $73 million from investors, including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Coatue.</p>
<p>Another, newer entrant is <a href="https://supernormal.com/">SuperNormal</a>, a year-old, Stockholm, Sweden-based work communication platform that employs video and screen recording tools to help teams create and send asynchronous video updates throughout the day and which raised <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/supernormal-funding/">$2 million</a> in seed funding led by EQT Ventures in December.</p>
<p>Still, if you believe that the future of work is remote, it&#8217;s clear that the opportunity here is a big one. Further, Weet &#8212; which is accessible for free via a browser extension and whose integrations with both Slack and Microsoft Teams are scheduled to go live next month &#8212; is fast becoming a better product than some of what&#8217;s available in the market already, says Fellache.</p>
<p>Weet already features instant recording, screen sharing, virtual backgrounds, video filters, emoji reactions, commenting options and auto transcription. For a premium paid version in the works, it is also developing features that will make it easier to organize discussions for users. Imagine, for example, a salesperson looking for communications about a potential client and wanting notes from those auto-transcriptions that are presented together in one email to that individual.</p>
<p>As for privacy, Fellache points to the data management expertise that Speach has developed over time working with clients like Airbus and Colgate-Palmolive that are acutely mindful of privacy. Weet &#8212; which Fellache says is already being used by units inside Colgate-Palmolive &#8212; employs the same standards and practices.</p>
<p>Weet is seemingly taking a different approach on the marketing front, too. Fellache says while some rivals enable users to publish one video at a time, Weet is a more conversational tool where teammates and contacts can create sections of the same video for a back-and-forth, sending video feedback, audio feedback, sharing their screen or reacting with emoticons.</p>
<p>Put another way, Weet enables not only the exchange of more critical information but can invite more interaction broadly and, presumably, strengthen team relationships in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a discussion, not a transaction,&#8221; Fellache offers, and that&#8217;s important, she suggests. As she has seen firsthand, in a world where teams are increasingly scattered around the globe, open communication is more central than ever to a company&#8217;s success &#8212; and that of its employees.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not every day that we hear of Latin American VCs investing in U.S.-based startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berkeley-based fintech Flourish has raised $1.5 million in a funding round led by Brazilian venture capital firm Canary. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Pedro Moura and Jessica Eting, the startup offers an “engagement and financial wellness” solution for banks, fintechs and credit unions with the goal of helping them engage and retain clients.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also participating in the round were Xochi Ventures, First Check Ventures, Magma Capital and GV Angels as well as strategic angels including Rodrigo Xavier (former Bank of America CEO in Brazil), Beth Stelluto (formerly of Schwab), Gustavo Lasala (president and CEO of The People Fund) and Brian Requarth (founder of Viva Real). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With clients in the U.S., Bolivia and Brazil, Flourish has developed a solution that features three main modules: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rewards engine designed to incentivize users to save or invest money.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An intelligent and automated micro-savings feature where users can create personalized rules (such as transferring $15 into a rainy day fund every time their favorite sports team wins).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A financial knowledge module, where personal financial transactions and spending patterns are turned into a question and answer game. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., Flourish began by testing end-user mechanics with organizations such as CommonWealth and Opportunity Fund. In 2019, it released a B2C version of the Flourish app (c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alled the Flourish Savings App)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a pilot for its banking platform, which can integrate with banks through an SDK or an API. It is also now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">licensing its engagement technology to banks, retailers and fintechs across the Americas.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flourish has piloted or licensed its solution to U.S.-based credit unions, Sicoob (Brazil&#8217;s largest credit union) and BancoSol in Bolivia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup makes money through a partnership model that focuses on user activation and engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both immigrants, Moura and Eting met while in the MBA program at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. Moura came to the U.S. from Brazil as a teen, while Eting is the daughter of a Filiponio father and mother of Mexican descent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair bonded on their joint mission of building a business that empowered people to create positive money habits and understand their finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the 11-person team works out of the U.S., Mexico and Brazil. It plans to use its new capital to increase its number of customers in LatAm, do more hiring and develop new functionalities for the Flourish platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, it plans to next focus on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian market, and will scale in a few select countries in the Americas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are three things that make Latin America, and more specifically Brazil, attractive to us at this moment,” Moura said. “Currently, the B2B financial technology market is still in its nascency. This combined with open banking regulation and the need for more responsible products provides Flourish a unique opportunity in Brazil.”</span><b></b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining company culture when the majority of staff is working remotely is a challenge for every organization &#8212; big and small.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an issue, even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID. But it’s become an even bigger problem with so many employees working from home. Employers have to be careful that workers don’t feel disconnected and isolated from the rest of the company and that morale stays high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="http://www.workvivo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workvivo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cork, Ireland-based employee experience startup that is backed by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoom founder Eric Yuan and Tiger Global that has steadily grown over 200% over the past year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company works with organizations ranging in size from 100 employees to over 100,000 and boasts more than 500,000 users. According to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO and co-founder John </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goulding, it’s had 100% retention since it launched. Customers include Telus International, Kentech, A+E Networks and Seneca Gaming Corp., among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Goulding and Joe Lennon in 2017, Workvivo launched its employee communication platform in mid-2018 with the goal of helping</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies create “an engaging virtual workplace” and replace the outdated intranet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not about real time, we’re more asynchronous communication,” Goulding explained. “We have a lot of transactional tools, and typically carry the bigger message about what’s going on in a company and what positive things are happening. We’re more focused on human connection.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Workvivo, companies can provide information like CEO updates, recognition for employees via a social style &#8212; “more things that shape the culture so workers can get a real sense of what’s happening in an organization.” It launched podcasts in the second quarter and livestreaming in Q4.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Workvivo, a platform for employee culture, raises a $16M Series A from Tiger Global&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/workvivo-a-platform-for-employee-culture-raises-a-16m-series-a-from-tiger-global/embed/#?secret=zHcn6MTEbA" data-secret="zHcn6MTEbA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Workvivo showed its product to Zoom’s Yuan, who ended up becoming one of the company’s first investors. Then in May of 2020, the company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/workvivo-a-platform-for-employee-culture-raises-a-16m-series-a-from-tiger-global/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $16 million in a Series A funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Tiger Global, which is best known for large growth-oriented rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workvivo, which was built out long before the COVID-19 pandemic, found itself in an opportune place last year. And demand for its offering has reflected that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since COVID hit, growth has accelerated,” Goulding told TechCrunch. “We grew three times in size over where we were before the pandemic started, in terms of revenue, users, customers and employees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SaaS operator’s deals range from $50,000 to close to $1 million a year, he said. Workvivo is Europe-based and operates in 82 countries. But the majority of its customers are located in the U.S. with 80% of its growth coming from the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup opened an office in San Francisco in early </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020, which it is expanding. Thirty percent of its 65-person team is currently U.S.-based, with some working remotely from other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Workvivo would not reveal hard revenue figures, Goulding only said it’s not seeking additional funding anytime soon considering the company is “in a very strong capital position.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tackle the same problem, Microsoft last month </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched Viva, its new “employee experience platform,” or, in non-marketing terms, its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/microsoft-launches-viva-its-new-take-on-the-old-intranet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new take</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the intranet sites most large companies tend to offer their employees. With the move, Microsoft is taking on the likes of Facebook’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workplace platform and Jive in addition to Workvivo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the increasingly crowded space, Workvivo believes it has an advantage over competitors in that it integrates well with Slack and Zoom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re sitting alongside Slack and Zoom in the ecosystem,” Goulding said. “There’s Zoom, Slack and us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slack is real-time messaging and what’s happening in the immediate future, and Zoom is real-time video and “about the moment,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Goulding, Microsoft’s new offering is unproven yet and a reactionary move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s obvious there’s a battle to be won for the center of the digital workplace,” he said. “We’re here to capture the heartbeat of an organization, not pulses.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With most of us locked into a square video box on platforms like Zoom, the desire to break away and perhaps wander around a virtual space is strong. These new ways of presenting people — as small circles of videos placed in a virtual space where they can move around — has appeared in various forms, like &#8220;virtual bars&#8221; for the last few months during global pandemic lockdowns. Hey, I even went to a few virtual bars myself! Although the drinks from my fridge could have been better.</p>
<p>The advantage of this spatial approach is it gives a lot more &#8220;agency&#8221; to the user. You feel, at least, a <em>bit</em> more in control, as you can make a &#8220;physical&#8221; choice as to where you go, even if it is only still a virtual experience.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://spatial.chat/">SpatialChat</a>, one of the first startups with that approach that launched on ProductHunt in April last year, is upping the game with a new design and the feature of persistent chats. The product debuted on ProductHunt on April 20, 2020, and rose to No. 3 app of the day. The web-based platform has been bootstrapped by the founders with their own resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpatialChat is now adding a special tier and features for teams running town hall meetings and virtual offices and says it currently has more than 3,000 organizations as paying customers, with more than 200,000 total monthly active users.</p>
<p>The startup is part of a virtual networking space being populating by products such as<a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com"> Teamflow</a>, <a href="https://gather.town">Gather</a> and <a href="https://remo.co">Remo</a>. Although it began as an online networking events service, it&#8217;s now trying to reposition as a forum for multigroup discussions, all the way up from simple stand-up meetings to online conferences.</p>
<p>SpatialChat uses a mix of &#8220;proximity&#8221; video chats, screen sharing and rooms for up to 50 people. It’s now putting in pricing plans for regular, weekly, and one-time use cases. It says it’s seen employees at Sony, Panasonic, Sega, LinkedIn, Salesforce and McKinsey, as well as educators and staff at 108 American universities, including Harvard, Stanford, Yale and MIT, use the platform.</p>
<p>Almas Abulkhairov, CEO and co-founder of SpatialChat says: “Slack, Zoom and Microsoft Teams represent a virtual office for many teams but most of our customers say these apps aren’t a good fit for that. They don’t provide the same serendipity of thought you get working shoulder to shoulder and &#8216;Zoom fatigue&#8217; became a term for a reason. We want to bring the best from offline work.”</p>
<p>Konstantin Krasov, CPO at Data Souls, who used the platform, said: “We had 2,500 people in attendance during a two-day event that we hosted for our community of 50,000 data scientists. SpatialChat enabled us to make a cool networking event, Q&amp;A and AMA with thought leaders in data science.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coursera, an online education platform that has seen its business grow amid the coronavirus pandemic, is planning to file paperwork tomorrow for its initial public offering, sources familiar with the matter say. The company has been talking to underwriters since last year, but tomorrow could mark its first legal step in the process to IPO.</p>
<p>The Mountain View-based business, founded in 2012, was last valued at $2.4 billion in the private markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/edtech-startups-flirt-with-unicorn-style-growth/">during a Series F fundraising event in July 2020.</a> Bloomberg pegs Coursera’s latest valuation<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/online-education-firm-coursera-is-said-to-weigh-2021-ipo#:~:text=Coursera%20Inc.%20is%20considering%20an,people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter.&amp;text=Get%20insights%20from%20reporters%20around%20the%20world%20in%20the%20Fully%20Charged%20newsletter."> at $5 billion. </a></p>
<p>The latest financing event brought its cash balance to $300 million, right around the money that Chegg had before it went public. Coursera CEO Jeff Maggioncalda did confirm then that the company is eyeing an eventual IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coursera has had a busy pandemic. Similar to Udemy, another massive open online course provider planning to go public, Coursera added an enterprise arm to its business. It launched Coursera for Campus to help colleges bring on online courses (credit optional) with built-in exams; more than 3,700 schools across the world are using the software. It is unclear how much money this operation has brought in, but we know that Udemy for Business is nearing $200 million in annual recurring revenue. In February, the company announced that it has received B Corp. certification, which means that it hits high standards for social and environmental performance. It also converted to a public benefit corporation.</p>
<p>GSV, a venture capital firm that exclusively backs edtech companies, had its largest position of its first fund in Coursera. GSV announced a $180 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/gsv-ventures-doubles-assets-managed-with-new-fund-focused-on-global-edtech/">million Fund II yesterday. </a></p>
<p>It makes sense that edtech companies want to go public while the markets remain hot and remote education continues to be a central way that instruction is delivered. Other companies from the sector that have gone public in recent weeks include Nerdy and Skillsoft, two companies that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> used a SPAC</a> to make their public debuts. Once &#8211; and if &#8211; Coursera does go public, it will join these newbies as well as the long-time edtech public companies including 2U, Chegg, and K12 Inc, and Zovio Solutions.</p>
<p>Coursera declined to comment.</p>
<p><em>Update: The previous version of this story stated that Skillshare has gone public. This is incorrect. Skillsoft has gone public. An update to reflect this change has been made.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When I first wrote about <a href="https://www.whatnot.com">Whatnot</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/">February of last year</a>, they were just getting started. Aiming to be the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/goat/">GOAT</a> of collectible toys, they were focusing first on being the go-to trusted spot for buying and selling authenticated Funko Pop figurines.</p>
<p>A few months later, as they expanded into categories like pins and Pokémon cards, the company started to build out a live shopping platform — think of something along the lines of a TV shopping network, but swap out the studios and camera crews for folks at home with iPhones selling to an audience of fellow collectors. The concept had already proven popular in China and was starting to gain traction amongst buyers of collectibles in the U.S. But a good chunk of those U.S. livestreams were happening on Instagram Live, which isn&#8217;t really built for things like bidding or handling payments after a sale occurs. Whatnot saw a gap in the market and wanted to fill it.</p>
<p>It seems that move is working out well for the team. At the end of 2020, Whatnot raised a $4 million seed round; just a few months later, building on the momentum of its live shopping platform and looking to expand into many more categories of collectibles, it has raised another $20 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company tells me that this Series A round was led by Connie Chan of Andreessen Horowitz, and backed by YC, Wonder Ventures, Operator Partners, Scribble Ventures, Steve Aoki and Chris Zarou.</p>
<p>Whatnot continues to offer a more traditional, nonlivestreamed selling platform — but co-founder Grant LaFontaine tells me about &#8220;95%&#8221; of the team&#8217;s focus is on the livestream side of things.</p>
<p>&#8220;People really come to us for the live, but then they&#8217;re like, &#8216;Eh, I don&#8217;t want to sell across 10 different platforms&#8217; so we give them the tools to be a one-stop shop,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>As I wrote back in December, one increasingly popular type of livestream on Whatnot is the &#8220;card break&#8221;, wherein:</p>
<blockquote><p>Users pool their money to buy an entire box of trading card packs — often boxes that are no longer being produced and can cost thousands of dollars to obtain. Each user gets a number, each number tied to a pack (or packs) within the box. Each pack is opened on the livestream, its contents sent to the (hopefully?) lucky owner tied to that pack’s number.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why raise more money? LaFontaine tells me it&#8217;s to help them expand into more categories, fast. The company currently focuses primarily on Pokémon cards, Funko Pops, FigPins and sports cards, but they mention things like comic books, video games and vintage hardware as natural fits. Diving into a new category means building up a community for it, convincing trusted sellers to hop on their platform and marketing to the right buyers to make it worthwhile. In time, LaFontaine tells me, the team expects to cover 100+ categories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A lot of our communication these days with each other is digital, and today one of the companies enabling that &#8212; with APIs to build chat experiences into apps &#8212; is announcing a round of funding on the back of some very strong growth.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://getstream.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream</a>, which lets developers build chat and activity streams into apps and other services by way of a few lines of code, has raised $38 million, funding that it will be using to continue building out its existing business as well as to work on new features.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stream started out with APIs for activity feeds, and then it expanded to chat, which today can be integrated into apps built on a variety of platforms. Currently, its customers integrate third-party chatbots and use Dolby for video and audio within Stream, but over time, these are all areas where Stream itself would like to do more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;End-to-end encryption, chatbots: We want to take as many components as we can,&#8221; said Thierry Schellenbach, the CEO who co-founded the startup with the startup&#8217;s CTO Tommaso Barbugli in Amsterdam in 2015 (the startup still has a substantial team in Amsterdam headed by Barbugli, but its headquarters is now in Boulder, Colorado, where Schellenbach eventually moved).</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2121181" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121181" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg 1929w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=768,567 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=680,502 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=1536,1134 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121181" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://getstream.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">The company already has amassed a list of notable customers, including Ikea-owned TaskRabbit, NBC Sports, Unilever, Delivery Hero, Gojek, eToro and Stanford University, as well as a number of others that it&#8217;s not disclosing across healthcare, education, finance, virtual events, dating, gaming and social. Together, the apps Stream powers cover more than 1 billion users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This Series B round is being led by Felicis Ventures’ Aydin Senkut, with previous backers GGV Capital and 01 Advisors (the fund co-founded by Twitter’s former CEO and COO, Dick Costolo and Adam Bain) also participating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alongside them, a mix of previous and new individual and smaller investors also participated: Olivier Pomel, CEO of Datadog; Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Amsterdam-based Knight Capital; Johnny Boufarhat, founder and CEO of Hopin; and Selcuk Atli, co-founder and CEO of social gaming app Bunch (itself having raised a notable <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200917005244/en/Bunch-Closes-20-Million-Series-A-Financing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">round of $20 million led by General Catalyst</a> not long ago).</p>
<p dir="ltr">That list is a notable indicator of what kinds of startups are also quietly working with Stream.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is not disclosing its valuation but said c<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">hat revenue grew by 500% in 2020. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, the Series B speaks of a moment of opportunity: It is coming only about six months after the startup raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/stream-whose-apis-help-product-teams-build-chat-and-activity-feeds-fast-just-raised-a-15-million-series-a-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A of $15 million</a>, and in fact Stream wasn&#8217;t looking to raise right now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We were not planning to raise funding until later this year but then Aydin reached out to us and made it hard to say no,&#8221; Schellenbach said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;More than anything else, they are building on the platforms in the tech that matters,&#8221; Senkut added in an interview, noting that its users were attesting to a strong return on investment. &#8220;It&#8217;s rare to see a product so critical to customers and scaling well. It&#8217;s just uncapped capability&#8230; and we want to be a part of the story.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That moment of opportunity is not one that Stream is pursuing on its own.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some of the more significant of the many players in the world of API-based communications services like messaging, activity streams &#8212; those consolidated updates you get in apps that tell you when people have responded to a post of yours or new content has landed that is relevant to you, or that you have a message, and so on &#8212; and chat include SendBird, Agora, PubNub, Twilio and Sinch, all of which have variously raised substantial funding, found a lot of traction with customers, or are positioning themselves as consolidators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That may speak of competition, but it also points to the vast market there for the tapping.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, one of the reasons companies like Stream are doing so well right now is because of what they have built and the market demand for it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Communications services like Stream&#8217;s might be best compared to what companies like Adyen (another major tech force out of Amsterdam), Stripe, Rapyd, Mambu and others are doing in the world of fintech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As with something like payments, the mechanics of building, for example, chat functionality can be complex, usually requiring the knitting together of an array of services and platforms that do not naturally speak to each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, something like an activity feed or a messaging feature is central to how a lot of apps work, even if they are not the core feature of the product itself. One good example of how that works are food ordering and delivery apps: they are not by their nature &#8220;chat apps&#8221; but they need to have a chat option in them for when you do need to communicate with a driver or a restaurant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Putting those forces together, it&#8217;s pretty logical that we&#8217;d see the emergence of a range of tech companies that both have done the hard work of building the mechanics of, say, a chat service, and making that accessible by way of an API to those who want to use it, with APIs being one of the more central and standard building blocks in apps today; and a surge of developers keen to get their hands on those APIs to build that functionality into their apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What Stream is working on is not to be confused with the customer-service focused services that companies like Zendesk or Intercom are building when they talk about chat for apps. Those can be specialized features in themselves that link in with CRM systems and customer services teams and other products for marketing analytics and so on. Instead, Stream&#8217;s focus are services for consumers to talk to other consumers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is a trend worth watching is whether easy-to-integrate services like Stream&#8217;s might signal the proliferation of more social apps over time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There is already at least one key customer &#8212; which I am now allowed to name &#8212; that is a steadily growing, still young social app, which has built the core of its service on Stream&#8217;s API.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With just a handful of companies &#8212; led by Facebook, but also including ByteDance/TikTok, Tencent, Twitter, Snap, Google (via YouTube) and some others depending on the region &#8212; holding an outsized grip on social interactions, easier, platform-agnostic access to core communications tools like chat could potentially help more of these, with different takes on &#8220;social&#8221; business models, find their way into the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Stream</span>’s technology addresses a common problem in product development by offering an easy-to-integrate and scalable messaging solution,” said Dick Costolo of 01 Advisors, and the former Twitter CEO, in a statement. “Beyond that, their team and clear vision set them apart, and we ardently back their mission.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Updated to correct that the revenue growth is not related to the valuation figure.</em></p>
