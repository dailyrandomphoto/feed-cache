										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s digital businesses can breathe a sign of relief today as the European Commission has officially signed off on data adequacy for the (now) third country, post-Brexit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big deal for UK businesses as it means the country will be treated by Brussels as having essentially equivalent data protection rules as markets within the bloc, despite no longer being a member itself &#8212; enabling personal data to continue to flow freely from the EU to the UK, and avoiding any new legal barriers.</p>
<p>The granting of adequacy status has been all but assured in recent weeks, after European Union Member States signed off on a draft adequacy arrangement. But the Commission&#8217;s adoption of the decision marks the final step in the process &#8212; at least for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that the Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3183">PR</a> includes a clear warning that if the UK seeks to weaken protections afforded to people&#8217;s data under the current regime it &#8220;will intervene&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a statement, Věra Jourová, Commission VP for values and transparency, said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“</em>The UK has left the EU but today its legal regime of protecting personal data is as it was. Because of this, we are adopting these adequacy decisions today. At the same time, we have listened very carefully to the concerns expressed by the Parliament, the Members States and the European Data Protection Board, in particular on the possibility of future divergence from our standards in the UK&#8217;s privacy framework. We are talking here about a fundamental right of EU citizens that we have a duty to protect. This is why we have significant safeguards and if anything changes on the UK side, we will intervene.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The UK adequacy decision comes with a Sword of Damocles baked in: A sunset clause of four years. It&#8217;s a first &#8212; so, er, congratulations to the UK government for projecting a perception of itself as untrustworthy over the short run.</p>
<p>This clause means the UK&#8217;s regime will face full scrutiny again in 2025, with no automatic continuation if its standards are deemed to have slipped (as many fear they will).</p>
<p>The Commission also emphasizes that its decision does not mean the UK has four &#8216;guaranteed&#8217; years in the clear. On the contrary, it says it will &#8220;continue to monitor the legal situation in the UK and could intervene at any point, if the UK deviates from the level of protection currently in place&#8221;.</p>
<p>Third countries without an adequacy agreement &#8212; such as the US, which has adequacy twice struck down by Europe&#8217;s top court (after it found US surveillance law incompatible with EU fundamental rights) &#8212; do not enjoy &#8216;seamless&#8217; legal certainty around personal data flows; and must instead take steps to assess each of these transfers individually to determine whether (and how) they can move data legally.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">Last week</a>, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) put out its final bit of guidance for third countries wanting to transfer personal data outside the bloc. And the advice makes it clear that some types of transfers are unlikely to be possible.</p>
<p>For other types of transfers, the advice discusses a number of of supplementary measures (including technical steps like robust encryption) that may be possible for a data controller to use in order to, through their own technical, contractual and organizational effort, ramp up the level of protection to achieve the required standard.</p>
<p>It is, in short, a lot of work. And without today&#8217;s adequacy decision UK businesses would have had to get intimately acquainted with the EDPB&#8217;s guidance. For now, though, they&#8217;ve dodged that bullet.</p>
<p>The qualifier is still very necessary, though, because the UK government has signalled that it intends to rethink data protection.</p>
<p>How exactly it goes about that &#8212; and to what extent it changes the current &#8216;essentially equivalent&#8217; regime &#8212; may make all the difference. For example, Digital minister <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac1cbaef-d8bf-49b4-b11d-1fcc96dde0e1">Oliver Dowden has talked about data being &#8220;a great opportunity&#8221; for the UK</a>, post-Brexit.</p>
<p>And writing in the FT back in February he suggested there will be room for the UK to rewrite its national data protection rules without diverging so much that it puts adequacy at risk. &#8220;We fully intend to maintain those world-class standards. But to do so, we do not need to copy and paste the EU’s rule book, the General Data Protection Regulation, word-for-word,&#8221; he suggested then, adding that: &#8220;Countries as diverse as Israel and Uruguay have successfully secured adequacy with Brussels despite having their own data regimes. Not all of those were identical to GDPR, but equal doesn’t have to mean the same. The EU doesn’t hold the monopoly on data protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>The devil will, as they say, be in the detail. But some <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/994125/FINAL_TIGRR_REPORT__1_.pdf">early signals are concerning</a> &#8212; and the UK&#8217;s startup ecosystem would be well advised to take an active role in impressing upon government the importance to stay aligned with European data standards.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s also the prospect of a legal challenge to the adequacy decision &#8212; even as is, i.e. based on current UK standards (which find <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/B-9-2021-0272_EN.html">plenty of critics</a>). Certainly it can&#8217;t be ruled out &#8212; and the CJEU hasn&#8217;t shied away from quashing other adequacy arrangements it judged to be invalid&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Note that reaching this stage was totally predictable; it was never the data-transfer-compliance supine Commission that was going to take CJEU case-law on this seriously. Only the Court might — the &#39;guardian of the Treaties&#39; has long left the building. The saga continues.</p>
<p>&mdash; Michael Veale (@mikarv) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikarv/status/1409469967620268037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Today, though, the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) has seized the chance to celebrate a PR win, writing that the Commission&#8217;s decision &#8220;rightly recognises the country’s high data protection standards&#8221;.</p>
<p>The department also reiterated the UK government&#8217;s intention to &#8220;promote the free flow of personal data globally and across borders&#8221;, including through what it bills as &#8220;ambitious new trade deals and through new data adequacy agreements with some of the fastest growing economies&#8221; &#8212; simultaneously claiming it would do so &#8220;while ensuring people’s data continues to be protected to a high standard&#8221;. Pinky promise.</p>
<p>&#8220;All future decisions will be based on what maximises innovation and keeps up with evolving tech,&#8221; the DCMS added in a press release. &#8220;As such, the government’s approach will seek to minimise burdens on organisations seeking to use data to tackle some of the most pressing global issues, including climate change and the prevention of disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, Dowden also made a point of combining both streams, saying: &#8220;We will now focus on unlocking the power of data to drive innovation and boost the economy while making sure we protect people’s safety and privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>UK business and tech associations were just as quick to welcome the Commission&#8217;s adequacy decision. The alternative would of course have been very costly disruption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement, John Foster, director of policy for the Confederation of British Industry, said: “This breakthrough in the EU-UK adequacy decision will be welcomed by businesses across the country. The free flow of data is the bedrock of the modern economy and essential for firms across all sectors– from automotive to logistics &#8212; playing an important role in everyday trade of goods and services. This positive step will help us move forward as we develop a new trading relationship with the EU.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In another supporting statement, Julian David, CEO of techUK, added: “Securing an EU-UK adequacy decision has been a top priority for techUK and the wider tech industry since the day after the 2016 referendum. The decision that the UK’s data protection regime offers an equivalent level of protection to the EU GDPR is a vote of confidence in the UK’s high data protection standards and is of vital importance to UK-EU trade as the free flow of data is essential to all business sectors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The data adequacy decision also provides a basis for the UK and EU to work together on global routes for the free flow of data with trust, building on the G7 Digital and Technology declaration and possibly unlocking €2TR of growth. The UK must also now move to complete the development of its own international data transfer regime in order to allow companies in the UK not just to exchange data with the EU but also to be able to access opportunities across the world.”</p>
<p>The Commission has actually adopted two UK adequacy decisions today &#8212; one under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and another for the Law Enforcement Directive.</p>
<p>Discussing key elements in its decision to grant the UK adequacy, EU lawmakers highlighted the fact the UK&#8217;s (current) system is based upon transposed European rules; that access to personal data by public authorities in the UK (such as for national security reasons) is done under a framework that has what it dubbed as &#8220;strong safeguards&#8221; (such as intercepts being subject to prior authorisation by an independent judicial body; measures needing to be necessary and proportionate; and redress mechanisms for those who believe they are subject to unlawful surveillance).</p>
<p>The Commission also noted that the UK is subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights; must adhere <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">to the </span>European Convention of Human Rights;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/108">Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; aka &#8220;the only binding international treaty in the area of data protection&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;These international commitments are an essential elements of the legal framework assessed in the two adequacy decisions,&#8221; the Commission notes. </span></p>
<p>Data transfers for the purposes of UK immigration control have been excluded from the scope of the adequacy decision adopted under the GDPR &#8212; with the Commission saying that&#8217;s &#8220;in order to reflect a recent judgment of the England and Wales Court of Appeal on the validity and interpretation of certain restrictions of data protection rights in this area&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission will reassess the need for this exclusion once the situation has been remedied under UK law,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>So, again, there&#8217;s another caveat right there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Korber and his asthmatic and pregnant wife were looking to buy a house in Israel. As an environmental engineer, he knows that air pollution is the leading environmental cause of premature death, can cause premature birth, and can account for other respiratory diseases. Korber started looking for the city with the least amount of pollution in Israel only to realize that this information didn’t exist. His frustration led him to create what today is <a href="https://www.breezometer.com/">BreezoMeter</a>, a tool that forecasts 40 pollutants within the categories of pollen, air pollution, wildfires and weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the company announced a $30 million Series C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">led by Fortissimo Capital, bringing its total raised to date to $45 million. The company is based in Israel and launched in June of 2014, about two years after Korber was house-hunting with his wife.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deep Science: Keeping AI honest in medicine, climate science and vision&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/deep-science-keeping-ai-honest-in-medicine-climate-science-and-vision/embed/#?secret=zcojVHVNvp" data-secret="zcojVHVNvp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In many countries, people don’t have a clue about the air around them,” Korber, now CEO and co-founder of BreezoMeter, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BreezoMeter uses AI and machine learning to gather and understand data from multiple sources, including more than 47,000 sensors worldwide. The result is street-level air quality resolution (within 16.5 ft) and pollen, pollutants, and fire data, in more than 100 countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably didn’t know this, but if you have an Apple Watch or an iPhone, they both have BreezoMeter built into the Apple weather app. Scroll down on the weather of any city, and the air quality measure is presented by BreezoMeter. In the U.S., the Air Quality Index (AQI) uses a scale from 0-500, 0 being the cleanest. Here in Miami, the air quality was 36 (good) yesterday, and 51 (moderate) today. In comparison, New York City’s air is 34 (good) today, better than Miami’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BreezoMeter is not only able to measure current air quality, but it can forecast it, too, allowing people to better prepare depending on their sensitivities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are able to forecast when the conditions for pollen season will start, and then [we] can forecast how pollen may move between two different locations,” said Korber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure of your sensitivities, knowing the air quality of where you are, you can at least keep a lookout for symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Depending on the type of pollutant in the air, BreezoMeter can also tell you the possible symptoms you may start feeling if exposed,” Korber said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge isn’t just the pollution itself, but also a large information gap regarding air quality. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), about 120 million people in the U.S. live in areas where there is no pollution monitoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before BreezoMeter, everyone used the data from the same sensors, and now we collect data from those sensors plus others including traffic data, wildfires, satellites, local sensors and we also take into account land use for pollen,” said Korber.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VDtTTE5tFX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/whats-behind-this-years-boom-in-climate-tech-spacs/">What&#8217;s behind this year&#8217;s boom in climate tech SPACs?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What&#8217;s behind this year&#8217;s boom in climate tech SPACs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/whats-behind-this-years-boom-in-climate-tech-spacs/embed/#?secret=VDtTTE5tFX" data-secret="VDtTTE5tFX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A time when sensors can easily get destroyed is during a wildfire. “The sensors can burn, literally,” Korber said. To circumvent this problem, BreezoMeter relies on its other multitude of sensors for the data, including those from satellites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every day, more than 300 million people use our platform to make informed decisions on how to avoid environmental hazards,” said Korber, and not everyone is using just the weather app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, they may be benefiting from BreezoMeter from within <a href="https://www.propellerhealth.com/">Propeller by Resmed</a>. Propeller is a device that, depending on the air quality, tells a patient what to do to improve their health, such as close a window or use an inhaler, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to BreezoMeter, since Propeller incorporated BreezoMeter into its product, Propeller’s patients have experienced about 50% fewer asthma attacks and reduced ER visits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BreezoMeter plans to use the money from the current raise to develop more product categories and triple its team to about 120 people.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>As you are reading this, I&#8217;ll be preparing to head out for an adventure, joining thousands of others who plan to jump in their cars, trucks, SUVs, and of course, vans and RVs for the great American road trip. While much of my time will be spent hiking in more remote wilderness, I will end up in Yellowstone National Park, which promises to be a busy affair. For those of you who are shaking your heads wondering why I would subject myself to the masses, I say consider this fun tidbit: According to one local guidebook, 98% of visitors to Yellowstone can be found within one mile of any trailhead. My previous anecdotal experiences supports this stat; I&#8217;ve found that most stick to their cars, paved paths, overlooks and boardwalks. I will not be.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I will, however, make one exception while I&#8217;m in the park. I plan to check out the autonomous shuttle that will be piloted in the park. Beep, in partnership with Local Motors, will be operating the autonomous shuttle called T.E.D.D.Y., which stands for The Electric Driverless Demonstration in Yellowstone. T.E.D.D.Y. is meant to give homage to former President Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The company plans to operate two routes, seven days a week. Information collected during the pilot will be used to inform future deployments in national parks across the country.</p>
<p><em>Happy trails.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a week of funding announcements and new vehicles in the micromobility world. Two of the e-scooter giants, <strong>Spin</strong> and <strong>Bird</strong>, have announced some fresh launches. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/ford-micromobility-subsidiary-spin-launches-first-in-house-built-e-scooter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin’s got its first in-house designed and built electric scooter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which it’s calling the S-100T. The T is for “tough,” which is how Spin is positioning this scooter. It can get beat up on the streets, and in testing, and still last up to three years, maybe even more. Spin will start rolling out its scooter when it launches in Sacramento in July.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird is launching some e-bikes to its fleet of e-scooters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will start in Cleveland, Ohio later this year. Bird’s choice to become multi-modal happens at a time when its biggest competitor, <strong>Lime</strong>, has already had bikes and is now working with e-mopeds. Bird is also launching a ‘Smart Bikeshare’ platform, wherein local shared e-bike and e-moped (but NOT e-scooter) operators can put their vehicles on the Bird app, thus making it seem like Bird has more of a multi-modal fleet than it does, and giving the local operators some more clout and attention. </span></p>
<p><b>Following the money</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of local operators, micromobility software provider <strong>Joyride</strong> believes more small shared e-scooter and e-bike businesses are cropping up, especially in areas where Bird and Lime pulled out during the pandemic. To help those companies get a fleet, launch it and manage it is Joyride. The company has been around since 2014, but </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/micromobility-software-provider-joyride-raises-3-7-million-seed-round/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just raised a $3.7 million seed round so that it can expand its services and help reach more local operators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while we’re on the subject of funding, New Zealand-based electric utility bike startup <strong>Ubco</strong> has just raised $10 million to fund its global expansion, with a focus on the U.S. market, and scale up its commercial subscription business. Full disclosure, I’m currently in Auckland testing one of these things out and it’s “smooth as,” as the Kiwis say, so keep your eyes out for a review of the bike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ubco 2X2 vehicle, which looks like a dirt bike and rides like a moped, started as a way to get farmers around the pasture, but the founders soon saw the utility vehicle’s utility beyond the farm. Now, the company supplies bikes to enterprise fleets, mail services, logistics and more. Ubco is working on a subscription model to make it easier for customers to rent a vehicle with no commitment, and easier for the company to own vehicle end-of-life in a sustainable way. </span></p>
<p><b>Safety first</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tier Mobility</strong>, the Berlin-based e-scooter company that recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/dott-lime-and-tier-selected-for-london-e-scooter-trial/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won one of the London permits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and signed on some </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$60 million worth of debt from Goldman Sachs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has published an e-scooter safety </span><a href="https://www.tier.app/wp-content/uploads/TIER-UK-Safety-Board-Interim-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company formed a group called the Tier UK Safety Board in conjunction with charities and transport experts, Tier says. The group is calling for higher safety standards across the sector to protect pedestrians and improve rider safety, particularly for those who are blind or partially sighted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Might this report just be a ploy for Tier to flex its safety records? Probably, but are the safety suggestions this group is likely trying to make into law also stuff that Tier already does? Also, yes, probably. Here are the things: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operators should be required to use </span><a href="https://www.tier.app/tier-partners-with-fantasmo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more sophisticated parking tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that doesn’t rely solely on GPS so e-scooters don’t become an obstacle (See: </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=blind+person+e-scooter+injury&amp;oq=blind+person+e-scooter+injury&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160.6159j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partially sighted woman trips on scooter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>

<p>It&#8217;s been a SPAC-tacular week. Yes, I went there.</p>
<p>SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, have received a lot of attention in this newsletter. And that&#8217;s because the financial instrument, which allows a faster but more expensive path to an IPO, has inundated the transportation sector. Some 22 mobility SPACs occurred in 2020 with the majority of them involving electric vehicle manufacturers like the troubled Nikola Motors and Lordstown Motors, as well as Canoo, which has had its own drama, and Fisker.</p>
<p>In 2021, we&#8217;ve seen aviation-related companies take the SPAC plunge along with lidar companies and autonomous vehicle startups. This week, we had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/lidar-company-quanergy-to-go-public-via-1-4b-spac-deal/">solid state lidar company <strong>Quanergy</strong></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/autonomous-trucking-startup-embark-to-go-public-in-5-2b-spac-deal/">self-driving trucks startup <strong>Embark</strong></a> make SPAC deals.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>BMW’s</strong> Silicon Valley-based venture capital arm is investing in <strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, a company that develops autonomous trucking technology. While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Kodiak told TechCrunch that BMW&#8217;s investment was financial, not strategic, meaning there&#8217;s no technical partnership between the two companies.</p>

<p><strong>Holy Grail</strong>, a two-year-old startup based in Mountain View, California that is taking a micro approach to solving the outsized problem of capturing carbon, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/holy-grail-raises-2-7m-seed-fund-to-create-modular-carbon-capture-devices/">raised $2.7 million in seed funding</a> from LowerCarbon Capital, Goat Capital, Stripe founder Patrick Collison, Charlie Songhurst, Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, Songkick co-founder Ian Hogarth, Starlight Ventures and 35 Ventures. Existing investors Deep Science Ventures, Y Combinator and Oliver Cameron, who co-founded Voyage, the autonomous vehicle acquired by Cruise, also participated.</p>
<p><strong>IoTecha</strong>, an electric vehicle charging company, has raised $13.2 million in a round led by BP Ventures. The venture firm invested $7 million into the fund. IoTecha connects EV chargers with the electricity grid through its software platform. Their product allows private and fleet vehicles from any manufacturer to communicate with charging stations to signal when they need recharging. It works by gathering information over time, identifying patterns and the energy requirements of each user across all forms of EV charging. IoTecha said that it will use the investment to scale its technology throughout BP&#8217;s electrification network.</p>
<p><strong>Lendbuzz</strong>, an auto finance platform, has raised $360 million in capital and debt. The $60 million in funding was led by Wellington Management joined by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co and MUFG Innovation Partners. The $300 million in debt financing was led by Goldman Sachs Bank USA. The company, which sells its loan origination and servicing software to dealerships, said it will use the funds to continue its expansion in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Nikola Corporation </strong>is <a href="https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-invests-50-million-in-wabash-valley-resources-to-produce-clean-hydrogen-in-the-midwest-for-zero-emission-nikola-trucks-122">investing $50 million</a> in cash and stock in exchange for a 20% equity in a clean hydrogen project being developed by Wabash Valley Resources LLC. The project will use solid-waste and biomass to produce hydrogen for transportation fuel and electricity generation. Pablo Koziner, Nikola&#8217;s President of Energy and Commercial, said in a press release that the project should support future truck sales and the rollout of hydrogen stations throughout the Midwest.</p>
<p><strong>Sendle</strong>, a shipping carrier that uses carbon offsetting to run carbon neutral operations for small businesses, has raised a $35 million Series C. The round was led by AP Ventures, with participation from existing investors including Federation, Full Circle and NRMA. Sendle said it would use the funds to expand its operations in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> reached a deal to become the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/uber-to-become-the-sole-owner-of-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/"> sole owner of Latin American delivery startup Cornershop</a>, one year after acquiring a majority stake in the company. Uber is acquiring the remaining 47% interest in Cornershop in exchange for 29 million shares.

<p>Hi folks, welcome back to Policy Corner. We&#8217;ve got a short one this week but I promise the piece of news is a big one.</p>
<p><strong>President Joe Biden </strong>and a group of Senators have struck a deal on a massive infrastructure bill after months of debate. The $1.2 trillion agreement touches nearly all traditional forms of infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and railways – but it also includes some funds for electric transportation.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this was one of the major sources of disagreement among lawmakers, so the funds for these initiatives is far, far less than what Biden originally proposed when he introduced the bill in March. He originally included new rebates for EV purchases, a proposal that’s been wiped from the new bill.</p>
<p>However, the bill does earmark $7.5 billion for electric buses and $7.5 billion to build out EV charging stations. While this is perhaps less than what advocates had been hoping for (and truthfully just a sliver of the original proposal), it’s still a big improvement from last year’s spending on such initiatives.</p>

<p>As per ushe, there is a lot of news. Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aurora</strong><strong>&#8216;s </strong>Board of Directors gained a new member: Sonos&#8217; chief financial officer Brittany Bagley. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/welcoming-sonos-cfo-brittany-bagley-to-auroras-board">in a blog post</a> that she brings &#8220;a keen understanding of how to ship industry-defining products and a strong sense of fiscal stewardship.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Plus </strong>has hired Lynn Miller as General Counsel. Miller was formerly the Deputy General Counsel at Tesla, where she led Tesla&#8217;s privacy program, handled government inquiries and investigations, and led its litigation strategy. Prior to working at Tesla, Miller was part of Apple&#8217;s litigation team. </span></p>
<p><strong>Pony.ai </strong>is considering going public, company CEO James Peng <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-toyota-backed-self-driving-startup-ponyai-considers-going-public-2021-06-25/">told Reuters</a> on Friday. The company also announced that Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase, would join as chief financial officer. The autonomous tech unicorn has operated robotaxis with human safety drivers in Irvine, California as well as China.</p>
<p><strong>Volvo&#8217;s </strong>flagship electric SUV, which will debut in 2022, will be outfitted with <strong>Luminar&#8217;s </strong>autonomous driving stack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/volvos-flagship-electric-suv-will-come-with-luminars-lidar-and-software-as-standard/">as standard</a>. When the two companies announced the partnership last year, the arrangement was that customers would have to pay extra for Luminar&#8217;s system. No longer! But customers will have to pay to access the Highway Pilot functionality, which takes drivers &#8216;out of the loop&#8217; on highway roads once conditions are verified as safe.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Electric Last Mile Solutions</strong>, a company that manufactures and sells electric vans and trucks to fleet customers, is heading to the Nasdaq on Monday. ELMS is merging with special purpose acquisition company Forum Merger III Corporation in a SPAC deal valued at $1.4 billion. The SPAC transaction, which was announced last December, will give ELMS $379 million in gross cash proceeds, including $155 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding from private investors BNP Paribas Asset Management and Jennison Associates. The company will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “ELMS.”</p>
<p><strong>Panasonic </strong>divested the entirety of its Tesla stock last fiscal year for around $3.61 billion, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-unloads-entire-Tesla-stake">Nikkei Asia reported</a>. Panasonic is Tesla&#8217;s electric-vehicle battery supplier for its Nevada Gigafactory, and the two companies have had a partnership going back over a decade. An executive for the Japanese company told Nikkei that that relationship &#8220;will not change going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span class="il">Toyota </span></strong>has entered into an intended partnership <strong><span class="il">VivoPower </span></strong><span class="il">to use</span> its electrical vehicle convertor kits in <span class="il">Toyota</span> LandCruisers. Through the deal, VivoPower will have exclusivity for the electrification of LandCruisers for five years. This is the first time Toyota has approved an external drive train supplier since Tesla in 2011. The conversion kits will be designed and manufactured by <span class="il">VivoPower</span> subsidiary <strong>Tembo e-LV B.V. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Revel&#8217;s </strong>plans to deploy a fleet of ride-hailing Teslas may have hit a major block after New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted against issuing new for-hire vehicle licenses to EVs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546955/nyc-tlc-electric-vehicle-license-taxi-vote-revel-tesla">The Verge&#8217;s Andrew Hawkins said</a> the vote was seen as a snub toward the startup. Revel was planning on launching a ride-hailing service using a fleet of Tesla Model Ys.</p>
<h2>Other bits</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ryder System</strong>, a company that offers heavy-duty truck rentals to commercial fleet customers, was hacked last December. In <a href="https://ago.vermont.gov/blog/2021/06/08/ryder-system-inc-notice-of-data-breach-to-consumers/">a letter</a> posted to Vermont’s Attorney General website, the Miami-based company said it was notifying 3,563 individuals of the “unauthorized intrusion.” Customers’ driver’s license numbers, social security numbers (which I&#8217;m told by TechCrunch writer Zack Whittaker is highly unusual), and other identifying information was potentially involved in the data breach. </span></p>
<p><strong>Porsche </strong>is going into the battery business. The automaker announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/porsche-to-make-high-performance-batteries-in-joint-venture-with-customcells/">a new joint venture</a> with <strong>Customcells</strong> to open a 100 megawatt-hours battery manufacturing plant in Germany. For reference, that&#8217;s enough batteries for around 1,000 vehicles. The batteries will be manufactured for Porsche&#8217;s line of racing and high-performance vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drink making probably isn’t at the top of your list of jobs most likely to be fully automated. The past year-and-a-half have, however, brought into stark relief how large a role robotics could play in the food service industry. I’ve said it time and again on these pages, but the appeal is clear: Robots don’t get sick and they don’t spread diseases the way we human Petri dishes tend to.</p>
<p>There’s been no shortage of investments in the category, and today <a href="https://www.botrista.co/">Botrista</a> (robotic barista, get it?) joins the list with a $10 million Series A. The round was co-led by Purestone Capital and La Kaffa and featured the Sony Innovation Fund, Middleby Corporation and PIDC. It follows a $4 million seed round, bringing the startup’s funding to date to around $16 million.</p>
<p>The company’s premier product is the simply named Drinkbot (Botrista, it seems, is enough pun name to go around). The latest version of the robotic drink mixing system features a refrigerated base with up to eight ingredients, a touchscreen control panel and 14 separate nozzles for dispensing the mixed beverages. The entire process runs around 20 seconds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by former Tesla engineer Sean Hsu, the company will be using the funding to expand the robot’s footprint across the U.S. on the heels of some pandemic-related transformations to the food service industry.</p>
<p>“In 2020, fountain drink sales were down considerably as consumers rapidly switched their drink preferences and were less likely to order fountain drinks during take-out or delivery,” Hsu said in a press release tied to the round.</p>
<p>Miso Robotics, notably, announced their own plans to release a fountain drink-based robotic system last week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getthursday.com">Thursday</a>, a dating app that wants to solve problems created by, well, too much time spent using dating apps, had raised a £2.5 million (~$3.5M) seed investment &#8212; a few months after launching (in May) its single-matching service in London and New York (and racking up over 52k downloads).</p>
<p>Last Thursday (June 17) it says that 110,000 likes were sent, resulting in 7,500 matches in a single day. How many actual dates occurred isn&#8217;t something it&#8217;s able to report, though.</p>
<p>The seed is double their initial target, with financing coming from Ascension Ventures, Best Nights VC (previously M-Venture) the investment arm of Jägermeister, Connect Ventures, plus early backers of CityMapper, TypeForm and FIIT (processed via SeedLegals).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notable angels backing the dating platform include Tom Blomfield, founder of Monzo; Matt Robinson, founder of GoCardless and Nested; Ian Hogarth, founder of Songkick; Eldar Tuvey, founder of Wandera and Henry de Zoute, founder of LookAfterMyBills.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meme-based dating is here: Meet Schmooze&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/a-new-dating-app-schmooze-matches-people-based-on-their-affinity-for-memes/embed/#?secret=8RW5PHSV0k" data-secret="8RW5PHSV0k" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So what&#8217;s Thursday&#8217;s twist in a highly competitive space? The clue is in the name: This dating app is only live for one day per week.</p>
<p>Specifically the app opens for usage at 00.01 each Thursday morning so swiping is compressed into a few hours. All matches and conversations vanish at midnight. Hence users are pushed to act quickly &#8212; and &#8220;be a bit spontaneous&#8221;, as it puts it &#8212; if they want to get a date that night.</p>
<p>Profiles are thus fairly basic. Users can upload five photos (either from social media apps like Facebook or their phone&#8217;s camera roll) &#8212; and share some &#8220;topline information&#8221; about themselves.</p>
<p>The app also prompts them to answer a few questions &#8212; to give a flavor of their personality. And there&#8217;s a &#8216;Stories&#8217; style feature to further show off who they are (again that content deletes after 24 hours).</p>
<p>Matches are based on what Thursday says is a &#8220;rough location&#8221; &#8212; so users being matched are able to figure out a convenient place to meet up. (The app specifies that users&#8217; exact location is never shared.)</p>
<p>Thursday users are encouraged to only log on in the morning if they are free that evening to go out on a date.</p>
<p>Matches are also limited to x10 people a day &#8212; to avoid users just trying to maximize their chances by swiping to match with every user they see.</p>
<p>By putting some hard (time) limits on usage, Thursday&#8217;s pitch is that service scarcity can fix some of the problematic issues of overuse which can plague dating apps &#8212; leading to dating indecision and swipe fatigue. And, well, just waste a lot of people&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>It also reckons that by giving users a limited &#8212; one day per week &#8212; chance to book a date it can put some of the excitement back into digital dating. Which can otherwise, at times, feel pretty transactional.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, co-founder George Rawlings said: “Just four weeks into launching and we&#8217;re delighted to have a number of notable investors on board who really believe in our vision and back this app. We&#8217;ve got big plans with a clear mission, to change a culture of how people date. This is just the start and we will deliver. Dating apps just got exciting again.”</p>
<p>Flush with 2x the amount of seed funding they had initially planned to raise, Thursday&#8217;s team intends to step on the gas &#8212; and, well, there&#8217;s no way to patent this kind of idea so they will need to move quickly to stay ahead of any fast-follows.</p>
<p>No surprise then that the plan for the seed funding includes hiring a head of growth and a head of marketing, in addition to other senior roles and a number of tech hires &#8212; and coming up with what they dub as a &#8220;six figure marketing strategy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Expanding the app to other cosmopolitan cities elsewhere is also on the roadmap. But for now Thursday is only available for singles in London and New York.</p>
<p>Dating apps are already a diverse bunch &#8212; catering to all sorts of priorities, communities and kinks, including by applying various creative twists in the name of helping users find a match (such as by limiting who can send the first message; or hiding selfies until a few messages have been exchanged to push beyond superficial swiping).</p>
<p>Time limits on usage is another interesting idea. Albeit, how this type of &#8216;demand manipulation&#8217; might affect the resulting dating power dynamics remains to be seen. And it seems noteworthy that the founders are both male.</p>
<p>“This is the first version of Thursday and it&#8217;s definitely not perfect so in the short term we are going to use this time to tighten up the app, introduce some new features and continue to develop our matching algorithm to make it the most efficient and intuitive matching system on the market,&#8221; added co-founder Matt McNeill Love in another statement. &#8220;We’re also going to be introducing a not been done before, revolutionary feature, which will really assist with matches resulting in dates.”</p>
<p>Given the accelerated usage timeframe and the vanishing messages Thursday clearly needs to pay careful attention to user security.</p>
<p>On this front it says all users are verified before they join &#8212; either by uploading their passport or driving license. It also says it takes abusive messages &#8220;extremely seriously&#8221; and does not tolerate hate speech, such as racism, body shaming or misogyny.</p>
<p>The pledge is that any such abusive users will be blocked and unable to return.</p>
<p>While the USP of the app is a &#8216;one day a week&#8217; limit there is, of course, an option to pay to get a little more access.</p>
<p>Thursday says there are &#8220;a limited number&#8221; of VIP memberships available.</p>
<p>Users who choose to shell out a monthly fee will get their profiles boosted all day (&#8220;x60 increased visibility&#8221;); be able to send unlimited likes; and be able to unlock Saturday usage&#8230; albeit on the bonus day they are presumably limited to the pool of other VIP users as non-paying users are locked out til Thursday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once heralded as disruptive marketplaces, classifieds are giving way to transactional marketplaces. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, some classifieds in the West like eBay have evolved with time, acquiring competition operating both models</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, this occurrence is happening in part, at least for the classifieds businesses that haven&#8217;t fizzled out</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://jiji.ng/">Jiji</a>, one of the largest marketplaces for classifieds in Africa, is an example. Today, the company is announcing the acquisition of transactional car marketplace <a href="https://www.cars45.com/">Cars45</a> for an undisclosed amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news is important for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">many</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons. But before we get to that, Cars45 has been under different ownership within the past three years that people might have lost track of how many times the company was sold. So it&#8217;s important to clear that up.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Cars45<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/1483520/"> raised $5 million from Frontier Car Group (FCG)</a>, the Berlin-based company that builds used-car marketplaces focusing on emerging markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This made FCG the largest shareholder and parent company in the Nigerian car business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years later, FCG <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/olx-group-invests-up-to-400m-in-used-car-marketplace-frontier-car-group-at-700m-valuation/">received $400 million</a> from OLX Group (a division of Prosus, the Netherlands-based separate tech holdings of South African tech giant Naspers). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment valued FCG at $700 million, with OLX Group taking a controlling stake. In 2020, OLX Group, via its OLX Autos brand, acquired Cars45 from FCG</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>OLX Autos shut down FCG&#8217;s operations in Berlin this March but still kept control of Cars45 and two other brands<span style="font-weight: 400;">: CarFirst in Pakistan and WeBuyAnyCar in the U.S. However, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/prosus-classifieds-group-olx-shuts-down-berlins-frontier-car-group-to-focus-olx-autos-on-latam-and-asia/">announcement</a> stated that OLX Autos&#8217; new focus was on Asia and Latin America, which indicated plans to sell Cars45. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">today&#8217;s news, it seems OLX Group might have washed its hands of most of its businesses in African markets, except South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. OLX Group did not immediately respond to a TechCrunch request for comment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, this is not the first time Jiji and OLX have done business. In 2019, the Naspers-owned online marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/consolidation-in-africa-as-classifieds-player-jiji-acquires-their-main-competitor-olx/">sold its assets</a> in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to the seven-year-old classifieds player. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Jiji now commands 10 million unique monthly visits and three million active listings, according to the company stats</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s get to why the acquisition is important.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a call with TechCrunch, co-founder and board member Vladimir Mnogoletniy noted that vehicles listing is the second most popular category on Jiji.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the acquisition will see Cars45 grow the vehicles category. Furthermore, cars45 will merge its operations in Nigeria (primary market), Ghana and Kenya with Jiji as the classifieds marketplace wants to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its position in the space. In addition, the acquisition of Cars45 will help mitigate problematic trust and safety concerns that have sometimes plagued Jiji and offer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a different car buying and selling experience via its transactional marketplace model. In turn,  Cars45 users will benefit from Jiji’s dominance in online classifieds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will integrate this into one company because this acquisition has a lot of benefits for both. It&#8217;s a very common practice when marketplace and transactional business models work together as one project,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Anton Volyansky said regarding the integration of both platforms. &#8220;For instance, a seller of a car, it&#8217;s convenient to sell both ways via a marketplace or auction model. So, it would be like a seamless process for selling the car.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiji CFO David Ojo, Cars45&#8217;s key value is its network of inspection centres where cars </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are inspected by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than 200 parameters</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike a classifieds marketplace where checks are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inadequately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carried out, transactional models employed by platforms like Cars45 ensure quality checks and detailed reports on a car&#8217;s condition with various databases.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception in 2014, Jiji is for the first time exploring a business outside its usual classifieds model, which has brought it profitability according to the company. Volyansky calls it a bold step and an important foundation &#8220;for building the future of the company.&#8221; But of course, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> future isn&#8217;t void of competition. In fact, it gets more intricate as time goes on. Right now, Jiji has regional competitors in Swiss-owned ROAM and Jumia Deals, and horizontally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/">Autochek</a>. Yet, Volyansky believes the acquisition of Cars45 might be the first of many transactional marketplace acquisitions to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set Jiji apart from other players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> classifieds, we&#8217;re looking at opportunities, but we are already a leader in Africa, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s very limited space for whom to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interested in deals like Cars45, where we bring our leadership positions from classifieds and acquire very close business models that give us exposure to the transactional marketplace. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for us, a major interest will be to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adjacent business models,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; he explained.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soumobroto </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ganguly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO of Cars45, commented: &#8220;We are proud to have built a trusted buying and selling experience in autos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It makes sense to combine online and offline expertise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merging with Jiji </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is aimed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at creating a new kind of automotive retail experience for users in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are confident of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">jointly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building an African Champion in the O2O Automotive Sector</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.voyagerinnovation.com/about-us">Voyager Innovations</a>, the Manila-based owner of <a href="https://www.paymaya.com/">PayMaya</a>, one of the Philippines’ most popular payment and financial services apps, announced today it has raised $167 million in new funding to launch more financial services, including a digital bank.</p>
<p>The raise includes $121 million in new funding, and $46 million from previously committed funds. Voyager <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/voyager-innovations-funding-183208/">announced</a> in April 2020 that it had secured up to $120 million in investment commitments from PLDT, KKR, Tencent, the International Finance Group (IFC) and the IFC Emerging Asia Fund.</p>
<p>The latest capital came from existing shareholders PLDT, one of the country’s largest telecoms, KKR and Tencent, and new investors including IFC Financial Institutions Growth Fund, managed by IFC AMC, a member of the World bank Group (another one of Voyager’s investors).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Voyager’s total raised since 2018 now stands at $452 million.</p>
<p>Along with competitors GCash and Coins, PayMaya is one of the most popular financial “super apps” in the Philippines. Its services include a digital wallet, online remittances, bill payments, bank transfers, prepaid cards and an e-commerce feature called PayMaya Mall that connects consumers to 350 merchants.</p>
<p>In its funding announcement today, Voyager said it has applied for a digital bank license with Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Philippines’ central bank. A representative for the Voyager said the neobank will launch about six months after Voyager secures its license.</p>

<p>PayMaya has more than 250,000 digital-finance access touchpoints, like convenience stores, where users can top-up their accounts. Voyager says this is seven times the number of ATM and bank branches in the Philippines, making PayMaya more accessible than traditional banks, especially in remote or rural areas.</p>
<p>According to the BSP, <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Inclusive%20Finance/Financial%20Inclusion%20Reports%20and%20Publications/2019/2019FISToplineReport.pdf">about 71% of Filipinos were unbanked as of 2019</a>. The BSP has set <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Media_And_Research/Primers%20Faqs/Digital%20Payments%20Transformation%20Roadmap%20Report.pdf">financial inclusion goals it wants to achieve by 2023</a>, including onboarding 70% of Filipino adults to payment or transaction accounts, and converting 50% of total retail payments into digital form.</p>
<p>PayMaya and Smart Padala by PayMaya, its remittance service, claim its total registered users doubled over 18 months to 38 million as of June 2021. This year, Voyager also began expanding PayMaya’s services with working capital loans for micro- to mid-sized businesses through PayMaya Lending Corp, and PayMaya Protect insurance policies for health coverage and devices.</p>

In Southeast Asia, startups in this space that have raised funding over the past few months include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indonesian-robo-advisor-app-bibit-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Bibit</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/robo-advisor-stashaway-gets-25m-series-d-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Stashaway</a>—and that’s just a (very) partial list. Now <a href="https://infina.vn/">Infina</a>, which calls itself the “Robinhood of Vietnam,” is announcing an oversubscribed $2 million seed round.</p>
<p>The seed funding, which was made in two closes, included participation from Saison Capital, Venturra Discovery, 1982 Ventures, 500 Startups, Nextrans, and angel investors like executives at Google and Netflix.</p>
<p>Infina launched its app in January 2021. Most of its users are between the ages of 25 to 40 and looking for alternatives to investing in long-term asset classes like real estate. The app requires a minimum contribution of about $25 USD and lets investors pick from assets including savings accounts, term deposits, fractionalized real estate and mutual funds, which founder and chief executive officer James Vuong told TechCrunch is currently the most popular asset class among Infina’s users. Infina works with financial partners like Dragon Capital, ACB Capital, Mirae Asset Fund Management and Viet Capital Asset Management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company notes that <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/companies/hose-profits-soar-as-trading-accounts-surge-4282277.html">only about 3.2% of people in Vietnam have invested in stocks</a>. But <a href="https://cafef.vn/nha-dau-tu-trong-nuoc-mo-moi-ky-luc-gan-114000-tai-khoan-chung-khoan-trong-thang-5-20210602124523717.chn">according to the Vietnams Securities Depository</a>, about 500,000 trading accounts were opened during the first five months of 2021, a 20% increase from all of 2020. This, along with Vietnam’s high internet penetration rate (about 70% as of January 2020) and the fact that more than 3/4 of of internet users <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-vietnam">have used online financial services before</a>, lays the groundwork for apps like Infina to take traction.</p>
<p>In statement about its investment, Saison Capital partner Chris Sirise said, “Retail investing in Vietnam is at an inflection point and we have seen multiple other emerging markets reach this break-out point. With an experienced team that is passionate about financial literacy and education, Infina is well-positioned to ride this wave of growth.”</p>
<p>Before founding Infina, Vuong was an engineer in Silicon Valley before returning to Vietnam to serve as vice president of investment and a Kauffman Fellow at IDG Ventures. He also founded a startup called Lana Group that was acquired by Line Group. Vuong told TechCrunch he believes Vietnam is entering a “‘golden decade’ of hyper uninterrupted growth as other Asian Tigers have had in the past,” and created Infina to gives retail investors a chance to partake in Vietnam’s financial trajectory.</p>

<p>While at home during various stages of lockdown in Vietnam, Vuong said many internet users began switching to digital services, including for investments. He added that a series of interest rate cuts by Vietnam’s Central Bank to help businesses during COVID-19 prompted many retail investors to look for alternatives with higher returns than term deposits.</p>
<p>“A majority of our users are new investors,” said Vuong. “Although they are familiar with savings, fixed income or mutual fund investing are relatively new to them.” The app’s interface and content is geared toward them.</p>
<p>When users register, Infina surveys their risk and return profile, then recommends an asset to begin with. As they continue investing, Infina’s users see information about the risk and return profile of each asset category and the issuer’s profile, investment strategy and historical performance. Like other investment apps with many newer investors, Infina also creates its own educational content, like blog posts, daily newsletters and videos.</p>
<p>“We are very transparent in communications on risk and returns, profits and fees, and that’s our advantage compared to other platforms,” said Vuong. He added that part of the new funding will be used to hire people with technical and investment backgrounds to further develop Infina’s KYC (know your customer) system to better analyze their risk appetite, as well as its system for evaluating each asset class.</p>
<p>Other investment apps in Vietnam include Finhay and Tikop. When asked how Infina differentiates from its competitors, Vuong noted its wide range of asset classes, low minimum and transparency about different types of investments. He added that Infina is not majority owned or tied to a particular issuer, “which allows us to be neutral and work with all of the country’s high-quality fund managers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Slice, an Indian fintech startup that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/slice-raises-6m-to-help-young-indians-pay-digitally-and-build-credit-score/">built a “super card” for millennials in India</a>, said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a new financing round and is adding new features to change how people engage with their credit cards.</p>
<p>Existing investors Gunosy, Blume Ventures and others financed the new round in the Bangalore-headquartered startup, it said.</p>
<p>Even as hundreds of millions of Indians today have a bank account, only about 30 million have a credit card. Most people in the South Asian market are not eligible to get a credit card, and even many of those who are don’t bother to get one because the experience of signing up is too clumsy, time consuming, and the rewards don’t make up for it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.sliceit.com">Slice</a> has made it easier for far more people &#8212; even those without a traditional full-time job &#8212; to get a card, and the signup process doesn’t take forever.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170724" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170724" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170724 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/India-credit-card.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/India-credit-card.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/India-credit-card.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/India-credit-card.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/India-credit-card.jpg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/India-credit-card.jpg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/India-credit-card.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170724" class="wp-caption-text">New credit card additions in India.

<p>Rajan Bajaj, founder and chief executive of Slice, said in an interview with TechCrunch that the startup, which has already amassed over 3 million users, is now bringing rewards to its app as it attempts to turn the plastic card into a larger financial instrument.</p>
<p>“You use your card more often than you use Uber, Ola, Swiggy and Zomato combined. But the payment experience on the card leaves a lot to be desired. Eventually, if customers don’t see a value, they will abandon the card and move elsewhere,” he said.</p>
<p>“Banks treat credit cards like a loan product instead of a high frequency payment instrument and make money through late charges and interest rates. You see a random charge on your credit card statement, you don&#8217;t recognize it so now you have to deal with a customer representative. More than half such users give up and just accept those charges,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are upfront about all of this. There’s no such thing as a joining fee or annual fee for Slice members and there’s no minimum amount they are required to pay each month,” he said, adding that the startup is also profitable. &#8220;As we were building our platform, we recognized that there were many things that a credit card firm engages in that didn&#8217;t make sense for the customers, so we didn&#8217;t include those,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Slice’s eponymous app shows hyperlocal deals from restaurants and also gives back up to 2% cashback on each transaction that is instantly redeemable to cash, he said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170723 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/slice.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="687" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/slice.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/slice.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/slice.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/slice.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/slice.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/slice.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>One of the ideas behind the rewards, said Bajaj, is to have people engage with the app more often so that they know how much money they are spending. Customers can also use the app to make several purchases (for instance, by scanning a QR code).</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the card as a payment product, and we are solving it as a consumer experience problem with a customer first approach in mind,&#8221; he said. Within six months of joining Slice, more than 65% member&#8217;s credit score climbs to 730, he said.</p>
<p>To make it easier for members to pay their bills and not worry about any additional charges, Slice now offers them the ability to split their bill and make the payment in a duration of up to three months &#8212; the longest in the industry &#8212; at no interest.</p>
<p>Slice has also become a formidable rival to established credit card firms in recent years. Bajaj said about 50% of new customers who are joining Slice today hold a credit card from a competing firm, he said. More than half of these customers switch to Slice as their primary card, he added.</p>
<p>“With the new features, which are very competitive, we expect to switch more than 80% of customers who own other cards to use Slice as their primary card in the next six to eight months,” he said, adding that the startup is able to offer better rewards than most credit cards because it spends just a fraction of its rivals in acquiring new customers.</p>
<p>“Our existing customers tell their friends about Slice. We don’t have to stand in malls and airports to advertise our product,” he said.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has significantly shrunk people&#8217;s spending habits and hence hurt several fintech startups. But the Bangalore-based startup said not only has it recovered but it&#8217;s also growing. Slice said the month of May was its best month since inception, and June has shown 25% growth.</p>
<p>The startup, which provides users credit limit through its own balance sheet, said it will deploy the fresh funding into developing more features for customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slice&#8217;s biggest advantage is how well they understand millennials and gen z. Their approach to solving their issues has been truly refreshing and building something simple and hassle-free has been a part of their DNA since inception. The Slice super card has the potential to fundamentally change the way the next generation thinks about the concept of credit cards altogether and we, at Gunosy, are glad to be a part of their growth story,&#8221; said Shinji Kimura, chairman and chief executive of Gunosy, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past couple of years, we&#8217;ve seen a growing trend of creators adopting digital and social media, not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a supplement to their media presence but also as a cornerstone of their personal brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accelerated creator economy trends. Many popular artists and figures have had to postpone concerts and live events, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using social media to carry out these activities and engage their fans. Proliferating through Western and far East markets, the creator economy bug, which has made platforms like Cameo and Patreon unicorns, is beginning to take centre stage in MENA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://minlyapp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Egypt-based creator economy platform, is announcing that it has closed a $3.6 million seed round to allow stars across the MENA region to create authentic, personalized connections with their fans.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, which Minly says was oversubscribed, was co-led by 4DX Ventures, B&amp;Y Venture Partners and Global Ventures. It also included participation from unnamed regional funds and angel investors like Scooter Braun, founder of SB Projects; Jason Finger, co-founder of Seamless and GrubHub; Anthony Saleh and Jeffrey Katzenberg of WndrCo; Arieh Mimran of Groupe Mimran; and Tamim Jabr. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts say time spent viewing social media surpassed time spent viewing TV within the MENA region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But one shortcoming with social media is that its content often feels mass-produced. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When creators make posts, it&#8217;s most times void of personalization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, this dilutes the fan experience and limits the extent and number of ways the creator can monetize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly, founded last year by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/shinnawy">Mohamed El-Shinnawy</a>, Tarek Hosny, Tarek ElGanainy, Ahmed Abbas, and Bassel El-Toukhy,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides tools for creators to craft what it calls &#8216;authentic connections&#8217; with their superfans and audience at scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;In short, our goal is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deliver tens of millions of unique, unforgettable experiences to fans each year,&#8221; El-Shinnawy told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinnawy, who brings more than 15 years of media and technology experience to the table, is the chief technology officer at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He sold his first company, Emerge Technology, to a U.S.-based media company. He has also delivered work for Hollywood’s top studios, such as Sony Pictures, Universal, Disney, Fox and Warner Brothers, while playing a role in the global expansion of Apple TV+, Disney+, and Netflix to the MENA region.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170689" style="width: 354px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170689" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2170689" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-4-1.jpeg?w=453" alt="Minly" width="344" height="516" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-4-1.jpeg 853w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-4-1.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-4-1.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-4-1.jpeg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-4-1.jpeg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-4-1.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170689" class="wp-caption-text">Mohamed El-Shinnawy (co-founder and CTO, Minly)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has experienced rapid growth since launching late last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has more than 50,000 users and an impressive list of popular regional celebrities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranging from actors and athletes like Fifi Abdou and Mahmoud Trezeguet to musicians and internet influencers like Assala Nasri and Tamer Hosny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, users can buy personalized video messages and shoutouts from these celebrities, and they, in turn, connect with their fans on a more personal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we have already differentiated ourselves from other creator economy platforms in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We do this by offering the best catalogue of stars and user experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And our entire team is working hard to grow this gap even further,&#8221; said El-Shinnawy on the crop of celebrities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has onboarded to the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the instances where celebrities connected with their fans on Minly include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ctress and dancer Fifi Abdou <a href="https://minlyapp.com/r/iN0i15BHdYG3mpK8l2MQOkxaUHqo4Hgd">sent a personal message to one of her biggest fans</a> who has Down syndrome and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when Egyptian singer Tamer Hosny <a href="https://minlyapp.com/r/EqlvNlhy1y1QC2drKAsHC4ZXFy50vDkv">made a surprise appearance</a> at two fans&#8217; engagement party in March.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignnone size-large wp-image-2170682" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-3-e1624790775169.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-3-e1624790775169.jpeg 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-3-e1624790775169.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-3-e1624790775169.jpeg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minly-3-e1624790775169.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes a small commission on transactions made through its platform. However, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> majority of the transaction price, a figure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn&#8217;t disclose, goes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to creators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And at the same time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urges celebrities to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> donate a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their earnings to partner charities on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly&#8217;s knack for creating a personalized experience is why Pan-African VC firm 4DX Ventures invested. The firm&#8217;s co-founder and general partner Peter Orth, who will be joining Minly&#8217;s board, said the company is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fundamentally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changing the relationship between celebrities and fans in the MENA region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team has both the ambition and the expertise to build a full-stack digital interaction platform that could change the way digital content </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consumed in the region,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creator economy market surpassed $100 billion in value this year and is still growing at an impressive rate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The pace of content creation will only speed up since surveys suggest that being a YouTuber or TikTokker or the most common term, vlogger, is one the most desirable careers among Gen Zs. VC heavyweights like Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Partners, and Tiger Global have also heralded this growth </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">considerably,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contributing to the more than $2 billion invested in creator economy platforms this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In MENA, there&#8217;s a huge opportunity for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The region has over 450 million people, of which 30% are between the ages of 18 to 30. This demographic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have a deep connection with social media, and El-Shinnawy believes MENA will soon contribute to a large part of the total creator economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the goal is to capture a huge </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of that spend and become a multibillion-dollar, category-leading company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The creator platform has a case to do so. As it stands, the opportunity to build a creator economy one-stop-shop in MENA is huge compared to other regions that already have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entrenched incumbents. Also, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the few platforms in the region with meaningful venture funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The creator economy is in its infancy and growing at lightning speed. We have the opportunity to build this category’s first unicorn in MENA,” the CTO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this investment, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is doubling down on building local celebrity acquisition teams in Egypt and other parts across MENA and the GCC, where it has seen significant traction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will also scale its engineering team to churn out more products to build a horizontal creator platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, there&#8217;s big news with the expansion of Android apps to Windows. Apple also came out swinging against sideloading and expanded its profitable Search Ads business to China&#8230;with more than a few caveats. Meanwhile, TikTok launched its own take on mini-apps after tests, making its videos more interactive.</p>

<p>Microsoft surprised industry observers this week at its Windows 11 event with news that it will make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/android-apps-are-coming-to-windows-11-through-the-amazon-appstore">Android apps available</a> on the next version of its operating system. The apps will run natively on Windows 11 and can be downloaded from Amazon&#8217;s Appstore through the new Windows Store included in the updated OS. They&#8217;ll also be able to be integrated into the Start menu and pinned to the taskbar, and can tile or &#8220;window&#8221; as part of the OS&#8217;s new application placement user interface.</p>
<p>The Amazon partnership will bring increased attention to the Amazon Appstore, whose importance has somewhat fizzled over the years given the general lack of investment and its close ties to Amazon Fire devices, which are <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/tablet/worldwide">outsold</a> by iPad. App developers today tend to focus initially on the App Store and Google Play, not Amazon&#8217;s Appstore. However, bringing some <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266210/number-of-available-applications-in-the-google-play-store/">3 million</a> Android apps to Windows users opens up a huge new potential market for Android. But could it actually make coding for &#8220;iOS first&#8221; less of a given for certain types of applications &#8212; like those that complement the productivity environment enabled by a Windows PC, perhaps?</p>

<p>In the near-term, more consumers may begin to sideload the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get/amazonapp">Amazon Appstore app</a> on their Android devices for their paid app installs in order to gain access to the cross-platform support a Google Play version would not necessarily provide.</p>
<p>Microsoft noted during the event that it&#8217;s partnering with Intel to use its Intel Bridge technology to make this Appstore integration possible on x86 systems. However, the Intel-powered apps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549303/windows-11-intel-bridge-android-apps-amd-arm-processors">will also run on AMD and Arm processors</a>, The Verge noted, though the technical details of how that will work were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Microsoft during the event demonstrated how the app integration would work by showing off TikTok running in a vertical format on the new Windows OS. This may not have been the best example, as TikTok has a fairly usable website for watching videos. Meanwhile, the image of the Amazon Appstore in the Windows Store showed other apps including those from Ring, Uber, Yahoo, Khan Academy, Kindle, Game of War: Fire Age, My Talking Tom Friends, and more, which indicates this is a comprehensive rollout.</p>
<p>Ahead of this news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/19/this-week-in-apps-spotify-debuts-a-clubhouse-rival-facebook-tests-audio-rooms-in-us-amazon-cuts-appstore-commissions/">Amazon announced</a> it would soon lower its cut on app developer revenues from 30% to 20%, as part of a new program for small businesses. The program, which also includes promotional credits for AWS, could help boost developer support for the Appstore. Plus, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store">on the larger Windows Store</a>, non-game developers can keep 100% of their revenue if they use their own payment platforms for in-app purchases. Apps and games using Microsoft&#8217;s payment platform split revenue with the company at 85%/15% and 88%/12%, respectively. This sort of commission structure combined with the introduction of Android apps makes the Windows Store seem more developer-friendly than Apple&#8217;s App Store, which Microsoft likely hopes will keep it out of antitrust crosshairs.</p>
<h3>Apple launches Search Ads in China</h3>
<p>Apple this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/apple-search-ads-china/">brought its search advertising business</a> to China five years after its U.S. debut. The system allows developers to bid on an advertising slot based on keywords users search for in the App Store. Though the move opens up a major new market for app developers, the system in China is fairly complex and comes with several caveats. Developers will need to upload documents, including business licenses and other files, that confirm their account has been approved before being able to run ads. Apple may then submit these documents to third-party databases and government entities for validation.</p>
<p>According to Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://searchads.apple.com/v/help/b/docs/apple-advertising-guidelines-for-mainland-china.pdf">guidelines</a>, the industry-specific licenses required exclude most foreign businesses from directly advertising in mainland China. Instead, they&#8217;ll need to work with local partners who will run ads on their behalf.</p>
<p>The expansion for now only includes the Search Ads in the App Store and not the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/apple-expands-its-ad-business-with-a-new-app-store-ad-slot/">newly added Search Tab ads</a>, where developers can bid on a slot directly on the Search tab in the App Store itself.</p>

<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<p><strong>Apple released iOS 15 beta 2 and iPadOS 15 beta 2 for app developers</strong>. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/24/heres-whats-new-in-ios-15-beta-2-and-ipados-15-beta-2/">New features include</a> support for SharePlay, updated Memoji outfits, a new Maps icon, a welcome screen in the updated Weather app, access to launch Quick Note with a swipe from bottom-right on iPad, Shortcuts improvements, bug fixes for iCloud Private Relay, and more. WatchOS 8 beta 2 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/24/watchos-8-beta-2-developers">was also released</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The iOS 15 beta code also revealed Apple is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/24/ios-15-will-let-users-easily-update-to-a-beta-release-when-restoring-a-device-from-backup/">working on a feature</a> that will allow users to update to a beta release when restoring a device from backup</strong> instead of being told that you can&#8217;t use backups of newer iOS versions.</p>
<p><strong>iOS and iPad apps will now be able to request privileged access to more RAM in iOS 15</strong>, exceeding normal system memory limits, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/25/apps-can-request-access-to-more-ram-with-ios-15-entitlement-exceeding-normal-system-memory-limits">9to5Mac also discovered</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Apple this week published a <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps.pdf">white paper</a> (PDF) where it presents its argument against any legislation that would force the company to allow sideloading of apps on iOS or iPadOS devices outside its App Store</strong>. While there are consumer benefits to allowing for choice &#8212; like getting your hands on apps that don&#8217;t fit Apple&#8217;s rules, for example &#8212; Apple makes the case that sideloading could compromise user privacy and security in a number of ways, including potentially opening up users to being scammed and making it more difficult for parents to lock down kids&#8217; iPhones, among other things. Pirated apps could also eat into legitimate developer revenue, not to mention Apple&#8217;s own. Apple&#8217;s Director of User Privacy Erik Neuenschwander went into further detail with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90649203/apple-iphone-sideloading-safety-apps-tech">Fast Company</a> about Apple&#8217;s position, noting attackers could even trick users into thinking they were downloading from the App Store when they were not.</p>

<p>Alternative browser Brave this week <a href="https://brave.com/brave-search-beta/">introduced</a> its own search service, Brave Search, now available in beta across all platforms &#8212; including web, Android and iOS. The service is different from other search engines because it does not track or profile users, and it leverages its own search index for answering queries instead of relying on other providers. Its ranking algorithms will be community-curated and open. Soon, it will also offer options for both an ad-free paid search and an ad-supported search option, allowing users to decide how they want to proceed.</p>
<p>Brave Search was announced in <a href="https://brave.com/brave-search/">March</a> when Brave acquired Tailcat. The company says the new service will later this year become the default in the Brave browser.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rumor has it, if you whisper mafia to a venture capitalist or tech reporter, a seed investment and headline appears within minutes. That process quickly turns into seconds if the mafia reference includes the letters S, T, R, I, P and E before it.</p>
<p>Tech mafias, otherwise known as a group of early employees within a company who spin out to start their own, independently successful companies, became a popularized term <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/the-rise-of-the-new-crypto-mafias/">thanks to PayPal</a> in the early 2000s. As my lede alludes, the term has since become a cliche of sorts. Everything is a mafia, including you, dear Startups Weekly newsletter subscribers. Jokes aside, I’d argue the term is still a helpful way to track the way talent moves in the ever-growing world of startups.</p>
<p>Many venture capitalists have been making subtle, and not-so-subtle efforts, to back the next cohort of star employees turned star entrepreneurs. Wave Capital originally began as an institutional venture capital fund explicitly for Airbnb alumni starting new companies. Ross Fubini of XYZ Ventures introduced Palantir’s first business hire to its first engineer and now invests in the community out of his fund. Eric Tarczynski of Contrary Capital launched Contrary Talent, a program that helps early career professionals navigate the world of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>This newsletter was going to be about the undercovered mafias that are brewing in tech, but <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1403085207121637376">a recent exchange with some of you on Twitter</a> took me in an entirely new direction. Check out the thread if you want to know the next mafioso, but today, I want to explore a more modern way to think about these entities.</p>
<h3>Glamorization of mafias</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2170445" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170445" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170445" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg 5100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170445" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Britt Erlanson / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Rebekah Bastian, the chief executive and founder of OwnTrail, isn’t the biggest fan of mafias — even though she’s technically a part of one herself. The first-time founder was the former Zillow VP of Product and VP of Community &amp; Culture who thinks that the growing world of mafias comes with some problematic truths.</p>
<p>“While it&#8217;s true that these ‘mafias’ are good for the people within them and often touted with pride, there are reasons that they are problematic from an equity perspective,” she said. First, she pointed to how hiring from and funding employees from a given company, if that company doesn&#8217;t have diverse representation (particularly at the leadership level), propagates the inequitable cycles of who is getting hired and funded. Second, she thinks that the press focuses on startups coming out of these companies that serve a privileged subset of the population, instead of mission-focused ones.</p>
<p>What do you think? Her argument is essentially to not glamorize the concept of hiring within existing networks, because if white, male entrepreneurs only hire from within their existing networks, the resulting company will look and act white and male. On the flip side, and this is what gets me excited, underrepresented founders who raise millions of dollars, suddenly have the power to usher in an entirely different group of techies into this world. The Glossier mafia would look quite different than the PayPal mafia.</p>
<p>As I said before, I think &#8220;mafias&#8221; are certainly a compelling way to track how talent moves. I don’t think we should stop paying attention to the phenomenon or shame people for being opportunistic about alumni groups. It’s how the world works. Instead, I think that there’s hope that problems inherent to them are changing as founding groups themselves become more diverse. To Bastian’s point, I think there’s a way to be more intentional about what is idolized and what is not.</p>
<h3>A new descriptor</h3>
<p>A few people also mentioned that we should start using a different word to describe this dynamic instead of &#8220;mafia&#8221; due to its more nefarious connotations. Here’s a list of your best suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaOgundu/status/1403348280352796678">Tribe</a></li>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>Happy weekend, everyone. I hope that your week wasn’t too hectic and that you are getting a good recharge in. That said, we have a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>Something that has been cropping up more and more in my inbox, SMS folder and Twitter DMs are venture rounds from startups with an open-source backbone. Essentially, startups have roots in an open-source project, often with the progenitors of that open tech inside the company itself.</p>
<p>A good example of this at the very end stage of the startup world was Confluent. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/confluents-ipo-brings-a-high-growth-high-burn-saas-model-to-the-public-markets/">went public this week</a> to pretty good effect, pricing above its IPO range and later appreciating further. Confluent is predicated on the open-source tech Kafka, which you’ve probably heard of.</p>
<p>The Exchange caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/mavolpi">Mike Volpi of Index Ventures</a>, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/08/confluent-closes-24m-series-b-round-for-its-apache-kafka-based-stream-data-platform/">early backer of Confluent</a>, on the company’s IPO day. During our chat, we got to nibble on the open-source (OSS) startup world, which Volpi said changed dramatically in recent years. From his telling, venture investors back in 2015 weren’t too hyped about open-source startups, arguing that there already was one (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/what-does-red-hats-sale-to-ibm-tell-us-about-couchbases-valuation/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Red Hat</a>), and that that was going to be roughly about it.</p>
<p>If we did our math correctly, Index wound up with a stake worth in excess of $1 billion in Confluent at its IPO price. So, the haters were wrong about OSS.</p>
<p>That said, Volpi added that while he’s as bullish on open-source-focused startups as before, the market has become increasingly picked over as more investors pile into backing the model. That inventors are putting more money to work in the space is not a surprise if you’ve been reading startup funding coverage. BuildBuddy is an example that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-15m-to-help-developers-build-software-more-quickly/">I wrote about last December</a>. Ron <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/tecton-teams-with-founder-of-feast-open-source-machine-learning-feature-store/">covered Tecton</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/airbyte-announces-26m-series-a-for-open-source-data-connector-platform/">Airbyte</a> recently.</p>
<p>The trend of venture interest in OSS has been building for some time. Hell, VCs wrote about an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/07/tracking-the-explosive-growth-of-open-source-software/">explosion of open-source startups for TechCrunch back in 2017</a>. But the Confluent IPO and the recent wave of funding rounds for startups in the space seem to indicate that market appetite for such companies has reached a new, higher plateau. (If you are building an OSS-focused startup and recently raised capital, <a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com">say hi</a>.)</p>
<h2>More on Confluent’s IPO</h2>
<p>The Exchange also spoke with <a href="https://twitter.com/jaykreps?lang=en">Confluent CEO Jay Kreps</a> on his company’s IPO day. A few notes from that chat are worth our time. Here are our key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing is never going back to “normal”:</strong> That venture capitalists were able to start doing deals over Zoom was only so surprising. After all, you’d expect your average VC to be somewhat technology savvy. But Kreps said that his IPO roadshow worked well over digital channels, and that he was able to talk to more folks, more quickly than if he had been jet-hopping around the country for face-to-face meetings. If the even more conservative public-market investor set is fine with Zoom, digital pitching is a done deal.</li>
<li><strong>Public markets are still burn friendly: </strong>Confluent is a quickly growing software company that is not yet profitable. Its IPO reception is a good indication that losing money remains perfectly acceptable in today’s market. Per Kreps, if you have a huge market &#8212; he reckons that Confluent has a $50 billion market to attack &#8212; and can show that capital is being invested &#8212; CEO code for <em>not being utterly torched by an inefficient business model and cost structure </em>&#8212; then losses are just fine. This matters for Q3 IPO hopefuls who have more growth than net income. Which is most of them.</li>
<li><strong>Even public investors like open source:</strong> The Exchange also asked Kreps about being an open-source company approaching the public markets. Was it a positive or negative? A positive, per the CEO, adding that technology has a history of being built around open standards, which means that OSS fits neatly into historical trends. And he added that because open-source projects can have strong organic momentum, it can help public investors see future growth at the corporate level. Neat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>OK, how about even more open source news?</h2>
<p>Hope you like open-source software news, because I have even more for you. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prefect-announces-32m-series-b-funding-led-by-tiger-global-to-deliver-on-growing-demand-for-dataflow-automation-301309467.html">Prefect raised a $32 million Series B</a>. I didn’t get to cover the round when it happened, but did catch up with the company this week for a quick chat.</p>
<p>The company is based around the PrefectCore, an open-source project. PrefectCore helps companies make sure that their data inflow is set up correctly, focusing on things like scheduling, monitoring, logging and so forth. The company calls this sort of work negative engineering; it falls into a dead space of sorts. No one really wants to work on it, per the startup.</p>
<p>Notably, Prefect, instead of offering a hosted version of its open-source project, instead sells a monitoring service. It thinks that hosting OSS projects is a somewhat old-hat way of monetizing such projects. So, instead of selling hosting or feature-gating, the company’s commercial product is an API that tracks what PrefectCore is managing. If it reports all green lights, good shit, you’re in swell shape. If not, you have an issue.</p>
<p>But what matters is that Confluent shows that OSS startups can reach a huge scale and become big IPOs. And Prefect indicates that there may be even more ways to skin the OSS cat when it comes to making money off open-source software.</p>
<p>So, expect more OSS VCs deals to land this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a tough year for business. From ransomware attacks and power outages to cloud downtime and supply-chain disruptions, it’s never been more important to communicate to customers and stakeholders about what’s going wrong and why. Yet, with partial data and misinformation often spreading faster than official word, it’s also never been harder to deliver accurate and timely messages.</p>
<p>Given the complexities of this environment, I wanted to convene a group of specialists to talk about what the future of crisis comms holds for startups, technology companies, and business more broadly. We had a great set of three folks discuss how to build resilient orgs, handle the decentralization going on in tech today, and how to prioritize crisis management over the mundane tasks every day.</p>
<p>Joining us were:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>, who as commandant of the Coast Guard and during his career, was commander of the Atlantic coast during 9/11, and led federal responses during Hurricane Katrina, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.</li>
<li><b>Ana Visneski</b>, who worked with Allen on building out the Coast Guard’s first digital presence as an officer and chief of media, is now senior director of communications and community at <a href="https://www.h2o.ai">H20.ai</a> and was formerly global principal of disaster communications for Amazon Web Services.</li>
<li><b>John Visneski</b> is the chief information security officer (CISO) at <a href="https://accolade.com">Accolade</a>, and was formerly director of information security at The Pokémon Company. He served 10 years in the U.S. Air Force, where he served as chief of executive communications, and yes, is Ana’s brother.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This discussion has been edited and condensed for clarity</i></p>
<h2 id="Prepping an organization for catastrophe">Prepping an organization for catastrophe</h2>
<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: You’ve all been in disaster communications, in some cases for decades. What are some of the top-level lessons you’ve learned about the field?</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: Great communications and great communications people can’t save a dysfunctional organization. There’s only so much you can do with what you’ve got. I want to say that as a proviso because I’ve seen a lot of people try to communicate their way out of a problem.</p>
<p>The big difference between Katrina in 2005 and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 was Katrina was before Twitter and Facebook and Deepwater was after it. In the old days, you went out and did your job. There might be an after-action report, but it was pretty much done within your organizational structure.</p>
<p>I’m going to really date myself. We sent forces into Somalia [around 1993]. It was the first time in history that CNN watched the people come to shore from the amphibious vehicles and I knew life had changed dramatically. There is no operation that takes place these days where the public is not part of the operation, part of the environment, part of the outcomes that are generated. If you fail to realize that, you’re going to fail right away. Anybody who’s got a cell phone enters your world of work.</p>
<p>So the question is, how do you think about that? That’s resulted in a significant Black Lives Matter movement with George Floyd and somebody happened to be there with a cell phone, and if that had not happened, that situation probably would not have turned out the way it did. So the question is what are we to make of that loop?</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: Generally speaking, your organizational hierarchies are not designed to be optimized for a crisis. They’re designed to build consensus. They’re designed to understand budgets. They’re designed for long-term planning. It’s the same in the military and it’s even worse in the private sector. And so there’s no concept of situational leadership. There’s no concept of who’s actually in charge during a particular crisis.</p>
<p>In recent attacks, the folks that were in my position, didn’t do a good enough job of explaining the technical aspects of what was going on in such a way that their organization could channel that into something that could then be translated to the public.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: That’s actually called the theory of excellence in crisis communications, which is basically you have to have this transparency and this well-organized system before something goes wrong. And almost everyone doesn’t.</p>
<p>A good example is in 2017, when S3 broke for AWS, which is how I ended up doing crisis comms for them. I looked around and I said, “Well, why don’t we use our crisis comms plan?” And my boss said, “Our what?” And so I ended up building the critical event protocol and I built it based off the Incident Command System (ICS) that is used by federal agencies during a disaster. And essentially it was a big red button that says “Stop! Everyone get on a call, figure out who’s in charge of responding” that just unifies everyone.</p>

<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: I’ll give you a classic antidote because I’ve written about it quite a bit. When I was going to the Sloan School at MIT, in December of ’88, we went down to New York and visited a bunch of CEO’s, and one of the days we went across the river to see the CEO at Exxon, a guy named [Lawrence G. Rawl]. During the discussion, I asked, “Bhopal was the biggest industrial accident in the history of the world today. As a CEO running a big corporation, have you thought about what happened if you had a similar Bhopal-type situation?” He spent 20 minutes going over their extremely well-thought-out communications plan and four months later, the Exxon Valdez ran underground and they actually failed at everything.</p>

<p><b>John Visneski</b>: Your plan that you write down on paper is only as good as how much you practice it. Right? One of the things that the military typically is pretty good at is practicing before you play. Doing mock drills, doing tabletop exercises, having a red team that throws things at you that you might not expect.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: Yeah. I’ve dealt with a couple of large firms that have had very big problems. The default setting, if you haven’t thought about this ahead of time, is they go to a subject matter expert and hold them accountable for what the organization should do. That is not the way to do it. You need a designated person to create unity of effort. It’s got to involve the C-suite, and it’s got to involve not only your clients and your stakeholders, but your supply chain.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: We keep talking about training, but just having a plan in the first place is critical. With some of these big companies, they’re so siloed that when something like this happens, everyone’s trying to do the right thing and running into each other. If you don’t have redundancies built in and backups for your backups, you’re going to go down hard.</p>
<p>You’ve got a plan for what happens if your main spokesperson <i>was</i> the incident? Or what happens if there was an earthquake and, all of a sudden, you don’t have your C-suite to talk? And John can talk a lot about this, but the last mile is another problem with crisis comms. If it’s a big disaster, you’ve got to plan around your tech, how are you going to get the information from the field back to where you can actually broadcast it out to people?</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: When I got called to go to Katrina, I was on my way to the airport and the last thing I did was I sent my son along to a Best Buy to get me a mobile handheld and a SiriusXM receiver, so I could have awareness of what was being done. As far as the communications, a thing like that was the smartest thing I did.</p>

<p><b>John Visneski:</b> One of the biggest challenges is this all needs to be resourced, right? Your company needs to actually dedicate resources to that prior planning. To being able to build out the infrastructure, to being able to have hot-swap data centers and locations and things like that. And sometimes whether it’s your board or whether it’s your CFO or whoever’s holding the purse strings for your organization, it’s really hard to justify the return on investment that a lot of folks see as sort of a rainy day fund.</p>
<p>So it’s incumbent upon the leadership of the organization, particularly the leadership that is going to be involved in some sort of a disaster response to get ahead of those conversations and understand how disaster response can do things to protect revenue.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: Because of the pandemic, we’ve had almost two years of shit hitting the fan. So we’re seeing a lot more C-suite leaders going, “We need to know how to be prepared for what happens next.”</p>
<h2 id="Communicating in a decentralized and flat world">Communicating in a decentralized and flat world</h2>
<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: If you think about the last 20 years, particularly in the private sector, we went from a model of headquarters buildings, large leadership structures all in one place, oftentimes a fairly hierarchical model of how to operate a company, etc. Today, we’re seeing decentralization, and a sort of horizontalness in a lot of companies. How does this new culture affect disaster communications?</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: Well, now that there is this decentralization, it’s incredibly difficult to wrangle all of your people and get everyone on the same page. And you have to think about what happens if Slack goes down. It goes back to redundancies — you have to have multiple ways of contacting your people.</p>
<p>Along that line, I am not a fan of companies saying is, “You can’t post on social media or you shouldn’t do this or that.” Because all that does is sows distrust. Instead, I am a big fan of training your people to do it right. Of course, you have to have company policy that if someone during a crisis is posting secure information or lies, or is just being a racist jerk, obviously there are consequences, but training your people to use the tool right, helps with transparency.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: My motto when I was commandant was transparency of information breeds self-correcting behavior. If you put enough information out and everybody holds it, organizational intent becomes embedded into how people see the environment they’re in. They’re going to understand what’s going on and you won’t have to give them a direct order to do the right thing. They’ll understand that. And I think that’s really important.</p>
<p>In the military, we have something called a “common operating picture,” and it’s basically a display where everybody’s at, what they’re doing at any one time. It’s not an order. It’s not hierarchical. Instead, it provides context and provides a window into what you’re doing.</p>
<p>So I think there’s a difference between creating a common operating picture and what actually constitutes authority. If you can separate those, the more you put into the former, the less of the latter you’re going to have to do.</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: I’m based in Seattle. We have an office in Philadelphia, an office in Houston, an office in San Francisco, and an office in Prague. There’s people in all those offices who are critical for our business. The advantage we have is the advantage that a lot of tech organizations take for granted, which is we were already going through a digital transformation, or we were already on the backside of digital transformation. Cloud focus, Software as a Service, Slack, email, Signal on my phone, a million different ways for me to communicate with my team, communicate with leadership and things like that.</p>
<p>What we take for granted is, there are a lot of organizations in the United States and worldwide that have not gone through that digital transformation. No offense to the military, but when I was at the Pentagon, if email went down, you might as well play hockey in the hallways because no work was going to get done.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: You can add losing GPS as well.</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: Exactly. So a lot of organizations have had to come to terms with how do they communicate when they’re distributed like that? The answer isn’t one-size-fits-all. It might be different for an Accolade, different from a Facebook, different from a Twitter, different from a Bank of America or a Bank of New York Mellon. Just based on what their architecture looked like pre-pandemic, what their architecture looks now, and what sort of investments they’ve made to future-proof themselves, should something this ever happen again.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: I was on a Twitter Space recently, and I was talking that in the United States, especially those of us who are in the tech industry, we tend to take for granted all of this stuff. There are all of these assumptions that are made. In reality, not only do you have to deal with the last mile if a disaster happens, but you also have to deal with the fact that not everyone has one of these super computers in their pockets all over the world.</p>

<p>Talking about technological arrogance, but people forget radio. People forget that there are these older technologies that in a disaster are still where you’re going to go. John makes fun of me all the time, because I’m trying the new thing every time it comes out, but you can’t forget the stuff that works like radio in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="The crisis of crises and how to handle the infinite range of disasters today">The crisis of crises and how to handle the infinite range of disasters today</h2>
<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: The next subject I want to get to is the range and diversity of crises that are hitting organizations today. The Admiral had brought up Exxon and ’89. Okay, you’re an oil company, you have an oil spill — I wouldn’t call it predictable, but you can certainly create a plan. You can say, “Here’s how we need to communicate. Here’s how we handle this.”</p>
<p>But look at the range of stuff we’ve had to deal with in the last year. Everything from a pandemic to Texas power outages, wildfires in California, TSMC is dealing with a drought in Taiwan, you’ve got internal employee hostile workplace protests, external protests, ransomware attacks, bitcoin heists, and on and on.</p>
<p>Ultimately does the same toolbox work no matter what the crisis is? Or do different types of crises demand different kinds of responses? And how would you know the difference?</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: I taught crisis leadership in large complex organizations for four years at George Washington University. In the last class, I told my students to write down the worst catastrophe they could ever think would happen that you have to go and wake up the president in the middle of the night. They all wrote it down on a piece of paper, folded it up and put it in a ball cap. I shook it up and pulled one of the pieces out.</p>
<p>I said to the class, “Just listen to what I’m about to say. Thanks for getting up and coming in early to the White House Press Corps office this morning. I want you to know the president was notified at 4:30 this morning about what happened. He and the First Lady were overwhelmed with grief for the loss of life and the impact on the community. We’ve set up a schedule where we’re going to brief the president every four hours and a meeting following the brief to the president. There’ll be a brief to the press 30 minutes after that. The cabinet’s been advised.” And I went on and on and on.</p>
<p>I finished and I said, “What do you think about that?” And James Carville, who was visiting, said, “It’s great” and he asked, “Well, what was the event?” And I said, “I never opened the paper.” So to your point there’s some things that are just a goddammed no-brainer.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: I took the ICS [Incident Command System] structure and rebuilt it basically to work in the corporate setting. And the reason that’s so effective is it’s built to be flexible. You have someone who’s in charge overall, you have someone who’s in charge of communications. You have someone who’s in charge of logistics. You have someone who’s in charge of security, and it flexes up or down. And so no one can necessarily predict a “black swan” event. But you can build a core response system that is as close to all hazards as possible.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: Predict complexity.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: Yes. And you predict that it will be complex and that nothing goes to plan. We’ve made a lot of jokes that nothing prepared me for a wedding during COVID like having been a first responder. Well, my brother got married last year too. And I did a little bit of help there with my background, but for my wedding, nothing was the same. And it’s the same thing during a disaster. Katrina is different from Gustaf. Gustaf was different from Sandy, but they’re all hurricanes at their core.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: I just spent an hour with a bunch of government employees earlier today on the same topic. What happens in a “complex” situation is that existing standard operating procedures, legal theories, frameworks, and governance break down and do not work, and they have to be replaced with some other way to deal with it.</p>
<p>ICS allows you to do, and with the right standard doctrine, you can get pretty close to a 50-60% solution that will get you headed in the right direction while you figure out the rest of it.</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: I’ll say at least from the tech side of things is those plans need to abstract technology almost entirely. Take it up to a level where it doesn’t matter what your communications method is from a technological standpoint. Don’t assume that you’re going to have the bits and bytes flowing the way that we do now. Don’t assume cell towers, don’t assume power, don’t assume any of those sorts of things, because the second that you predicate your plan on those assumptions is the second that the complexity is going to come in and tell you you’re wrong. The 40% that is not planned for is going to become what outweighs the 60%.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: I think one of the things the tech industry kind of runs into is we are so reliant on the technology now that we can’t imagine what we’d do without it. At the end of the day, good crisis comms relies on good people, and good crisis and disaster response relies on the people doing it.</p>
<p>So you have to build your plan around the people and the structure there, and then use the technology at hand during the event to augment what plans you already have for people. Because by the time I’d write a crisis plan for something. If I included Twitter and blah, blah, blah, well, one like John just said, it’s going to break. Or by the time we have the crisis, the technology has changed and we’re using something else. So you got to write it from a perspective of people first and tech is the tool.</p>

<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: Okay, so obviously we should all spend more time figuring out how to communicate better during crises. But everyone is busy, and every person is trying to hit whatever metric they need for the quarter. How do you get a low-risk but huge-impact issue like crisis management on the priority list?</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: For a B2B organization or a B2C organization or really anybody that’s selling a particular service, typically you need to lean on compliance requirements first. So customer contracts are going to say, from a security perspective, your data security addendum, your privacy addendums, and things that are generally going to have some language that centers around having a business continuity plan, a disaster response plan, an incident response plan, a cyber incident response plan, and then the really good contracts are the ones that actually specify you’ll do it no less than two times a year. So the first thing to lean on is those compliance requirements, because those will actually directly tie to revenue.</p>
<p>Then the secret sauce and what a lot of us in the cyber community are trying to get better at is how do you take that next step? We know that compliance does not necessarily mean security. We know that just because we have a written business continuity plan and that we say we exercise it, we present a report that says we exercise it, doesn’t necessarily mean we’re going that next mile to make sure that we train our employees. The education piece of it is really what we need to advocate to get additional resources for.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: My pitch to these big companies is if you’ve got a regulatory requirement, you have a plan that’s required. Why would you fund that and not take the opportunity to add just a little bit of incremental effort and resources to take advantage of the natural cycle that you’re required to do anyway?</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: Hit them where the money is, because a good crisis plan can range in price. Let’s say you spend $200,000 getting your system set up. If you’re looking at these companies, a disaster or a crisis could tank your company. Or it could cost you millions and millions of dollars if you’re not prepared. So at the end of the day, the ROI is huge.</p>
<p>And like I said before, with COVID having just happened, I think more of leadership is aware that, “Hey, we’re not crisis proof just because we’re a gaming company or just because we’re whatever.” No, one’s crisis proof. So at the end of the day, you’re going to save money. If you just do it in the first place, because then you just have to update it every year, and you just have to do a little bit of training. The biggest cost is on the front end and then just maintaining it after that and updating it.</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: Everyone knows that if something bad happens, if you don’t have plans in place, you’re going to lose a shit load of money. But let’s think about it from a consumer standpoint. Generally speaking, your average consumer is becoming much more conversant when it comes to privacy.</p>
<p>Moving forward, it isn’t enough just to say, “If we don’t have this, things can go really bad.” It’s also to say, “We can leverage this if we do this really well. And if we can advertise to our customers, whether it’s another business or whether it’s the consumer that not only do we protect your data, but also we have all these plans in place in order to react to complex situations.” You can actually use that as something that separates you from your near-peer competitors in the business world.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: At the end of the day, if the trust isn’t there in the tech and the trust isn’t there that you’re doing the right things, it doesn’t matter what you do when a crisis hits. You’re already in the trashcan.</p>

<p>Hey Equity fam, we have a small clip of extra goodness for you today. After our live show &#8212; <strong>listen to the recording <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/equity-live-this-is-what-leadership-smells-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, it was good fun</strong> &#8212; we got to take a few questions from the audience, audio that was not included in the main episode, as we didn&#8217;t have the time. But we&#8217;ve cut it out, given it a short polish, and have it for you today.</p>
<p>If you wanted even more Equity, here you go!</p>
<p>As a small note from the team, we know that this week&#8217;s Wednesday episode didn&#8217;t have the best audio quality. And to do a Twitter Spaces experiment the same week as a live show might have felt like a lot of change. Don&#8217;t worry, it just worked out that way. Equity will keep tinkering and having fun, but we&#8217;re back to normal next week.</p>
<p>Enjoy the Q&amp;A, and we&#8217;ll see you at our next live show!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bristol proved especially popular among tech investors last year — local businesses raked in an impressive $414 million in 2020, making it the third-largest U.K. city for tech investment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. is gaining in popularity as a great place to start a tech firm. The country is quickly catching up to China on the tech investment front, with VC investments reaching a record of $15 billion in 2020, according to <a href="https://technation.io/report2021/#uk-tech-investment">TechNation</a>. A global health crisis notwithstanding, London remained a favorite for investors. U.K. cities made up a fifth of the top 20 European cities, with names such as Oxford, Dublin, Edinburgh and Cambridge rising to the fore in 2020.</p>
<p>Bristol proved especially popular among tech investors last year — local businesses raked in an impressive $414 million in 2020, making it the third-largest U.K. city for tech investment. The city also has the most fintech startups per head in the U.K. outside London, according to <a href="https://www.whitecapconsulting.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bristol-Bath-FinTech-Ecosystem-Report-2019-20.pdf">Whitecap’s 2019-2020 Ecosystem Report</a>.</p>
<p>Efforts by the city&#8217;s private and public sectors to modernize the city have helped it rank among the <a href="https://www.huawei.com/uk/news/uk/2017/huawei-uk-smart-cities-index">top smart cities in the U.K.</a>, attracting a bevy of tech entrepreneurs. Its proximity to London has meant that it is a good alternative for founders looking for a more affordable stay while letting them tap the capital&#8217;s financial resources. The University of Bristol also has the largest robotics department in Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Bristol is also home to an important startup accelerator, <a href="https://www.setsquared.co.uk/">SETsquared</a>. A collaborative effort by the five universities of Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Southampton and Surrey, the accelerator has supported over 4,000 entrepreneurs and helped their startups raise a total of £1.8 billion. Other startup support players include the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/bristol-entrepreneur-who-exited-for-800m-doubles-down-on-the-city-with-deep-tech-incubator-and-vc-fund/">Science Creates VC fund</a>, set up by entrepreneur <a href="https://twitter.com/h_destecroix">Harry Destecroix,</a> and <a href="https://www.techspark.co/">TechSPARK</a> <a href="https://engine-shed.co.uk/">Engine Shed</a>.</p>
<p>Key emerging startups from Bristol include Graphcore, Open Bionics, Ultraleap, Immersive Labs and Five AI.</p>
<p>To get a better idea of the state of the tech ecosystem and the investor outlook for this city, we surveyed founders, leaders and executives involved in nurturing Bristol&#8217;s startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>The survey revealed that the city has a robust renewable, zero-carbon and fintech startup landscape. Robotics, VR, bio, quantum, digital and deep tech are also areas showing promise. As for the investing scene, although Bristol has a healthy angel network, the city lacks institutional VC, but with London only a drive or train ride away, this has not proved a significant problem.</p>
<p>We surveyed:</p>

<h2>Coralie Hassanaly, innovation consultant, DRIAD</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol is strong in renewable and zero-carbon innovation, fintech and robotics. It&#8217;s weak in industry 4.0.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Graphcore, LettUs Grow, Open Bionics, Ultraleap and YellowDog.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
A lot of focus on fintech, I think.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Bristol is a great middle ground between a large dynamic city (plus it&#8217;s not far from London) and access to nice countryside area. With remote working we can expect it will attract new residents in the next few years.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Aimee Skinner, Abigail Frear and Stuart Harrison.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Second major city in U.K. innovation.</p>
<h2>Pete Read, CEO and founder, Persona Education</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol is strong in media/animation, edtech, social impact, health and science. I&#8217;m most excited by edtech and the possibility to reach and positively impact millions of students via online learning. It&#8217;s weaker in hardware and fintech.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Kaedim, Persona Education and One Big Circle.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
There are several very active tech investment networks coming from several angles, e.g., university-led, groups of private angels and tech incubators. The great thing is they all collaborate and share resources, ideas and expertise in initiatives such as The Engine Shed and Silicon Gorge.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
More people are moving in, as Bristol has a great urban lifestyle with easy access to the countryside and Southwest/Wales holiday spots, and an international airport 20 minutes from the center.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Jerry Barnes at Bristol PE Club; Abby Frear at TechSPARK; Briony Phillips at Rocketmakers; Jack Jordan-Connelly at SETsquared.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s developing rapidly with lots of support, so it will be bigger, attracting more investment and definitely more on the international scene five years from now.</p>
<h2>Kiran Krishnamurthy, CEO, AI Labs</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Our tech ecosystem is strong in the aerospace and defense sector. We are excited by the scope and scale of digital transformation opportunities with AI available in this sector. The main weakness in this sector is the slow pace of transformation, especially now due to the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Graphcore and YellowDog.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Compared to the U.K. tech sector average, Bristol has a <a href="https://www.beauhurst.com/blog/tech-companies-bristol/">very low proportion</a> of established companies (4% versus 8%), a higher proportion of seed stage companies (42% versus 37%), and a higher death rate (21% versus 17%). It’s a particularly young ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
It is possible that people moving out of London will come into Bristol due to the transport links, strong ecosystem and beautiful nature of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Bristol turns out to be San Francisco of Europe!</p>
<h2>Simon Hall, director, Airway Medical</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol is strong in the medtech, veterinary, industrial sectors.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Others have moved in.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
SETsquared.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
We will see massive growth in five years.</p>
<h2>Ben Miles, CEO, Spin Up Science</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?<br />
</strong>Our sector is weak in entrepreneurial ambition among researchers, and so suffers from low rates of deep tech spinout activity from leading universities. We are most excited by the step change in activity we have seen in the past two years and culture shift towards innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Rosa Biotech, Albotherm and CytoSeek.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Medium strength in shallow tech; currently weak in deep tech.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
People are moving in.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Spin Up Science, Science Creates and Science Angel Syndicate.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Very strong in deep tech with an invested local community of entrepreneurs, incubators and investors.</p>
<h2>Rupert Baines, ex-CEO, UltraSoC</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol is strong in wireless (5G, 60 GHz, etc.), semiconductors (especially processors, AI/ML and parallel architectures), robotics and other hard tech/deep tech.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Graphcore, Ultraleap, Blu Wireless and Five AI.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s limited. There are some angels, but few locally focused funds.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Much the same: People choose to live in Bristol/Bath for quality of life. Much of the work is already external — commuting to London.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Nigel Toon, Simon Knowles, Stan Boland, David May and Nick Sturge.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Much stronger, with more processor and hardware activity.</p>
<h2>Mathieu Johnsson, CEO and co-founder, Marble</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol has a strong robotics, aerospace and renewables scene. I&#8217;m most excited to see how the legacy in aerospace in Bristol will translate to future industry-defining companies. The ecosystem is weak on the investor side, though London VCs are less than a two-hour train journey away.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Graphcore, Ultraleap and Open Bionics.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />

Tom Carter at Ultraleap, and Joel Gibbard at Open Bionics.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Getting closer to London and Cambridge.</p>
<h2>Chris Erven, CEO, KETS Quantum Security</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol has a strong biotech, quantum, digital, science-based/deep tech ecosystem. I&#8217;m excited by this eclectic city with exciting people that think differently.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Any QTEC, SETsquared, or UnitDX members and alumni.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Very early/nascent, mostly angels.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Probably move in! Beautiful green spaces around, lots of interesting, independent shops. And (just about) commutable from London.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
The incubators — QTEC, QTIC, SETsquared and UnitDX; Bristol Private Equity Club; Harry Destecroix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, we caught up with Steve Sarracino the founder of the growth-equity firm <a href="https://www.activantcapital.com/">Activant Capital</a> in Greenwich, Conn., We&#8217;d last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/this-low-flying-growth-equity-firm-with-payments-and-logistics-bets-just-closed-a-255-million-fund/">talked with Sarracino</a> back in early April of last year, as people around the world were being forced into their homes by the pandemic, and his firm was just closing its third fund with $257 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>As we learned, Activant, which tends to invest in e-commerce infrastructure and payments companies, is now (according to an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001835572/000156761921007887/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a>), nearing a close on a fourth fund that has targeted $425 million. It has &#8212; like a <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/us-vcs-europe/">growing number</a> of other U.S. firms &#8212; also opened a new office in Berlin, headed by Max Mayer, a former investor with Global Founders Capital.</p>
<p>We talked a bit about Activant&#8217;s growing interest in Europe and what underlies it. We also talked about the velocity of deal-making right now and what Sarracino makes of one of the hottest trends of the year: the many roll-ups of third-party sellers on Amazon. Excerpts from that conversation follow, edited lightly for length.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: How long have you been investing in Europe?</strong></p>
<p>SS: A long time. We&#8217;d invested in Hybris [an e-commerce company that was <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2497458/sap-buys-e-commerce-vendor-hybris-in-strike-back-at-oracle--salesforce-com.html">acquired</a> by SAP in 2013 for $1.5 billion]. We&#8217;re also investors in NewMarket [a six-year-old, Berlin- and Boston-based SaaS company that was founded by serial entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanschambach/">Stephan Schambach</a>, who also founded Demandware].</p>
<p>We go back and forth to London all the time; it&#8217;s easy from the East Coast. But the continent is a different story. You really need to have a presence on the ground there.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Why make the move now?</strong></p>
<p>SS: There was always a lot of technical talent there &#8212; I think there are two times the number of STEM graduates in Europe as in the U.S. The challenge before was that the venture community was smaller &#8212; it takes a vibrant early-stage community to create later-stage opportunities. Europe was also missing middle management. In L.A. or New York or Boston, you can pull strong SVPs or even C-level execs out of Facebook and Amazon, but there wasn&#8217;t the same level of big companies there, and that has changed. They&#8217;re all [in Europe] now. So you&#8217;ve now got the technical talent, [sufficient] venture [dollars] and management.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are there other advantages? Are valuations any better in Europe or is Tiger Global <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/tiger-global/">driving up the numbers</a> there, too?</strong></p>
<p>SS: For the best companies, you don&#8217;t see much difference in valuation across continent. But the opportunity in Europe is attractive in the middle stage. Seed and A is pretty well covered, but B,C,D, and E is a very different game.</p>
<p>Another amazing thing about Europe is that while you do have to spend a little more on marketing, sales, and product because you have to be multi-lingual, you have to deal with different tax jurisdictions, you have to sell differently in different countries, European startups as a result are purpose-built to go global much faster versus U.S. companies. [In the U.S.], you have one giant market and you might pop into the UK and Canada, but it&#8217;s a very different proposition to go global.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do the European companies you talk with feel the need to establish a presence in the U.S. as soon as possible, or has that changed, too?</strong></p>
<p>SS:  In some areas, for example, where cloud adoption is behind in Europe versus the U.S., you can get hypergrowth in Europe. So it&#8217;s not a requirement or prerequisite to expand into the U.S. But, of course, it&#8217;s on the roadmap for anyone in the tech business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you think about companies that could conceivably become rivals with your U.S. investments down the road?</strong></p>
<p>SS: We&#8217;re careful about investing in the same company but in different geographies because our belief is that they can compete globally, so we try and pick the global winner. If it&#8217;s a micro geo &#8212; let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a company that sells SMB infrastructure software in Germany and won&#8217;t get to the US, we wouldn&#8217;t have trouble backing [a similar company in the U.S.], but that&#8217;s something you have to pay close attention to, because we are on the board and we are active.</p>
<p>Our funds are fairly concentrated. In our third fund, we only have six assets. With this new fund, we&#8217;ll have 10 to 12 partnerships at most. So it&#8217;s a little easier to manage.</p>

<p><strong>TC: How can anyone invest in a market that&#8217;s moving this fast? We reporters see a lot of deals and they look so much alike at this point that it&#8217;s dizzying. It must be exponentially worse for you.</strong></p>
<p>SS: Things are moving fast and they&#8217;re expensive. Tiger and bigger firms have shifted the market. But there are still great opportunities in the mid-stages. Our overall philosophy is that, first, you want to find the startup that&#8217;s doing something different or doing something that no one has done in a long time. You also have to distinguish between a feature and a platform. Can this startup build out a real platform and acquire different types of customers? Third, you&#8217;ve got to know these sectors much better now than ever before, because, to your point, there are 15 companies doing the same thing these days, and to have that level of conviction, you have to meet with all 15 and pick what you think is the winning horse based on where the market is going, the quality of the team, and the quality of the product they can build.</p>
<p>In some ways it&#8217;s harder to differentiate, and there are a few ways to react to that. The way we react is to retrench to our core sectors that we know well and say no to a lot of stuff that seems really amazing but we&#8217;re just not going to get up to speed fast enough given the velocity of the market.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you determine whether a startup is working on a feature versus a platform?</strong></p>
<p>SS: It&#8217;s a real issue because there are a lot of great feature companies that can get to some scale pretty fast &#8212; $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million in revenue. But making that next step is hard. Companies with real network effects &#8212; meaning that every customer they add, there&#8217;s some benefit to the other customers &#8212; [can be] any sort of of two-sided marketplace, [it can be] embedded payments, [but there has to be] some other level of &#8216;value add&#8217; besides selling simple software.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also seeing more companies charging transactionally versus [a flat subscription rate]. I think that&#8217;s going to be a big trend over the next three years &#8212; this move away from SaaS to charging along the lines of what the customers cares about. When you charge the way the customer views their revenue, the product has to be very good and very differentiated.</p>

<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve talked with me before about funding companies that help SMBs avoid getting hollowed out by Amazon. Just wondering what you make of these many roll-ups of third-party sellers on Amazon we&#8217;re seeing in the U.S. and Europe and suddenly in Asia, too.</strong></p>
<p>SS: Oh, gosh. So they&#8217;re basically finding really neat products, buying them for cheap multiples of EBITDA, and then driving better advertising, visibility, and reviews on Amazon to get more buyers driving up EBITDA. It&#8217;s a brilliant play, but I&#8217;ve had my face ripped off a few times, and one [instance owed to there being] a single point of failure, so as Amazon shifts things, I think that introduces risk.</p>
<p>There are some really interesting assets out there. It&#8217;s just not what we do. I also think there was some Covid bump, because people were at home and not spending money on travel, so you saw spending shift away from services and experiences and into goods and products and I think that&#8217;s going to shift back quickly to experiences. So we&#8217;ll see what happens post COVID with some of these, but it&#8217;s going to be get the same kind of overarching growth that drove some of the underlying products. There&#8217;s  also a question about how much technology they&#8217;re really applying versus, is it more of a deal business. That&#8217;s unclear, but, I mean, some of them have raised like half a billion dollars so they got it, they&#8217;re doing something right.</p>

But instead of launching a fresh viral TikTok dance for summer, the single inspired an informal protest among Black creators tired of thanklessly launching trends into the social media stratosphere.</p>
<p>With the release of the video for &#8220;Thot Shit,&#8221; some Black TikTok creators began <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-tiktok-strike-dance-megan-thee-stallion-thot-shit">calling attention to that exploitation this week</a>, inspiring others to <a href="https://twitter.com/LeslieMac/status/1406630859596259329">refuse to choreograph a dance</a> to the hit song. The idea behind the movement is that Black artists on the platform create a disproportionate amount of content and culture — much of which is <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/after-addison-rae-backlash-jimmy-fallon-hosted-black-tiktok-dancers-the-tonight-show">re-packaged and monetized by popular white creators</a> and culture at large.</p>
<p>The song choice probably isn&#8217;t a coincidence. The Megan Thee Stallion video is both a playful but important paean to essential workers — twerking grocery, food service and sanitation workers, in this case — and a biting commentary on the wealthy white establishment that exploits their labor without thinking twice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The &#8220;strike&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have creators leaving the platform or even staying off of the app. Instead, Black creators who might normally contribute dances for the hot new song are sitting back and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsskeonluv29/video/6974936656839281926?lang=en&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1">pointing to what happens when they&#8217;re not around</a>. (Predictably: not a lot.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Thot-Shit-6972655154873796610?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">On the sound&#8217;s page</a>, some videos tease choreography but pivot into a statement about how <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theericklouis/video/6975379403282943237?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">Black creators don&#8217;t get their due on the app</a>. In other videos, Black creators watch on in horror at awkward dance attempts failing to fill the void or laugh about how the song&#8217;s lyrics are instructional but <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kiri.jaz/video/6976422643293490437">non-Black TikTok still can&#8217;t figure it out</a>.</p>
<p>The eminently danceable &#8220;Thot Shit&#8221; could build into Megan Thee Stallion&#8217;s biggest hit yet, but just looking on TikTok you wouldn&#8217;t know it.</p>

<p>When reached for comment on the phenomenon, TikTok praised Black creators as a &#8220;critical and vibrant&#8221; part of the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;We care deeply about the experience of Black creators on our platform and we continue to work every day to create a supportive environment for our community while also instilling a culture where honoring and crediting creators for their creative contributions is the norm,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Many TikTok accounts participating in the strike<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fordahomies24/video/6975357226684878085?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"> cite a recent explosion of white TikTokkers lip-syncing obliviously</a> to a clip of Nicki Minaj&#8217;s 2016 song &#8220;Black Barbies&#8221; that <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/black-barbies-tiktok-sound/">specifically praises Black bodies</a> (&#8220;I&#8217;m a fucking Black Barbie/Pretty face, perfect body&#8230;&#8221;). White TikTok inexplicably flocked to the sound, boosting its popularity and crowding out Black creators.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just one incident in a long history of Black creators feeling exploited and appropriated on social networks. Black TikTok dancers have long been left in the cold: Their original dance moves explode in popularity and get picked up by non-Black creators, who also pick up the credit along the way.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The TikTok strike truly is amazing b/c it shows not only how US pop culture is built on stealing from Black people, but how the music industry depends on this cycle of theft &amp; white washing in order to monetize the music.</p>
<p>&mdash; DEFUND &amp; ABOLISH POLICE, REFUND OUR COMMUNITIES (@BreeNewsome) <a href="https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome/status/1408210077497057282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The recent strike is the latest beat in the ongoing conversation over who gets to cash in on the wellspring of creativity that pours out of a platform like TikTok. More broadly, some creators believe that <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hankgreen1/video/6976405761987448069">TikTok&#8217;s economics are stacked against them</a>, even compared to other major platforms like YouTube. Across social media sites, creators, <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/why-instagram-influencers-are-unionising">particularly creators of color</a>, are turning to collective action and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/style/influencer-union-hollywood-SAG-AFTRA.html">even unionizing to assert their power</a>.</p>
<p>For Black creators tired of seeing their work appropriated, collectively refusing to gift the world a hot new TikTok dance is certainly one way to show just how vital they are to the online ecosystem — something even a quick glance at the desolate &#8220;Thot Shit&#8221; sound makes abundantly clear.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 25, 2021. We have a great block of startup news and Amazon coverage for you today. But before we get into all of that, a note that there are only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/only-two-more-weeks-until-tc-early-stage-2021-marketing-fundraising/">two weeks left before our TechCrunch Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising event</a>. It’s going to rock, so check it out and get prepped. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/aws-is-buying-encrypted-messaging-service-wickr/">Amazon buys encrypted messaging service Wickr:</a> </strong>If you thought it was strange that an e-commerce company runs the world’s biggest public cloud service, it may feel even stranger that that same public cloud service just bought an encrypted messaging service. But in the platform era, tech companies want to do everything, so we should not be shocked. Amazon’s cloud team intends to “continue operating Wickr as is and offer its services to AWS customers” starting now. In related news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/amazon-and-google-face-uk-cma-probe-over-fake-reviews/">Amazon and Google are taking whacks in the U.K.</a> over fake reviews.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/faa-clears-virgin-galactic-for-commercial-astronaut-spaceflight/"><strong>Virgin is a go:</strong></a> The American government has cleared Virgin Galactic for commercial spaceflight. The result of the news? Shares of the SPAC’d company rose by nearly 39% today. So, it’s a liftoff moment for the company <em>and</em> its market cap.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/why-is-didi-worth-so-much-less-than-uber/"><strong>Didi’s confusing value:</strong></a> Closing out our Top 3 today, TechCrunch took a look at the Chinese ride-hailing giant’s first IPO price range. We’re curious why it looks and feels so cheap compared to its erstwhile rival, Uber.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>TechCrunch stretched its legs today, giving us a lot to discuss past the usual funding round roll call. Here’s what you should read:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/deep-science-keeping-ai-honest-in-medicine-climate-science-and-vision/">What’s new in Deep Science:</a></strong> Behind the scenes of startup glitz and venture capital glamor is a bunch of scientific work, the stuff that powers the next generation of tech and the startups of tomorrow. Devin Coldewey has a digest of science work ranging from predicting liquid flow based on still images to AI systems faking confidence.</li>
<li><strong>The rapidly evolving early-stage market: </strong>If you care about how and when and why early-stage startups raise capital, TechCrunch has lots for you this week. Here’s a look at today’s <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">early-stage venture capital market in the U.S</a></strong>., and <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/">here’s another focused on Latin America</a></strong>. More coming next week looking at what’s afoot in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, a host of startups raised more money. Here are a few highlights to keep you up to date:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/mercuryo-raises-7-5m-for-crypto-focused-cross-border-payments-after-crossing-50m-in-arr/">Mercuryo raises $7.5M for crypto-powered, cross-border payments:</a></strong> One key use of blockchain tech that was touted years ago was sending money around the world. Traditional banking is famously bad at this, leading to high fees and other issues. Mercuryo could be cracking the model and has crossed the $50 million ARR mark. Impressive.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/edge-delta-raises-15m-series-a-to-take-on-splunk/">Edge Delta raises $15M to take on data analysis giants:</a> </strong>The startup’s new Series A puts it into closer competition with Splunk, Datadog and other huge companies that sell cloud-based data monitoring services. The real story is somewhat technical, but happy we had <a href="https://twitter.com/fredericl">Frederic Lardinois</a> on hand to explain it to us.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/kaszek-ventures-leads-a-15-million-round-in-chilean-asset-management-startup-fintual/"><strong>Fintual raises $15M for Latin American retail investing:</strong></a> The Robinhood-led boom in retail investing that the United States has seen in recent years is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon. And Fintual wants to take a bite out of the trend in the Latin American market. The Chilean startup now has a Series A under its belt to power its fight against both regulation and incumbent players.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Musculoskeletal medical startups race to enter personalized health tech market</h2>
<p>With more than 50 million Americans suffering from chronic pain and musculoskeletal (MSK) medical problems, a number of startups are offering patients new products &#8220;that don’t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo,&#8221; reports <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a>.</p>
<p>Startups hoping to enter this space have an uphill climb. Setting aside regulations that cover aspects like product packaging and marketing, they must compete with well-entrenched competition from Big Pharma as they try to partner with health insurance companies.</p>
<p>Natasha profiles three companies that are each taking a different approach to personalized health: Clear, Hinge Health and PeerWell.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>From the world of Big Tech today we just have one more entry, as we covered Amazon’s big news up above. <a href="https://twitter.com/riptari">Natasha Lomas</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/linkedin-formally-joins-eu-code-on-hate-speech-takedowns/">reported today that</a> “Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has committed to doing more to quickly purge illegal hate speech from its platform in the European Union by formally signing up to a self-regulatory initiative that seeks to tackle the issue through a voluntary Code of Conduct.”</p>
<p>I wanted to raise this particular story because it somewhat underscores how internet regulation is shaping up around the world. You wouldn’t see this story, say, in the United States, or at least not in the same format. And in China, for example, another key internet market, it would also have a very different flavor. To some degree it feels like we’re dealing with three different &#8212; and increasingly distant &#8212; internets. Something for startups to chew on.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There's a kernel of truth in every joke, so whenever someone quips, "This meeting could have been an email!" you can bet that some small part of them meant it sincerely.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meetings should have a clear purpose, but instead, they&#8217;ve become a way to measure status and reinforce what is colloquially referred to as CYA culture.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a kernel of truth in every joke, so whenever someone quips, &#8220;This meeting could have been an email!&#8221; you can bet that some small part of them meant it sincerely.</p>
<p>Few people know how to run meetings effectively and keep conversations on track. Making matters worse, attendees often don&#8217;t bother to prepare, which makes a boring session even less productive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the complication of workplace politics: How secure do you feel declining an invitation from a co-worker — or a manager?</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time a recurring meeting is added to a calendar, a kitten dies,&#8221; says Chuck Phillips, co-founder of MeetWell. &#8220;Very few employees decline meetings, even when it’s obvious that the meeting is going to be a doozy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Changing your meeting culture is difficult, but given that 26% of workers plan to look for a new job when the pandemic ends, startups need to do all they can to retain talent.</p>
<p>Aimed at managers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/reform-your-startups-meeting-culture/">this post offers several testable strategies</a> that will help you boost productivity and say goodbye to poorly run, lazily planned meetings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Declining a bad meeting should never be taboo, and you should reiterate your trust in the team and challenge them to spend their and others’ time with more intention,&#8221; Phillips says. &#8220;Help them feel empowered to decline a bad meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch, and have a great weekend.</p>

<p>In the last year, online apparel shopping app Shein grew active daily users by 130%, reports Apptopia.</p>
<p>Each day, thousands of new products arrive on the app&#8217;s virtual shelves. Items are rapidly designed and prototyped before Shein&#8217;s contractors put them into production in Guangzhou factories — two weeks later, those SKUs arrive in fulfillment centers around the globe.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reporter Rita Liao examined how the company&#8217;s agile supply chain has become hot talk among e-commerce experts, but beyond a strong logistics game and data-driven product development, Shein&#8217;s close relationships with suppliers are integral to its success.</p>
<p>She also tried to answer a question many are asking: Is Shein a Chinese company?</p>
<p>“It’s hard to pin down where Shein is from,&#8221; answered Richard Xu from Grand View Capital, a Chinese venture capital firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a company with operations and supply chains in China targeting the global market, with nearly no business in China.”</p>

<p>MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner Marlon Nichols and Wonderschool CEO Chris Bennett joined Extra Crunch Live to tear down the company’s early deck.</p>
<p>“The first thing that jumped out at all of us was just how bare-bones the presentation is: white text on a blue background, largely made up of bullet points,” <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater'">Brian Heater</a> writes before noting the CEO admitted that “not much changed aesthetically between that first pitch and the Series A deck.”</p>
<p>“It aligned with what we were valuing at the time,” Bennett says. “We were really focused on getting the product-market fit and really trying to understand what our customers needed. And we’re really focused on building the team.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm calls SentinelOne’s looming debut “fascinating.”</p>
<p>“Why? Because the company sports a combination of rapid growth and expanding losses that make it a good heat check for the IPO market,” he writes. “Its debut will allow us to answer whether public investors still value growth above all else.”</p>

<p>Guest columnist Rob Hudock, a litigator who focuses on helping companies recruit the best talent available while avoiding distracting workplace issues or lawsuits, lays out the importance of putting out any employment-related fires before an exit.</p>
<p>“Inattention to employment issues can have a significant impact on deals — from preventing closings and reducing the deal value to altering the deal terms or significantly limiting the pool of potential buyers,” he writes.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, such issues typically can be resolved well in advance with a little forethought and legal guidance.”</p>

<p>Building an excellent product and a standout company culture require the same process, Heap CEO Ken Fine writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“At Heap, the analytics solution provider I lead, a defining principle is that good ideas should not be lost to top-down dictates and overrigid hierarchies,” he writes. “The best results come when you approach leadership like you would create a great product — you hypothesize, you test and iterate, and once you get it right, you grow it.”</p>
<p>Here, he lays out his method that argues in favor of iterative change, not “one-and-done decrees.”</p>

<p>The big news on Thursday was the announcement of Andreessen Horowitz’s new cryptocurrency-focused fund. Most focused on the eye-popping $2.2 billion figure, but Alex Wilhelm dug a bit deeper into the announcement to note that a16z isn’t just pumping a ton of money into the crypto space, it’s putting on gloves to fight for it.</p>
<p>Alex writes that “a16z intends to run defense for crypto in the American, and perhaps global, market. Crypto-focused startups are likely unable to tackle the regulation of their market on their own because they’re more focused on product work in a particular region of the larger crypto economy. The wealthy and connected investment firm that backs them will take on the task for its chosen champions.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm dives headfirst into BuzzFeed’s announcement that it plans to go public via a blank check company.</p>
<p>He looked at its historical and anticipated revenue growth (the latter is very sunny, which is not atypical for SPAC presentations), what makes up that revenue (more “commerce” as time goes on), its long-term profitability projections, as well as fun stuff, like the Pulitzer Prize-winning BuzzFeed News.</p>
<p>Admit it. You’re curious.</p>

<p>Moving from a pay-as-you-go model to a subscription service is more than just putting a monthly or yearly price tag on a product, CloudBlue’s Jess Warrington writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“Executives cannot just layer a subscription model on top of an existing business,” Warrington writes. “They need to change the entire operation process, onboard all stakeholders, recalibrate their strategy and create a subscription culture.”</p>
<p>Warrington says that in his role at CloudBlue, companies often approach him for “help with solving technology challenges while shifting to a subscription business model, only to realize that they have not taken crucial organizational steps necessary to ensure a successful transition.”</p>
<p>Here’s how to avoid that situation.</p>

<p>Rebecca Bellan interviewed Veo CEO Candice Xie about the micromobility startup’s “old-fashioned way” of doing business.</p>
<p>“I understand people are eager to prove their unit economics, their scalability and also improve their matrix to the VC to raise another round,” Xie says. “I would say that’s OK in the consumer industry, like consumer electronics or SaaS.</p>
<p>“But we are in transportation. It is a different business, and transportation takes years of collaboration and building between private and public partners. … So I don’t see it happening from day one, turning over a billion-dollar company, while simultaneously having it all make sense for the cities and users.”</p>

<p>All companies want more or less the same thing: growth. But how do you accomplish it?</p>
<p>Ideally, don’t start from scratch.</p>
<p>The race to grow faster is more pressing than ever before. … “[F]orward-thinking entrepreneurs and growth marketers simply must make time to study their competition, learn best practices and apply them to their own business growth,” Mark Spera, the head of growth marketing at Minted, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“Of course, you should still run your own experiments, but it’s just more capital-efficient to emulate than to trial-and-error from scratch. Here are five companies with growth strategies worth emulating — including the most important lessons you can begin applying to your business today.&#8221;</p>

<p>With more than 50 million Americans suffering from chronic pain and musculoskeletal (MSK) medical problems, a number of startups are offering patients new products &#8220;that don’t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo,&#8221; reports Natasha Mascarenhas.</p>
<p>Startups hoping to enter this space have an uphill climb. Setting aside regulations that cover aspects like product packaging and marketing, they must compete with well-entrenched competition from Big Pharma as they try to partner with health insurance companies.</p>
<p>Natasha profiles three companies that are each taking a different approach to personalized health: Clear, Hinge Health and PeerWell.</p>

<p>In the second part of an Exchange series looking at the global early-stage venture capital market, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim unpacked the scene in Latin America, discovering it looked a lot like the situation in the United States: slow Series A rounds, fast B rounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mega-rounds are no longer an exception in Latin America; in fact, they have become a trend, with ever-larger rounds being announced over the last few months,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>Despite that, the funds aren&#8217;t being equitably distributed, and the region still lags behind its peers: Brazil has the most $1 billion startups in Latin America, with 12. The U.S., meanwhile, has 369, and China has 159.</p>
<p>But the Latin American market remains hot, if not quite as scorching as the U.S. and China.</p>
