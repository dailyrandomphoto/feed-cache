					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 25, 2021. We have a great block of startup news and Amazon coverage for you today. But before we get into all of that, a note that there are only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/only-two-more-weeks-until-tc-early-stage-2021-marketing-fundraising/">two weeks left before our TechCrunch Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising event</a>. It’s going to rock, so check it out and get prepped. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/aws-is-buying-encrypted-messaging-service-wickr/">Amazon buys encrypted messaging service Wickr:</a> </strong>If you thought it was strange that an e-commerce company runs the world’s biggest public cloud service, it may feel even stranger that that same public cloud service just bought an encrypted messaging service. But in the platform era, tech companies want to do everything, so we should not be shocked. Amazon’s cloud team intends to “continue operating Wickr as is and offer its services to AWS customers” starting now. In related news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/amazon-and-google-face-uk-cma-probe-over-fake-reviews/">Amazon and Google are taking whacks in the U.K.</a> over fake reviews.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/faa-clears-virgin-galactic-for-commercial-astronaut-spaceflight/"><strong>Virgin is a go:</strong></a> The American government has cleared Virgin Galactic for commercial spaceflight. The result of the news? Shares of the SPAC’d company rose by nearly 39% today. So, it’s a liftoff moment for the company <em>and</em> its market cap.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/why-is-didi-worth-so-much-less-than-uber/"><strong>Didi’s confusing value:</strong></a> Closing out our Top 3 today, TechCrunch took a look at the Chinese ride-hailing giant’s first IPO price range. We’re curious why it looks and feels so cheap compared to its erstwhile rival, Uber.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>TechCrunch stretched its legs today, giving us a lot to discuss past the usual funding round roll call. Here’s what you should read:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/deep-science-keeping-ai-honest-in-medicine-climate-science-and-vision/">What’s new in Deep Science:</a></strong> Behind the scenes of startup glitz and venture capital glamor is a bunch of scientific work, the stuff that powers the next generation of tech and the startups of tomorrow. Devin Coldewey has a digest of science work ranging from predicting liquid flow based on still images to AI systems faking confidence.</li>
<li><strong>The rapidly evolving early-stage market: </strong>If you care about how and when and why early-stage startups raise capital, TechCrunch has lots for you this week. Here’s a look at today’s <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">early-stage venture capital market in the U.S</a></strong>., and <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/">here’s another focused on Latin America</a></strong>. More coming next week looking at what’s afoot in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, a host of startups raised more money. Here are a few highlights to keep you up to date:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/mercuryo-raises-7-5m-for-crypto-focused-cross-border-payments-after-crossing-50m-in-arr/">Mercuryo raises $7.5M for crypto-powered, cross-border payments:</a></strong> One key use of blockchain tech that was touted years ago was sending money around the world. Traditional banking is famously bad at this, leading to high fees and other issues. Mercuryo could be cracking the model and has crossed the $50 million ARR mark. Impressive.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/edge-delta-raises-15m-series-a-to-take-on-splunk/">Edge Delta raises $15M to take on data analysis giants:</a> </strong>The startup’s new Series A puts it into closer competition with Splunk, Datadog and other huge companies that sell cloud-based data monitoring services. The real story is somewhat technical, but happy we had <a href="https://twitter.com/fredericl">Frederic Lardinois</a> on hand to explain it to us.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/kaszek-ventures-leads-a-15-million-round-in-chilean-asset-management-startup-fintual/"><strong>Fintual raises $15M for Latin American retail investing:</strong></a> The Robinhood-led boom in retail investing that the United States has seen in recent years is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon. And Fintual wants to take a bite out of the trend in the Latin American market. The Chilean startup now has a Series A under its belt to power its fight against both regulation and incumbent players.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Musculoskeletal medical startups race to enter personalized health tech market</h2>
<p>With more than 50 million Americans suffering from chronic pain and musculoskeletal (MSK) medical problems, a number of startups are offering patients new products &#8220;that don’t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo,&#8221; reports <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a>.</p>
<p>Startups hoping to enter this space have an uphill climb. Setting aside regulations that cover aspects like product packaging and marketing, they must compete with well-entrenched competition from Big Pharma as they try to partner with health insurance companies.</p>
<p>Natasha profiles three companies that are each taking a different approach to personalized health: Clear, Hinge Health and PeerWell.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>From the world of Big Tech today we just have one more entry, as we covered Amazon’s big news up above. <a href="https://twitter.com/riptari">Natasha Lomas</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/linkedin-formally-joins-eu-code-on-hate-speech-takedowns/">reported today that</a> “Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has committed to doing more to quickly purge illegal hate speech from its platform in the European Union by formally signing up to a self-regulatory initiative that seeks to tackle the issue through a voluntary Code of Conduct.”</p>
<p>I wanted to raise this particular story because it somewhat underscores how internet regulation is shaping up around the world. You wouldn’t see this story, say, in the United States, or at least not in the same format. And in China, for example, another key internet market, it would also have a very different flavor. To some degree it feels like we’re dealing with three different &#8212; and increasingly distant &#8212; internets. Something for startups to chew on.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There's a kernel of truth in every joke, so whenever someone quips, "This meeting could have been an email!" you can bet that some small part of them meant it sincerely.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meetings should have a clear purpose, but instead, they&#8217;ve become a way to measure status and reinforce what is colloquially referred to as CYA culture.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a kernel of truth in every joke, so whenever someone quips, &#8220;This meeting could have been an email!&#8221; you can bet that some small part of them meant it sincerely.</p>
<p>Few people know how to run meetings effectively and keep conversations on track. Making matters worse, attendees often don&#8217;t bother to prepare, which makes a boring session even less productive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the complication of workplace politics: How secure do you feel declining an invitation from a co-worker — or a manager?</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time a recurring meeting is added to a calendar, a kitten dies,&#8221; says Chuck Phillips, co-founder of MeetWell. &#8220;Very few employees decline meetings, even when it’s obvious that the meeting is going to be a doozy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Changing your meeting culture is difficult, but given that 26% of workers plan to look for a new job when the pandemic ends, startups need to do all they can to retain talent.</p>
<p>Aimed at managers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/reform-your-startups-meeting-culture/">this post offers several testable strategies</a> that will help you boost productivity and say goodbye to poorly run, lazily planned meetings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Declining a bad meeting should never be taboo, and you should reiterate your trust in the team and challenge them to spend their and others’ time with more intention,&#8221; Phillips says. &#8220;Help them feel empowered to decline a bad meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch, and have a great weekend.</p>

<h2>Why Amazon should pay attention to Shein</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2167952" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167952" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2167952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="556" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png 1414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167952" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shein</p></div></p>
<p>In the last year, online apparel shopping app Shein grew active daily users by 130%, reports Apptopia.</p>
<p>Each day, thousands of new products arrive on the app&#8217;s virtual shelves. Items are rapidly designed and prototyped before Shein&#8217;s contractors put them into production in Guangzhou factories — two weeks later, those SKUs arrive in fulfillment centers around the globe.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reporter Rita Liao examined how the company&#8217;s agile supply chain has become hot talk among e-commerce experts, but beyond a strong logistics game and data-driven product development, Shein&#8217;s close relationships with suppliers are integral to its success.</p>
<p>She also tried to answer a question many are asking: Is Shein a Chinese company?</p>
<p>“It’s hard to pin down where Shein is from,&#8221; answered Richard Xu from Grand View Capital, a Chinese venture capital firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a company with operations and supply chains in China targeting the global market, with nearly no business in China.”</p>

<p>Fletcher joined TechCrunch at a virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> event to discuss what it’s like to launch a slew of startups under the umbrella of a 113-year-old automaker.</p>

<p>MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner Marlon Nichols and Wonderschool CEO Chris Bennett joined Extra Crunch Live to tear down the company’s early deck.</p>
<p>“The first thing that jumped out at all of us was just how bare-bones the presentation is: white text on a blue background, largely made up of bullet points,” <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater'">Brian Heater</a> writes before noting the CEO admitted that “not much changed aesthetically between that first pitch and the Series A deck.”</p>
<p>“It aligned with what we were valuing at the time,” Bennett says. “We were really focused on getting the product-market fit and really trying to understand what our customers needed. And we’re really focused on building the team.”</p>

<p><strong>I’ve been working on an H-1B in the U.S. for nearly two years. </strong></p>
<p><strong>While I’m grateful to have made it through the H-1B lottery and to be working, I’m feeling unhappy and frustrated with my job.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I really want to start something of my own and work on my own terms in the United States. Are there any immigration options that would allow me to do that?</strong></p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm calls SentinelOne’s looming debut “fascinating.”</p>
<p>“Why? Because the company sports a combination of rapid growth and expanding losses that make it a good heat check for the IPO market,” he writes. “Its debut will allow us to answer whether public investors still value growth above all else.”</p>
<p>Alex delves into an early dataset from SentinelOne and why public market investors still appear to value growth above anything else.</p>

<p>Guest columnist Rob Hudock, a litigator who focuses on helping companies recruit the best talent available while avoiding distracting workplace issues or lawsuits, lays out the importance of putting out any employment-related fires before an exit.</p>
<p>“Inattention to employment issues can have a significant impact on deals — from preventing closings and reducing the deal value to altering the deal terms or significantly limiting the pool of potential buyers,” he writes.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, such issues typically can be resolved well in advance with a little forethought and legal guidance.”</p>

<p>Building an excellent product and a standout company culture require the same process, Heap CEO Ken Fine writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“At Heap, the analytics solution provider I lead, a defining principle is that good ideas should not be lost to top-down dictates and overrigid hierarchies,” he writes. “The best results come when you approach leadership like you would create a great product — you hypothesize, you test and iterate, and once you get it right, you grow it.”</p>
<p>Here, he lays out his method that argues in favor of iterative change, not “one-and-done decrees.”</p>

<p>The big news on Thursday was the announcement of Andreessen Horowitz’s new cryptocurrency-focused fund. Most focused on the eye-popping $2.2 billion figure, but Alex Wilhelm dug a bit deeper into the announcement to note that a16z isn’t just pumping a ton of money into the crypto space, it’s putting on gloves to fight for it.</p>
<p>Alex writes that “a16z intends to run defense for crypto in the American, and perhaps global, market. Crypto-focused startups are likely unable to tackle the regulation of their market on their own because they’re more focused on product work in a particular region of the larger crypto economy. The wealthy and connected investment firm that backs them will take on the task for its chosen champions.”</p>

<p>He looked at its historical and anticipated revenue growth (the latter is very sunny, which is not atypical for SPAC presentations), what makes up that revenue (more “commerce” as time goes on), its long-term profitability projections, as well as fun stuff, like the Pulitzer Prize-winning BuzzFeed News.</p>

<p>Moving from a pay-as-you-go model to a subscription service is more than just putting a monthly or yearly price tag on a product, CloudBlue’s Jess Warrington writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“Executives cannot just layer a subscription model on top of an existing business,” Warrington writes. “They need to change the entire operation process, onboard all stakeholders, recalibrate their strategy and create a subscription culture.”</p>
<p>Warrington says that in his role at CloudBlue, companies often approach him for “help with solving technology challenges while shifting to a subscription business model, only to realize that they have not taken crucial organizational steps necessary to ensure a successful transition.”</p>
<p>Here’s how to avoid that situation.</p>

<p>Rebecca Bellan interviewed Veo CEO Candice Xie about the micromobility startup’s “old-fashioned way” of doing business.</p>
<p>“I understand people are eager to prove their unit economics, their scalability and also improve their matrix to the VC to raise another round,” Xie says. “I would say that’s OK in the consumer industry, like consumer electronics or SaaS.</p>
<p>“But we are in transportation. It is a different business, and transportation takes years of collaboration and building between private and public partners. … So I don’t see it happening from day one, turning over a billion-dollar company, while simultaneously having it all make sense for the cities and users.”</p>

<p>All companies want more or less the same thing: growth. But how do you accomplish it?</p>
<p>Ideally, don’t start from scratch.</p>
<p>The race to grow faster is more pressing than ever before. … “[F]orward-thinking entrepreneurs and growth marketers simply must make time to study their competition, learn best practices and apply them to their own business growth,” Mark Spera, the head of growth marketing at Minted, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“Of course, you should still run your own experiments, but it’s just more capital-efficient to emulate than to trial-and-error from scratch. Here are five companies with growth strategies worth emulating — including the most important lessons you can begin applying to your business today.&#8221;</p>

<p>With more than 50 million Americans suffering from chronic pain and musculoskeletal (MSK) medical problems, a number of startups are offering patients new products &#8220;that don’t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo,&#8221; reports Natasha Mascarenhas.</p>
<p>Startups hoping to enter this space have an uphill climb. Setting aside regulations that cover aspects like product packaging and marketing, they must compete with well-entrenched competition from Big Pharma as they try to partner with health insurance companies.</p>
<p>Natasha profiles three companies that are each taking a different approach to personalized health: Clear, Hinge Health and PeerWell.</p>

<p>In the second part of an Exchange series looking at the global early-stage venture capital market, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim unpacked the scene in Latin America, discovering it looked a lot like the situation in the United States: slow Series A rounds, fast B rounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mega-rounds are no longer an exception in Latin America; in fact, they have become a trend, with ever-larger rounds being announced over the last few months,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>Despite that, the funds aren&#8217;t being equitably distributed, and the region still lags behind its peers: Brazil has the most $1 billion startups in Latin America, with 12. The U.S., meanwhile, has 369, and China has 159.</p>
<p>But the Latin American market remains hot, if not quite as scorching as the U.S. and China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers at <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/carbon-nanomaterial-light-strong-0624">MIT</a> and <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/nano-architected-material-resists-impact-better-than-kevlar">Caltech</a> have created a nanoengineered material that could be tougher than the likes of kevlar or steel. Made of interconnected carbon &#8220;tetrakaidecahedrons,&#8221; the material absorbed the impact of microscopic bullets in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p>The study, led by MIT&#8217;s Carlos Portela, aimed to find out whether nanoarchitected materials — that is, designed and fabricated at the scale of nanometers — could be a viable path toward ultratough blast shields, body armor and other protective surfaces.</p>
<p>The idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetradecahedron">tetrakaidecahedron</a>-based materials, however, isn&#8217;t a new one. The complex 14-sided class of polyhedron (there are about 1.5 billion possible variations) was proposed by Lord Kelvin in the 19th century as theoretically one of the most efficient possible for filling space with duplicates of itself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If many such polyhedra can be packed into a small space and interconnected, Portela and his colleagues wondered, would they act as an efficient shock absorber? Such materials had been tested with slow deformations but not powerful impacts like you would expect from a bullet or micrometeoroid.</p>
<p>To find out, they assembled blocks of the material by means of nanolithography techniques, baking the resulting structure until it was pure carbon. Then they shot these carbon structures with 14-micron-wide silicon oxide bullets traveling well above the speed of sound (though at these scales, the comparison is a bit quaint).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170508" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170508" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170508" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg" alt="Close-up of silicon oxide 'bullet' embedded in the carbon material" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170508" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIT/Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>The carbon structures, especially denser ones, absorbed the impact extremely well, stopping the particle dead — and crucially, deforming but not shattering.</p>
<p>&#8220;We show the material can absorb a lot of energy because of this shock compaction mechanism of struts at the nanoscale versus something that&#8217;s fully dense and monolithic, not nanoarchitected,&#8221; said Portela in a news release describing the discovery. &#8220;The same amount of mass of our material would be much more efficient at stopping a projectile than the same amount of mass of Kevlar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the researchers found they were able to model the impact and damage best by using methods generally used to describe meteors impacting a planet&#8217;s surface.</p>
<p>This is just an initial lab result, so soldiers won&#8217;t be wearing tetrakaidecahedronal flak jackets any time soon, but the experiment definitely shows the promise of this approach. If the team is able to find a way to manufacture the material at scale, it could be useful in all kinds of industries.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01033-z">Nature Materials</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Chinese ride-hailing giant appears set to be valued at a discount to its U.S. counterpart. By several tens of billions of dollars, it turns out. And we can’t quite figure out why.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Years ago, U.S. ride-hailing giant Uber and its Chinese rival Didi were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/31/uber-china-will-reportedly-merge-with-archrival-didi-chuxing/">locked in an expensive rivalry</a> in the Asian nation. After a financially bruising competition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/">Uber sold its China-based business to Didi</a>, focusing instead on other markets.</p>
<p>The two companies are coming head-to-head again, however, as Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">looks to list in the United States</a>. The company&#8217;s IPO filing was big news for the SoftBank Vision Fund, Tencent and Uber, thanks to its stake in Didi from its earlier transaction.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Uber is more diversified both geographically and in terms of its revenue mix. Didi is larger, more profitable and more concentrated.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But Didi appears set to be valued at a discount to Uber. By several tens of billions of dollars, it turns out. And we can&#8217;t quite figure out why.</p>
<p>This week, Didi indicated that it will target a $13 to $14 per-share IPO price, with each share on the U.S. markets worth one-fourth of a Class A share in the company. In more technical language, each <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp">ADR</a> is 25% of a Class A ordinary share in Didi, if you prefer it put like that.</p>
<p>With 288 million shares to be sold in its U.S. IPO, Didi could raise as much as $4.03 billion, a huge sum.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Didi worth at $13 to $14 per ADR? Using a nondiluted share count, Didi is valued between $62.3 billion and $67.1 billion. Inclusive of shares that may be issued thanks to vested options and the like, Didi could be worth <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/didi-sets-valuation-target-of-62-billion-to-67-billion-in-ipo-11624575164">as much as $70 billion</a>; Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/83198/Chinese-ride-hailing-giant-DiDi-Global-sets-terms-for-$3.9-billion-US-IPO">calculates</a> the company&#8217;s midpoint valuation using a fully diluted share count at $67.5 billion.</p>
<p>Regardless of which number you prefer, Didi is not set to challenge Uber&#8217;s own valuation. Yahoo Finance pegged Uber at $95.2 billion as of this morning.</p>
<p>Why is the Chinese company worth less than its erstwhile rival? Let&#8217;s dig around in their numbers and find out.</p>
<h2>Didi versus Uber</h2>
<p>As a reminder, Uber&#8217;s Q1 2021 included adjusted revenues of $3.5 billion, a gain of 8% compared to the year-ago quarter. Uber&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA came in for the period at -$359 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It is said that the best way to lose the next war is to keep fighting the last one. The citadels of the medieval ages were an effective defense until gunpowder and cannons changed siege warfare forever. Battlefield superiority based on raw troop numbers ceded to the power of artillery and the machine gun.</p>
<p>During World War I, tanks were the innovation that literally rolled over fortifications built using 19th-century technology. Throughout military history, innovators enjoyed the spoils of war while those who took too long to adapt were left crushed and defeated.</p>
<p>Cyberwarfare is no different, with conventional weapons yielding to technologies that are just as deadly to our economic and national security. Despite our military superiority and advances on the cyber front, America is still fighting a digital enemy using analog ways of thinking.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Despite our military superiority and advances on the cyber front, America is still fighting a digital enemy using analog ways of thinking.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This must change, and it begins with the government making some difficult choices about how to wield its offensive powers against an enemy hidden in the shadows, how to partner with the private sector and what it will take to protect the nation against hostile actors that threaten our very way of life.</p>
<h2>Colonial Pipeline was one step forward, two steps back</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/us/politics/cyberattack-colonial-pipeline.html">ransomware attack</a> against Colonial Pipeline, the Russia-linked hacking group known as DarkSide reportedly shuttered and the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> recovered part of the $4.4 million ransom that was paid. These are positive developments and an indicator that our government is taking these types of attacks seriously. But it does not change the fact that cyberterrorists, acting with impunity in a hostile foreign country using a technique that has been known for years, managed to shut down the country’s largest oil pipeline and walk away with millions of dollars in ransom payments. They will likely never face justice, Russia will not face any real consequences and these attacks will no doubt continue.</p>
<p>The reality is that while companies can get smarter about cyber defenses and users can get more vigilant in their cyber hygiene practices, only the government has the power to bring this behavior to a halt.</p>
<p>Countries that permit cybercriminals to operate within their borders should be made to hand them over or be subject to crippling economic sanctions. Those found providing sanctuary or other assistance to such individuals or groups should face material support charges like anyone who assists a designated terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Regulators should insist that cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets help track down illicit transactions and parties or be cut off from the U.S. financial system. Law enforcement, the military and the intelligence community should be aggressively working to make it so difficult, so unsafe and so unprofitable for cyberterrorists to operate that they would not dare attempt another attack against American industry or critical infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Government must facilitate cooperation with private actors</h2>
<p>Our biggest vulnerability and missed opportunity is the inability of public and private entities to form a unified front against cyberwar. It is essential from both a defensive and offensive perspective that the government and private sectors share cyber risk and incident information in real time. This is not currently happening.</p>
<p>Companies are too scared that in revealing vulnerabilities they will be sued, investigated and further victimized by the very government that is supposed to help them defend against attack. The federal government still has no answer for the problems of overclassification of information, overlapping bureaucracies and cultural barriers that provide no incentive to proactively engage with private industry to share information and technologies.</p>
<p>The answer is not to strong-arm companies into coming to the table and expect one-way information flow. Private actors should be able to come forward voluntarily and share information without having to fear plaintiff litigation and regulatory action. Self-disclosed cyber data made in real time should be kept confidential and used to defend and fight back, not to further punish the victim. That is no basis for a mutual partnership.</p>
<p>And if federal agencies, the military or the intelligence community have intelligence about future attacks and how to prevent them, they should not sit on it until long after it will do any good. There are ways to share information with private industry that are safe, timely and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Cooperation should also go beyond the exchange of cyber event information. The private sector and academia account for a massive amount of advancement in the cyber space, with total research and development spending split roughly <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/us/bed/research-development-expenditure/4706/">90%-10% between the private and public sector</a> over the past two decades.</p>
<p>Our private sector &#8212; with technology companies employing the best and brightest spanning from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, to the technology corridor of Northern Virginia &#8212; has a tremendous amount to offer to the government yet remains a largely untapped resource. The same innovations driving private-sector profit should be used to strengthen national security.</p>
<p>China has already figured this out, and if we cannot find a way to leverage private-sector innovation and young talent in the United States, we will fall behind. If there has ever been a call to action where the Biden administration, Democrats and Republicans in Congress can set politics aside and embrace <a href="https://www.axios.com/senator-warner-calls-congress-cyberattacks-6313c867-a67e-4836-9d47-f09d45a6faeb.html">bipartisan solutions</a>, this is it.</p>
<h2>Look to the military-defense industry model</h2>
<p>Thankfully, there is a model public-private dynamic that in many ways is working. Weapons systems today are almost exclusively manufactured by the <a href="https://www.idb.org/what-is-the-defense-industrial-base/">Defense Industrial Base</a>, and when deployed to the battlefield there is constant two-way communication with warfighters about vulnerabilities, threats and opportunities to improve effectiveness. This relationship was not forged overnight and is far from perfect. But after decades of efforts, secure collaboration platforms were developed, security clearance standards were established and trust was formed.</p>
<p>We must do the same between cyber authorities in the federal government and actors throughout the private sector. Financial institutions, energy companies, retailers, manufacturers and pharmaceuticals must be able to engage the government to share real-time cyber data in both directions. If the federal government learns of a threat group or technique, it should not only take the offensive to shut it down but also push that information securely and quickly to the private sector.</p>
<p>It is not practical for the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security or the military to assume the burden of defending private networks against cyberattacks, but the government can and should be a shoulder-to-shoulder partner in the effort. We must adopt a relationship that recognizes this is both a joint battle and burden, and we do not have years to get it right.</p>
<h2>Call to action</h2>
<p>When you look at the history of war, the advantage has always gone to those who innovate first. With respect to cyberwarfare, the solution does not lie solely in advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing or blockchain. The most powerful development in today’s war against cyberterrorism might be as simple as what we all learned in preschool: the value of sharing and cooperation.</p>
<p>The government, the technology industry and the broader private sector must come together not only to maintain our competitive edge and embrace advances like cloud computing, autonomous vehicles and 5G, but to ensure that we defend and preserve our way of life. We have been successful in building public and private partnerships in the past and can evolve from an analog relationship to a digital one. But the government must take the reins and lead the way.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This week, we'll explore a number of projects aimed at identifying or confirming bias or cheating behaviors in machine learning systems, or failures in the data that support them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Research papers come out far too frequently for anyone to read them all. That’s especially true in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/deep-science/">This column</a> aims to collect some of the more interesting recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>This week we have a number of entries aimed at identifying or confirming bias or cheating behaviors in machine learning systems, or failures in the data that support them. But first a purely <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/06/14/uw-researchers-turn-single-photo-into-video/">visually appealing project</a> from the University of Washington being presented at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.</p>
<p>They trained a system that recognizes and predicts the flow of water, clouds, smoke and other fluid features in photos, animating them from a single still image. The result is quite cool:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169362" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/symmetric-720-GIF.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169362" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/symmetric-720-GIF.gif" alt="Animation showing how a system combined guesses at previous and forthcoming moments to animate a waterfall." width="600" height="338" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2169362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hołyński et al./CVPR</p></div></p>
<p>Why, though? Well, for one thing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/">the future of photography is code</a>, and the better our cameras understand the world they&#8217;re pointed at, the better they can accommodate or recreate it. Fake river flow isn&#8217;t in high demand, but accurately predicting movement and the behavior of common photo features is.</p>
<p>An important question to answer in the creation and application of any machine learning system is whether it&#8217;s actually doing the thing you want it to. The history of &#8220;AI&#8221; is riddled with examples of models that found a way to look like they&#8217;re performing a task without actually doing it — sort of like a kid kicking everything under the bed when they&#8217;re supposed to clean their room.</p>
<p>This is a serious problem in the medical field, where a system that&#8217;s faking it could have dire consequences. <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uow-mam052721.php">A study, also from UW, finds</a> models proposed in the literature have a tendency to do this, in what the researchers call &#8220;shortcut learning.&#8221; These shortcuts could be simple — basing an X-ray&#8217;s risk on the patient&#8217;s demographics rather than the data in the image, for instance — or more unique, like relying heavily on conditions in the hospital its data is from, making it impossible to generalize to others.</p>
<p>The team found that many models basically failed when used on datasets that differed from their training ones. They hope that advances in machine learning transparency (opening the &#8220;black box&#8221;) will make it easier to tell when these systems are skirting the rules.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mega-rounds are no longer an exception in Latin America; in fact, they have become a trend, with ever-larger rounds being announced over the last few months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">wrote about the early-stage venture capital market</a>, with the goal of understanding how some startups are raising more seed capital before they work on their Series A, while other startups are seemingly raising their first lettered round while in the nascent stages of scaling.</p>
<p>The expedition was rooted in commentary from <a href="https://twitter.com/rudina11?lang=en">Rudina Seseri of Glasswing Ventures</a>, who said abundant seed capital in the United States allows founders to get a lot done before they raise a Series A, effectively delaying these rounds. But after those founders did raise that A, their Series B round could rapidly follow thanks to later-stage money showing up in earlier-stage deals in hopes of snagging ownership in hot companies.</p>
<p>The idea? Slow As, fast Bs.</p>
<p>After chatting with Seseri more and a number of other venture capitalists about the concept, a second dynamic emerged. Namely that the “typical” early-stage funding round, as Seseri described it, was “becoming atypical because of the rise of preemptive rounds [in which] typical expectations on metrics go out the window.”</p>

<p>Series As, she said, could come mere months after a seed deal, and Series B rounds were seeing expected revenue thresholds tumble in part to “large, multiasset players that have come down market and are offering a different product than typical VCs &#8212; very fast term sheets, no active involvement post-investment, large investments amounts and high valuations.”</p>
<p>Focusing on just the Series A dynamic, the old rule of thumb that a startup would need to reach $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) is now often moot. Some startups are delaying their A rounds until they reach $2 million in ARR thanks to ample seed capital.</p>

<p>What’s different between the two groups? Startups with &#8220;elite status&#8221; are able to jump ahead to their Series A, while other founders spend more time cobbling together adequate seed capital to get to sufficient scale to attract an A.</p>
<p>The dynamic is not merely a United States phenomenon. The two-tier venture capital market is also showing up in Latin America, a globally important and rapidly expanding startup region. (Brazilian fintech startup Nubank, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">just closed a $750 million round</a>.)</p>
<p>This morning, we’re diving into the Latin American venture capital market and its early-stage dynamics. We also have notes on the European scene, so expect more on the topic next week. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s hot</h2>
<p>Mega-rounds are no longer an exception in Latin America; in fact, they have become a trend, with ever-larger rounds being announced over the last few months.</p>
<p>The announcements themselves often emphasize round size: For instance, the recent $100 million Series B round into Colombian proptech startup Habi was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623005589/en/Habi-Raises-100-Million-Series-B-Led-by-SoftBank-and-Expands-Footprint-into-Mexico">touted</a> as &#8220;the largest Series B for a startup headquartered in Colombia.&#8221; This follows other 2021 records such as &#8220;the largest Series A for Mexico &#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mexican-online-grocer-justo-raises-65m-in-general-atlantic-led-series-a/">$65 million for online grocer Jüsto</a> &#8212; and &#8220;the largest Series A ever raised by a Latin American fintech&#8221; &#8212;  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/belvo-latams-answer-to-plaid-raises-43m-series-a-to-scale-its-api-for-financial-services/">$43 million</a> for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/">&#8220;Plaid for Latin America&#8221;</a> Belvo.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mercuryo.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that has built a cross-border payments network, has raised $7.5 million in a Series A round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based company describes itself as “a crypto infrastructure company” that aims to make blockchain useful for businesses via its “digital asset payment gateway.” Specifically, it aggregates various payment solutions and provides fiat and crypto payments and payouts for businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put more simply, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo aims to use </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies as a tool for putting in motion next-gen, cross-border transfers or, as it puts it, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“to allow any business to become a fintech company without the need to keep up with its complications.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The need for fast and efficient international payments, especially for businesses, is as relevant as ever,” said Petr Kozyakov, Mercuryo’s co-founder and CEO. While there is no shortage of companies enabling cross-border payments, the startup’s emphasis on crypto is a differentiator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our team has a clear plan on making crypto universally available by enabling cheap and straightforward transactions,” Kozyakov said. “Cryptocurrency assets can then be used to process global money transfers, mass payouts and facilitate acquiring services, among other things.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170352" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170352" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170352 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Alexander-Vasiliev-Greg-Waisman-Petr-Kozyakov--e1624639508126.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1331" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170352" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Left to right: Alexander Vasiliev, Greg Waisman, Petr Kozyakov / MercuryO</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo began onboarding customers at the beginning of 2019, and has seen impressive growth since with annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April surpassing over $50 million. Its customer base is approaching 1 million, and the company has partnerships with a number of large crypto players including Binance, Bitfinex, Trezor, Trust Wallet, Bithumb and Bybit. In 2020, the company said its turnover spiked by 50 times while run-rate turnover crossed $2.5 billion in April 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build on that momentum, Mercuryo has begun expanding to new markets, including the United States, where it launched its crypto payments offering for B2B customers in all states earlier this year. It also plans to “gradually” expand to Africa, South America and Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Target Global led Mercuryo’s Series A, which also included </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participation from a group of angel investors and brings the startup&#8217;s total raised since its 2018 inception to over $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to launch a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency debit card (spending globally directly from the crypto balance in the wallet) and continuing to expand to new markets, such as Latin America and Asia-Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo’s various products include a multicurrency wallet with a built-in crypto exchange and digital asset purchasing functionality, a widget and high-volume cryptocurrency acquiring and OTC services.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kozyakov says the company doesn’t charge for currency conversion and has no other “hidden fees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We enable instant and easy cross-border transactions for our partners and their customers,” he said. “Also, the money transfer services lack intermediaries and require no additional steps to finalize transactions. Instead, the process narrows down to only two operations: a fiat-to-crypto exchange when sending a transfer and a crypto-to-fiat conversion when receiving funds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo also offers crypto SaaS products, giving customers a way to buy crypto via their fiat accounts while delegating digital asset management to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether it be virtual accounts or third-party customer wallets, the company handles most cryptocurrency-related processes for banks, so they can focus more on their core operations,” Kozyakov said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Lobanov, Target Global’s co-founder, said that as an experiment, his firm tested numerous solutions to buy Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Doing our diligence, we measured ‘time to crypto’ – how long it takes from going to the App Store and downloading the app until the digital assets arrive in the wallet,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo came first with 6 minutes, including everything from KYC and funding to getting the cryptocurrency, according to Lobanov.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The second-best result was 20 minutes, while some apps took forever to process our transaction,” he added. “This company is a game-changer in the field, and we are delighted to have been their supporters since the early days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup plans to release a product that will give businesses a way to send instant mass payments to multiple customers and gig workers simultaneously, no matter where the receiver is located.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Several personalized health tech startups hope to reinvent care for patients suffering from musculoskeletal (MSK) medical conditions and chronic pain.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic unevenly roars on, <a href="https://twitter.com/emelton?lang=en">Emily Melton</a>, founder and managing partner of <a href="https://threshold.vc/">Threshold VC</a>, is reflecting on a previous public health crisis: the Spanish flu.</p>
<p>She says the response just over a century ago prompted the rise of interventional medicine — treating illness through surgery or medicine only after symptoms manifest. Today, interventional medicine is the dominant mindset in Western healthcare. And, Melton, a lead investor in health tech startups including Livongo, Tia and Calibrate, says the care pathway ages well.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Personalized medicine — the buzzy yet powerful framing growing in popularity among Silicon Valley startups — is a delivery system in which patients receive more holistic care that takes into account multiple symptoms or comorbidities.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s happening in our society? Chronic diseases, chronic pain, diabetes and obesity,” she said. “That doesn’t require a magic pill and there&#8217;s not just a surgery. Oftentimes, there’s therapeutic components, behavior changes and movable touch points.”</p>
<p>Enter personalized medicine. The buzzy yet powerful framing is growing in popularity among Silicon Valley startups. It’s a delivery system in which patients receive more holistic care that takes into account multiple symptoms or comorbidities. In hormonal health, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">personalized medicine could add more data and specificity</a> to which birth control someone takes, instead of the usual process of trial and error. Essentially, it’s the opposite of interventional medicine.</p>
<p>“We’re not just an arm or a leg, we’re not just obese or a diabetic or a pain sufferer,” Melton said. “How do we treat you as a whole person?”</p>
<p>A number of companies are using this approach to reinvent care for patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) medical conditions and chronic pain. These conditions are commonly treated with addictive opioids, a major public health concern. As an estimated 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, entrepreneurs are working on solutions that don’t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo. And the money market is certainly there: In 2017, the global MSK medical market <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/3973843/musculoskeletal-diseases-market-forecast-2020#:~:text=The%20global%20musculoskeletal%20diseases%20Market,5.5%25%20during%202018%20to%202023.">was valued at $57.4 billion</a>; the market for chronic pain, which overlaps with MSK medicine, is expected to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chronic-pain-treatment-market-to-cross-151-7-billion-value-by-2030-ps-intelligence-301136366.html">hit $151.7 billion in value by 2030.</a></p>
<p>“Oftentimes it&#8217;s not new ideas, it&#8217;s conflating a number of factors that come together at one moment in time that allow exponential change that makes a startup work,” Melton said, of the boom and recent activity in MSK medicine. Today, we’ll focus on three startups taking different approaches to help people suffering from chronic pain and MSK-related conditions: Clearing, PeerWell and Hinge Health.</p>
<h2><strong>Clearing</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avi-dorfman-3a89803/">Avi Dorfman</a> says going direct to consumers is the most effective way to treat chronic pain, so he founded<a href="https://www.clearing.com/"> Clearing</a>. The digital health startup worked with a medical advisory board of physicians and researchers from Harvard, Johns Hopkins and NYC&#8217;s Hospital for Special Surgery to create an opioid-free solution for people struggling with pain.</p>
<p>Last month, Clearing raised a $20 million seed round led by Bessemer and Founders Fund. Melton also invested in the round on behalf of Threshold.</p>
<p>Clearing offers four products: prescription compound cream that includes FDA-approved ingredients, CBD cream for topical discomfort, nutraceuticals to supplement joint health, and a directory of prerecorded, at-home exercises. It currently is available to patients in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The EU for all its lethargy, faults and fetishization of bureaucracy, is, ultimately, a good idea. It might be 64 years from the formation of the European Common Market, but it is 29 years since the EU&#8217;s formation in the Maastricht Treaty, and this international entity is definitely still acting like an indecisive millennial, happy to flit around tech startup policy. It’s long due time for this digital nomad to commit to one ‘location’ on how it treats startups.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing we can all agree on, this is a unique moment in time. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the acceptance of technology globally, especially in Europe. Thankfully, tech companies and startups have proven to be more resilient than much of the established economy. As a result, the EU’s political leaders have started to look towards the innovation economy for a more sustainable future in Europe.</p>
<p>But this moment has not come soon enough.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The European tech scene is still lagging behind its US and Asia counterparts in numbers of startups created, talent in the tech sector, financing rounds, and IPOs / exits. It doesn’t help, of course, that the European market is so fractionalized, and will be for a long time to come.</p>
<p>But there is absolutely no excuse when it comes to the EU’s obligations to reform startup legislation, taxation, and the development of talent, to “level the playing field” against the US and Asian tech giants.</p>
<p>But, to put it bluntly: The EU can’t seem to get its shit together around startups.</p>
<p>Consider this litany of proposals.</p>
<p>Starting as far back a 2016 we had the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2016%3A733%3AFIN">Start-Up and Scale-Up Initiative</a>. We even had the <a href="https://europeanstartupnetwork.eu/european-scaleup-manifesto/">Scale-Up Manifesto</a> in the same year. Then there was the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/startup-communities-look-ahead-11-concrete-policy-recommendations-european-leaders">Cluj Recommendations</a> (2019), and the <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu/en">Not Optional</a> campaign for options reform in 2020.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, the community of VC´s, founders, and startup associations in Europe has been saying mostly the same things for <em>years</em>, to national and European leaders.</p>
<p>Finally, this year, we got something approaching a summation of all these efforts.</p>
<p>Portugal, which has the European presidency for the first half of this year, took the bull by its horns and created something approaching a final draft of what the EU needs.</p>
<p>After, <em>again</em>, intense consultations with European ecosystem stakeholders, it identified eight best practices in order to level the playing field covering the gamut of issues such as fast startup creation, talent, stock options, innovation in regulation and access to finance. You name it, it covered it.</p>
<p>These were then put into the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/startup-europe">Startup Nations Standard</a> and presented to the European Council at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziTo5UOYnk8">Digital Day</a> on March 19th, together with the European Commission&#8217;s DG CNECT and its Commissioner Tierry Breton. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/on-friday-the-eu-will-put-startup-friendly-legislation-to-member-states-will-they-sign-up/">wrote about</a> this at the time.</p>
<p>Would the EU finally get a grip, and sign up for these evidently workable proposals?</p>
<p>It seemed, at least, that we might be getting somewhere. Some 25 member states signed the declaration that day, and perhaps for the first time, the political consensus seemed to be forming around this policy.</p>
<p>Indeed, a body set up to shepherd the initiative (the European Startup Nations Alliance) was even announced by Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa which, he said, would be tasked with monitoring, developing and optimizing the standards, collecting data from the member states on their success and failure, and reporting on its findings in a bi-annual conference aligned with the changing presidency of the European Council.</p>
<p>It would seem we could pop open a chilled bottle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bairrada_DOC">DOC Bairrada Espumante</a> and celebrate that Europe might finally start implementing at least the basics from these suggested policies.</p>
<p>But no. With the pandemic still raging, it seemed the EU&#8217;s leaders still had plenty of time on their hands to ponder these subjects.</p>
<p>Thus it was that the <a href="https://scaleupeurope.tech/">Scaleup Europe</a> initiative emerged from the mind of Emmanuel Macron, assembling a select group of 150-plus of Europe’s leading tech founders, investors, researchers, corporate CEOs and government officials to do some more pondering about startups. And then there was the <a href="https://europeanstartupnetwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Press-Release-10-May-2021-Action-Plan-to-Make-Europe-the-new-Global-Powerhouse-for-Startups.pdf">Global Powerhouse Initiative</a> of DG Research &amp; Innovations Commissioner, Mariya Gabriel.</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we were about to go through this process all over again, with the EU acting as if it had the memory span of a giant goldfish.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not arguing that all these collective actions are a bad thing. But, by golly, European startups need more decisive action than this.</p>
<p>As things stand, instead of implementing the very reasonable Portuguese proposals, we will now have to wait for the EU&#8217;s wheels to slowly turn until the French presidency comes around next year.</p>
<p>That said, with any luck, a body to oversee the implementation of tech startup policy that is mandated by the European community, composed of organizations like <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/">La French Tech</a>, <a href="https://startupportugal.com/">Startup Portugal</a> and <a href="https://startupestonia.ee/en">Startup Estonia</a>, might finally seem within reach.</p>
<p>But to anyone from the outside, it feels again as if the gnashing of EU policy teeth will have to go on yet longer. With the French calling for a &#8216;La French Tech for Europe&#8217; and the Portuguese having already launched ESNA, the efforts seem far from coordinated.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, tech startup founders and investors could not care less where this new body comes from or which country launches it.</p>
<p>After years of contributions, years of consultations, the time for action is now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for EU member states to agree, and move forward, helping other member states catch up based on established best practices.</p>
<p>It’s time for the long-awaited European Tech Giants to blossom, take on the US-born Big Tech Giants, and for Europe to finally punch its weight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has committed to doing more to quickly purge illegal hate speech from its platform in the European Union by formally signing up to a self-regulatory initiative that seeks to tackle the issue through a voluntary Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_3221">statement today</a>, the European Commission announced that the professional social network has joined the EU&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Countering Illegal Hate Speech Online, with justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, welcoming LinkedIn&#8217;s (albeit tardy) participation, and adding in a statement that the code &#8220;is and will remain an important tool in the fight against hate speech, including within the framework established by digital services legislation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I invite more businesses to join, so that the online world is free from hate,&#8221; Reynders added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While LinkedIn&#8217;s name wasn&#8217;t formally associated with the voluntary Code before now it said it has &#8220;supported&#8221; the effort via parent company Microsoft, which was already signed up.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/june/24/keeping-conversations-safe--trusted-and-professional">statement</a> on its decision to formally join now, it also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;LinkedIn is a place for professional conversations where people come to connect, learn and find new opportunities. Given the current economic climate and the increased reliance jobseekers and professionals everywhere are placing on LinkedIn, our responsibility is to help create safe experiences for our members. We couldn’t be clearer that hate speech is not tolerated on our platform. LinkedIn is a strong part of our members’ professional identities for the entirety of their career &#8212; it can be seen by their employer, colleagues and potential business partners.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the EU &#8216;illegal hate speech&#8217; can mean content that espouses racist or xenophobic views, or which seeks to incite violence or hatred against groups of people because of their race, skin color, religion or ethnic origin etc.</p>
<p>A number of Member States have national laws on the issue &#8212; and some have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/germany-tightens-online-hate-speech-rules-to-make-platforms-send-reports-straight-to-the-feds/">passed their own legislation</a> specifically targeted at the digital sphere. So the EU Code is supplementary to any actual hate speech legislation. It is also non-legally binding.</p>
<p>The initiative kicked off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/facebook-twitter-youtube-and-microsoft-agree-to-remove-hate-speech-across-the-eu/">back in 2016</a> &#8212; when a handful of tech giants (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft) agreed to accelerate takedowns of illegal speech (or well, attach their brand names to the PR opportunity associated with saying they would).</p>
<p>Since the Code became operational, a handful of other tech platforms have joined &#8212; with video sharing platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/tiktok-joins-europes-code-on-tackling-hate-speech/">TikTok signing up last October</a>, for example.</p>
<p>But plenty of digital services (notably messaging platforms) still aren&#8217;t participating. Hence the Commission&#8217;s call for more digital services companies to get on board.</p>
<p>At the same time, the EU is in the process of firming up hard rules in the area of illegal content.</p>
<p>L<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ast year the Commission proposed broad updates (aka the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a>) to existing ecommerce rules </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">to set operational ground rules that they said are intended to bring online laws in line with offline legal requirements &#8212; in areas such as illegal content, and indeed illegal goods. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So, in the coming years, the bloc will get a legal framework that tackles &#8212; at least at a high level &#8212; the hate speech issue, not merely a voluntary Code. </span></p>
<p>The EU also recently adopted legislation on terrorist content takedowns (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/eu-adopts-rules-on-one-hour-takedowns-for-terrorist-content/">this April</a>) &#8212; which is set to start applying to online platforms from next year.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s interesting to note that, on the perhaps more controversial issue of hate speech (which can deeply intersect with freedom of expression), the Commission wants to maintain a self-regulatory channel alongside incoming legislation &#8212; as Reynders&#8217; remarks underline.</p>
<p>Brussels evidently sees value in having a mixture of &#8216;carrots and sticks&#8217; where hot button digital regulation issues are concerned. Especially in the controversial &#8216;danger zone&#8217; of speech regulation.</p>
<p>So, while the DSA is set to bake in standardized &#8216;notice and response&#8217; procedures to help digital players swiftly respond to illegal content, by keeping the hate speech Code around it means there&#8217;s a parallel conduit where key platforms could be encouraged by the Commission to commit to going further than the letter of the law (and thereby enable lawmakers to sidestep any controversy if they were to try to push more expansive speech moderation measures into legislation).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On illegal hate speech, EU lawmakers eye binding transparency for platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/on-illegal-hate-speech-eu-lawmakers-eye-binding-transparency-for-platforms/embed/#?secret=0xiDOW6QPK" data-secret="0xiDOW6QPK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The EU has &#8212; for several years &#8212; had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/">voluntary a Code of Practice on Online Disinformation</a> too. (And a spokeswoman for LinkedIn confirmed it has been signed up to that since its inception, also through its parent company Microsoft.)</p>
<p>And while lawmakers recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">announced a plan to beef that Code up</a> &#8212; to make it &#8220;more binding&#8221;, as they oxymoronically put it &#8212; it certainly isn&#8217;t planning to legislate on that (even fuzzier) speech issue.</p>
<p>In further public remarks today on the hate speech Code, the Commission said that a fifth monitoring exercise in June 2020 showed that on average companies reviewed 90% of reported content within 24 hours and removed 71% of content that was considered to be illegal hate speech.</p>
<p>It added that it welcomed the results &#8212; but also called for signatories to redouble their efforts, especially around providing feedback to users and in how they approach transparency around reporting and removals.</p>
<p>The Commission has also repeatedly calls for platforms signed up to the disinformation Code to do more to tackle the tsunami of &#8216;fake news&#8217; being fenced on their platforms, including &#8212; on the public health front &#8212; what they last year dubbed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/tech-giants-must-open-up-about-the-coronavirus-infodemic-say-eu-lawmakers/">coronavirus infodemic</a>.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has undoubtedly contributed to concentrating lawmakers&#8217; minds on the complex issue of how to effectively regulate the digital sphere and likely accelerated a number of EU efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericachidi/">Erica Chidi</a>, the co-founder of<a href="https://loomhq.com/"> LOOM</a> and a first-generation Nigerian-American, learned how to wrap the language of self-care around her body from an early age. She spent the early part of her life in South Africa, then the epicenter of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, watching her father work as an endocrinologist and infectious disease specialist. That exposure was supplemented by Chidi’s mother, a registered nurse, who made “talking about the body something that was pretty commonplace in our house.” Her childhood seeded an understanding of the women’s body, a conversation that can be stigmatized in many immigrant households.</p>
<p>Eventually, Chidi became a Doula, a trained person who guides mothers through the process toward motherhood.</p>
<p>“As a doula, I really focused on individual care and helping people be able to advocate for themselves&#8230;in order for them to optimize their healthcare experience wherever they were within their sexual reproductive health journey,” she said. “When I flash forward to what I’ve been doing now, 10 years later, I know back then what I was really focusing on was user experience.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s the seedling that led to Loom, <em><a href="https://www.loom.com/">not that video company</a></em>, but a digital learning platform about women’s health, with an explicit focus on the sexual and reproductive health journey. Chidi founded it in 2017 alongside Quinn Lundberg, a women’s healthcare policy advocate. After the duo <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90533945/this-doula-raised-3-million-to-build-a-digital-platform-for-reproductive-education">raised $3 million</a> in seed financing last year, Loom is now officially launching its first course to the public: a Pregnancy and Postpartum program.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="E2vBFUd729"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">Hormonal health is a massive opportunity: Where are the unicorns?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hormonal health is a massive opportunity: Where are the unicorns?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/embed/#?secret=E2vBFUd729" data-secret="E2vBFUd729" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The program, which costs $90 for 12 months of access, includes asynchronous and synchronous learning components.</p>
<p>The video repository, which Chidi describes as a “Masterclass, but for sexual reproductive health,” includes videos about medicated, unmedicated, and cesarean birth, as well as advice on choosing a care provider. The live components include weekly small pods, led mostly by clinicians, going into specific issues and concerns that mothers might be facing, such as postpartum care or trimester tips. There’s also a monthly talk hosted by Chidi, in which the entire community is invited to dive into a singular topic within the pregnancy and postpartum world. For now, these sessions are held over Zoom, but Loom is in the process of developing its own video platform.</p>
<p>Chidi said that the company is more interested in giving users instantaneous and actionable value from content, instead of getting them to view or complete all of the content. However, that&#8217;s easier said than done. The company needs to balance engaging material with nuanced, clinician-approved medical education. Right now, Chidi teaches much of the content, and despite her upbringing and experience, Doulas are not considered medical professionals. Loom is working with research institutions, community organizations and the Reproductive Justice Framework &#8211; an anti-racist movement about reproductive rights and social justice &#8211; to develop its content.</p>
<p>Expectful, a company similar in mission to Loom, raised $3 million this year. Expectful is a meditation and sleep app for women, and is now expanding into a community and marketplace for new and expecting mothers. The startup’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nathalie-walton-expectful-seed/"> new chief executive Nathalie Walton</a> joins Chidi in being two of the few dozen Black female founders to raise millions in venture capital.</p>

<p>Chidi, a Black LGBTQ+ founder, used to think that she was an “untraditional founder” in a lot of ways: “I didn&#8217;t go to Stanford, I don&#8217;t have an MBA, and I don&#8217;t have a technical background,” she said. “But what I&#8217;ve realized over the past year is that I&#8217;ve always been a deep systems thinker. I&#8217;m a rigorous writer, and a very kind of tactical educator, and all of those skills really transferred well into the product building process.” That “deeply emotion-centered, deeply-humanistic framework” that she brings is a strategic fit in the world of women’s healthcare.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">What do all companies, regardless of industry, say they want? Growth. Lighting-fast, continuous growth. The good news is you can quickly learn which growth marketing strategies work by studying other companies&#8217; success and adapting it to your own business.</p>
<p>Most technophiles remember Dropbox’s referral program — the one that helped it grow <a href="https://viral-loops.com/blog/dropbox-grew-3900-simple-referral-program/">3,900%</a> in 15 months. Its philosophy was simple: reward customers with free storage space for referring other customers. In 2008, it was an absolute revelation. A golden ticket.</p>

<p>In 2021, you’d be hard-pressed to find a company without a formal <a href="https://www.growthmarketingpro.com/referral-program-software/">referral program</a>. It’s a standard growth marketing trick. If you study other companies’ tactics, you’re going to be able to shortcut growth — it’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>The race to grow faster is more pressing than ever before. When you consider the speed with which venture capital funds need to return dollars to their investors and that consumer acquisition costs have increased by <a href="https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/customer-research-steve-blank-des-traynor">55%</a> over the last three years, forward-thinking entrepreneurs and growth marketers simply must make time to study their competition, learn best practices and apply them to their own business growth.</p>
<p>Of course, you should still run your own experiments, but it’s just more capital-efficient to emulate than to trial-and-error from scratch. Here are five companies with growth strategies worth emulating — including the most important lessons you can begin applying to your business today.</p>

<h2>1. Doing SEO right: Flo</h2>
<p>SEO is going to spend this summer shaking in its boots. Google <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-page-experience-update-rolls-out-just-as-core-update-finishes-wednesdays-daily-brief-349658">began rolling out</a> a two-week core algorithm update on June 2, and it’s unleashing a page experience update through August. These updates usually come with significant volatility that makes organic Google rankings jump all over the place.</p>
<p>However, one clear winner of the 2021 SEO footrace is <a href="https://flo.health/">Flo</a>, a women’s ovulation calendar, period tracker and pregnancy app. According to <a href="https://growthbarseo.com/">GrowthBar</a>, a SEO tool I co-founded, Flo’s organic traffic has soared 192% over the past two months and it ranks on page one for some staggeringly competitive women’s health keywords.</p>
<p>If SEO is a strategy you’re pursuing, there are two key growth lessons to take away from Flo’s recent success.</p>
<p><strong>1. Authority matters now more than ever</strong>. Healthcare websites fall into a category of sensitive sites that Google classifies as Your Money, Your Life (YMYL). Because of oodles of fake news and suspect web content, Google has rightfully raised its bar for expertise and factuality. Go to any one of Flo’s more than 1,000 blog posts (yes, content is still king) and you’ll see that nearly all of them are reviewed by gynecologists, primary care physicians or some other type of women’s health expert. Its site also has pages devoted to its writers and medical reviewers, content guidelines and peer-review specifications. Flo takes its information seriously. From the 2020 election to QAnon to vaccination side effects, Google is on high alert. Whatever your niche, you need to establish credibility to win Google searches.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Your pass includes a free, three-month subscription to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">Extra Crunch</a>, our members-only program featuring exclusive daily articles for founders and startup teams.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick run through what you’ll experience in July at TC Early Stage 2021.</p>
<p>Day one is all about highly interactive sessions on topics such as marketplace positioning, growth marketing, content development and — everyone’s favorite subject — fundraising.</p>
<p>Here are just two prime examples of the topics and talent on tap.</p>
<p><strong>Growth Marketing 101:</strong> “Growth” is a concept that is inconsistently defined and operationalized across startups. Greylock Partner, Mike Duboe has built growth teams at early-stage and growth/IPO-stage companies and will talk about how companies should think about organization design for growth, best practices in scaling performance marketing practices, and how investors deconstruct healthy vs unhealthy growth.</p>
<p><strong>How Founders Can Think Like a VC:</strong> Though there is more capital flowing through the market than ever before, the world of fundraising can still feel like a black box to many founders. Hear Norwest Venture Partners’ Lisa Wu explain how founders can get in the mind of a VC, framing their company’s narrative in terms that VCs love. Be the ball, as they say.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the boffo breakout sessions from Dell Technologies, UserTesting, Movile, Pilot and oVice. You’ll find topic descriptions and times (specific to your location) in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the event agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Day two is all about the pitch-off. Tune in as 10 early-stage startups take the virtual stage and deliver their best five-minute pitch to a global audience of investors, TC editors, press and event attendees. A five-minute Q&amp;A with the judges follows that pitch.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/announcing-the-early-stage-pitch-off-judges-2/">crackerjack judges</a> — Ben Sun, Primary Venture Partners; Leah Solivan, Fuel Capital and Shardul Shah, Index Ventures — will provide invaluable feedback. Who knows? You might hear tips that help turn your pitch deck into a fundraising machine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seattle-based <a href="https://edgedelta.com/">Edge Delta</a>, a startup that is building a modern distributed monitoring stack that is competing directly with industry heavyweights like Splunk, New Relic and Datadog, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Menlo Ventures and Tim Tully, the former CTO of Splunk. Previous investors MaC Venture Capital and Amity Ventures also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to date to $18 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our thesis is that there&#8217;s no way that enterprises today can continue to analyze all their data in real time,&#8221; said Edge Delta co-founder and CEO Ozan Unlu, who has worked in the observability space for about 15 years already (including at Microsoft and Sumo Logic). &#8220;The way that it was traditionally done with these primitive, centralized models &#8212; there&#8217;s just too much data. It worked 10 years ago, but gigabytes turned into terabytes and now terabytes are turning into petabytes. That whole model is breaking down.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170060" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170060" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170060" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="670" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png 2476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=1536,1006 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=2048,1341 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170060" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Edge Delta</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He acknowledges that traditional big data warehousing works quite well for business intelligence and analytics use cases. But that&#8217;s not real-time and also involves moving a lot of data from where it&#8217;s generated to a centralized warehouse. The promise of Edge Delta is that it can offer all of the capabilities of this centralized model by allowing enterprises to start to analyze their logs, metrics, traces and other telemetry right at the source. This, in turn, also allows them to get visibility into all of the data that&#8217;s generated there, instead of many of today&#8217;s systems, which only provide insights into a small slice of this information.</p>
<p>While competing services tend to have agents that run on a customer&#8217;s machine, but typically only compress the data, encrypt it and then send it on to its final destination, Edge Delta&#8217;s agent starts analyzing the data right at the local level. With that, if you want to, for example, graph error rates from your Kubernetes cluster, you wouldn&#8217;t have to gather all of this data and send it off to your data warehouse where it has to be indexed before it can be analyzed and graphed.</p>
<p>With Edge Delta, you could instead have every single node draw its own graph, which Edge Delta can then combine later on. With this, Edge Delta argues, its agent is able to offer significant performance benefits, often by orders of magnitude. This also allows businesses to run their machine learning models at the edge, as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I saw before I was leaving Splunk was that people were sort of being choosy about where they put workloads for a variety of reasons, including cost control,&#8221; said Menlo Ventures&#8217; Tim Tully, who joined the firm only a couple of months ago. &#8220;So this idea that you can move some of the compute down to the edge and lower latency and do machine learning at the edge in a distributed way was incredibly fascinating to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edge Delta is able to offer a significantly cheaper service, in large part because it doesn&#8217;t have to run a lot of compute and manage huge storage pools itself since a lot of that is handled at the edge. And while the customers obviously still incur some overhead to provision this compute power, it&#8217;s still significantly less than what they would be paying for a comparable service. The company argues that it typically sees about a 90 percent improvement in total cost of ownership compared to traditional centralized services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170059" style="width: 5290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170059" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170059 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png" alt="" width="5280" height="2782" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png 5280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=768,405 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=1536,809 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=2048,1079 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5280px) 100vw, 5280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170059" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Edge Delta</p></div></p>
<p>Edge Delta charges <a href="https://edgedelta.com/pricing/">based on volume</a> and it is not shy to compare its prices with Splunk&#8217;s and does so right on its <a href="https://edgedelta.com/pricing/">pricing calculator</a>. Indeed, in talking to Tully and Unlu, Splunk was clearly on everybody&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s kind of this concept of unbundling of Splunk,&#8221; Unlu said. &#8220;You have Snowflake and the data warehouse solutions coming in from one side, and they&#8217;re saying, &#8216;hey, if you don&#8217;t care about real time, go use us.&#8217; And then we&#8217;re the other half of the equation, which is: actually there&#8217;s a lot of real-time operational use cases and this model is actually better for those massive stream processing datasets that you required to analyze in real time.&#8221;</p>
<p>But despite this competition, Edge Delta can still integrate with Splunk and similar services. Users can still take their data, ingest it through Edge Delta and then pass it on to the likes of Sumo Logic, Splunk, AWS&#8217;s S3 and other solutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you follow the trajectory of Splunk, we had this whole idea of building this business around IoT and Splunk at the Edge &#8212; and we never really quite got there,&#8221; Tully said. &#8220;I think what we&#8217;re winding up seeing collectively is the edge actually means something a little bit different. [&#8230;] The advances in distributed computing and sophistication of hardware at the edge allows these types of problems to be solved at a lower cost and lower latency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Edge Delta team plans to use the new funding to expand its team and support all of the new customers that have shown interest in the product. For that, it is building out its go-to-market and marketing teams, as well as its customer success and support teams.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week we did something fun and different and good: a live show! A good number of people came, and asked questions, and altogether, it was a blast.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny,</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> had a lovely time with the regular work, while Grace and Chris and Kevin made the whole operation function. We&#8217;ll likely post a bonus episode of the Q&amp;A on Saturday if people are interested in Equity After Hours.</p>
<p>That aside, what did we talk about in a longer-than-usual episode? Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/5-takeaways-from-buzzfeeds-spac-deck/"><strong>Buzzfeed is going public!</strong> </a>Alex wrote about the news here, but the gist is that the media company is merging with a SPAC, buying Complex, and raising some capital at the same time. We have thoughts about it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/"><strong>Maybe neobanks will break even?</strong> </a>We dug into some fintech news through the perspective of some recent news from the neobank market.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/majority-raises-19-million-for-its-mobile-banking-service-for-migrants/">MAJORITY raised MONEY</a></strong> for migrants to the United States, while MFast, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/vietnamese-financial-services-app-mfast-gets-1-5m-pre-series-a-led-by-do-ventures/">a Vietnamese financial services app</a></strong>, got some funding of its own amid the neobank boom.</li>
<li>Alex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/an-interview-with-a-leading-venture-capitalist/">interviewed a leading venture capitalist</a>. So, we talked about that.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/"><strong>What&#8217;s going on with the early-stage venture capital market?</strong></a> That&#8217;s something we tried to parse. The gist is that the rapidly-evolving world of investing in startups is in the midst of a few trends that are worth understanding. Even if they are slightly contradictory.</li>
<li>A16z<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/"> tripled down on crypto with a new $2.2 billion fund, </a>giving it a total of $18.8 billion in assets under management.</li>
<li>Edtech leaders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/edtech-culture-memo/">rallied around a memo of their own this past week.</a></li>
<li>And then to close, we raced through some of our recent reporting on a new fund that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/academy-investor-network-usaa/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAInF86XeyKZb94yYgs3GDdMw_jHxx56nRffvzpoaKhVFAan7RHDy2BVX8mPoLOglE98tzPsxkPorvv5lT1Cn2KIEUL5fbdHZUarhklC7CuV5wKU_SplTmOR25MdZfj2kcdxOZoc1QRev9lgsyxt7SSLz_umfegu1XUsWdBFKI1Zt">will invest in American military institute graduates</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/software-design-startup-figma-is-now-worth-10-billion?sref=gni836kR">Figma&#8217;s huge new round of capital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/waitwhat-raises-12m-to-double-down-on-what-comes-after-podcasts/">and WaitWhat</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s always fun to play around with our show, and thank you to everyone who came out and supported us in our first-ever, but probably not last-ever, virtual live show. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We are back to regular, however, starting Monday.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s cloud services giant Amazon Web Services (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws/">AWS</a>) is getting into the encrypted messaging business. The company has just <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-welcomes-wickr-to-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has acquired secure communications service <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wickr">Wickr</a> &#8212; a messaging app that has geared itself towards <a href="https://wickr.com/customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">providing services</a> to government and military groups and enterprises. It claims to be the only &#8220;collaboration service&#8221; that meets security criteria set out by the NSA.</p>
<p>AWS will continue operating Wickr as is, and offer its services to AWS customers, &#8220;effective immediately,&#8221; notes a blog post from Stephen Schmidt, the VP and CISO for AWS, announcing the news.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed in the short announcement. Wickr had raised just under $60 million in funding, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/60487-57/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> data (it also notes a valuation of under $30 million but that seems to be a very old estimate). Meanwhile, Amazon&#8217;s cloud and enterprise division, AWS, has been a juggernaut for the e-commerce and services giant. AWS posted revenues of <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$13.5 billion last quarter</a>, up 32% year-on-year, with net income of $8.1 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s purchase of a messaging product geared at providing secure services to government bodies is coming at a time when the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-05/microsoft-s-10-billion-pentagon-deal-at-risk-amid-amazon-fight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to be embroiled in a dispute around the JEDI contract</a>, a $10 billion deal to provide services to the U.S. that Microsoft was granted during the Trump administration.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear if this is part of Amazon&#8217;s effort to build out more infrastructure and services to flesh out its own offerings, or simply a sign that it will continue to court that market, with or without JEDI in its pocket.</p>
<p>The move also suggests that Amazon could be planning to make a bigger push into the messaging space &#8212; some might say a long-awaited move from the company.</p>
<p>The AWS division currently offers communications service <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/amazon-chime/">Chime, </a>which enables organizations to meet, chat, and place business calls. But it&#8217;s a little-known product that&#8217;s failed to have the impact of rival services Slack or Microsoft Teams, and it doesn&#8217;t focus on end-to-end encryption as Wickr does.</p>
<p>Amazon was reportedly working on a messaging product as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/14/amazon-messaging-app-anytime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far back as 2017</a>, although that appeared to be geared more to consumers. The company also owns a number of social media patents.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021, and there are a million other considerations around messaging that wouldn&#8217;t have been key factors in 2017, such as encryption and other privacy-saving features. And messaging in general has grown increasingly sophisticated.</p>
<p>There are four areas in particular where Amazon might be interested in playing here: (1) to offer Wickr as a business service, continuing how it is used today; (2) building &#8220;messaging-as-a-service&#8221; for other companies to use in their apps a la other AWS services; (3) build a consumer messaging app on top of the Wickr infrastructure; (4) more services connected to Echo, expanding more features around a bigger social commerce/interactive play. Or, all of the above.</p>
<p>Commenting on the acquisition, Stephen Schmidt, AWS CISO, said: “The need for this type of secure communications is accelerating. With the move to hybrid work environments, due in part to the Covid-19 pandemic, enterprises and government agencies have a growing desire to protect their communications across many remote locations. Wickr’s secure communications solutions help enterprises and government organizations adapt to this change in their workforces and is a welcome addition to the growing set of collaboration and productivity services that AWS offers customers and partners.”</p>
<p>In a notice on its website, Wickr said: &#8220;From our founding ten years ago, we have grown to serve organizations across a wide range of industries, all over the world. Together with AWS, we look forward to taking our solutions to the next level for our customers and partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wickr, which was founded in 2011 and is based in San Fransisco, describes itself as the “most secure” video conferencing and collaboration platform. Unlike other collaboration tools, which encrypt messages as they travel from a user&#8217;s device to a company&#8217;s servers but store those communications in an unencrypted state, Wickr uses end-to-end encryption which means that only people on either end of a conversation can decrypt and read messages.</p>
<p>Wickr also offers users an ephemeral messaging feature, which allows users to set self-destruction timers for as short as a few seconds.</p>
<p>The company has recently made a big push into the enterprise as a result of the mass shift to online communications. In February this year Wickr launched &#8216;Global Federation&#8217;, a feature that enables enterprise and government entities to securely communicate using end-to-end encryption with mission-critical partners outside of their network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">API Holdings, which operates the giant healthcare startup PharmEasy, said on Friday it has reached an agreement to acquire a 66.1% stake in Thyrocare, which runs a diagnostic lab chain, for about $613 million in what is the first-ever acquisition of a publicly listed firm by a unicorn startup in the world&#8217;s second most populated nation.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to regulatory and other applicable customary approvals. Docon Technologies, a 100% subsidiary of API, will be the acquirer and shall make an open offer for an additional 26% stake for over $241 million, the startup said in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complex transaction. In a <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/15C27629-196E-4C08-ADDA-A683A6AF71C9-182938.pdf">filing</a> (PDF) to a local exchange, Thyrocare has disclosed that API Holdings intends to raise another financing round, where it may sell about 4.9% stake to Dr. A. Velumani, a promoter of Thyrocare, for about $202 million. This will imply a valuation of over $4 billion for the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The six-year-old startup, which has raised about $572 million to date and was valued at $1.5 billion in its most recent financing round in April, counts Prosus Ventures, Temasek, Eight Roads Ventures, TPG, B Capital Group, and Bessemer Venture Partners among its investors.</p>
<p>Siddharth Shah, chief executive of API Holdings, said on Friday that the startup is in talks to raise a $500 million financing round at $4 billion valuation.</p>
<p>PharmEasy, the only healthcare unicorn startup in India, is the nation&#8217;s largest online pharmacy and diagnostics brand. It operates a business-to-business pharma marketplace with over 6,000 consultation clinics with 90,000 partner retailers across the South Asian nation.</p>

<p>Thyrocare is India’s largest diagnostics solution provider by volume (it performs over 110 million tests in a year). The 26-year-old firm also operates a network of over 3,330 collection centers in 2,000+ towns in India.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will enable PharmEasy to serve a patient across their entire journey in a treatment, said Shah. The startup has no plans to go public immediately, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to be partnering Thyrocare. We will provide world class customer experience in diagnostics, rivalling our pharmacy experience by leveraging technology, and building on top of the massive scale &amp; truly pan-India presence of Thyrocare. It is our aim to deliver all outpatient healthcare products &amp; services to every Indian within 24 hours,” said 32-year-old Shah in a statement.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s announcement marks the latest in a series of huge transactions in the rapidly consolidating healthcare industry in India. Earlier this month, Tata Digital, the subsidiary of Tata Group, said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/tata-digital-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-online-pharmacy-1mg/">acquiring a majority stake in digital health startup 1mg</a>, valuing the startup at over $400 million. Last year, Amazon entered the space, too, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/amazon-pharmacy-bangalore-india-launch/">launching an online pharmacy</a> in the country.</p>
<p>“I am excited about this relationship, unique of its kind in Indian healthcare industry. The unique reach and strength of Thyrocare in diagnostics blended with young and dynamic team of PharmEasy will bring in better healthcare solutions for common man nationwide,” said Dr. Velumani, Chairman and MD of Thyrocare, in a statement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think because of the VC money and also the hype in the industry, a lot of people just forget how easy and simple the business should be."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups are the embodiment of frenetic action. The rush to grow, outrun, and disrupt runs in the lifeblood of today&#8217;s entrepreneurs, driving their fervor and enabling them to capture markets from giants of industries too big to maneuver in a quickly changing landscape.</p>
<p>That has been truer for the mobility landscape than most other industries. Companies like electric scooter providers Lime and Bird have raised tons of capital to change how the urban population gets around, but that growth has come at the cost of a bottom line still in the red.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The difference with Veo is that we control our supply chain — we design, manufacture and deploy our own vehicles, and our lead times are extremely tight.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s striking to see electric scooter company Veo take a different approach to the business. Rather than raising venture capital and scaling quickly, the company does business the old-fashioned way: Proving the model works in one market before moving to the next. This slower, more methodical approach has worked in Veo’s favor — it might be the only company in its industry that has been consistently profitable.</p>
<p>Veo&#8217;s approach reflects its co-founder and CEO Candice Xie&#8217;s belief that transportation is not an industry that allows companies to scale rapidly and turn a big profit within a year, and especially not if it’s going to make sense for a city. Electric scooters aren’t just a business to Xie — they’re a utility, a tool that can be best implemented through patient collaboration between public and private partners. The CEO has taken this ethos and executed Veo’s business model with the expectation that it will make the company the most impactful in the industry.</p>
<p>A former financial planner for automation solutions company, Schneider Electric, in Chicago, Xie launched Vue in 2017, partly inspired by the bike-share boom in Asia. She was decidedly against the poor quality bikes many operators were deploying at the time, and was also frustrated by the lack of affordable, safe and convenient transportation in Chicago. After some market research, Xie and her co-founder, Yanke (Edwin) Tan, a bike engineer, discovered the gap in last-mile transportation in the United States.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>
<p><strong>In your <a href="https://veo-mobility.medium.com/sorry-boys-the-first-profitable-micromobility-company-was-veo-not-lime-97b6b279243f">Medium post</a> titled “Sorry, Boys. The First Profitable Micromobility Company Was Veo, Not Lime,” you fired some shots at Lime and the tech bro-ey micromobility industry at large. </strong><strong>That was pretty bold. </strong></p>
<p>Thank you! I think because of the VC money and also the hype in the industry, a lot of people just forget how easy and simple the business should be. That&#8217;s why I put out the post. It was just time to say something in the industry and help people to understand.</p>
<p><strong>What made you write it?</strong></p>
<p>That was actually the time when Lime announced they were the first ones to achieve profitability, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/lime-touts-a-2020-turnaround-and-2021-profitability/">that&#8217;s through EBITDA</a>, and a lot of people were clapping for them. I was compelled to write because many people who follow the industry asked me, &#8220;Hey, it seems their approach is working? Should we follow suit? Why are you taking a different approach?&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt like that statement from Lime was quite misleading for a lot of people, and I don&#8217;t think that was a responsible statement, either. So that made me feel like I should use my insight and just explain things a bit more openly with our information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other financial sectors in Latin America, the retail investing space is getting a facelift by local tech startups that are cashing in on the untapped potential for democratizing asset management in the region. One of those startups is Chilean-based Fintual, which today announced a $15 million round led by Kaszek Ventures, the largest fund in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintual is an automated passive investment platform that allows the average person in Chile or Mexico to invest in mutual funds containing ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), investment vehicles that aren’t as well known, or as readily accessible in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea that got to me was that we were allowing people to invest in the long term, we enable them to invest in instruments they didn’t have access to before,” said Pedro Pineda, co-founder and CEO of Fintual.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting Fintual in 2018 with his three co-founders, Pineda was an astronomer and an entrepreneur, who built and sold a Groupon copycat company in Chile called &#8220;Queremos Descuentos&#8221; (We Want Discounts) for just over $1 million when he was 28. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the exit, he admits he was a bit lost in life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One day I decided that I wanted to do only the things that I wanted to do and with the people I wanted to do it with,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He traveled for a couple of years, and learned to code, among other things, until Omar Larré, Fintual’s current CIO, presented him with the idea for the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larré had been a portfolio manager at Banco Itau, Brazil’s biggest bank by total assets, and he saw the gap in the market: investing was not set up for the average person. The annual fees were too high, the minimum amount required to invest was too high, and there was a penalty when you removed your money. Additionally, the transaction takes a certain amount of financial know-how that most people don’t possess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Pineda, disrupting the financial sector also seemed like a lot of fun, he thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I liked the idea of challenging the financial banks, and you can’t do that without technology. We have this super tool that my parents didn’t have, and you can disrupt an entire industry,” Pineda told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While traditional mutual funds in Chile and Mexico charge up to 6.45% and 5% annually, Fintual charges 1% annually of assets managed. Additionally, Fintual doesn’t require a minimum investment nor a minimum amount of time invested, and users can take their money out any time with no penalties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s different than the U.S.; we invest way less than you do; by a factor of 10 maybe,” Pineda said, comparing the investment rate in Chile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the company was accepted into Y Combinator and became the first Chilean startup to go through the prestigious accelerator. It has been growing exponentially ever since and today it serves 57,000 clients in Chile and Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a table that shows their growth including money managed and percent growth each year since launch.</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><b>Assets Under Management (USD)*</b></td>
<td><b>Annual Growth</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2018</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">             1.2 M</span></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2019</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">             12.9 M</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">1075%</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2020</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">              87.6 M</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">679%</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2021</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">              480.7 m</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">548%</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     *Each figure corresponds to the end of each month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current raise will be used to grow the company’s operations in Mexico, expand to other countries &#8212; namely Colombia and Peru &#8212; and grow its tech team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Kaszek, other investors to date include YC, ALLVP, and angel investors such as Plaid’s CTO, Jean-Denis Greze, and Cornershop’s founder Oskar Hjertonsson. To date, the company has raised about $15.2 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintual’s impressive growth speaks for itself, but Kaszek’s co-founder and managing partner, Nicolas Szekasy, said the fund has been following Fintual since its early days, and he was impressed with the niche market the team identified and even more impressed with the user experience the company had developed which has, in turn, fueled its growth.</span></p>
