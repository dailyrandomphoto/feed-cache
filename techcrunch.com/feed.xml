										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mindset, a platform featuring personal story collections from recording artists, announced today that it raised $8.7 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>As co-founders of the K-pop focused podcast production company <a href="https://www.divestudios.io/">DIVE Studios</a>, brothers Brian Nam, Eric Nam and Eddie Nam noticed that the studio&#8217;s best performing content came from podcast episodes where stars discussed how they handle struggles in their personal lives. So, the Nam brothers came up with the idea for <a href="https://www.getmindset.com/">Mindset</a>, an off-shoot of DIVE Studios.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that this was a unique selling point people really wanted more of &#8212; so we started to think about ways to really double-down on that aspect,&#8221; said CEO Brian Nam. &#8220;How do we provide more of this valuable content to Gen Z and young millennial audiences? We decided that there wasn’t really the right kind of platform out there for this type of storytelling, so we decided to develop our own mobile platform to uniquely share these stories in an audio format.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2193807" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aug25_AppDiscovery_v2.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>In its current format, Mindset features four audio collections from artists like Jae, Tablo, BM, and Mindset co-founder <a href="https://www.ericnam.com/">Eric Nam</a>, who happens to be a K-pop star himself. Each collection has ten episodes of around ten to twenty minutes long &#8212; the introductory episode is free, but to gain access to the rest of an individual artist&#8217;s collection, users need to pay $24.99. The app also has free Boosters, which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">Calm</a>-like, five-minute clips of bedtime stories and motivational mantras.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up until now, the primary source of income, especially for musicians, has been touring, music streams, and then maybe some endorsement deals, but we&#8217;re able to unlock this fourth one, which is monetizing your stories,&#8221; Nam said. &#8220;The pricing is similar to how they might price a ticket, or how they would sell merchandise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mindset isn&#8217;t meant to be a therapy app. “We’re not licensed therapists, we don’t try to act like we are,” Nam said. Rather, it&#8217;s a way for artists to share more intimate experiences with their fans to show that behind they music, they&#8217;re people too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Mindset launched in an MVP (minimum viable product) version in February. Nam declined to share active user or revenue numbers, but said that the app gained enough traction that by May, it raised venture funding. The $8.7 million round is led by Union Square Ventures with strategic participants like record executive Scooter Braun (of TQ Ventures), who has more recently made headlines over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_masters_controversy">the Taylor Swift masters controversy</a>. Other backers include Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin, Opendoor Co-Founder Eric Wu, and more.</p>
<p class="p1">“Scooter Braun was a strategic investor,&#8221; Nam told TechCrunch.</p>
<p class="p1">Braun has also worked with artists like Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, and Demi Lovato.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;He&#8217;s really opened a lot of doors for us to branch out into the Hollywood and Western space, where we traditionally came from the K-pop space,&#8221; Nam added.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Mindset is putting its seed funding toward content creation, hiring, and product development. The app is currently available on iOS and Android, but it will officially launch on September 14. After that, Mindset will release another audio collection from an artist or actor every two weeks. Nam declined to share who these artists will be. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aileen Lee is one of the most prestigious and successful venture capitalists of the past decade. Before starting her own firm in Cowboy Ventures, Lee was a partner at KPCB for more than 12 years. Her portfolio includes DocSend, Ironclad, Philz Coffee, StyleSeat and many, many more.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Lee join us alongside one of her portfolio company founders, Guild Education&#8217;s Rachel Carlson, on an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-with-cowboy-ventures-and-guild-education?ref=2981607eb662">Click to register for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live brings founders and their investors together to pop the lid off of the black box that is fundraising. How did they meet? Why did they choose each other? What got them to yes? How do they work together now?</p>
<p>These are the pieces of the fundraising process that often aren&#8217;t covered in your average &#8220;how to fundraise&#8221; blog posts and programming, and we&#8217;re here to get these questions answered.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> also features the ECL Pitch-off, which gives folks in the audience the chance to raise their hand and pitch their startup to our guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. Let&#8217;s get to know our guests.</p>
<p>Lee has been one of the most sought-after investors in Silicon Valley for as long as I&#8217;ve been in tech. A founding partner at All Raise, she is committed to diversity and inclusion and has an eye for talent, realizing that the former often precedes the latter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She&#8217;s been on the Midas List a handful of times, and is also listed as one of Forbes&#8217; most influential people.</p>
<p>Rachel Carlson founded Guild Education in 2015 and has led the company since. Guild has raised upwards of $370 million from investors that include General Catalyst, Felicis, Bessemer and more.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about how to get to yes, what sings in a pitch deck and how they operate as partners to this day.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is 100% free to folks who attend live, but only Extra Crunch members can access the content on-demand. If you&#8217;re not yet an Extra Crunch member, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">sign up here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a blog post this morning, Alphabet drone delivery company Wing announced that it is set to hit 100,000 customer deliveries over the weekend. The news comes on the second anniversary of the service’s pilot launch in Logan, Australia, a city of roughly 300,000 people in the Brisbane metropolitan area.</p>
<p>It also, notably, arrives a few weeks after <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air">Wired reported</a> that Amazon’s own drone delivery efforts are “collapsing inwards.” Wing comms head Jonathan Bass told TechCrunch that the service is set to enter additional markets in the coming months.</p>
<p>“I think we&#8217;ll expand quite a bit,” Bass told TechCrunch. “I think we&#8217;ll launch new services in Australia, Finland and the United States in the next six months. The capabilities of the technology are probably ahead of the regulatory permissions right now.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2193555" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Recording-2021-08-24-at-4.36.05-PM.2021-08-24-16_38_06.gif" alt="" width="800" height="403" /></p>
<p>Of the existing deliveries, more than half were completed in Logan over the course of the last eight months. The first week of August, for instance, found customers place orders for 4,500 deliveries, which works out to one every 30 seconds during Wing’s delivery window.</p>
<p>The numbers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,000 cups of coffee</li>
<li>1,700 children’s snack packs</li>
<li>1,200 hot chooks (roasted chicken, in Australian)</li>
<li>2,700 sushi rolls</li>
<li>1,000 loaves of bread</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2193564" style="width: 5339px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193564" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2193564 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-4.jpg" alt="" width="5329" height="3553" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-4.jpg 5329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-4.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5329px) 100vw, 5329px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193564" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wing</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The drones have a range of six miles &#8212; limited by their battery life. That means the trips are fairly short, so there’s not a lot of issue with foodstuffs staying hot or cold, in spite of the package (which resembles a Happy Meal) being transported outside the drone. The primarily limitation, the company says, is weight, with capacity to carry up to three pounds. Apparently the system has had no issues carrying extremely fragile objects like eggs.</p>
<p>The drones cruise at around 100 to 150 feet in the air and lower down to about 23 feet when they reach their destination. From there, a tether lowers the package to the ground and unhooks it. No one is required to receive the package.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193562" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193562" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193562" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-2.jpg 5088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wing-Drone-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193562" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wing</p></div></p>
<p>“If you combine the test flights with deliveries, it’s close to half-a-million flights over the past four or five years,” says Bass. “We’ve gradually moved into dense environments and listen to communities.” That last bit includes community feedback to reduce the drone’s noise levels.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avid Ventures participated in the financing, in addition to existing backers Lightspeed Ventures, Stripe, Y Combinator Continuity Fund, SciFi VC and UpWest. Other individual investors that put money in the round include early employees and executives from Plaid, Coinbase, Square, Stripe and PayPal, such as </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-reses-938b7850/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaqueline Reses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, formerly head of Square Capital. The financing comes just over six months after Balance announced </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/lightspeed-and-max-levchin-bet-on-balance-to-bring-b2b-payments-into-the-digital-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $5.5 million seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motivation for starting the company was simple, said CEO and co-founder Bar Geron: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to create an online B2B experience that doesn’t suck.” He and Yoni Shuster, both former PayPal employees, started the company in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B2B payments, he said, have historically differed from B2C primarily in that they have not taken place at the moment of purchase (or at the point of sale) but rather within 30 days and with an invoice. This is not an efficient process for merchants or vendors alike, the company maintains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most businesses have avoided paying for their supply with credit cards, because cards can quickly max out, Geron said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only element that keeps many merchants offline is payments,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s a process that is stuck in the flow of those marketplaces and keeping them from scaling. We got fascinated with the problem.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lightspeed and Levchin bet on Balance to bring B2B payments into the digital world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/lightspeed-and-max-levchin-bet-on-balance-to-bring-b2b-payments-into-the-digital-world/embed/#?secret=M6kdToNE24" data-secret="M6kdToNE24" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After starting out at Y Combinator, Balance has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed what it describes as a “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumer-like B2B checkout platform for merchants and marketplaces,” or a “self-serve digital checkout experience company for B2B businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What that means is that Balance has built a B2B payments platform that allows merchants to offer a variety of payment methods, including ACH, cards, checks and bank wires, as well as a variety of terms, including payment on delivery, net payment terms and payment by milestone. Behind the scenes, Balance underwrites the terms of those transactions requiring financing by evaluating the risk of the customer, the merchant and the specific payment terms selected. Balance is built on top of Stripe and offers all of Stripe’s credit card payment options, but then extends far beyond them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balance, according to Geron, invested “a lot” in APIs for marketplaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a very robust API platform so that these businesses can manage the entire payment flow without being exposed to the risk and regulation of payments,” he told TechCrunch. “And this is all happening without them even touching the funds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plus for merchants is the ability to get immediate payout that is always reconciled like credits. Marketplaces are equipped with automated vendor disbursement, a full compliance umbrella and reconciliation management, Balance says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make the online payments experience for businesses as seamless as it is for consumer payments, and we want to do it globally,” Geron told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has already partnered with e-commerce giants such as BigCommerce and Magento and will soon also work with Salesforce, according to Geron. Its customers range from startups to publicly traded marketplaces to e-commerce enterprises across a variety of industries such as steel, freight, hardware, food ordering, medical supply and apparel. They include Bryzos, Choco, Zilingo and Bay Supply, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s early days yet, but Balance has seen growth of about 500% to 600% since the time of its last raise in February, Geron said. The company, which has offices in Tel Aviv and New York, has about 30 employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan Angelos, a general partner at Ribbit and former head of M&amp;A and investment at Stripe, believes the fact that Balance has built its platform specifically for “rapidly scaling” B2B marketplaces and merchants is reflective of a “well-placed” focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“B2B marketplaces, for example, have a very particular set of payments and capital markets-related needs that can be much more holistically and elegantly solved with Balance&#8217;s flexible toolkit than alternatives,” he wrote via email. “Payments and checkout are two sides of the same coin, and Balance&#8217;s products allow users to address them together to better serve their customers as well as their own margins.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Productivity has been a focal point for many enterprise businesses since before the pandemic hit, and even more so since its onset. But <a href="https://www.macro.io/">Macro</a> founders Ankith Harathi and John Keck are taking a different tack.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Zoom SDK-powered product has been reimagined by its team, and is relaunching today.</p>
<p>When Macro first launched into beta, with $4.3 million in Seed capital led by FirstMark, the idea was that Zoom calls lacked the infrastructure to be truly useful (and equitable). As a solution, the company created a Zoom overlay that allowed users to type in action items, takeaways, etc. right in the call. Macro would then transfer all that information into a Google Doc and send it to attendees.</p>
<p>The product also gave users the option to choose their layout, including skin that would just show thumbnails of attendees over the browser or application of choice, rather than taking up the whole screen. It even had a feature called Airtime that showed how much each individual was talking during a meeting, ensuring that everyone&#8217;s voices are heard.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that final feature, and the feedback of Macro users, that culminated in this relaunch. Shifting away from its early productivity bend, Macro is now focusing on self-expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the future of video communications, one of our most intimate forms of communication, will be super personalized. You and I are fundamentally very different people,&#8221; Harathi said to me over Zoom. &#8220;But we are in the Zoom era, and we&#8217;re all using the same really generic interface regardless of how different we are.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="G4A5fCBcQ1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/macro-just-raised-4-3m-to-make-your-never-ending-zoom-calls-more-useful/">Macro just raised $4.3M to make your never-ending Zoom calls more useful</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Macro just raised $4.3M to make your never-ending Zoom calls more useful&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/macro-just-raised-4-3m-to-make-your-never-ending-zoom-calls-more-useful/embed/#?secret=G4A5fCBcQ1" data-secret="G4A5fCBcQ1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new Macro allows users to personalize their interface and express themselves, using shapes, colors, filters and more. In fact, the company is working alongside some big-name artists (TBA) to offer users special reactions within their Zoom calls. Whether or not other members of the call are using Macro, they&#8217;ll still see you the way present yourself using the service.</p>
<p>Some features remained from the original iteration of Macro remain, such as Airtime. Harathi and Keck explained to TechCrunch that the main feedback they received on the product at launch, back in July of 2020, was that its features around self-expression and inclusivity were resonating the most with users, and that few folks were actually making use of the service&#8217;s productivity suite.</p>
<p>Macro is also reintroducing the skin that allowed users to hang out (and see each other in Zoom) while working collaboratively in some other application, calling it Rooms. Macro currently works with MacOS.</p>
<p>The company is keeping its bottoms-up approach to growth, offering the product for free to anyone who wants to use it, without having to get an entire organization on board.</p>
<p>Macro is riding the Zoom wave as the video conferencing behemoth shifts focus to its app ecosystem. Harathi and Keck believe that Macro is to video conferencing what Superhuman is to email, with the main caveat being that Macro is doubling down on self-expression over productivity.</p>
<p>They believe that the UI winner has a lot to gain as the protocol of video meetings continues to prosper, and the company is aiming to be that winner.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For our Wednesday show this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> had colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/asilbwrites">Amanda Silberling</a> on the show to help us parse through OnlyFans&#8217; precedent-setting move to ban sexually-explicit content on its service. The decision was a bolt from the blue for many of its creators, a great portion of whom created and monetized adult videos and images through the subscription service. It also stirred up a ton of debate around fintech, crypto, venture capital, and the morality of decision-makers.</p>
<p>We put all the facts in context for you, hitting the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OnlyFans&#8217; recently leaked financials.</strong> Of course, the company&#8217;s historical, and projected revenues are now dated thanks to the platform&#8217;s planned content changes, but all the same the numbers help put into context just how much money OnlyFans&#8217; adult creators were earning on its platform.</li>
<li>The leaked financials were part of a pitch deck that the company was using on its plight to raise more capital &#8211; an endeavor that has apparently been challenging for the startup. This tension made us think about<strong> the role that venture capital plays in funding vice startups,</strong> and why a tiny clause may stop many from getting into the game. Let&#8217;s just say, the money behind the money has a way of having weight.</li>
<li>And finally, we wondered <strong>what might be ahead for adult-content creators</strong>. Per Silberling, the world of adult content has ever been in flux, with creators and other sex workers moving from platform to platform as corporate policies, and national laws evolved. To see OnlyFans wind up where Patreon and Tumblr previously tread is not a complete surprise.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OnlyFans has suspended its decision to ban sexually explicit content after it received widespread backlash over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">planned policy change</a>. Although Onlyfans was not created specifically for porn, the content has become the platform’s most visible use case.</p>
<p>“Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard. We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change,” the company said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773?s=20">tweet on Wednesday</a>. “OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators.”</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard.</p>
<p>We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change. </p>
<p>OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators.</p>
<p>&mdash; OnlyFans (@OnlyFans) <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>OnlyFans hasn’t elaborated on the specific “assurances” it has secured. The company did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s inquiry about the matter. However, the statement indicates OnlyFans may have been able to resolve its issues with its banking partners by going public about the matter. The company previously noted it had to make the policy change to comply with the requests of its “banking partners and payout providers.” The company indicated the pressure it faced from these partners and providers led to its decision to no longer permit sexually explicit content on its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s worth noting OnlyFans’ statement says the decision has been “suspended,” which indicates the policy may not have been cancelled altogether.</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet to the original announcement, OnlyFans noted that “an official communication to creators will be emailed shortly.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/onlyfans-explicit-content-ban-should-spark-a-conversation-about-a-creators-bill-of-rights/">decision to ban sexually explicit content</a> had frustrated sex workers who relied on the platform to financially support themselves. In response to the planned policy change, some creators had already deleted their OnlyFans accounts and moved to alternate services. With this recent reversal, creators will have to decide between returning to the platform or leaving it altogether for a rival service.</p>
<p>OnlyFans was founded in 2016 and claims to have over 130 million registered users and more than 2 million creators. The platform managed to attract several celebrities including Bella Thorne, Cardi B and Bhad Bhabie.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thelevel.ai/">Level AI</a>, an early stage startup from a former member of the Alexa product team, wants to help companies process customer service calls faster by understanding the interactions they&#8217;re having with customers in real time.</p>
<p>Today the company launched publicly, while announcing a $13 million Series A led by Battery Ventures with help from seed investors Eniac and Village Global along with some unnamed angels. Battery&#8217;s Neeraj Agrawal will be joining the startup&#8217;s board under the terms of the agreement. The company reports it has now raised $15 million including an earlier $2 million seed.</p>
<p>Company founder Ashish Nagar helped run product for the Amazon Alexa team, working on an experimental project to get Alexa to have an extended human conversation. While they didn&#8217;t achieve that as the technology is just not there yet, it did help him build his understanding of conversational AI, and in 2019 he launched Level AI to bring that knowledge to customer service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our product helps agents in real time to perform better, resolve customer queries faster and make them clear faster. Then after the call, it helps the auditor, the folks who are doing quality assurance and training audits for those calls do their jobs five to 10 times faster,&#8221; Nagar explained.</p>
<p>He says that the Level AI solution involves several activities. The first is understanding the nature of the conversation in real time by breaking it down into meaningful chunks that the technology can understand. Once they do that, they take that information and run it against workflows running in the background to deliver helpful resources, and finally use all that conversational data they are collecting to help companies learn from all this activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now have all this call data, email data, chat data, and we can look at it through a new lens to train agents better and provide insights to other aspects of the business like product managers and so on,&#8221; Nagar said.</p>
<p>He makes clear that this isn&#8217;t looking at sentiment or using keyword analysis to drive actions and understanding. He says that it is truly trying to understand the language in the interaction, and deliver the right kind of information to the agent to help the customer resolve the problem. That involves modeling intent, memory and understanding multiple things at the same time, which as he says, is how humans interact, and what conversational AI is trying to mimic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While it&#8217;s not completely there yet, they are working at solving each of these problems as the technology advancements allow.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2018 and the first idea was to build voice assistants for front line workers, but after talking to customers, Nagar learned there wasn&#8217;t a real demand for this, but there was for using conversational AI to help augment human workers, especially in customer service.</p>
<p>He decided to build that instead and launched the first version of the product in March 2020. Today the company has 27 employees spread out in the U.S. and India, and Nagar believes that by being remote and hiring anywhere, he can hire the best people, while driving diversity.</p>
<p>Agrawal, who is lead investor for the round, sees a company solving a fundamental problem of delivering the right information to an agent in real time. &#8220;What ​​he&#8217;s built has real time in mind. And that&#8217;s kind of the holy grail of helping the customer service agents. You can provide information after the call ends, and that&#8217;s [&#8230;] helpful, but [&#8230;] you get the real value [by delivering information] during the call and that&#8217;s where real business value is,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To celebrate its ten year anniversary, Messenger today announced a handful of new features: poll games, word effects, contact sharing, and birthday gifting via Facebook Pay. But beyond the fun features, Facebook has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/facebook-retools-messaging-again-by-adding-calling-to-main-app?sref=gni836kR">testing</a> a way to add voice and video calls back into the Facebook app, rather than on Messenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are testing audio and video calls within the Facebook app messaging experience so people can make and receive calls regardless of which app they’re using,&#8221; a representative from Facebook told TechCrunch. &#8220;This will give people on Facebook easy ways to connect with their communities where they already are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although earlier in Facebook history, the Messenger app had operated as a standalone experience, Facebook tells us that it&#8217;s now starting to see Messenger less as a separate entity &#8212; more of an underlying technology that can help to power many of the new experiences Facebook is now developing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been focused more on real-time experiences &#8212; Watch Together, Rooms, Live Audio Rooms &#8212; and we’ve started to think of Messenger as a connective tissue regardless of the surface,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson told us.  &#8220;This is a test, but the bigger vision is for us to unlock content and communities that may not be accessible in Messenger, and that the Facebook app is going to become more about shared real-time experiences,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Given the company&#8217;s move in recent months to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/">integrate its underlying communication infrastructure</a>, it should come to reason that Facebook would ultimately add more touchpoints for accessing its new Messenger-powered features inside the desktop app, as well. When asked for comment on this point, the spokesperson said the company didn&#8217;t have any details to share at this time. However, they noted that the test is a part of Facebook&#8217;s broader vision to enable more real-time experiences across Facebook&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>Despite the new integrations, the standalone version of Messenger isn&#8217;t going away.</p>
<p>Facebook says that people who want a more &#8220;full-featured&#8221; messaging, audio and video calling experience&#8221; should continue to use Messenger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As for today&#8217;s crop of new features &#8212; including polls, word effects, contact sharing, and others &#8212; the goal is to  celebrate Messenger&#8217;s ability to keep people in touch with their family a friends.</p>
<p>To play the new poll games, users can tap &#8220;Polls&#8221; in their group chat and select the &#8220;Most Likely To&#8221; tab &#8212; then, they can choose from questions like &#8220;most likely to miss their flight?&#8221; or &#8220;most likely to give gifts on their own birthday?&#8221;, select names of chat participants to be included as potential answers, and send the poll.</p>
<p>Contact sharing will make it easier to share others&#8217; Facebook contacts through Messenger, while birthday gifting lets users send birthday-themed payments on Messenger via Facebook Pay. There will also be other &#8220;birthday expression tools,&#8221; including a birthday song <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/facebook-messenger-is-stepping-up-its-emoji-game/">soundmoji</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stickers/355175666155936">&#8220;Messenger is 10!&#8221; sticker pack</a>, a new balloon background, a message effect, and AR effect to celebrate Messenger&#8217;s double-digit milestone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193678" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193678" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2193678" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Word-Effects.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193678" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Messenger</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, word effects lets users manually input a phrase, and any time they send a message with that phrase, an accompanying emoji will float across the screen. In an example, Messenger showed the phrase &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; accompanied with a word effect of confetti emojis flooding the screen. (That one&#8217;s pretty tame, but this could be a remarkable application of the poop emoji.) The company only shared a &#8220;sneak peak&#8221; of this feature, as it&#8217;s not rolling out immediately.</p>
<p>In total, Facebook is announcing a total of ten features, most of which will begin rolling out today.</p>
<p>Messenger has come a long way over the past decade.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/01/facebook-beluga/">acqui-hired</a> a small group messaging start-up called Beluga, started by three former Google employees (apparently, a functional group thread was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/23/beluga/?_ga=2.108498692.748415581.1629728212-1532633466.1621860309">white whale</a> back then &#8212; simpler times). Several months later, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/09/facebook-launches-standalone-mobile-messenger-app-and-it%E2%80%99s-beluga/">unveiled Messenger</a>, a standalone messaging app.</p>
<p>But three years into Messenger&#8217;s existence, it was no longer an optional add-on to the Facebook experience, but a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/28/facebook-moving-messages/">mandatory download</a> for anyone who wanted to keep up with their friends on the go. Facebook removed the option to send messages within its flagship app, directing users to use Messenger instead. Facebook&#8217;s reasoning behind this, the company told TechCrunch at the time, was that they wanted to eliminate the confusion of having two different mobile messaging systems. Just months earlier, Facebook had spent $19 billion to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-whatsapp/?_ga=2.213237778.748415581.1629728212-1532633466.1621860309">acquire WhatsApp</a> and woo international users. Though removing Messenger from the Facebook app was controversial, the app reached <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/messenger/">1.2 billion users</a> three years later in 2017.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook has declared that it wants to evolve into a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">metaverse</a>&#8221; company, and on the same day as the anti-trust filing last week, Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a product that applies virtual reality in an impressively boring way: helping people <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/facebook-finally-made-a-good-virtual-reality-app/">attend work meetings</a>. This metaverse would be enabled by technologies built by Facebook&#8217;s platform team, noted Vice President of Messenger Stan Chudnovsky. However, he added that people in the metaverse will still need platforms like Messenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think messaging is going anywhere, even in the metaverse, because a asynchronous communication is going to continue to exist,&#8221; Chudnovsky said. People will still need to send messages to those who aren&#8217;t currently available to chat, he explained. Plus, Chudnovsky believes this sort of communication will become even more popular with the launch of the metaverse, as the technology will help to serve as a bridge between your phone, real life, and the metaverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;if anything is gonna happen more, not less. Because messaging is that things that just continues to grow with every new platform leap,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic completely upended the threat landscape as we know it. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">Ransomware</a> accounted for an estimated 2.9 million attacks so far in 2021, and supply-chain attacks that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">targeted Kaseya</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">SolarWinds</a> have increased fourfold over 2020, according to the European Union&#8217;s cybersecurity agency, ENISA, which recently <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks">warned</a> that the more traditional cybersecurity protections are no longer effective in defending against these types of attacks.</p>
<p>This has created an unprecedented need for emerging technologies, attracting both organizations and investors to look closer at newer cybersecurity technologies.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a perfect storm of factors coming together to create the most aggressive threat landscape in history for commercial and government organizations around the world,” said Dave DeWalt, founder and managing director of NightDragon, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/varmour-the-multi-cloud-security-startup-raises-58m-en-route-to-ipo/">invested in multi-cloud security startup vArmour</a>. “As an investor and advisor, I feel we have a responsibility to help these organizations better prepare themselves to mitigate this growing risk.”</p>
<p>According to Momentum Cyber’s latest cybersecurity market review out Wednesday, investors poured $11.5 billion in total venture capital financing into cybersecurity startups in the first half of 2021, up from $4.7 billion during the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>More than 36 of the 430 total transactions surpassed the $100 million mark, according to Momentum, which includes the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/">$543 million Series A raised by passwordless authentication company Transmit Security</a> and the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/lacework-lands-525m-investment-as-revenue-grows-300/"> $525 million round closed by cloud-based security company Lacework</a>.</p>
<p>“As an investor in the cyber market for over fifteen years, I can say that this market climate is unlike anything we’ve seen to date,” said Bob Ackerman, founder and managing director of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/allegiscyber-capital/">AllegisCyber Capital</a>, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/cybersecurity-startup-panaseer-raises-26-5m-series-b-led-allegiscyber-capital/">led a $26.5 million investment in cybersecurity startup Panaseer</a>. “It is encouraging to finally see CEOs, boards of directors, investors and more paying serious attention to this space and putting the resources and capital in place to fund the innovations that address the cybersecurity challenges of today and tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, M&amp;A volume also saw a massive increase during the first six months of the year, with significant deals for companies in cloud security, security consulting, and risk and compliance. Total M&amp;A volume reached a record-breaking $39.5 billion across 163 transactions, according to Momentum, more than four-times the $9.8 billion spent in the first half of 2020 across 93 transactions.</p>
<p>Nine M&amp;A deals in 2021 so far have been valued at greater than $1 billion, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">Proofpoint’s $12.3 billion acquisition</a> by Thoma Bravo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/making-sense-of-the-6-5b-okta-auth0-deal/">Auth0’s $6.4 billion acquisition</a> by Okta, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/mcafee-sells-enterprise-biz-to-symphony-technology-group-for-4b/">McAfee’s $4 billion acquisition</a> by TG.</p>
<p>“Through the first half of 2021, we have witnessed unprecedented strategic activity with both M&amp;A and financing volumes at all-time highs,&#8221; said Eric McAlpine and Michael Tedesco, managing partners at Momentum Cyber. &#8220;We fully expect this trend to continue through the rest of the year and into 2022.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cribl is developing unified data pipelines, called “observability pipelines,” to parse and route any type of data that flows through a corporate IT system.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At a time when remote work, cybersecurity attacks and increased privacy and compliance requirements threaten a company’s data, more companies are collecting and storing their observability data, but are being locked in with vendors or have difficulty accessing the data.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://cribl.io/">Cribl</a>. The San Francisco-based company is developing an “open ecosystem of data” for enterprises that utilizes unified data pipelines, called “<a href="https://cribl.io/blog/the-observability-pipeline/">observability pipelines</a>,” to parse and route any type of data that flows through a corporate IT system. Users can then choose their own analytics tools and storage destinations like Splunk, Datadog and Exabeam, but without becoming dependent on a vendor.</p>
<p>The company announced Wednesday a $200 million round of Series C funding to value Cribl at $1.5 billion, according to a source close to the company. Greylock and Redpoint Ventures co-led the round and were joined by new investor IVP, existing investors Sequoia and CRV and strategic investment from Citi Ventures and CrowdStrike. The new capital infusion gives Cribl a total of $254 million in funding since the company was started in 2017, Cribl co-founder and CEO Clint Sharp told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pVV4CvsNaH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/splunk-acquires-network-observability-service-flowmill/">Splunk acquires network observability service Flowmill</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Splunk acquires network observability service Flowmill&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/splunk-acquires-network-observability-service-flowmill/embed/#?secret=pVV4CvsNaH" data-secret="pVV4CvsNaH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sharp did not discuss the valuation; however, he believes that the round is “validation that the observability pipeline category is legit.” Data is growing at a compound annual growth rate of 25%, and organizations are collecting five times more data today than they did 10 years ago, he explained.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, they want to ask and answer questions, especially for IT and security people,” Sharp added. “When Zoom sends data on who started a phone call, that might be data I need to know so I know who is on the call from a security perspective and who they are communicating with. Also, who is sending files to whom and what machines are communicating together in case there is a malicious actor. We can also find out who is having a bad experience with the system and what resources they can access to try and troubleshoot the problem.”</p>
<p>Cribl also enables users to choose how they want to store their data, which is different from competitors that often lock companies into using only their products. Instead, customers can buy the best products from different categories and they will all talk to each other through Cribl, Sharp said.</p>
<p>Though Cribl is developing a pipeline for data, Sharp sees it more as an “observability lake,” as more companies have differing data storage needs. He explains that the lake is where all of the data will go that doesn’t need to go into an existing storage solution. The pipelines will send the data to specific tools and then collect the data, and what doesn’t fit will go back into the lake so companies have it to go back to later. Companies can keep the data for longer and more cost effectively.</p>
<p>Cribl said it is seven times more efficient at processing event data and boasts a customer list that includes Whole Foods, Vodafone, FINRA, Fannie Mae and Cox Automotive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sharp went after additional funding after seeing huge traction in its existing customer base, saying that “when you see that kind of traction, you want to keep doubling down.” His aim is to have a presence in every North American city and in Europe, to continue launching new products and growing the engineering team.</p>
<p>Up next, the company is focusing on go-to-market and engineering growth. Its headcount is 150 currently, and Sharp expects to grow that to 250 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Over the last fiscal year, Cribl grew its revenue 293%, and Sharp expects that same trajectory for this year. The company is now at a growth stage, and with the new investment, he believes Cribl is the “future leader in observability.”</p>
<p>“This is a great investment for us, and every dollar, we believe, is going to create an outsized return as we are the only commercial company in this space,” he added.</p>

<p>Scott Raney, managing director at Redpoint Ventures, said his firm is a big enterprise investor in software, particularly in companies that help organizations leverage data to protect themselves, a sweet spot that Cribl falls into.</p>
<p>He feels Sharp is leading a team, having come from Splunk, that has accomplished a lot, has a vision and a handle on the business and knows the market well. Where Splunk is capturing the machine data and using its systems to extract the data, Cribl is doing something similar in directing the data where it needs to go, while also enabling companies to utilize multiple vendors and build apps to sit on top of its infrastructure.</p>
<p>“Cribl is adding opportunity by enriching the data flowing through, and the benefits are going to be meaningful in cost reduction,” Raney said. “The attitude out there is to put data in cheaper places, and afford more flexibility to extract data. Step one is to make that transition, and step two is how to drive the data sitting there. Cribl is doing something that will go from being a big business to a legacy company 30 years from now.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://bodo.ai">Bodo.ai</a>, a parallel compute platform for data workloads, is developing a compiler to make Python portable and efficient across multiple hardware platforms. It announced Wednesday a $14 million Series A funding round led by Dell Technologies Capital.</p>
<p>Python is one of the top programming languages used among artificial intelligence and machine learning developers and data scientists, but as Behzad Nasre, co-founder and CEO of Bodo.ai, points out, it is challenging to use when handling large-scale data.</p>
<p>Bodo.ai, headquartered in San Francisco, was founded in 2019 by Nasre and Ehsan Totoni, CTO, to make Python higher performing and production ready. Nasre, who had a long career at Intel before starting Bodo, met Totoni and learned about the project that he was working on to democratize machine learning and enable parallel learning for everyone. Parallelization is the only way to extend <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-moores-law.html">Moore’s Law</a>, Nasre told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EGEJc406DU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/sentry-launches-new-performance-monitoring-software-for-python-and-javascript/">Sentry launches new performance monitoring software for Python and JavaScript</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sentry launches new performance monitoring software for Python and JavaScript&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/sentry-launches-new-performance-monitoring-software-for-python-and-javascript/embed/#?secret=EGEJc406DU" data-secret="EGEJc406DU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bodo does this via a compiler technology that automates the parallelization so that data and ML developers don’t have to use new libraries, APIs or rewrite Python into other programming languages or graphics processing unit code to achieve scalability. Its technology is being used to make data analytics tools in real time and is being used across industries like financial, telecommunications, retail and manufacturing.</p>
<p>“For the AI revolution to happen, developers have to be able to write code in simple Python, and that high-performance capability will open new doors,” Totoni said. “Right now, they rely on specialists to rewrite them, and that is not efficient.”</p>
<p>Joining Dell in the round were Uncorrelated Ventures, Fusion Fund and Candou Ventures. Including the new funding, Bodo has raised $14 million in total. The company went after Series A dollars after its product had matured and there was good traction with customers, prompting Bodo to want to scale quicker, Nasre said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nasre feels Dell Technologies Capital was “uniquely positioned to help us in terms of reserves and the role they play in the enterprise at large, which is to have the most effective salesforce in enterprise.”</p>
<p>Though he was already familiar with Nasre, Daniel Docter, managing director at Dell Technologies, heard about Bodo from a data scientist friend who told Docter that Bodo’s preliminary results “were amazing.”</p>
<p>Much of Dell’s investments are in the early-stage and in deep tech founders that understand the problem. Docter puts Totoni and Nasre in that category.</p>
<p>“Ehsan fits this perfectly, he has super deep technology knowledge and went out specifically to solve the problem,” he added. “Behzad, being from Intel, saw and lived with the problem, especially seeing Hadoop fail and Spark take its place.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the new funding, Nasre intends to triple the size of the team and invest in R&amp;D to build and scale the company. It will also be developing a marketing and sales team.</p>

<p>The company is now shifting from financing to customer- and revenue-focused as it aims to drive up adoption by the Python community.</p>
<p>“Our technology can translate simple code into the fast code that the experts will try,” Totoni said. “I joined Intel Labs to work on the problem, and we think we have the first solution that will democratize machine learning for developers and data scientists. Now, they have to hand over Python code to specialists who rewrite it for tools. Bodo is a new type of compiler technology that democratizes AI.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fitness band market share is undoubtedly contracting, thanks in no small part to the massive popularity of smartwatches. But 13.1 million overall shipments in Q1 2021 is nothing to sneeze at. People are still buying non-watch fitness trackers, due to their lower price and non-invasiveness.</p>
<p>Announced this morning via the Google Keyword blog, the latest version of Fitbit’s Charge line looks to further blur the line line between the categories. The latest version of the premium fitness band adds a color touchscreen, along with ECG (heart) and EDA (stress) sensors.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="givDuDL9CY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/fitbit-adds-gps-and-spotify-control-for-the-the-charge-4/">Fitbit adds GPS and Spotify control for the Charge 4</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fitbit adds GPS and Spotify control for the Charge 4&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/fitbit-adds-gps-and-spotify-control-for-the-the-charge-4/embed/#?secret=givDuDL9CY" data-secret="givDuDL9CY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Naturally those sorts of smartwatch-level features also come with a $30 price increase, up to $180 &#8212; putting it at the same price point as 2019’s Versa 2 and $50 less than the Versa 3. Like I said, the lines have blurred. Fitbit also offers a number of cheaper trackers, including the $100 Inspire 2, though the company is well aware that it can’t really compete on the super low end of the market.</p>
<p>The addition of ECG monitoring brings a feature to the band that has largely been the realm of pricier smartwatches. It’s been popular with both users and doctors, who often recommend it for day to day monitoring of conditions like a-fib. That’s in addition to heart rate monitoring, which can be used around the clock, courtesy of a battery that’s rated at a full week (though the always-on option for the full-color AMOLED touchscreen will undoubtedly eat into that).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193483" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193483" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193483" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193483" class="wp-caption-text">Still photography of Fitbit Charge 5. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fitbit</p></div></p>
<p>EDA monitoring, which Fitbit first offered on the Sense last fall, is designed to detect a wearer’s stress levels by way of their finger sweat glands. That’s coupled with a “Stress Management Score” available through the Fitbit app, “so you can see each morning if you’re mentally ready to take on more challenges, or if you need to recharge.” The idea of viewing my own stress numbers over the past year is likely enough to drive them up even higher.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of that feeds into the larger Health Metrics dashboard, which the company is setting up as a kind of one-stop shop that also includes sleep and standard fitness. The Charge also offers integration with third-party mindfulness apps like Ten Percent Happier and Calm, the latter of which is a part of a new partnership that brings the wildly popular meditation app’s content to Fitbit Premium members.</p>
<p>Premium also gets a new feature called Daily Readiness Score, which Fitbit describes thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coming soon to Premium is our new Daily Readiness Score, which will use insights from your body via your Fitbit device, including your activity, heart rate variability (HRV) and recent sleep, to help you assess when you’re ready to push yourself physically — in other words, if you should workout or prioritize recovery. By wearing your Fitbit device daily (including while you sleep), you’ll receive a personalized score each morning along with details on what impacted it, with suggestions like a recommended activity level and Premium content to help you make the best decisions for your body and make your workouts more efficient.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, and here’s a picture of Fitbit’s new brand ambassador, for good measure. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/the-future-of-action-cinema-with-ang-lee-and-will-smith/">Looks familiar:</a></p>

<p>The Charge 5 is the first major release since Fitbit officially became a part of Google. We haven’t seen a lot of major changes yet (though CEO James Park is now officially “VP, GM &amp; Co-founder,” per his billing). Expect to see something more significant on that front when the company unveils its next smartwatch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Forward Kitchens provides a turnkey tool for restaurants to set up an online presence.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forwardkitchens.com/">Forward Kitchens</a> was working quietly on its digital storefront for restaurants and is now announcing a $2.5 million seed round.</p>
<p>Raghav Poddar started the company two years ago and was part of the Y Combinator Summer 2019 cohort. Poddar told TechCrunch he has been a foodie his entire life. Lately, he was relying on food delivery and pickup services, and while visiting with some of the restaurant owners, he realized a few things: first, not many had a good online presence, and second, these restaurants had the ability to cook cuisine representative of their communities.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BCTKKrEy91"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/">10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/embed/#?secret=BCTKKrEy91" data-secret="BCTKKrEy91" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That led to the idea of Forward Kitchens, which provides a turnkey tool for restaurants to set up an online presence, including food delivery, where they can create multiple digital storefronts easily and without having to contact each delivery platform. The company ran pilot programs in a handful of restaurants, and this is the first year coming out of stealth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It’s an expansion of what they have on the menu, but is not immediately available in the neighborhood,” Poddar added. “Kitchens can keep the costs and headcount the same, but be able to service the demand and get more orders because it is fulfilling a need for the neighborhood, which is why we can grow so fast.”</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Forward Kitchens goes into a restaurant and takes into account its capacity for additional cooking and the demographic area, as well as what food is available near it, and helps the restaurant create the storefront.</p>
<p>Each restaurant is able to build multiple storefronts, for example, an Italian restaurant setting up a storefront just to sell its popular mac n’ cheese or other small plates on demand. A couple hundred digital storefronts were already created, Poddar said.</p>
<p>A group of investors, including Y Combinator, Floodgate, Slow Ventures and SV Angel and angel investors Michael Seibel of YC, Ram Shriram and Thumbtack’s Jonathan Swanson, were involved in the round.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand the company’s footprint and reach, and to hire a team in operations, sales and engineering to help support the product.</p>
<p>“Forward Kitchens is empowering independent kitchens to create digital storefronts and receive more online sales,” Seibel said via email. “With Forward Kitchens, a kitchen can create world-class digital storefronts at the click of a button.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For founder and CEO Joseph Quan, the fact that so many people who worked in the industry put money in the round as angels was huge validation that Knoetic is on the right track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in March 2020, the New York City-based startup has built a platform that combines a social network and a SaaS analytics tool for chief people officers. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year, human resources leaders found themselves in a position they’d never before been &#8212; hiring talent remotely and having to work virtually to retain workers that previously came to an office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quan himself </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has worked in a variety of roles in the HR technology space, including at <a href="https://www.twinelabs.com/">Twine</a>, Knoetic’s predecessor company. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason we exist was really born out of the pandemic. We noticed in our ecosystem of chief people officers that their role was thrust into the spotlight and it was a really tough time for them, and also a really lonely time,” Quan told TechCrunch. “Everyone was kind of scrambling for answers and we just realized this was a time to actually put together a network that allows all these people to commiserate and tackle some of their hardest questions, and then from that, form the basis for a broader vision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 1,000 HR professionals are members of Knoetic’s social community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which the company has embedded directly into its </span><a href="https://www.knoetic.com/analytics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people analytics software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The result, Quan said, is an “Insight Engine” designed to give CPOs both quantitative and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">qualitative insights with the goal of helping them make “smarter, holistic” decisions about their workforce. The network is a referral-only community aimed at giving HR professionals a forum to discuss best practices and their “most pressing challenges,” such as how to navigate the COVID Delta variant and transition to and from remote work, Quan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chief people officers can also use Knoetic to do things like build board decks and present data to their CEOs. The company also claims the platform can help CPOs improve employee retention, compensation and hiring. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a short amount of time, Knoetic has built an impressive customer and community base, including the likes of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lyft, Squarespace, Amplitude, Discord, Dollar Shave Club and Zapier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vas Natarajan of Accel believes that Knoetic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is solving “a deep pain point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see how overstretched people teams are trying to wrangle information to make organizational decisions,” he wrote via email. “Across our best companies is a strong people function backed by great data to help inform all kinds of decisions around compensation, performance, and diversity and inclusion, among other things. Knoetic is uniformly solving this for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup will use its new capital toward building out new products and hiring. It currently has about 25 employees, and Quan expects that number to grow to “north of 40” by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to build the single greatest network for HR professionals and build a dedicated community team,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the line, Quan also envisions creating an analytics engine that is “prescriptive and predictive” and can do things like tell HR leaders what kind of turnover their companies are seeing, what they can do about it and how to improve retention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then it would be predictive as we gather more big data points as more people use the platform,” he added. “Then we could use that data to proactively predict who’s going to be a fast-rising company or who’s going to trip over the next 12 months. We’re starting to build those kinds of models on the back end.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meditation app Headspace this morning <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210825005262/en/Ginger-and-Headspace-Will-Merge-to-Meet-Escalating-Global-Demand-for-Mental-Health-Support">announced plans to merge</a> with on-demand mental health service, Ginger. Barring unforeseen regulatory roadblocks, the two companies will combine to form Headspace Health. The new organization would sport a combined value of $3 billion and a headcount of more than 800+.</p>
<p>The merger comes during accelerated usage of both parties, as a seemingly endless pandemic has put a strain on mental health across the globe and many have turned to virtual solutions to address the growing problem.</p>
<p>“We are witnessing a mental health crisis unlike anything we’ve experienced in our lifetimes, yet the majority of mental healthcare today is neither broadly accessible nor affordable,” Headspace CEO CeCe Morken said in a statement. “Together, as Headspace Health, we will address the systemic challenges of access and affordability in a fundamentally different way by creating the world’s most holistic, scalable, and effective mental health and wellbeing company.”</p>
<p>Morken will become the President of Headspace Health, while current CEO Russell Glass will serve as the new company’s CEO.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193743" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193743" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193743" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="537" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg 2401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=1536,805 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=2048,1074 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193743" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>“Headspace and Ginger have a shared recognition that the mental health crisis can’t be solved by simply hiring more therapists or moving care online,” Glass said. “Through this merger, we can uniquely tackle the full spectrum of mental health needs &#8212; from prevention to clinical care &#8212; all from one integrated platform.”</p>
<p>Ginger announced a $50 million Series D roughly one year ago and a $100 million Series E this March, bringing its total funding north of $220 million. Headpace, meanwhile, has raised $216 million, courtesy of last year’s $100.7 million Series C. Headspace is one of the top global meditation apps, along with chief competitor, Calm. The new company would find it pushing well beyond its current mindfulness focus to, &#8220;provide the full spectrum of proven, effective virtual support &#8211; from mindfulness and meditation, to text-based behavioral health coaching, to video-based therapy and psychiatry &#8211; for all types of patient populations.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just as importantly, the combined company would push beyond a direct to consumer model, including a corporate and Medicaid plan focus.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Further details of the deal have not been disclosed. The deal is expected to close in Q4.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Los Angeles delivery robot startup Coco this week has announced $36 million in funding. The Series A was led by Sam Altman, Silicon Valley Bank and Founders Fund, with participation from Sam Nazarian, Ellen Chen and Mario Del Pero. It brings the company&#8217;s total funding up to around $43 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;I strongly believe the delivery service industry in its current state is massively under-serving merchants. We have an enormous opportunity to create a better experience for hundreds of thousands of merchants and their customers, today,&#8221; co0founder and CEO Zach Rash said in a release. &#8220;This is not a research program experimenting with technology to be productized at some unknown point in the future.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193604" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193604" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193604" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-DSC_5440-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-DSC_5440-1-1.jpg 7018w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-DSC_5440-1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-DSC_5440-1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-DSC_5440-1-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-DSC_5440-1-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-DSC_5440-1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-DSC_5440-1-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-DSC_5440-1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193604" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Coco</p></div></p>
<p>The UCLA spinout, formerly known as Cyan Robotics, is operating in a crowded field that includes names like Starship, Nuro and UC Berkeley alum Kiwibot. Rather than pushing for full autonomy, Coco’s solution utilizes remote drivers (which are a more popular solution than many companies care to admit).</p>
<p>Coco is still young, having launched in February 2020. The company currently has a headcount of 120, with plans to &#8220;grow to over 1,000&#8221; by end of year, as the pandemic continues to fuel additional interest in robotic deliveries. The new funding will also go toward hardware and additional city launches.</p>
<p>Coco says it has been able to operate with a 97% on-time rate, while reducing delivery times for its clients by around 30%. The company lacks a massive partner like Nuro’s work with Domino&#8217;s, though California-based Umami Burger is probably the largest on a list of 18 restaurant partners currently listed on Coco’s site.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently operating in Santa Monica and in five different L.A neighborhoods,&#8221; the company tells TechCrunch.  &#8220;Later this year we are expanding into a number of other major U.S. cities. We have partnered with national restaurant brands like SBE (Umami Burger) and are actively scaling across many locations, and we are serving a wide range of family operated restaurants like Bangkok West Thai in Santa Monica and San Pedro Brewing Company in Los Angeles. We are out of the pilot phase and are launching with dozens of new merchants every day.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“As an entrepreneur, I build ‘unicorns,’ and now I’m searching for them with Myelin,” said Varsavsky in a written statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oxenford is founder and former CEO of letgo, an online secondhand marketplace. He told TechCrunch that Nisenson and Varsavsky were good friends that were successful and smart, so it made sense to join them in the firm. Though he has made over 100 investments, he is also a founder and said he wanted to help other entrepreneurs not make the same mistakes he did.</p>
<p>The firm aims to raise between $25 million and $50 million for the second fund, Oxenford said. The fund is industry agnostic, but they are attracted to seed and Series A startups in biotech, fintech, proptech, femtech and food tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also partners with large portfolios and networks for leads. An average check size for the firm is $250,000 to $500,000 for a first check, and $1 million to $3 million for follow-on funding.</p>
<p>However, Oxenford sees check sizes increasing as valuations, especially in Latin America, are rising and more capital is flowing. This also makes it more difficult to identify the companies with substance.</p>
<p>“Having been founders — all three of us — we can understand a bit better than others whether there is substance, and the projects have true potential,” he added. “We look for unicorn potential, some revenue, a serial entrepreneur and a good culture that is data-driven. We are taking a special approach that is founders helping founders in various stages of their careers.”</p>
<p>The new fund follows Myelin I, which invested several millions into 23 startups, including CookUnity and Buenbit. Nisenson says the first fund was “mostly proof-of-concept,” and was his first time as a fund manager, though Varsavsky had worked on other funds. They decided to have a very small fund and co-invest with larger funds.</p>
<p>“We found that nano funds can outperform big funds because you can invest in every deal,” Nisenson added. “The big funds don’t care because you are not competing with them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Apple and Google continue to face increasing scrutiny over the rules they set for how third-party apps in their app stores charge for services, a significant development in that story is going down in South Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea’s parliamentary committee passed on Wednesday (25 August) a landmark bill to prevent Google and Apple from charging software developers’ commissions on in-app purchases, the first of its kind in the world. The final vote by all members of the National Assembly &#8211; required to pass and activate the proposal &#8211; which was expected to be held in a plenary session on the same day, was delayed until further notice.</p>
<p>The plenary session was tentatively delayed to 30 August, according to a media.</p>
<p>South Korea will be the first country to prohibit such global tech giants from imposing billing systems on in-app purchases if voted into law.</p>
<p>The bill, dubbed the “Anti-Google Law”, was approved by the legislation and judiciary committee of the National Assembly to revise the Telecommunication Business Act, seeking to restrict Google and Apple from requiring app developers to use their billing system.</p>
<p>Google said in September 2020 it would impose its billing system on all app developers, collecting up to 30 percent commission for all in-app purchases.</p>
<p>In July 2021, Google decided to defer its new billing policy to the end of March 2022 upon request by app developers and lowered its play store commission to 15 percent, <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800028&amp;year=2021&amp;no=249500&amp;_ga=2.17139193.1386304125.1629894068-2059292691.1629894068">based on local media reports</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple said in its statement, “The proposed Telecommunications Business Act will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases, and features like &#8216;Ask to Buy&#8217; and Parental Controls will become less effective. We believe user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal—leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.”</p>
<p>Apple and Google of course argue that there are bigger issues around better and safer user experience that come with mandating their own in-app payment systems. And this is the argument that it falls on here too.</p>
<p>Google did not immediately respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Xiaomi reported a second-quarter net income of $1.28 billion on revenue of $13.56 billion following the Chinese technology giant&#8217;s strong surge in smartphone market share globally.</p>
<p>During the quarter that ended in June, Xiaomi said it saw a 64% year-on-year growth in revenue, and its net income surged over 80% from the same time a year ago.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-listed firm said its smartphone revenue grew to $9.1 billion, thanks to a just as impressive jump in its smartphone shipment to 52.9 million units in the quarter, in which it topped Apple to become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/xiaomi-global-shipments-push-past-apple-for-no-2-spot/">the world’s second-largest smartphone vendor</a>, according to market intelligence firm Canalys.</p>
<p>The U.S. government’s sanctions against Huawei, Xiaomi’s chief domestic rival, has helped the younger firm &#8212; along with some other manufacturers &#8212; gain market share domestically as well as globally.</p>
<p>Xiaomi’s revenue from Internet of Things and lifestyle products category also saw a 36% jump in revenue to $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>Shortly after reporting its earnings results, the company said it will buy the four-year-old autonomous driving technology startup Deepmotion for about $77.3 million. The investment follows Xiaomi’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/xiaomi-ev-subsidiary/">bold plan to invest $10 billion over the next decade</a> in the electric vehicles space.</p>
<p>Xiaomi is the latest Chinese tech company to enter the EV industry. Chinese search engine giant Baidu earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">announced</a> that it would be making EVs with the help of automaker Geely. In November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/alibaba-saic-ev-brand/">Alibaba and Chinese state-owned carmaker SAIC Motor</a> said they had joined hands to produce electric cars. Ride-share leader Didi and EV maker BYD are also co-designing a model for ride-hailing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As my colleague Rita Liao reported earlier:</p>
<blockquote><p>The internet behemoths are competing with a raft of more specialized EV startups such as Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto, which have already debuted multiple models and are often compared to Tesla. They strive to differentiate from each other by investing in functions from in-car entertainment to autonomous driving.</p>
<p>For Xiaomi, the obvious advantage in making cars is its vast retail network and international brand recognition. Some of its smart devices, such as smart speakers and air purifiers, could be easily incorporated into its vehicles as selling points. The real challenge, of course, is in manufacturing. Compared to phone making, the automotive industry is more capital-intensive with a long and complex supply chain. We will see if Xiaomi will pull it off.</p></blockquote>
<p>Xiaomi said Wednesday its investment in Deepmotion will help the giant shorten the time to market for its products.</p>
