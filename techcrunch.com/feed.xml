										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ethical investing remains something of a confusing maze, with a great deal of ‘greenwashing’ going on. A new UK startup is hoping to fix that with the launch of its new app and platform for retail investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://clim8invest.com/">Clim8 Invest</a>has raised $8 million from 7pc Ventures (early backers of Oculus, acquired by Facebook),  British Business Bank Future Fund and a numbers of technology entrepreneurs and executives including Marcus Exall (Monese), Marcus Mosen (N26),  Paul Willmott (Lego Digital, McKinsey), Doug Scott (Redbrain), Matt Wilkins (Thought Machine), Andrew Cocker (Skyscanner), Steve Thomson (Redbrain), Monica Kalia (Neyber, Goldman Sachs), Doug Monro (Adzuna), Erik Nygard (Limejump). </p>
<p>Consumers will be able to invest in companies and supply chains that are focused on tackling climate change. It will be competing with similar startups in the space such as London-based Tickr (backed by $3m from Ada Ventures), Helios in Paris, and Yova in Zurich.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Duncan Grierson, CEO of Clim8 said in a statement: “We are launching at an exciting time for sustainable investing. 2020 was an exceptional year for environmentally-focused investment offerings, as investors looked harder at climate-related opportunities. Sustainable investments have continued to outperform markets since the beginning of the Covid-19 Crisis and we believe this will continue.”</p>
<p>Grierson has 20 years of experience in the green space and was a winner of the EY Entrepreneur of Year Cleantech award.</p>
<p>The startup will take advantage of new, higher EU rules around the disclosure requirements for sustainable investment funds. Users can choose between either stocks and shares ISAs (up to £20k) or a taxable general investment account.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.memicmed.com/">Memic</a>, a startup developing a robotic-assisted surgical <a href="https://www.memicmed.com/hominis/">platform</a> that recently received <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-robotically-assisted-surgical-device-performing-transvaginal-hysterectomy">marketing authorization</a> from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, today announced that it has closed a $96 million Series D funding round. The round was led by Peregrine Ventures and Ceros, with participation from OurCrowd and Accelmed. The company plans to use the new funding to commercialize its platform in the U.S. and expand its marketing and sales efforts outside of the U.S., too.</p>
<p>The company previously raised a total amount of $31.8 million, according to Crunchbase, including about $12.5 million raised through crowdsourcing platform <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/companies/memic">OurCrowd</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.memicmed.com/hominis/">Hominis</a>, as the company calls its platform, has been authorized for use in &#8220;single site, natural orifice laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal benign surgical procedures including benign hysterectomy.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting that the robot doesn&#8217;t perform the surgery without human intervention. Instead, surgeons control the device &#8212; and its robotic arms &#8212; from a central console. The company notes that the instruments are meant to replicate the motions of the surgeon&#8217;s arms. And while it&#8217;s currently only authorized for this one specific type of procedure, Memic is looking at a wide range of other procedures where a system like this could be beneficial.</p>
<p class="m_-2276881737938356463MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">“The Hominis system represents a significant advancement in the growing multi-billion-dollar robotic surgery market. This financing positions us to accelerate our commercialization efforts and bring Hominis to both surgeons and patients in the months ahead,” said Dvir Cohen, co-founder and CEO of Memic.<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are a wide range of similar, computer-assisted surgical systems on the market already. Only last month, <a href="https://asensus.com/">Asensus Surgical</a> received FDA clearance for its laparoscopic platform to be used in general surgery, for example. Meanwhile, eye surgery robotics startup ForSight recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/eye-surgery-robotics-startup-forsight-raises-10m/">$10 million</a> in seed funding for its platform.</p>
<p>Memic&#8217;s Hominis is the first robotic device approved for benign transvaginal procedures, though, and the company and its investors are surely betting on this being a first stepping stone to additional use cases over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the broad potential of Hominis combined with a strong management team, we are proud to support Memic and execution of its bold vision,&#8221; said Eyal Lifschitz, managing general partner of Peregrine Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is reportedly working on a couple of new options for a renewed entry into the smart home, including a mash-up of the Apple TV with a HomePod speaker, and an integrated camera for video chat, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;sref=gni836kR">according to Bloomberg</a>. It&#8217;s also said to be working on a smart speaker that basically combines a HomePod with an iPad, providing something similar to Amazon&#8217;s Echo Show or Google&#8217;s Nest Hub in functionality.</p>
<p>The Apple TV/HomePod hybrid would still connect to a television for outputting video, and would offer similar access to all the video and gaming services that the current Apple TV does, while the speaker component would provide sound output, music playback, and Siri integration. It would also include a built-in camera for using video conferencing apps on the TV itself, the report says.</p>
<p>That second device would be much more like existing smart assistant display devices on the market today, with an iPad-like screen providing integrated visuals. The project could involve attaching the iPad via a &#8220;robotic arm&#8221; according to Bloomberg, that would allow it to move to accommodate a user moving around, with the ability to keep them in frame during video chat sessions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Bloomberg doesn&#8217;t provide any specific timelines for release of any of these potential products, and it sounds like they&#8217;re still very much in the development phase, which means Apple could easily abandon these plans depending on its evaluation of their potential. Apple just recently discontinued its original HomePod, the $300 smart speaker it debuted in 2018.</p>
<p>Rumors abound about a refreshed Apple TV arriving sometime this year, which should boast a faster processor and also an updated remote control. It could bring other hardware improvements, like support for a faster 120Hz refresh rate available on more modern TVs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ecocart.io/">EcoCart</a>, a company pitching consumers on ways to offset their carbon emissions for free at select merchants (<a href="https://ecocart.io/extension/">with a browser extension!</a>) has raised $3 million in financing from Base10 Partners.</p>
<p>Brands pay the company a commission to drive traffic to their websites under a standard affiliate marketing model and EcoCart uses a portion of the proceeds to offset a shopper&#8217;s carbon emissions.</p>
<p>About 10,000 companies work with EcoCart, either through direct partnerships, or passive affiliate marketing services. EcoCart also offers a carbon accounting tool for businesses and an offsetting offering for them as well, according to co-founders Peter Twomey and Dane Baker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup uses services like <a href="https://climeco.com/">ClimeCo</a> and <a href="http://www.bluesource.com/">BlueSource</a> to source and aggregate offset projects that companies can finance.</p>
<p>The two co-founders, who met at the University of San Diego previously founded a startup called Toyroom, which rented outdoor equipment to customers in an effort to reduce unnecessary consumption.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We live this problem ourselves. We realized it was incredibly difficult to maintain this sustainability ethos,&#8221; Baker said. </span></p>
<p>While the browser extension sets EcoCart apart from other offsetting services like Cloverly, the company does share some functionality in its business-facing offering where<a href="https://ecocart.io/business/"> an option to offset the carbon associated with a purchase</a> is integrated directly into the checkout flow.</p>
<p>EcoCart launched its business-to-business integration in June of last year and now counts 500 vendors as customers. So far, about a quarter of customers have chosen to offset their purchases at checkout amounting to the capture of an estimated 25 million pounds of CO2, the company said.</p>
<p>Investors backing the company include Base 10 Partners; PopSugar co-founder, Brian Sugar&#8217;s early stage venture fund and angel investors like Ben Jabbaway, the founder of Privy; Rich Gardner, the VP of global partnerships at Klaviyo; Kyle Hency, the co-founder of Chubbie; Bryan Meehan, the chair of Blue Bottle Coffee; and Carly Strife, the co-founder of BarkBox.</p>
<p>While online shopping gets a bad reputation, it&#8217;s actually sometimes a greener option than shopping in physical stores, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00562-y">according to one study published in Nature last year</a>.</p>
<p>Consumer offsets, while well-meaning, don&#8217;t have nearly the same impact as having the companies themselves actually rein in their greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonize their operations. In fact, the whole notion of the consumer carbon footprint and the personal responsibility of consumers for planetary pollution was <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/">dreamed up by advertising executives at the behest of oil and gas and consumer goods companies pushing products</a>.</p>
<p>But something is better than nothing, and offsets do help necessary projects get funding.</p>
<p>EcoCart said it spent months developing a proprietary algorithm to calculate the carbon footprint of online orders. For both the e-commerce plugin and browser extension, EcoCart uses the characteristics of each order including material inputs to the item, shipping distance, and package weight to estimate the emissions created from that order, the company said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe EcoCart is reinventing how brands interact with their customers while also managing and addressing their environmental impact at scale,” said Chris Zeoli, Principal at Base10 Partners, in a statement. “EcoCart represents a solution that is helping reverse decades of harmful climate change. Base10 is proud to be partnering with the EcoCart founders as they continue to make carbon neutral shopping the new checkout standard for industries including retail, micromobility, food delivery, and more.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting this week, some Domino&#8217;s customers in Houston can have a pizza delivered without ever interacting with a human.</p>
<p>The pizza delivery giant said Monday it has partnered with autonomous delivery vehicle startup Nuro to allow select customers to have their pizzas dropped at their door via Nuro&#8217;s R2 robot.</p>
<p>“There is still so much for our brand to learn about the autonomous delivery space,&#8221; Dennis Maloney, Domino’s senior vice president and chief innovation officer said in a statement. &#8220;This program will allow us to better understand how customers respond to the deliveries, how they interact with the robot and how it affects store operations.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On certain days and times, customers ordering from the Woodland Heights store on the Domino&#8217;s website can request R2, which uses radar, 360-degree cameras and thermal imaging to direct its movement. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They&#8217;ll get texts to let them know where the robot is and what PIN they&#8217;ll need to access their pizza via the bot&#8217;s touchscreen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Over the course of the pandemic, the contactless, autonomous food delivery industry has accelerated quickly, and Nuro is currently poised to become a leader in this space.</span></p>
<p>“Nuro’s mission is to better everyday life through robotics,&#8221; Dave Ferguson, Nuro co-founder and president, said in a statement. “We’re excited to introduce our autonomous delivery bots to a select set of Domino’s customers in Houston. We can’t wait to see what they think.”</p>
<p>This is the first time meals will be delivered by an electric, self-driving, occupant-less vehicle on the roads in Houston. Woodland Heights, which is mainly residential, is one of the oldest historic neighborhoods in Houston, flanked by the I-45 and I-10 highways. The Domino&#8217;s there is right on Houston Avenue, a main thoroughfare, making this a substantially challenging space in which to pilot this technology.</p>
<p>Nuro originally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/17/dominos-will-start-delivering-pizzas-via-an-autonomous-robot-this-fall/">announced the Domino&#8217;s partnership and began testing in Houston in 2019</a>. That same year, the company began deploying its vehicles to transport Kroger groceries in Houston and Phoenix. At the end of 2020, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california/">approved to begin testing on public roads in California</a>, delivering goods from partners like Walmart and CVS. Nuro is the first company to be granted regulatory approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation for a self-driving vehicle exemption.</p>
<p>Domino&#8217;s appears to be Nuro&#8217;s first large foray into restaurant delivery, but it certainly won&#8217;t be the last. The company just announced its $500 million Series C round, funded in part by Chipotle. Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s innovation-focused subsidiary Woven Planet, also invested, kicking off the fund&#8217;s portfolio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.thezebra.com">The Zebra</a>, an Austin-based company that operates an insurance comparison site, has raised $150 million in a Series D round that propels it into unicorn territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the round size and valuation are a substantial bump from the $38.5 million Series C that Austin-based The Zebra raised in February of 2020. (The company would not disclose its valuation at that time, saying now only that its new valuation of over $1 billion is a “nice step up.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zebra also would not disclose the name of the firm that led its Series D round, but sources familiar with the deal said it was London-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hedosophia. Existing backers Weatherford Capital and Accel also participated in the funding event.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round size also is bigger than all of The Zebra’s prior rounds combined, bringing the company’s total raised to $261.5 million since its 2012 inception. Previous backers also include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Silverton Partners, Ballast Point Ventures, Daher Capital, Floodgate Fund, The Zebra CEO Keith Melnick, KDT and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Melnick, the round was all primary, and included no debt or secondary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zebra started out as a site for people looking for auto insurance via its real-time quote comparison tool. The company partners with the top 10 auto insurance carriers in the U.S. Over time, it’s also “naturally” evolved to offer homeowners insurance with the goal of eventually branching out into renters and life insurance. It recently launched a dedicated home and auto bundled product, although much of its recent growth still revolves around its core auto offering, according to Melnick.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 VCs talk the future of Austin&#8217;s exploding startup ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/6-vcs-talk-the-future-of-austins-exploding-startup-ecosystem/embed/#?secret=xA45OWVn4D" data-secret="xA45OWVn4D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other financial services companies, The Zebra has benefited from the big consumer shift to digital services since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we know this because the company is one of the few that are refreshingly open about their financials. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zebra doubled its net revenue in 2020 to $79 million compared to $37 million in 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Melnick</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who is former president of travel metasearch engine Kayak. March marked the company’s highest-performing month ever, he said, with revenue totaling $12.5 million &#8212; putting the company on track to achieve an annual run rate of $150 million this year. For some context, that’s up from $8 million in September of 2020 and $6 million in May of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, its revenue per applicant has grown at a clip of 100% year over year, according to Melnick. And The Zebra has increased its headcount to over 325, compared to about 200 in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve definitely improved our relationships with carriers and seen more carrier participation as they continue to embrace our model,” Melnick said. “And we’ve leaned more into brand marketing efforts.”</span></p>

Image courtesy of The Zebra</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was even </span><a href="https://www.thezebra.com/about/press/zebra-announces-profitability-alongside-launch-homeowners-comparison-product/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profitable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a couple of months last year, somewhat “unintentionally,” according to Melnick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not highly unprofitable or burning through money like crazy,” he told TechCrunch. “This new raise wasn’t to fund operations. It’s more about accelerating growth and some of our product plans. We’re pulling forward things that were planned for later in time. We still had a nice chunk of money sitting on our balance sheet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to use its new capital to do more hiring and focus strongly on continuing to build The Zebra’s brand, according to Melnick. Some of the things the company is planning include a national advertising campaign and adding tools and information so it can serve as an “insurance advisor,” and not just a site that refers people to carriers. It’s also planning to create more “personalized experiences and results” via machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are accelerating our efforts to make The Zebra a household name,” Melnick said. “And we want a deeper connection with our users.” It also aims to be there for a consumer through their lifecycle &#8212; as they move from being renters to homeowners, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while an IPO is not out of the question, he emphasizes that it’s not the company&#8217;s main objective at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I definitely try not to get locked on to a particular exit strategy. I just want to make sure we continue to build the best company we can. And then, I think the exit will make itself apparent,” Melnick said. “I’m not blind and am very aware that public market valuations are strong right now and that may be the right decision for us, but for now, that’s not the ultimate goal for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the CEO, there’s still plenty of runway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a big milestone, but I do feel like for us that this is just the beginning,” he said. “We’ve just scratched the surface of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early investor Mark Cuban believes the company is at an inflection point.</span></p>
<p>&#8221; ‘Startup’ isn’t the right word anymore,&#8221; he said in a written statement. &#8220;The Zebra is a full fledged tech company that is taking on &#8211; and solving &#8211; some of the biggest challenges in the $638B insurance industry.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel Partner John Locke said the firm has tripled down on its investment in The Zebra because of its confidence in not only what the company is doing but also its potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In an increasingly noisy insurance landscape that includes insurtechs and traditional carriers, giving consumers the ability to compare everything in one place is is more and more valuable,” he told TechCrunch. “I think The Zebra has really seized the mantle of becoming the go-to site for people to compare insurance and then that&#8217;s showing up in the numbers, referral traffic and fundraise interest.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hi there, new and returning readers. This is The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before jump into micromobbin&#8217; and the rest, I wanted to point you to another Extra Crunch piece, this time a deep dive into second-life batteries. As Aria Alamalhodaei reports:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The average electric vehicle lithium-ion battery can retain up to 70% of its charging capacity after being removed. The business proposition for second-life batteries is therefore intuitive: Before sending the battery to a recycler, automakers can potentially generate additional revenue by putting it to use in another application or selling it to a third party.</p></blockquote>
<p>The upshot: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/">automakers are starting to make moves</a>.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for Extra Crunch stories on the business of hydrogen, software in micromobility and voice in cars.</p>

<p>Transit authorities in New York City and London have remained steadfast in their refusal to announce the winners of their respective e-scooter pilots, which both should have started weeks ago. But a peek at company websites, LinkedIns and job boards reveal who is at least <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/job-postings-hint-at-winners-of-nyc-and-london-e-scooter-pilots/">preparing to enter</a> the last two big frontiers of dockless, shared micromobility.</p>
<p>I’m betting on <strong>Lime</strong> securing both cities, which feels more like an educated guess given the company’s reach. <strong>Dott</strong> looks like it’ll be opening up in London; <strong>Superpedestrian</strong>, and maybe <strong>Spin</strong>, in NYC. <strong>Bird</strong> and <strong>Voi</strong> also have job listings in both cities, but the evidence backing concession wins is not conclusive based on listings alone.</p>

<p>Speaking of Lime, the company rolled out its <a href="https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/washington-becomes-first-city-to-roll-out-lime-e-mopeds-6271">first e-mopeds</a> in Washington, D.C. and <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/tourisme-transport/lime-defie-cityscoot-a-paris-en-lancant-les-scooters-electriques-en-libre-service-1304676">Paris</a> over the past two weeks. This launch makes D.C. the ultimate Lime-stan, being the first city to host all three modes of the company’s transport options which also include e-bikes and e-scooters. City officials and Lime agreed that riders will have to snap a mandatory helmet selfie to be able to take off.</p>
<p>Lime isn’t the only shared micromobility company that’s eyeing expansion. Dutch e-scooter startup <strong>Go Sharing</strong> is spreading its wings outside the Netherlands with a <a href="https://www.electrive.com/2021/04/06/dutch-go-sharing-launches-e-moped-fleet-in-vienna/">launch in Vienna</a>, and Berlin-based <strong>Tier</strong> has <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/berlin-based-micro-mobility-firm-tier-acquires-makery-establishes-new-tech-hub-in-budapest/">acquired Budapest’s app make</a>r <strong>Makery</strong>. It’s not clear how much Tier paid for the company, but Makery will serve as Tier’s tech hub in Central and Eastern Europe as the company plans expansion later this year.</p>
<p>It seems like the dockless rideshare industry is on its way up, but let us not forget how many stars need to align to make it work. After weeks of delays, U.K.-based <strong>Beryl</strong><a href="https://www.silive.com/coronavirus/2021/04/beryl-cancels-staten-island-bike-share-program-weeks-before-expected-rollout.html"> canceled its launch of e-scooters</a> in Staten Island, citing logistical and supply chain issues due to Covid.</p>
<h2>New ride swag releases</h2>
<p>China’s <strong>Niu</strong> appears to be doing well, reporting a <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/niu-stock-q1-2021-electric-scooter-sales-rebound/">surge in electric scooter sales</a> in the first quarter, up 273% to almost 150,000 e-scooters. On Tuesday, Niu launched four new vehicles, including a new electric kick scooter that will be sold in international markets starting at $599.</p>
<p>While we’re discussing sexy new rides, check out Segway’s <a href="https://www.ninebot.com/product/SegwayApexH2/">futuristic-looking e-motorcycle</a>. (No, I didn’t think “sexy” and “Segway” could exist in the same sentence either, yet here we are.)</p>
<p>This particular sports bike is a reminder that the company has branched out into the world of cool electric mobility since its 2015 acquisition by Ninebot. The Apex H2 is definitely not the stuff of mall cops and tour groups. What’s more, the new motorcycle is powered by a combination of hydrogen and electricity — essentially hydrogen stored in tanks will be converted into electricity and then stored in a battery. The only byproduct would be water vapor released from the tailpipe.</p>
<h2>Post-Rona public transit push</h2>
<p>Many policy-focused armchair experts have discussed the potential benefits of cities intertwining with micromobility and rideshare companies to encourage a post-Covid public transit recovery. Sydney, Australia might be the first city to give it a shot.</p>
<p>Starting mid-2021, up to 10,000 riders will be able to use their <a href="https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/uber-taps-on-for-discounted-public-transport">digital Opal Card</a> to pay for an Uber, a fixed fare <strong>Ingogo</strong> taxi trip or a Lime bike journey. If they catch public transport within an hour of those rides, they’ll get up to a $3 credit on their Opal account.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>OK, so it&#8217;s not a done deal yet, but it has the makings of being so large that I just had to make it &#8216;deal of the week.&#8217;</p>
<p>Citing unnamed sources, <a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/grab-said-to-draw-t-rowe-price-temasek-backing-for-spac-deal">Bloomberg reported</a> that Southeast Asian ride-hailing and delivery giant <strong>Grab Holdings</strong> has attracted backing from T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Temasek Holdings Pte for its planned merger with a blank-check company.</p>
<p>Grab isn&#8217;t just a ride-hailing app anymore. It has added all kinds of services to its app such as financial services and food delivery. The value of that app might explain the number of firms that are apparently lining up to join a private investment in public equity offering (PIPE) to support Grab&#8217;s combination with Altimeter Growth Corp. BlackRock Inc. is one of those firms that is in talks to participate in the PIPE, which could raise about $4 billion.</p>
<p>The upshot? The deal could value Grab at more than $34 billion. That would make it the biggest SPAC ever.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to call it. Peak SPAC is here.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elior</strong>, the corporate catering company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/elior-acquires-food-delivery-startup-nestor/">has acquired</a> French delivery startup <strong>Nestor</strong> for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p><strong>Kavak</strong>, the Mexican startup focused on the used car market in Mexico and Argentina, raise a Series D round of $485 million, which now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/mexican-unicorn-kavak-raises-a-485m-series-d-at-a-4b-valuation/">values the company at $4 billion</a>. Kavak is now one of the top five highest-valued startups in Latin America.</p>
<p><strong>Kolonial</strong>, a startup based out of Oslo that offers same-day or next-day delivery of food, meal kits and home essentials, has raised €223 million ($265 million) in an equity round of funding. Along with that, the company &#8212; profitable as of this year &#8212; is rebranding to Oda and plans to use the money (and new name) to expand to more markets, starting first with Finland and then Germany in 2022, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/norways-kolonial-rebrands-as-oda-bags-265m-on-a-900m-valuation-to-grow-its-online-grocery-delivery-business-in-europe/">Ingrid Lunden reports</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LanzaJet</strong>, the company commercializing a process to convert alcohol into jet fuel, gained energy giant Shell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/shell-invests-in-lanzajet-to-speed-up-deliveries-of-its-synthetic-aviation-fuel/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">as a strategic investor</a>. All Nippon Airways, Suncor Energy, Mitsui and British Airways are also investors. The funding amount wasn&#8217;t disclosed. LanzaJet is a spinoff from LanzaTech, one of the last surviving climate tech startups from the first cleantech boom that&#8217;s still privately held.</p>
<p><strong>Nuvocargo</strong>, a digital logistics platform for cross-border trade, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/nuvocargo-raises-12m-to-digitize-the-freight-logistics-industry/">raised a $12 million Series A funding</a> round led by QED Investors and participation from David Velez, Michael Ronen, Raymond Tonsing, FJ Labs and Clocktower. Previous investors NFX and ALLVP also put money into this round.</p>
<p><strong>QuantumScape Corporation</strong> said it successfully met the technical milestone that was a condition to close the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005943/en/%C2%A0QuantumScape-Meets-Volkswagen-Technical-Milestone-Clearing-Way-for-100M-Investment">additional $100 million investment</a> by VW Group. The milestone required Volkswagen to successfully test the latest generation of QuantumScape&#8217;s solid-state lithium-metal cells in their labs in Germany. This will be the second and final closing under the May 14, 2020 stock purchase agreement between VW and QuantumScape that provided for a total $200 million investment. (I missed this one last week).</p>
<p><strong>Spinny</strong>, the India-based online used car marketplace, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/indias-spinny-raises-65-million-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/">raised $65 million</a> in its Series C financing round led by Silicon Valley-headquartered venture firm General Catalyst. Feroz Dewan&#8217;s Arena Holdings, Think Investments and existing investors Fundamentum Partnership &#8212; backed by tech veterans Nandan Nilekani and Sanjeev Aggarwal &#8212; and Elevation Capital participated as well.</p>
<p><strong>Swyft</strong>, a company that helps retailers compete with Amazon by offering same-day delivery, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/swyft-raises-17-5-million-to-bring-same-day-delivery-to-all-the-retailers-that-arent-amazon/">raised $17.5 million</a> in a Series A round co-led by Inovia Capital and Forerunner Ventures, with participation from Shopify and existing investors Golden Ventures and Trucks VC.</p>

<p>Some interesting items this week.</p>
<h2>Ride-hailing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Uber</strong> announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uber-entices-drivers-back-post-pandemic-with-250-million-stimulus/">$250 million stimulus</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to try to entice drivers back after the pandemic. As vaccinations increase, so do Uber bookings, but there are not enough drivers to meet demand after many stopped working over the last year. This stimulus will see existing, returning and new drivers receive bonuses.</span></p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Apple</strong> CEO Tim Cook hinted heavily at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/tim-cook-drops-hints-about-autonomous-tech-and-the-apple-car/">autonomous future of its Apple car</a>, during an interview on the “Sway” podcast with Kara Swisher.</span></p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> CEO Chris Urmson, who is the new chair of the World Economic Forum’s Global AV Council, led a discussion with industry and government leaders about the benefits of self-driving trucking – safety, service, and sustainability – and how self-driving will change our workforce. Urmson later shared his views in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/world-economic-forum-bringing-together-leaders-across-chris-urmson/?trackingId=8qrvPPNcQ1CfTIPTRqsaOg%3D%3D">post on LinkedIn</a>. Uber CEO and Aurora Board member Dara Khosrowshahi was the previous chair of this council.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Verizon</strong> and <strong>Honda</strong> announced a partnership on Thursday to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/verizon-and-honda-want-to-use-5g-and-edge-computing-to-make-driving-safer/">test 5G and mobile edge computing</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make driving safer. We’re a long way away from even having a viable 5G network, let alone cars that can operate on it. But eventually, they hope to apply this kind of tech to self-driving vehicles. Side note: This isn&#8217;t Verizon&#8217;s first 5G-meets-MEC-and-vehicle rodeo. The company has been testing at Mcity since 2019. Last November, Renovo Auto (which Verizon is backing) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3XgPC-Oof8">released a video demonstrating</a> how 5G and MEC coupled with its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automotive data platform indexes and filters Advanced Driver Assistance System vehicle-data in near-real time. The tests were also conducted at</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mcity. </span></p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> is adding an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/gm-to-build-an-electric-chevrolet-silverado-pickup-with-more-than-400-miles-of-range/">electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck</a> to its lineup, as the automaker pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025. The Chevrolet Silverado electric full-size pickup will be based on the automaker&#8217;s Ultium battery platform and GM estimates the range will be more than 400 miles on a full charge. GM is targeting both the consumer and commercial market with this new electric pickup.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar </strong>set a &#8220;moonshot goal&#8221; to create the first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/polestar-will-have-to-question-everything-in-order-to-build-the-first-climate-neutral-ev/">climate-neutral car</a> by 2030. It&#8217;s a goal that won&#8217;t achieved by widely practiced offsetting measures, such as planting trees. Instead, Polestar aims to rethink every piece of the supply chain, from materials sourcing through to manufacturing, and even by making the vehicle more energy efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Wildcat Discovery Technologies</strong>, a technology company developing new battery materials, has gained Peter Lamp, general manager of the battery cell technology group at BMW AG, <a href="http://www.wildcatdiscovery.com/newsroom/detail-pages/02042021/">as a board member</a>.</p>
<h2>eVTOLs</h2>
<p><strong>Wisk Aero</strong>, the air mobility company borne out of a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/">filed a lawsuit</a> against <strong>Archer Aviation</strong> alleging patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation.</p>
<h2>In-car tech</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> confirmed that its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/gm-idles-more-north-american-plants-as-chip-shortage-drags-on/">idling more plants</a> and extending shutdowns at other facilities in North America due to a continued shortage of semiconductor chips that are used to control myriad operations in vehicles, including the infotainment, power steering and brake systems. Eight assembly plants are affected by the temporary closures.</p>
<p>Of course, GM is hardly the only automaker to be impacted by the global chip shortage. Competitor Ford has also had to temporarily pause production at some factories, while other automakers <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/automobiles/546424-subaru-temporarily-closing-plant-due-to-chip-shortage">such as Subaru</a> and Stellantis (the automaker formed by the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Groupe PSA).</p>
<h2>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</h2>
<p>The TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 event will be virtual again. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped us from putting together a stellar list of participants. We just starting to announce who will be on our virtual stage June 9.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one biggie: we&#8217;re bringing <strong>Joby Aviation</strong> founder <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong> and famed investor and LinkedIn co-founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/joby-aviations-joe-ben-bevirt-and-reid-hoffman-to-talk-about-building-a-startup-the-future-of-flight-and-spacs/">together on stage</a>. If my recent interview with those two provides an indication of what&#8217;s to come, it should be eye opening.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true">Early Bird tickets</a> to the show are now available — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book today</a> and save $100 before prices go up.</em></strong></p>
<p>Bevirt and Hoffman will discuss building a startup &#8212; and keeping it secret while raising funds &#8212; the future of flight and, of course, SPACs. If you recall, Joby announced in February that it would become a publicly traded company through a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company formed by Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We approach it (SPACs) as venture capital at scale,&#8221; Hoffman told TechCrunch in a February interview. So it&#8217;s not a &#8216;this-year thing,&#8217; it&#8217;s a next three years, next five years, next 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes, Hoffman believes SPACs are here to stay. Although we plan to check in on his stance in June. &#8220;I think that it&#8217;s valuable to the market and valuable to society to have multiple, different paths by which companies can go public,&#8221; Hoffman said.</p>
<p>Other guests to TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, includes investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Venture</strong>s and <strong>Rachel Ho</strong>lt of <strong>Construct Capita</strong>l, as well as <strong>Starship Technologies</strong> co-founder and CEO/CTO <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>. Stay tuned for more announcements in the weeks leading up to the event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ngksparkplugs.com/en/">NGK Spark Plug</a>, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of automative spark plugs, announced a new $100 million fund to invest in startups and find potential merger and acquisition deals. The fund was launched with Pegasus Tech Ventures, the &#8220;venture capital as a service&#8221; firm that has also worked with corporations like Sega Sammy Holdings, Asus and Aisin Seiki to launch venture funds.</p>
<p>While best known for its automotive components, NGK Spark Plug also manufacturers many other hardware components, including for semiconductor production equipment, cutting tools, medical equipment, industrial ceramics. In recent years, the Nagoya, Japan-headquartered company has <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/23/worlds-largest-spark-plug-manufacturer-shifting-focus-solid-state-ev-batteries/">begun focusing on new technologies</a>, like solid-state electric vehicle batteries.</p>
<p>NGK Spark Plug’s new corporate venture fund is an opportunity to work with startups and expand into new businesses, said Anis Uzzaman, general partner and chief executive officer of Pegasus Tech Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is looking for software and hardware startups in the United States, Europe, Israel and Asia and will focus on three themes: smart health, decentralized utilities and smart mobility.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DNX Ventures launches $315 million fund for US and Japanese B2B startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/dnx-ventures-launches-315-million-fund-for-u-s-and-japanese-b2b-startups/embed/#?secret=rGW6Hrrccw" data-secret="rGW6Hrrccw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The selection of those areas is based on global trends and data. The global rate of poverty is decreasing and more people need healthy food, clean water, access to energy, mobility and easy access to healthcare,&#8221; Uzzaman told TechCrunch in an email.<br />
&#8220;NGK is using its material and sensors expertise, as well as its sales channels in automotive, to establish systems and solutions to address major pain points in those areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>For smart mobility, this means tech like charging solutions, solid state batteries, ADAS systems, service platforms and power inverters. In decentralized utilities, NGK Spark Plug will look at food tech and agriculture startups, with the goal of creating safer and more sustainable food supplies and reducing pollution. It is also interested in air purification technology.</p>
<p>The fund will invest in early to late stage startups, with check sizes ranging from a few hundred thousand dollars to a few million dollars. NGK Spark Plug plans to work closely with portfolio companies, helping bring their tech to maturation, investing in them at multiple stages and remaining open to potential mergers and acquisitions, Uzzaman added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise has expanded its robotaxi ambitions beyond San Francisco. The autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM that also has backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Microsoft and Honda, has struck a deal to <a href="https://twitter.com/HamdanMohammed/status/1381541345941151744">launch a robotaxi service in Dubai</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>The robotaxi service in Dubai will use the Cruise Origin, the all-electric shuttle-like vehicle that has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to travel at highway speeds. The Origin, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/cruise-unveils-origin-an-electric-driverless-vehicle-designed-for-sharing/">unveiled in January 2020</a> will be manufactured by GM.</p>
<p>Cruise will establish a new local Dubai-based company which will be responsible for the deployment, operation and maintenance of the fleet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The service will start with a limited number of vehicles with plans to scale up to 4,000 vehicles by 2030 as part of Dubai&#8217;s self-driving transport strategy,  according to Mattar Mohammed Al Tayer, the director-general and chairman of the board of the RTA. The robotaxis — and eventually the service — will be introduced gradually and limited to specific areas before expanding to other parts of the city.</p>
<p>Dubai’s Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed said the agreement with Cruise is a &#8220;major step towards realizing Dubai&#8217;s Self-Driving Transport Strategy aimed at converting 25% of total trips in Dubai into self-driving transport trips across different modes of transport by 2030.&#8221;</p>
<p>Importantly, Cruise has a lock on Dubai for at least a few years. Under the agreement, Cruise is the &#8220;exclusive provider&#8221; for self-driving taxis and ride-hailing services in Dubai until 2029. Al Tayer said the selection of Cruise was not taken lightly and involved a comprehensive, multi-year process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s fintech space has gained proper attention over the past few years in investments but it is not news that startups still battle with offering high-quality products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they seem to be doing quite well compared with traditional banks that face challenges like legacy cost structures and a major lack of operational efficiency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.appzonegroup.com/">Appzone</a> is a fintech software provider. It is one of the few companies that builds proprietary solutions for these financial institutions and their banking and payments services. Today, the company is announcing that it has closed $10 million in Series A investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, African financial institutions rely on using foreign technology solutions to solve their problems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But issues around pricing, flexibility to innovate, and a lack of local tech support always come up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is where Appzone has found its sweet spot. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company based in Lagos, Nigeria, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/emeka-emetarom-ba532827">Emeka Emetarom</a>, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/obi-emetarom-772213168">Obi Emetarom</a>, and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/wale-onawunmi-13a30089">Wale Onawunmi </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2008</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appzone clearly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plays a different game from other African fintechs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One clear differentiator is that the company functions as an enabler (at payment rails and the core infrastructure) within banking and payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It commenced as a services firm to provide commercial banks with custom software development services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2011, the company launched its first core banking product targeting microfinance institutions. The following year, Appzone launched its first product (branchless banking) for commercial banks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It went live with its mobile and internet banking service in 2016 and launched an instant card issuance product in 2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the company launched services catered to end-to-end automation of lending operations for banks and blockchain switching</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started Appzone with the intention to build out innovative local solutions for banking and payments on the continent,&#8221; CEO Obi Emetarom told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The focus was to leverage our ability as an enabler to create proprietary technology for both segments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136868" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136868" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2136868" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-141.png?w=680" alt="Appzone" width="680" height="247" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-141.png 1313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-141.png?resize=150,54 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-141.png?resize=300,109 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-141.png?resize=768,278 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-141.png?resize=680,247 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-141.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2136868" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Appzone</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appzone platforms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are used by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 18 commercial banks and over 450 microfinance banks in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, they amass a yearly transaction value and yearly loan disbursement of $2 billion and $300million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Google for Startups Accelerator alumnus claims to have led Africa’s fintech sector in some global firsts from the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the company says it created the world’s first decentralised payment processing network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Second, the first core banking and omnichannel software on the cloud. Third, the first multi-bank direct debit service based on single global mandates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emetarom likes to describe Appzone as a fintech product ecosystem with an emphasis on proprietary technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So far, we&#8217;ve touched on two layers of this ecosystem—the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital core banking service providing software that runs financial institutions&#8217; entire operations and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interbank processing, which integrates these institutions into a decentralized network powered by blockchain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinciding with this investment is the introduction and scaling of a third layer that focuses on end-user applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appzone, having built both banking and fintech layers, wants to connect individuals and businesses to their services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where most new-age fintech startups operate, and although Appzone is coming late to the party, it has a bit of an edge, the CEO believes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most of these companies operating in end-user applications have to depend on services from core banking and interbank processing to be able to get their own offerings out there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we have an advantage </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> costs and flexibility because we are already operating in both layers,&#8221; Emeratom said in relation to what he thinks of competition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is coming out to blitz scale its products and services after working in stealth mode for more than a decade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One way it wants to carry this out will be to take its pan-African expansion sternly even though a large part of its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 450 clients </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nigeria. Other countries with a presence include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Gambia, Guinea, Tanzania, and Senegal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before now, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appzone lacked the resources to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> push into these markets aggressively even though they showed promise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But having closed its Series A, the plan is to drive growth in these countries and expand across more African countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another means Appzone plans to achieve scale is by growing its engineering team &#8212; a department it takes pride in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These engineers make up half of Appzone&#8217;s 150 employees and there are plans to double down on this number. Like most Nigerian startups these days, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appzone is big on senior engineers. Still, while it might present a problem to other companies, Emetarom says the company has no issue training promising junior talent to grow in expertise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our proprietary tech allows us to innovate at a fraction of a cost, and they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are built by</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the best local talent available</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because those systems are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complex and the level of innovation required is on another level, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seek out the to 1% of talent in Nigeria,&#8221; he remarked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that even though the expertise isn&#8217;t there, we can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquiring that expertise when we train the very best talents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more we train our engineers, the faster they grow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expertise, and they will be able to deliver at the same level of world-class quality we expect.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136867" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136867" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2136867" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppZone-Obi.jpeg?w=453" alt="Appzone" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppZone-Obi.jpeg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppZone-Obi.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppZone-Obi.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppZone-Obi.jpeg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppZone-Obi.jpeg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppZone-Obi.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2136867" class="wp-caption-text">Obi Emetarom (Co-founder and CEO, Appzone)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the round, a noteworthy event is that most investors who took part are based in Nigeria despite its size</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.cardinalstone.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CardinalStone Capital Advisers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Lagos-based investment firm, led the Series A investment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors based in the country include</span><a href="https://v8cappartners.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">V8 Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="http://www.constantcap.com/about.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Constant Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://itanna.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Itanna Capital Ventures. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based but Africa-focused firm</span><a href="https://latcap.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lateral Investment Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before now, Appzone closed a $2 million from South African Business Connexion (BCX) in 2014. Four years later, it raised $2.5 million in convertible debt and bought back shares from BCX in the process. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company says it has raised $15 million in equity funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/yomi-jemibewon-29a4b1">Yomi Jemibewon</a>, the co-founder and managing director of Cardinal Stone Capital Advisers, said the firm&#8217;s investment in Appzone is further proof of Africa&#8217;s potential as the future hub of world-class technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Appzone is building a disruptive fintech ecosystem that will be the backbone of Africa&#8217;s finance industry with products across payments, infrastructure and software as a service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of Appzone&#8217;s work is multifold &#8212; the company&#8217;s products deepen financial inclusion across the continent whilst providing best-fit and low-cost solutions to financial institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its emphasis on premium talent also helps stem brain drain, rewarding Africa&#8217;s best brains with best in class employment opportunities,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appzone&#8217;s funding continues the fast-paced investment activities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Africa&#8217;s fintech space after a slow January</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the last two months, more than eight fintech startups have secured million-dollar rounds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes very large rounds by South African digital bank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">TymeBank</a> ($109 million) in February and African payments company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> ($170 million) in March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A day spent driving a pre-production 2022 Mercedes Benz EQS provided an up-close look at what the German automaker has been doing with the billions of dollars it has dedicated to electrification.</p>
<p>The EQS is a meticulously designed flagship sedan that brings together the automaker&#8217;s MBUX infotainment system, a new electric platform and advancements in performance. It is an unapologetic pursuit to set a new benchmark for a full-size luxury sedan that happens to be electric.</p>
<p>The luxury electric sedan is meant to show American consumers what Mercedes can deliver (and will) in the future with EVs. And the stakes are high. The German automaker is banking on a successful rollout of the EQS in North America.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the beginning of a complete new era, because so far we had a completely flexible platform in place with hybrids, ICE, and BEVs,&#8221; said Christophe Starzynski, head of the EQ brand, who added that Mercedes will add three additional electric vehicles to its U.S. portfolio by 2025, including the EQE and two additional SUVs. &#8220;This is the first time that we really designed and developed and put all the technology in a battery electric vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EQS is the 17-foot long flagship derivative of the S-Class, Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s top-of-the-line luxury sedan that has a base price of $110,000. (So far, pricing on EQS hasn&#8217;t been revealed.) It&#8217;s stocked with its best tech to date. While most customers won&#8217;t appreciate all the doodads optioned on this car, they might enjoy knowing it&#8217;s all stored in that extensive infotainment cloud, or only a software update away.</p>
<h2>The first drive</h2>
<p>A fully loaded EQS is such a leap forward that it makes the new S Class already feel of another era.</p>
<p>The EQS 580 4Matic model I tested came spec&#8217;d out with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mercedes-unveils-hyperscreen-a-curved-56-inch-screen-for-its-flagship-eqs-electric-vehicle/">56-inch Hyperscreen</a>, head up display, acoustic glass, rear seat entertainment and an air filtration system, which Starzynski said pre-dates the pandemic, but naturally feels very of the moment.</p>
<p>At writing, the car&#8217;s exterior details are under wraps until its reveal April 15. The version I tested was partially cloaked, so I can&#8217;t tell you much about the sculpted nuances of its A pillar.</p>

<p>My five-year-old daughter accompanied me on the test drive. We started at the Mercedes Manhattan dealership, where EQS was displayed in the store window. As I approached the car, the driver door automatically swung open with great fanfare. From the vantage point of her booster seat, my daughter played with the rear screen that hovered in front of her. She selected ambient lighting in pink and purple hues for the cabin. Her top takeaway: &#8220;It&#8217;s a sparkly rainbow ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>The backseat experience actually matters quite a bit, because EQS is chauffeur friendly, a prereq for luxury cars in China, the hub for EV sales for the next decade.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136905" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136905" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2136905 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg" alt="Mercedes EQS" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2136905" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, up front, for a tall person like myself, the spacious driver seat — accented by the pillow that cradled the base of my neck — was one the most comfortable rides I&#8217;ve had. Once belted in, the car is all mood. Cue the lighting and sound design bells and whistles.</p>
<p>As much as I could appreciate the sensation of sonic silver waves to compensate for that faint EV whir, we soon opted to blast the five year old&#8217;s current favorite Barbie soundtrack from the billowing set of 15 Burmester speakers. (There are unfortunate compromises involved in bringing a five year old along for the ride.)</p>
<p>Everything in the EQS emanates from the 56-inch Hyperscreen OLED, which is divided into three separate displays spanning door-to-door. In person, it&#8217;s not as intrusive as it appears in photos. Its elliptical contour has a gamer-like cockpit sensibility.</p>
<p>The MBUX functions are housed on the main 17.7-inch OLED screen, to the right of the steering wheel. The passenger can opt to personalize their own touchscreen, too. Inside the powerful computation system is 24-gigabytes of RAM and 46.4 GB per second RAM memory, and eight CPU cores.</p>

<h2>The user experience</h2>
<p>Simplicity is a hallmark of good design, embodied in the best of Apple products. In contrast, Mercedes has always been big on delivering a dizzying set of user experience options and providing multiple approaches to access information. That inclination carries over in the EQS, using controls on the steering wheel, arm rest, and main screen. On test drives, I find multiple options for controls distracting. I am never sure if it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t had the time to fully adapt, in the same way that a new feature on a smartphone takes a couple weeks to get used to, or if it&#8217;s plain overkill. I noted the heads up display, but it was one place too many to look during the time I spent in the car.</p>

<p>What intrigued me is that the MBUX system studies driver behavior over time. By the end of my ride, the screen module reminded me that perhaps I would like to tee up my active seat massage once more. In short, I could bypass the other controls and focus on what I wanted to use most. Voice commands were decent, though my high pitch tenor managed to stump the system. I have yet to meet an automotive voice system that understands me all the time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no room for analog in the EQS experience. The graphics are crisp, multidimensional-dimensional, and clear. One downside was that my fingerprints smudged on the touchscreens. Pro tip: bring along a good screen spritzer and cloth before shooting photos. Another small grip was that the steering wheel seemed to be designed for a person with much larger hands than mine, and it was a little awkward to access all the functions stored on the wheel, which forced me to glance down to find the right spots. I ended up relying on the MBUX center screen to adjust settings.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the EQS user experience is how it handled messaging about range. At all times, the various screens on the dash displayed how many miles I had left, if my calculations for my destination were realistic, and mapped where I could go to charge.</p>
<h2>The range</h2>
<p>About that battery. The model I drove had a 107.8 kWh battery pack powering two electric motors used in the all-wheel-drive system. The range according to European testing is 470 miles, but could drop down according to U.S. EPA testing standards. I drove about 125 miles roundtrip from Manhattan to a little town called Beacon and back without even worrying about recharging.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136906" style="width: 5257px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136906" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2136906 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg" alt="Mercedes EQS" width="5247" height="3498" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg 5247w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5247px) 100vw, 5247px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2136906" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes Benz</p></div></p>
<p>I pulled up the screen to plot out ChargePoint options presented one click away. It also distinguishes which stations have 200 kW DC fast-chargers available, which Mercedes says take about 15 minutes to recharge. To assuage consumers on battery life, Mercedes has added a warranty that covers loss of capacity of the battery, valid for a decade after purchase, or up 150,000 miles.</p>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>The drive itself delivered powerful performance, as one would expect with 517 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque at work. The EQS beats out competitors drag coefficient at .20, which is a fun car enthusiast fact, but not essential knowledge for regular drivers.</p>
<p>It always takes a moment to get comfortable driving a long saloon, but like the S Class, the EQS handles its proportions with grace, and it turns with ease due to standard rear-wheel steering. It mirrors the S-Class safety features and ADAS systems. The drive settings include classic and sport, achievable through steering wheel controls or through the armrest. I am generally a sporty driver, and I liked the peppy feedback that this mode delivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we will be developing it further,&#8221; Starzysnki said, adding that the ADAS features will improve via software updates. Customizable updates such as light settings are also available for download.</p>
<p>The biggest differentiator of the EQS drive is its battery recuperation system. Intelligent recuperation mode optimizes the battery and controls driver actions. Normal recuperation dialed down the interference. I played around with one-pedal driving on the highway. Drivers can also choose no support at all.</p>

<p>Mainstream EV adoption in the United States feels like its right around the corner &#8212; and it could come even faster than expected if President Biden&#8217;s infrastructure plan passes. But automakers will need to do much more than edge out Tesla if they hope to capture the attention and dollars of U.S. consumers. EVs accounted for just 1.8% of U.S. car sales in 2020, according to Experian and reported in Automotive News.</p>
<p>Sweeping change takes time, money and a long-term commitment. The next level Mercedes-Benz EQS edges the playing field one step closer to the tipping point when the EV part of the architecture is no longer newsworthy, but the expectation for a luxury vehicle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Recent roars from an investment firm, credited to put Indian startups on the global map in the past decade and a half, are turning local young firms into unicorns at a pace never seen before in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Tiger Global has finalized &#8212; or is in late stages of concluding &#8212; more than 25 deals with Indian startups this year. About 10 of those investments have been unveiled so far while the rest, ranging from $10 million dollars to over $100 million, are in the pipeline for the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>The New York-headquartered firm, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/">closed a $6.7 billion fund</a>, last week led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">investments in social network ShareChat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-100-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/">business messaging platform Gupshup</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">investment app Groww</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">participated in fintech app CRED’s round</a>, helping all of these startups attain the much sought after unicorn status.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(A report in India speculated that Tiger Global plans to invest $3 billion of its new fund in Indian startups. TechCrunch understands the $3 billion figure is way off the mark.)</p>
<p>Tiger Global also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/infra-market-becomes-newest-indian-unicorn-with-100-million-fundraise/">invested in Infra.Market</a> and Innovaccer, two other Indian startups that turned unicorn earlier this year. (India has delivered 10 unicorns this year already, compared to 11 last year and six in 2019; Tiger is an investor in over 20 of 47 Indian unicorns.)</p>
<p>And it is currently in advanced stages to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tiger-global-eyes-pharmeasy-stake-amid-e-pharmacy-consolidation/articleshow/81928880.cms">back epharmacy firm PharmEasy</a>, which also turned into a unicorn last week, fintech firm ClearTax (at possibly $1 billion valuation), crypto exchange CoinSwitch, insurer Plum, B2B marketplace Moglix (at over $1 billion valuation), social firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/tiger-global-in-talks-to-invest-in-young-indian-social-network-at-170-million-valuation/">Kutumb</a> and Koo (at over $100 million valuation, <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/04/twitter-clone-koo-tiger-global-100-125-mn/">per the CapTable</a>), healthtech firm Pristyn Care, and B2B e-commerce Bzaar, and agritech Reshamandi, according to people familiar with the matter. (Some deals haven&#8217;t closed yet so the terms could change.)</p>
<p>No other investment firm has written checks of this magnitude to Indian firms this year &#8212; or ever &#8212; and the frenzy has reached a point where dozens of startup founders are scrambling to get an intro with Tiger Global partners.</p>

<p>Tiger Global’s confidence in young Indian firms <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Companies/5Cds0A5aOSil178CM4J9vM/How-Lee-Fixel-Flipkarts-godfather-in-New-York-changed-Ind.html">isn’t newly found</a>. Its investment in Flipkart in 2009 and Ola in 2012 showed the level of risk-appetite the U.S. firm was prepared to operate with in India, at a time when both the firms were struggling to raise money from some of the top Indian investors.</p>
<p>Under its former partner Lee Fixel, the investment firm backed several young firms including online grocer Grofers, logistics startup Delivery, fashion e-commerce Myntra, news aggregator InShorts, electric scooter maker Ather Energy, music streaming service Saavn, fintech Razorpay, and web producer TVF.</p>
<p>A handful of startup founders, on the condition of anonymity, recalled their investments from Tiger Global, which they all said concluded within two to three weeks after the first call from the investment firm.</p>
<p>But an executive change &#8212; the departure of Fixel &#8212; in 2019 slowed down the pace of Tiger Global in India, with the firm temporarily shifting focus to largely SaaS startups.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; Shailesh Vickram Singh (@svickram) <a href="https://twitter.com/svickram/status/1380450348779798531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Things have changed in recent quarters and Tiger Global has become more aggressive than ever before, said a venture capitalist, who has invested alongside Tiger Global in a few startups, on the condition of anonymity to be able to speak candidly.</p>
<p>The firm, which continues to write large checks to late-stage firms, is now also exploring investment opportunities in months-old startups.</p>
<p>The investor quoted above pointed to Infra.Market as another example of Tiger Global’s new strategy. It wrote its first check to Infra.Market in 2019, when the B2B startup was just two years old.</p>
<p>“Tiger then wanted to see if the startup can grow and convince other investors to back them. So in December, Infra.Market raised money at about $200 million valuation. Two months later, Tiger Global closed the new round at $1 billion valuation,&#8221; the investor said.</p>
<p>While great for startups, it creates a challenge for some investors, two investors said.</p>
<p>When Tiger Global values a startup at a level that much of the industry can&#8217;t match, and tends to not lead the subsequent round, there are very few firms that can invest in the following financing round, the investors said.</p>
<p>On private forums and in recent weeks, Clubhouse, a number of investors have cautioned that the recent optimism shared by some investors could prove challenging to materialize. &#8220;Tiger Global has traditionally got very optimistic in India every two to three years. The problem is that when it&#8217;s not optimistic, we are supposed to pick the tab,&#8221; one investor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under Scott Shleifer [MD at Tiger Global and pictured above], things may be different,&#8221; one of the investors added. Looking at Tiger Global&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-tiger-globals-deal-machine">recent activities elsewhere in the world</a>, it does appear that the firm has grown more aggressive in a handful of markets.</p>
<p>The American firm&#8217;s growing interest in India comes at a time when several more firms including Steadview, Prosus Ventures, Falcon Edge Capital, and even Google have ramped up their strategies for the world&#8217;s second most populous nation. (One investor said on a recent Clubhouse session that the frenzy of investments is also a sign of just the amount of capital floating in the market.)</p>
<p>India, the world&#8217;s third largest startup hub, is poised to produce 100 unicorns in the coming years, analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a report for clients last month. &#8220;India’s corporate landscape is undergoing a radical change due to a remarkable confluence of changes in the funding, regulatory and business environment in the country over the past two decades. An unprecedented pace of new-company formation and innovation in a variety of sectors has meant a surge in the number of highly-valued, as-yet unlisted companies,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The growth in highly valued companies has been enabled by a range of factors: (1) the natural shortage of risk capital in an economy with low per capita wealth has been addressed by a surge in (mostly foreign) private equity: these flows have exceeded public market transactions in each year of the last decade; (2) increase in teledensity and smartphone and internet penetration. Till 2005 less than 15% of Indians had a phone, versus 85% now; 700 million-plus people have internet access now due to cheap data and falling smartphone prices (40% penetration now).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(3) deep-rooted physical infrastructure changes: nearly all habitations are now connected by all-weather roads compared to only half in 2000, and all households are electrified now vs. just 54% in 2001; (4) financial innovation is accelerating, courtesy the world-leading “India stack”, which has innovative applications like UPI built on a base of universal bank account access, mobiles, and the biometric-ID (Aadhaar), helped by greater data availability; and (5) development of ecosystems in several sectors that now provides a competitive advantage versus global peers; for example in technology (4.5 million IT professionals) and pharma/biotech (several Indian firms can now afford $200-300 million of annual R&amp;D).&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome back to Week in Review!</p>
<p>Last week, I talked about Clubhouse&#8217;s slowing user growth. Well, this week news <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/twitter-is-said-to-have-discussed-4-billion-clubhouse-takeover">broke</a> that they had been in talks with Twitter for a $4 billion acquisition, so it looks like they&#8217;re still pretty desirable. This week, I&#8217;m talking about a story I published a couple days ago that highlights pretty much everything that&#8217;s wild about the alternative asset world right now.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><span class="s1">newsletter page</span></a>, and follow my tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny"><span class="s1">@lucasmtny</span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>If you successfully avoided all mentions of NFTs until now, I congratulate you, because it certainly does seem like the broader NFT market is seeing some major pullback after a very frothy February and March. You&#8217;ll still be seeing plenty of late-to-the-game C-list celebrities debuting NFT art in the coming weeks, but a more sober pullback in prices will probably give some of the NFT platforms that are serious about longevity a better chance to focus on the future and find out how they truly matter.</p>
<p>I spent the last couple weeks, chatting with a bunch of people in one particular community &#8212; one of the oldest active NFT communities on the web called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">CryptoPunks</a>. It&#8217;s a platform with 10,000 unique 24&#215;24 pixel portraits and they trade at truly wild prices.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wrote about the history and legacy of CryptoPunks, a vibrant $200 million NFT marketplace built around trading pixelated characters. There are only 10,000 of them and owning the cheapest one will cost you about $30k. <a href="https://t.co/X4iTSl6FjC">https://t.co/X4iTSl6FjC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lucas Matney (@lucasmtny) <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny/status/1380221886290780164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/6487">picture</a> sold for a $1.05 million.</p>
<p>I talked to a dozen or so people (including the guy who sold that one ^^) that had spent between tens of thousands and millions of dollars on these pixelated portraits, my goal being to tap into the psyche of what the hell is happening here. The takeaway is that these folks don&#8217;t see these assets as any more non-sensical than what&#8217;s going on in more traditional &#8220;old world&#8221; markets like public stock exchanges.</p>
<p>A telling quote from my reporting:</p>
<p><em>“Obviously this is a very speculative market… but it’s almost more honest than the stock market,” user Max Orgeldinger tells TechCrunch. “Kudos to Elon Musk — and I’m a big Tesla fan — but there are no fundamentals that support that stock price. It’s the same when you look at GameStop. With the whole NFT community, it’s almost more honest because nobody’s getting tricked into thinking there’s some very complicated math that no one can figure out. This is just people making up prices and if you want to pay it, that’s the price and if you don’t want to pay it, that’s not the price.”</em></p>
<p>Shortly after I published my piece, Christie&#8217;s announced that they were auctioning off nine of the CryptoPunks in an auction likely to fetch at least $10 million at current prices. The market surged in the aftermath and many millions worth of volume quickly moved through the marketplace minting more NFT millionaires.</p>
<p>Is this all just absolutely nuts? Sure.</p>
<p>Is it also a poignant picture of where alternative asset investing is at in 2021? You bet.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>
<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/">Amazon workers vote down union organization attempt</a><br />
</b>Amazon is breathing a sigh of relief after workers at their Bessemer, Alabama warehouse opted out of joining a union, lending a crushing defeat to labor activists who hoped that the high-profile moment would lead more Amazon workers to organize. The vote has been challenged, but the margin of victory seems fairly decisive.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-google-oracle-ruling/">Supreme court sides with Google in Oracle case</a><br />
</b>If any singular event impacted the web the most this week, it was the Supreme Court siding with Google in a very controversial lawsuit by Oracle that could&#8217;ve fundamentally shifted the future of software development.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/"><b>Coinbase is making waves</b></a><br />
The Coinbase direct listing is just around the corner and they&#8217;re showing off some of their financials. Turns out crypto has been kind of hot lately and they&#8217;re raking in the dough, with revenue of $1.8 billion this past quarter.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details/"><b>Apple share more about the future of user tracking</b></a><br />
Apple is about to upend the ad-tracking market and they published some more details on what exactly their App Tracking Transparency feature is going to look like. Hint: more user control.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/consumers-now-average-4-2-hours-per-day-in-apps-up-30-from-2019/"><b>Consumers are spending lots of time in apps</b></a><br />
A new report from mobile analytics firm App Annie suggests that we&#8217;re dumping more of our time into smartphone apps, with the average users spending 4.2 hours a day doing so, a 30 percent increase over two years.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/sonos-delivers-a-near-perfect-portable-speaker-with-the-new-sonos-roam/"><b>Sonos perfects the bluetooth speaker</b></a><br />
I&#8217;m a bit of an audio lover, which made my colleague Darrell&#8217;s review of the new Sonos Roam bluetooth speaker a must-read for me. He&#8217;s pretty psyched about it, even though it comes in at the higher-end of pricing for these devices, still I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing one with my own ears.</p>

<h2>Extra things</h2>
<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our Extra Crunch subscription service this week:</em><br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/"><b>The StockX EC-1</b></a><br />
&#8220;StockX is a unique company at the nexus of two radical transitions that isn’t just redefining markets, but our culture as well. E-commerce upended markets, diminishing the physical experience by intermediating and aggregating buyers and sellers through digital platforms. At the same time, the internet created rapid new communication channels, allowing euphoria and desire to ricochet across society in a matter of seconds. In a world of plenty, some things are rare, and the hype around that rarity has never been greater. Together, these two trends demanded a stock market of hype, an opportunity that StockX has aggressively pursued.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/how-to-build-the-right-team-for-a-billion-dollar-startup/"><b>Building the right team for a billion-dollar startup</b></a><br />
&#8220;I would really encourage you to take some time to think about what kind of company you want to make first before you go out and start interviewing people. So that really is going to be about understanding and defining your culture. And then the second thing I’d be thinking about when you’re scaling from, you know, five people up to, you know, 50 and beyond is that managers really are the key to your success as a company. It’s hard to overstate how important managers, great managers, are to the success of your company.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/"><b>So you want to raise a Series A</b></a><br />
&#8220;More companies will raise seed rounds than Series A rounds, simply due to the fact that many startups fail, and venture only makes sense for a small fraction of businesses out there. Every check is a new cycle of convincing and proving that you, as a startup, will have venture-scale returns. Moore explained that startups looking to move to their next round need to explain to investors why now is their moment.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Until next week,<br />

There’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lots of new capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on offer, and some expectation that we’ll get back to Q1’s IPO wave in Q3. Throw in widespread vaccinations and a return to something akin to our old lives, and the world of business could be ready to accelerate further in short order. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are caveats, of course. Lots of folks are being left behind in the recovery. And vaccine hesitancy is as lethally stupid as it is surprisingly common. But anticipated summer economic conditions, strong markets and a general belief that the digital transformation’s acceleration will continue point to a coming hot(ter) period for tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is </span><a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/videos/Brooklyn-bridge-ventures-charlie-odonnell-interview/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good news for startups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re already starting to see anticipatory reporting on the matter. Wired’s </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-revs-up-for-hot-startup-summer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on venture capitalists telling startups to invest rapidly is worth reading. I’ll back it up by saying that it seems that most startups that I am chatting with every week had a solid-as-heck first quarter and aren’t worried about the second. If I am not accidentally speaking with only founders who are doing well and somehow missing legion startups that are struggling, it seems to be a pretty darn good time to build a tech company. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaid’s round from earlier this week underscores what I’m talking about. The API-powered consumer fintech company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/plaid-raises-425m-series-d-from-altimeter-as-it-charts-a-post-visa-future/">CEO Zach Perret told TechCrunch</a> how much the digitization of the world of financial services had accelerated in the last year. Yep. Startups that would have done well in more normal times are often seeing their market move in their direction. Often rapidly. That’s why Plaid is worth north of $13 billion today, nearly triple what it was worth in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the startups doing well, there’s ample cash on offer. Ramp’s latest round, a two-in-one, makes that point plain. So, if the broader economy and its technological sector do accelerate, expect wallets to open even further. As the temperature heats up, so too could the business climate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, how else can you explain </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clubhouse-funding/audio-app-clubhouse-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-4-billion-valuation-bloomberg-news-idUSKBN2BT2NQ?il=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Clubhouse news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next week The Exchange is digging into Q1 2021 venture capital numbers from around the world. We’ll see soon enough how big the start to the year was, but we have a guess.</span></p>
<h2>Kudo, Coinbase and Canva</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sticking to our theme of growth and a hot and warming climate for tech startups, a few more data points from the last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I caught up with the CEO of Kudo this week, a few days after his company announced a $21 million Series A round of funding. I covered the translation-as-a-service company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/kudo-raises-6m-for-its-real-time-translation-and-video-conference-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year when it raised a seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Per its chief executive Fardad Zabetian, the company had 14 employees last March. It now has 150 and has more than 50 open positions. That’s not the sort of growth you see off of merely a few capital raises. That’s growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monster quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlights how some technology work from the past decade is maturing in a lucrative manner. The company’s epic revenue growth and nearly hilarious profitability are going to make its impending direct listing an even bigger event than I had expected. Get ready for that on the 14th. (More from the original Coinbase listing </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ObC7ZUeOCd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/embed/#?secret=ObC7ZUeOCd" data-secret="ObC7ZUeOCd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there’s Canva, which just </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210406005342/en/Visual-Communications-Platform-Canva-Announces-USD-15-Billion-Valuation-Launches-Suite-of-Presentations-Products-for-the-Workplace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repriced itself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through a $71 million secondary transaction. The cloud design company is now worth $15 billion, up from around $6 billion last June, per Crunchbase data. Even more, the company announced a few growth metrics worth sharing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Canva has crossed the $500 million annualized revenue mark </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Canva grew 130% in the last year, and was profitable (though we don’t know of what sort)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Canva now has 55 million monthly active users</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not going public. Yes, you can laugh. I got the company to ask its CEO Melanie Perkins why that’s the case, and here’s what we got back:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no rush for us. We&#8217;re profitable and we&#8217;re very fortunate that we can still find investors that align to our vision and values. I often say that we&#8217;re just one percent of the way there with Canva. We have a huge vision to empower every team to achieve its goals through visual communication. We’ve still got a whole lot more to achieve and so no immediate plans for any public listing- there&#8217;s simply no rush for us right now.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me just say that you don’t only have to go public when there’s a rush to do so! You can do so merely to make us, the reporting class, excited about going to work, as there are new numbers to read!</span></p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was off for a bit of this week to recharge, so some news and notes you might have expected in the above missive may be missing. Rest assured that The Exchange is going to get bigger and better and more number-y and full of jokes when I get back. Someone is joining the little team, so we have big plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hugs, </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Most of the startups I give advice to about how to raise venture capital shouldn’t be raising venture capital,” an investor recently told me. While the idea that every startup isn’t venture-backable might run counter to the narrative to the barrage of funding news each week, I think it’s important to double click on the topic. Plus, it keeps coming up, off the record, on phone calls with investors!</p>
<p>As venture grows as an asset class, the access to capital has broadened from a dollar perspective, but I do think the difficulties that remain is an important dynamic to call out (and something no one talks about during an upmarket). Beyond the fact that only a small subset of startups truly can pull off scaling to the point of venture-level returns, it is still hard for even qualified founders to raise venture capital. Venture capital is still a heavily white, male-led industry, and as a result contains bias that disproportionately limits access for underrepresented founders.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/?tpcc=ECTW2020">So, you want to raise a Series A</a></li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/how-to-build-the-right-team-for-a-billion-dollar-startup/">Building the right team for a billion-dollar startup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Eniac founding partner Hadley Harris applied this dynamic to the current market boom in a <a href=" https://twitter.com/Hadley/status/1380145821413482501">recent tweet:</a><em> A lot of people are misunderstanding this VC funding market. More money is flowing into the market but the increase is not evenly distributed. The market believes winners can be much bigger but not necessary that there will be more winners. It’s still very hard for most to raise a VC.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To say otherwise is to gaslight the early-stage or first-time founders that have spent months and months trying to raise their first institutional dollars and failed. So ask yourself: Seed rounds have indeed grown bigger, but for who? What comes at the cost of the $30 million seed round? Are the founders that can raise overnight from diverse backgrounds? Are investors backing first-time founders as much as they are backing second- or third-time entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>The answers might leave you debating about the boundaries, and limitations, of the upcoming hot-deal summer.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/y-combinator-demo-day-dispo-due-diligence/">the disconnect between due diligence and fundraising</a> right now. Now we&#8217;ve moved onto the disconnect, and bifurcation, within first-check fundraising itself. There is so much more we can get into about the fallacy of “democratization” in venture capital, from who gets to start a rolling fund to the lack of assurance within equity crowdfunding campaigns.</p>

<p>We’ll get through it all together, and in the meantime make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">follow me on Twitter @nmasc_</a> for more hot takes throughout the week.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we will talk about fintech politics, the Affirm model with a twist, and sneakers-as-a-service.</p>
<h2><strong>Ex-Coinbase talks politics </strong></h2>
<p>The inimitable <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo </a>has been dominating the fintech beat for us, covering everything from the latest<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/uruguayan-payments-startup-dlocal-quadruples-valuation-to-5b-with-150m-raise/"> Uruguayan unicorn</a> to Acorn’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/acorns-scoops-up-pillar-a-fintech-backed-by-kleiner-perkins/">scoop of a debt management startup.</a> But the story I want to focus on this week is her interview with ex-Coinbase counsel &amp; former Treasury official, Brian Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">notoriously released</a> a memo last year denouncing political activism at work, calling it a distraction. In this exclusive interview, Brooks spoke about how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/blockchain-and-taking-the-politics-out-of-tech/">blockchain is the answer to financial inclusion</a>, and argued why politics needs to be taken out of tech.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We don’t want bank CEOs making those decisions for us as a society, in terms of who they choose to lend money to, or not. We need to take the politics out of tech. All of us do a lot of different things, and we have no idea on a given day, whether what we’re doing is popular with our neighbors or popular with our bank president or not. I don’t want the fact that I sometimes feel Republican to be a reason why my local bank president can deny me a mortgage.</em></p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>The Affirm for X model </strong></h2>
<p>While Affirm may have popularized the “buy now, pay later” model, the consumer-friendly business strategy still has room to be niched down into specific subsectors. I ran into one such startup when covering Plaid’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/plaid-accelerator-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-fintech-startups/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> inaugural cohort of startups in its accelerator program. </a></p>
<p>Here’s what to know: Walnut is a new seed-stage startup that is a point-of-sale loan company with a healthcare twist. Unlike Affirm, it doesn’t make money off of fees charged to consumers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our new podcast Found is now available, and the first episode features guest Iman Abuzeid, co-founder and CEO of Incredible Health. Abuzeid&#8217;s story of founding and building Incredible Health, a career platform for healthcare professionals focusing specifically on nurses, is all about a focused entrepreneur building a unique skill set, and acquiring the experience necessary to create a world-leading solution.</p>
<p>Abuzeid went to medical school and acquired her MD, but decided before residency to instead go get an MBA from Wharton, in order to pursue her dream of entrepreneurship, inspired by two generations of entrepreneurs in the family that preceded her. After eventually making her way to Silicon Valley and working in a couple of other startups in the healthcare space, Abuzeid took important lessons away from those experiences about what not to do when running your own company, and embarked on building her own with co-founder Rome Portlock, now the company&#8217;s CTO.</p>
<p>Incredible Health is tackling a huge challenge — the shortfall of availability of skilled nurses, and the lack of mature, sophisticated career resources to help those nurses in their professional life. COVID-19 threw those issues into stark relief, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/incredible-health-updates-its-healthcare-career-platform-to-help-nurse-hiring-cope-with-covid/"> Incredible Health adjusted its game plan to adapt to its users&#8217; needs</a>. Abuzeid tells us all about how she made those calls, and also how she <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/incredible-healths-hiring-platform-for-nurses-gets-15m-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">convinced venture investors to come along for the ride</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>

<p>This week we&#8217;re looking into the upcoming Apple lawsuit with Epic Games over App Store fees, the soon-to-launch game changer that is App Tracking Transparency and Facebook&#8217;s latest attempt to take on Clubhouse, among other things.</p>

<p>The Epic Games versus Apple trial is nearing launch. The trial, which begins May 3 and is expected to drag on for weeks, will see the Fortnite maker attempting to argue that Apple&#8217;s control over the App Store &#8212; and the 30% commission it requires on in-app purchases &#8212; represents anti-competitive behavior from a monopoly that requires regulation under antitrust law. Apple, meanwhile, feels confident that it can demonstrate its not a monopoly as it faces competition across the market, not just in its App Store. It will also likely point to the commission decreases it recently made in the wake of the increased regulatory scrutiny. Apple now takes a smaller 15% cut from developers making less than $1 million in revenues.</p>
<p>New filings this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/epic-cries-monopoly-as-apple-details-secret-project-liberty-effort-to-provoke-fortnite-ban/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">detail Epic&#8217;s long-term program &#8220;Project Liberty,</a>&#8221; which describes how Epic planned its antitrust battle by forcing app stores to reject Fortnite for circumventing their payment mechanisms. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute">A filing from Epic also references</a> comments by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddie Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller that talk about how Apple locks users into its ecosystem with its services, including iMessage. Epic also argues that Apple uses security as a &#8220;pretext&#8221; for its commissions &#8212; even as a recent series of allegations (and threat of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">lawsuit</a>) from app developer Kosta Eleftheriou have demonstrated that Apple&#8217;s vetting process is failing to stop massive scams. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/08/epic-accuses-apple-of-using-security-as-a-pretext/">Epic also says</a> that allowing Apple to serve customers&#8217; refund requests leads to fraud because it doesn&#8217;t have the same visibility into the developer&#8217;s content that the developer itself does.</p>

<p>With the public release of iOS 14.5, which is expected soon, Apple will be shaking up the app economy with the launch of its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8h0btjq7">App Tracking Transparency framework</a>, or ATT. This requires iOS apps to begin prompting users for permission to track their users&#8217; activity, instead of just quietly doing so &#8212; generally without the user&#8217;s informed consent. Apple has said developers can explain in this prompt why they&#8217;re asking for this permission &#8212; for example, because they want to serve more personalized ads, perhaps. Tech giants like Facebook and Google, as well as many other ad-supported apps (and particularly social media apps), will be impacted by the change. Some have even gone so far as to try to find workarounds using non-IDFA methods, it&#8217;s been reported (IDFA being the current system that assigns a unique advertising ID to each device that is then tracked across the apps and websites a user visits). It was revealed <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/02/workaround-to-app-tracking-transparency/">last week</a> that Snapchat had investigated an IDFA alternative known as probabilistic matching, but claims it was just a &#8220;test.&#8221; Meanwhile, China&#8217;s largest tech companies &#8212; including Baidu, Tencent and ByteDance &#8212; <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snapchat-risks-apples-wrath-attempts-053334646.html">have been exploring</a> a state-backed IDFA alternative CAID.</p>
<p>This week, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details">made it clear</a> that &#8220;no tracking&#8221; without permission means just that. It says that if a user opts out of any IDFA-tracking via the pop-up, that means the developer doesn&#8217;t have permission to track using any other sort of identifiers either &#8212; like hashed email addresses or whatever other workaround developers come up with.</p>

<p>Facebook’s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, this week launched its latest experiment, Hotline, into public beta testing. The web-based application could be described as a mashup of Instagram Live and Clubhouse, as it allows creators to speak to an audience who can then ask questions through either text or audio. However, unlike Clubhouse, creators can opt to turn their cameras on for the event, instead of being audio-only. Currently, users sign in with Twitter and then verify their phone number to authenticate with the app. They can then type in their question to submit it to the speaker, who pulls them &#8220;on stage&#8221; to discuss. For now, the participants were audio-only and represented by a profile icon, but settings suggest that Hotline will test video for users in the future.</p>
<p>As the questions are asked, users can react with emoji, including clapping hands, fire, heart, laughter, surprise and thumbs up. And most importantly, unlike Clubhouse, Hotline events are recorded. Creators get both an audio and video recording that they could edit and upload elsewhere, including on other social networks. Because of its use of video, upvoted questions and recording, the app has a different vibe than Clubhouse &#8212; it feels more like a virtual event than a more casual space. Facebook is catering to this audience, too, by seeking out creators who are focused on doling out professional advice, it says.</p>
<p>Of note, Hotline is being led by Eric Hazzard, who joined Facebook when it acquired his app tbh, a positivity-focused Q&amp;A app.</p>

<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<p><strong>Still more betas</strong>. Apple this week <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/07/apple-issues-seventh-betas-for-ios-145-ipados-145-watchos-74">released its seventh betas</a> for iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 and other platforms, including Apple TV and Apple Watch &#8212; iOS 14.5 brings the rollout of App Tracking Transparency, which is why Apple is probably taking its time with this one.</p>
<p><strong>iOS 14 adoption has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/06/ios-14-adoption-surpasses-90-according-to-mixpanel/">now surpassed 90%</a></strong> according to data from Mixpanel. In December, 81% of phones were running iOS 14, now 90.45% are. Another 5.07% of users are running iOS 13, while 4.48% are running iOS 12 or older versions.</p>
<p><strong>Apple has been spotted testing tags in the App Store</strong> that will help guide users to more precise search results. The test, first reported by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/app-store-search-tags/">MacRumors</a>, had users encounter tags at the top of App Store search results when searching for popular terms like &#8220;photos&#8221; or &#8220;wallpaper,&#8221; that could help narrow results. Some users were running the iOS 14.5 beta when they saw tags, but others were not. It&#8217;s unclear if or when tags will launch to the wider public.</p>

The company has still not launched its own AirTags, a lost-item finder similar to Tile. Instead, it&#8217;s smartly positioning the Find My app as a platform anyone can plug into, in order to assuage anti-competitive concerns. The first items that will plug into Find My include VanMoof’s S3 and X3 e-bikes, Belkin’s SoundForm Freedom True Wireless Earbuds and the Chipolo ONE Spot tracker (a Tile rival).</p>

<p>However, one big name is notably missing from the lineup, and that&#8217;s AirTags&#8217; biggest competitor, Tile itself. Tile doesn&#8217;t want to hand over the direct customer relationship it has by way of its Tile app just to be included in Find My. And some have suggested Apple is propping up the Chipolo tracker to counter any arguments from Tile that it&#8217;s being anti-competitive with the launch of AirTags when they finally arrive.</p>

<p><strong>Apple details its App Store takedowns in new transparency report.</strong> Apple&#8217;s latest transparency report offers information about app takedowns due to requests from government authorities due to suspected violations of local laws. Apple says it complies with these requests where it&#8217;s legally required to do so. These requests, however, are not focused on Apple&#8217;s own editorial guidelines, which prohibit content that Apple itself chooses not to host.</p>

<p><strong>The new Google Play Store design arrives, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-google-play-store-ui-removes-hamburger-menu">killing off the hamburger menu</a> </strong>for good. The design is rolling out to Android devices. An in-app message tells you that those menu items have been moved to your profile icon, which, when tapped, brings up a condensed menu. The Settings menu was also updated. Some have complained the changes are making menu items and options harder to find. The Play Store hadn&#8217;t been updated significantly since 2019.</p>

The process will give publishers feedback on their apps&#8217; approval status so they can resolve issues that could lead to policy violations. Google says the new app reviews are being rolled out gradually in 2021 with two features: app readiness and app claiming. The former will require publishers to link apps they want to monetize with one supported app store, so their app can then be reviewed. The process will check the app source, publisher&#8217;s ownership and policy compliance. App Claiming will provide a list of apps that are being monetized with their ad code but aren&#8217;t yet on their AdMob or Ad Manager account.</p>

<p>This relatively new AR app lets you add AR to anything &#8212; a textbook, a magazine cover, a piece of paper, a photo or any other flat real-world object. To use Halo AR, you first select the object and snap a photo, then choose which photo, video or 3D model you want to overlay on top of it. Teachers can use the app to &#8220;tag&#8221; their course materials with AR links of sorts to immersive content or videos. Or you could use it for fun to create a scavenger hunt in the house for the kids. The app is a free download in the Education category on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/halo-ar-add-ar-to-anything/id1534359793">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lightup.lens&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese regulators have hit Alibaba with a record fine of 18 billion yuan (about $2.75 billion) for violating anti-monopoly rules as the country seeks to rein in the power of its largest internet conglomerates.</p>
<p>In November, China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">proposed sweeping antitrust regulations </a>targeting its interent economy. In late December, the State Administration for Market Regulation said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba</a>, weeks after the authorities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">called off the initial public offering</a> of Ant Group, the financial affiliate of Alibaba.</p>
<p>SAMR, the country&#8217;s top market regulator, said on Saturday it had determined that Alibaba had been &#8220;abusing market dominance&#8221; since 2015 by forcing its Chinese merchants to sell exclusively on one e-commerce platform instead of letting them choose freely among different services, such as Pinduoduo and JD.com. Vendors are often pressured to side with Alibaba to take advantage of its enormous user base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since late 2020, a clutch of internet giants including Tencent and Alibaba have been hit with various fines for violating anti-competition practices, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/china-literature-alibaba-fined/">failing to clear past acquisitions with regulators</a>. The meager sums of these penalties were symbolic at best compared to the benefits the tech firms reap from their market concentration. No companies have been told to break up their empires and users still have to hop between different super-apps that block each other off.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, however, there are signs that China&#8217;s antitrust authorities are getting more serious. The latest fine on Alibaba is equivalent to 4% of the company&#8217;s revenue generated in the calendar year of 2019 in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we received the Administrative Penalty Decision issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China,&#8221; Alibaba said in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210409005494/en/Alibaba-Group-Has-Received-the-Administrative-Penalty-Decision-Issued-by-the-State-Administration-for-Market-Regulation-of-the-People%E2%80%99s-Republic-of-China">statement in response to the penalty</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We accept the penalty with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination. To serve our responsibility to society, we will operate in accordance with the law with utmost diligence, continue to strengthen our compliance systems and build on growth through innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.alizila.com/a-letter-to-our-customers-and-to-the-community/">separate letter</a> to its customers and users, Alibaba said it will work to &#8220;lower entry barriers and business costs of operating on our platforms&#8221; to ensure &#8220;an operating environment for our merchants and partners that is more open, more equitable, more efficient and more inclusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thick walls that tech companies build against each other are starting to break down, too. Alibaba has submitted an application to have its shopping deals app run on WeChat&#8217;s mini program platform, Wang Hai, an Alibaba executive, recently confirmed.</p>
<p>For years, Alibaba services have been absent from Tencent&#8217;s sprawling lite app ecosystem, which now features millions of third-party services. Vice versa, WeChat is notably missing from Alibaba&#8217;s online marketplaces as a payment method. If approved, the WeChat-powered Alibaba mini app would break with precedent of the pair&#8217;s long stand-off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Practically every film production these days needs some kind of visual effects work, but independent creators often lack the cash or expertise to get that top-shelf CG. <a href="https://www.wonderdynamics.com/">Wonder Dynamics</a>, founded by VFX engineer Nikola Todorovic and actor Tye Sheridan, aims to use AI to make some of these processes more accessible for filmmakers with budgets on the tight side, and they&#8217;ve just raised $2.5 million to make it happen.</p>
<p>The company has its origins in 2017, after Sheridan and Todorovic met on the set of Rodrigo Garcia&#8217;s film <em>Last Days in the Desert</em>. They seem to have both felt that the opportunity was there to democratize the tools that they had access to in big studio films.</p>
<p>Wonder Dynamics is very secretive about what exactly its tools do. <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/vfx-startup-wonder-dynamics-2-5-million-seed-funding-nikola-todorovic-tye-sheridan-steven-spielberg-joe-russo-1234730142/">Deadline&#8217;s Mike Fleming Jr</a> saw a limited demo and said he &#8220;could see where it will be of value in the area of world creation at modest budgets. The process can be done quickly and at a fraction of a traditional cost structure,&#8221; though that leaves us little closer than we started.</p>
<p>Sheridan and Todorovic (who jointly answered questions I sent over) described the system, called Wallace Pro, as taking over some of the grunt work of certain classes of VFX rather than a finishing touch or specific effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building an AI platform that will significantly speed up both the production and post-production process for content involving CG characters and digital worlds. The goal of the platform is to reduce the costs associated with these productions by automating the &#8216;objective&#8217; part of the process, leaving the artists with the creative, &#8216;subjective&#8217; work,&#8221; they said. &#8220;By doing this, we hope to create more opportunities and empower filmmakers with visions exceeding their budget. Without saying too much, it can be applied to all three stages of filmmaking (pre-production, production and post-production), depending on the specific need of the artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>From this we can take that it&#8217;s an improvement to the workflow, reducing the time it takes to achieve some widely used effects, and therefore the money that needs to be set aside for them. To be clear this is distinct from another, more specific product being developed by Wonder Dynamics to create virtual interactive characters as part of the film production process — an early application of the company&#8217;s tools, no doubt.</p>
<p>The tech has been in some small scale tests, but the plan is to put it to work in a feature entering production later this year. &#8220;Before we release the tech to the public, we want to be very selective with the first filmmakers who use the technology to make sure the films are being produced at a high level,&#8221; they said. First impressions do matter.</p>
<p>The $2.5M seed round was led by Founders Fund, Cyan Banister, the Realize Tech Fund, Capital Factory, MaC Venture Capital, and Robert Schwab. &#8220;Because we are at the intersection of technology and film, we really wanted to surround ourselves with investment partners who understand how much the two industries will depend on each other in the future,&#8221; Sheridan and Todorovic said. &#8220;We were extremely fortunate to get MaC Venture Capital and Realize Tech Fund alongside FF. Both funds have a unique combination of Silicon Valley and Hollywood veterans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wonder Dynamics will use the money to, as you might expect, scale its engineering and VFX teams to further develop and expand the product&#8230; whatever it is.</p>
<p>With their advisory board, it would be hard to make a mistake without someone calling them on it. &#8220;We’re extremely lucky to have some of the most brilliant minds from both the AI and film space,&#8221; they said, and that&#8217;s no exaggeration. Right now the lineup includes Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo (&#8220;obviously geniuses when it comes to film production and innovation&#8221;), UC Berkeley and Google&#8217;s Angjoo Kanazawa and MIT&#8217;s Antonio Torralba (longtime AI researchers in robotics and autonomy), and numerous others in film and finance who &#8220;offer us a wealth of knowledge when we’re trying to figure out how to move the company forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>AI is deeply integrated into many tech companies and enterprise stacks, making it a solid moneymaker in that industry, but it is still something of a fringe concept in the more creator-driven film and TV world. Yet hybrid production techniques like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/ilm-shows-off-the-new-stagecraft-led-wall-used-for-season-2-of-the-mandalorian/">ILM&#8217;s StageCraft</a>, used to film <em>The Mandalorian</em>, are showing how techniques traditionally used for 3D modeling and game creation can be applied safely to film production — sometimes even live on camera. AI is increasingly that part of the world, as pioneers like Nvidia and Adobe have shown, and it seems inevitable that it should come to film — though in exactly what form it&#8217;s hard to say.</p>
