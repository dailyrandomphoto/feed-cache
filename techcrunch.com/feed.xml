										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Order and pay” platform for bars and restaurants <a href="https://ordr.menu/">Ordr</a> has raised a €10m ($12M) Series A round from Idekapital and OpenOcean.</p>
<p>Launched in Norway in 2020 it now counts IKEA, Nordic Choice, REKOM and Color Line as customers.  The company is now launching in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Ordr’s competitors include FlipDish, Onvi.com and WeOrder.</p>
<p>Ordr has a platform for digital menus, order-placement, and payment which, it claims, increases sales and reduces and queues at bars and restaurants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its branded phone solution consists of a ‘virtual POS’, replacing existing POS for restaurants and hotels to take orders and payment. The waiter can also use it. The company says customers don’t have to download a new app, while hotels and pubs can do deals with local restaurants and offer their menus on site.</p>
<p>founder and CEO Edwin Fjeldtvedt said: &#8220;Contrary to cash register systems that charge far too much and locks customers in, we’ve created the next generation cash register system that eliminates the need for old-fashioned POS systems and makes them virtual. At the same time, we’ve created an entirely new customer journey with the guest in the center based on the experience they are seeking.” He added that the app &#8220;took off&#8221; when the pandemic demanded new infection-control measures in the hotel, restaurant and catering industry.</p>
<p>Kristian Øvsthus Managing Partner at Idekapital said: “We have really been impressed by the vision, solution, management and the people they recruit as well as implementation ability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrik Backman, General Partner, OpenOcean sai: &#8220;Ordr has proven that their platform works very well, is a scalable solution that is applicable across a multitude of markets, and the company is now in a great place for an international venture. The catering industry desperately needs a new technology to stay competitive in the future and this is it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.shein.com/">Shein</a>&#8216;s quiet rise has reached a crescendo as the fast fashion e-commerce app takes the crown from Amazon as the most downloaded shopping app on <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/878577184/rank-history?app_slug=878577184&amp;market_slug=ios&amp;vtype=day&amp;countries=US&amp;device=iphone&amp;view=rank&amp;date=2021-02-18~2021-05-18&amp;legends=22">iOS</a> and <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/google-play/app/20600002127947/rank-history?app_slug=20600002127947&amp;market_slug=google-play&amp;vtype=day&amp;countries=US&amp;view=rank&amp;date=2021-04-19~2021-05-18&amp;legends=222">Android</a> in the United States, according to data from app tracking firm App Annie.</p>
<p>Its ascent is quiet because the startup, despite<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fBfGBjmzGy9CxB7VsoYjEA"> reportedly exceeding a $15 billion valuation</a>, maintains an unusually low profile and doesn&#8217;t try to make itself known to the media. The app, dubbed the &#8220;TikTok for e-commerce&#8221; by China-focused internet analyst Matthew Brennan in this <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/shein-the-tiktok-of-ecommerce?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NTAwNywicG9zdF9pZCI6MzY0ODM2OTMsIl8iOiJGaXpTUiIsImlhdCI6MTYyMTI1Njc5OCwiZXhwIjoxNjIxMjYwMzk4LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTAwMjUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.OCvxt-9N69bHLrOkzuTh0e4Eo6UMn6HCBwNuLFOHuys">thorough piece </a>on the startup, manufactures in China as many apparel retailers do.</p>
<p>The difference is Shein controls its own production chain, from design and prototype to procurement to manufacturing. Each step is highly digitized and integrated with another, which allows the company to churn out hundreds of new products tailored to different regions and user tastes at a daily rate. The strategy is not unlike TikTok matching content creators with users by using algorithms to understand their habits in real-time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>On May 11, Shein became the most installed shopping app on Android in the U.S., and six days later took the top spot on iOS as well. It briefly topped the Android chart in late April.</p>
<p>The origin of Shein, which was previously named &#8220;She Inside,&#8221; is little understood. On its <a href="https://asia.shein.com/About-Us-a-117.html">official website</a>, it describes itself as an &#8220;international B2C fast fashion e-commerce platform&#8221; founded in 2008. There is no mention of its founder and CEO Chris Xu. In a 2018 <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-l9qvuRmq4bGF-4G_KSajg">corporate blog</a> posted on WeChat, it wrote that it was headquartered in Nanjing, an eastern Chinese city home known for its historical heritages and home to Chinese appliance giant Suning. It also opened offices in other major Chinese cities as well as the U.S., Belgium and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Shein&#8217;s low profile is perhaps expected in times of geopolitical tensions and heightened regulatory scrutiny over China-related tech companies around the world. Shein owns its sales channel and user data, which distinguishes it from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">swathe of generic consumer brands relying on Amazon</a> for customer acquisition without meaningful access to user data.</p>
<p>Last June, the Indian government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned Shein among 59 apps</a>, including TikTok and WeChat, that it deemed &#8220;prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of May 17, Shein was the top iOS shopping app in 54 countries and ranked top in the category on Android devices across 13 countries.</p>
<p>Shein has not announced who its investors are, but Chinese media reports have listed Capital Nuts, JAFCO Asia, Greenwoods Asset Management, IDG Capital, Sequoia Capital China, Tiger Global, and Xiaomi founder&#8217;s Shunwei Capital among its backers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Shein for comments on the story. Sequoia Capital China confirmed it&#8217;s an investor in Shein.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span><a href="https://www.creandum.com/">Creandum</a>, a European early-stage VC, is bringing on board two new key team members: Ex-Kry CSO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabinawizander/">Sabina Wizander</a> joins as Partner and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemmabloemen/">Gemma Bloemen</a> as Principal. Both will joins this summer. <a href="https://www.creandum.com/">Creandum</a> has previously backed the likes of Spotify, Klarna, Depop, Kahoot!, Trade Republic, among others. </span></p>
<p><span>Former engineer Wizander was previously at the firn in 2015</span>and worked on Kry’s seed round before joining the digital health startup in 2017. As Partner, she’ll be based in Stockholm.</p>
<p><span>“I am very excited to rejoin the Creandum team”, says Sabina Wizander. “Creandum has developed very impressively the last few years and I know I’m coming back to an even stronger team, brand and portfolio. I’m also coming in with different goggles than last time, both having been on the other side of the investor table for Kry’s series A to D, and being part of scaling a company +100X in  revenue and team. Given my background from Kry, health tech will be an area of focus for me, and anything climate related is very close to my heart.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Former McKinsey consultant and Uber executive</span> <span>Bloemen joins at Principal from the post of COO Elder, the UK-based home care specialist, and worked on their Series B fundraising process in 2019.</span></p>
<p>Bloemen said: “I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work with many different, talented entrepreneurs across a wide range of industries. As a VC-backed startup executive and angel investor I know how important it is to have the right partner along the journey, especially in the early years, and the Creandum team has an impeccable track record and reputation of adding true value as an investor. I am keen to help founders with the operational expertise I gained from my time at Uber and Elder and I’m looking forward to supporting Creandum’s efforts in further establishing their activity in the UK ecosystem and expanding their already very impressive portfolio.”</p>
<p>Staffan Helgesson, General Partner and founder of Creandum added: “Both Sabina and Gemma have an outstanding track record of deep operational expertise and an impact-driven mindset, which will provide additional value to our advisory team, offering the best support to the early-stage company founders we work with. With these two new hires in two different geographies, Creandum has reached another important milestone on its path to become the premier venture capital firm serving entrepreneurs across Europe, helping them scale into global winners.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most parts of Africa and the Middle East, a consumer journey and experience in buying furniture is not fun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical shopping process would entail looking out for the best price and quality and asking for recommendations and checking offline stores, one after another</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is rare to find one-stop shops, especially large offline ones, that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cater to the needs of consumers in the MENA region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home goods and furniture marketplaces have launched in the last three years around the region to meet this need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt&#8217;s <a href="https://homzmart.com/">Homzmart</a> is one such, and today the company is announcing it has closed its $15 million Series A investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mahmoud-ibrahim-889ab553">Mahmoud Ibrahim</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-mohamed-670ba4143">Ibrahim Mohamed</a>, but it didn&#8217;t launch until the first quarter of 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This round of financing follows a $1.3 million seed investment raised in February last year. According to the company, this brings the total amount raised to $17.2 million. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s MSA Capital, one of the investors in Homzmart&#8217;s seed round, co-led this Series A investment alongside Nuwa Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other participating investors include EQ2 Ventures, Impact46, Outliers Capital, Nuwa Capital and Rise Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The furniture industry in Egypt has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> characterized by poor accessibility for consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homzmart&#8217;s marketplace collects designs, price ranges and other details of its retailers&#8217; products and solves high distribution costs for them by providing access to consumers who have flexible financing options</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, Homzmart said it incorporates AI to optimize content for retailers and intelligent tools to help customers with their purchasing decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a marketplace, we stand between the supply and demand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we connect furniture and home goods suppliers with consumers,&#8221; CEO Mahmoud Ibrahim told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like a big hassle to buy furniture in Africa and the Middle East. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s a pain all over the world when it comes to having a place that you can shop all your needs when it comes to home products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last 12 months, Homzmart claims to have grown 30x in sales. It also showcases more than 55,000 products from thousands of brands and merchants. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The online marketplace is tapping into the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding $8 billion industry where 14 million customers in the region search online for furniture monthly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153340" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153340" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Main_1.jpeg?w=680" alt="Homzmart" width="680" height="515" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Main_1.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Main_1.jpeg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Main_1.jpeg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Main_1.jpeg?resize=768,582 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Main_1.jpeg?resize=680,515 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Main_1.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153340" class="wp-caption-text">Ibrahim Mohamed (COO) and Mahmoud Ibrahim (CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Homzmark kicked off its hard launch and raised its seed round, it was right at the start of the pandemic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ibrahim said the company was uncertain that it would survive due to anticipated behavioral changes in consumer spending</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the opposite happened. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers in Egypt grew to like the product, resulting in more sales like most marketplaces and e-commerce platforms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this past year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the beginning, we were very worried and not sure how customers would react to buying furniture during the pandemic in the Middle East online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we&#8217;re actually amazed by the traction as it seemed like the region was waiting for something like this to happen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth experienced within the pandemic was one reason MSA Capital decided to double down on the startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As stated by Ben Harburg, the firm&#8217;s general partner, “The pandemic exposed the extreme vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of the Middle East’s archaic offline retail ecosystem, logistics and supply chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Into the void stepped Homzmart as the next-generation, digitally enabled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online marketplace and optimized logistics provider for large-item retail addressing both consumer and enterprise customers.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another reason behind the investment, the firm said, is the vast experience of both founders in e-commerce and fulfillment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ibrahim was the VP of Operations for Jumia Egypt before becoming the Group COO of Daraz, a Southeast Asian company acquired by Alibaba in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohamed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a Jumia alumnus and was part of the logistics development and expansion team in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although their experience with different verticals in everyday commerce in Jumia and Daraz was invaluable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the founders chose to launch in the niche furniture market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instead of building a similar model as their former employers. &#8220;We decided this was a really good vertical that we needed to focus on and hold ourselves accountable to digitizing in the region,&#8221; Ibrahim said about developing the niche product.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homzmart&#8217;s first year in business was all about understanding supply and demand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next couple of years is a strategy to expand across the MENA region, helping fulfill demand from a young and fast-growing consumer middle class</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whatever we did in Egypt, we need to do across the region. Homzmart isn&#8217;t looking to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an Egyptian platform, rather a regional platform,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched operations close to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Damietta City, Egypt, to focus on this regional market opportunity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be one of the largest furniture manufacturing hubs in the Middle East and thus allows Homzmart to streamline the region’s vertical industry supply chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An integral part of this supply chain is handling logistics and the movement of products from merchants to buyers. The company said a sizeable tranche of investments would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this effort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s next for the company when logistics is handled?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll say the thing that keeps me awake at night is the fact that our business is growing very fast. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we need to make sure that we&#8217;re building the right institutional infrastructure for that business, to make sure that after two or three years, we&#8217;re building like a very solid, multi-billion dollar business,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Ibrahim remarked.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is expanding further into the creator community with today&#8217;s launch of a video-first feature called &#8220;Idea Pins,&#8221; aimed at creators who want to tell their stories using video, music, creative editing tools and more. The feature feels a lot like Pinterest&#8217;s own take on TikTok, mixed with Stories, as the new Pins allow creators to record and edit creative videos with up to 20 pages of content, using tools like voiceover recording, background music, transitions and other interactive elements.</p>
<p>The company says Idea Pins evolved out of its tests with Story Pins,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/"> launched into beta</a> in September 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/pinterest-has-begun-testing-a-new-version-of-stories-called-story-pins-with-u-s-creators/">after various stages of development</a> beginning the year prior. At the time, Pinterest explained that Story Pins were different from the Stories you&#8217;d find on other social networks, like Snapchat or Instagram, because they focused on what people were doing &#8212; like trying new ideas or new products, not giving you snapshots of a creator&#8217;s personal life.</p>
<p>Another notable differentiator was that Story Pins weren&#8217;t ephemeral. That is, they didn&#8217;t disappear after a certain amount of time, but rather could be surfaced through search and other discovery mechanisms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1QsrcPPSyO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/pinterest-to-test-live-streamed-events-this-month-with-21-creators/">Pinterest to test livestreamed events this month with 21 creators</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pinterest to test livestreamed events this month with 21 creators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/pinterest-to-test-live-streamed-events-this-month-with-21-creators/embed/#?secret=1QsrcPPSyO" data-secret="1QsrcPPSyO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Over the past eight months since their debut, Pinterest has worked with Story Pin creators on the experience. That&#8217;s led to the new concept of the Idea Pin &#8212; essentially a rebranded Story Pin, which now offers a broader suite of editing tools than what was previously available.</p>
<p>Video is a key element in Idea Pins, as the Pins target the increased consumer demand for short-form video content of a creative nature &#8212; like what&#8217;s being delivered through TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and elsewhere. The videos in the Pins can be up to 60 seconds on iOS, Android and web for each page, with up to 20 total pages per Pin.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153098" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153098" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153098" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-people-tagging.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-people-tagging.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-people-tagging.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-people-tagging.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-people-tagging.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-people-tagging.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-people-tagging.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-people-tagging.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-people-tagging.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153098" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Creators can edit their videos by adding their own voiceover or using a &#8220;ghost mode&#8221; transition tool to better showcase their before-and-afters by overlaying one part of a video on another. And they can save drafts of their work in progress.</p>
<p>But Idea Pins still include a number of features common to Stories, like adding stickers or tagging other creators with an @username, for instance. Pinterest says it will start with over 100 stickers featuring hand-drawn illustrations focused on top categories and behaviors it expects to see, like food-themed illustrations, stickers for before-and-afters, seasonal moments, and more.</p>
<p>Pinterest is also working with the royalty-free music database Epidemic Sound to offer a catalog of free tracks for use in Idea Pins.</p>
<p>And because many creators will use Idea Pins to inspire people to try a recipe or project of some sort, they can include &#8220;detail pages&#8221; where viewers can find the ingredient list or instructions, which is handy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153097" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153097" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153097" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-music-tool.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-music-tool.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-music-tool.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-music-tool.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-music-tool.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-music-tool.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-music-tool.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-music-tool.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-music-tool.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153097" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Pins are shared to Pinterest, where the company says they help the creator build an audience by being distributed in several places across its platform, including in some markets, by locating Pins for creators you follow right at the top of the home page.</p>
<p>Creators can also apply topic tags when publishing to ensure they&#8217;re surfaced when people are seeking that sort of content. Each Idea Pin can have up to 10 topic tags, which help to distribute the content in a targeted way to users via the home feed and search, the company says.</p>
<p>While Pins can help creators build an audience on Pinterest, they can use Idea Pins to grow their audience on other platforms, too. The company says it will offer export options that let people share their Pins across the web and social media. To do so, they download their Pin as a video which includes a Pinterest watermark and profile name &#8212; a trick learned from TikTok. This can then be reshared elsewhere.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153099" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153099" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153099" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-Stickers.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-Stickers.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-Stickers.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-Stickers.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-Stickers.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-Stickers.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-Stickers.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-Stickers.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Idea-Pin-Stickers.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153099" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Pinterest users, meanwhile, can save Idea Pins like any other Pin on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the best inspiration comes from people who are fueled by their passions and want to bring positivity and creativity into the world,&#8221; said Pinterest co-founder and Chief Design and Creative Officer Evan Sharp, in a statement about the launch. &#8220;On Pinterest, anyone can inspire. From creators to hobbyists to publishers, Pinterest is a place where anyone can publish great ideas and discover inspiring content. We have creators with extraordinary ideas on Pinterest, and with Idea Pins, creators are empowered to share their passions and inspire their audiences,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The new Idea Pin format is rolling out today to all creators (users with a business account) in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153093" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153093" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2153093" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Creators-Following-Stream.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Creators-Following-Stream.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Creators-Following-Stream.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Creators-Following-Stream.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Creators-Following-Stream.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Creators-Following-Stream.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Creators-Following-Stream.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Creators-Following-Stream.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Creators-Following-Stream.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153093" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Pinterest says, during tests, it found that Idea Pins were more engaging than standard Pins, with 9x the average comment rate. The number of Idea Pins (previously known as Story Pins) has also grown by 4x since January, as more creators adopted the format.</p>
<p>To help creators track how well Pins are performing, Pinterest is expanding its Analytics feature to include a new Followers and Profile Visits-driven metric to show creators how their Idea Pins have driven deeper engagement with their account.</p>
<p>The company says the next step is to make Idea Pins more shoppable, which it&#8217;s doing now with tests of product tagging underway.</p>
<p>Pinterest has been increasing its investment in the creator community in recent months, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/">with the launch</a> of its first-ever <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/creatorcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/creatorcode&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621094697636000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQyP_d733YGaVc1P0IuBIqlNWfVA">Creator Fund</a> last month, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/pinterest-to-test-live-streamed-events-this-month-with-21-creators/">this month&#8217;s test of livestreamed events </a>with 21 creators.

<p>While Idea Pins seem like a natural pivot from Pinterest&#8217;s founding as an inspiration and idea board, it will face serious competition when it comes to wooing the professional creator community to its platform. Other big tech companies are outspending Pinterest, whose new Creator Fund of $500K falls short of the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">$1 million per day Snap paid</a> creators or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">the $100 million fund for YouTube Shorts creators</a>, TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund">$200 million</a> fund or the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600">deals Instagram has been making</a> to lure Reels creators. These platforms, as well as a host of startups, are also giving creators a way to directly monetize their efforts through features like tips, donations, subscriptions and more.</p>
<p>What Pinterest may have in its favor, though, is its reach. The company claims 475 million users, which makes it a destination some creators may not want to overlook in their bid for growth, and later, e-commerce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Madrid and Barcelona tend to attract the buzz when it comes to tech startups in Spain, Valencia is slowly and surely making a name for itself as a growing tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s third-largest city, Valencia features great beaches, sunny weather all year, and affordable housing and healthcare. And with a population of only around a million people, it&#8217;s a little more manageable compared to its bigger cousins.</p>
<p>The city also topped the InterNations Expat City Ranking 2020 as one of the best cities for expats to settle in. What&#8217;s more, it produces plenty of talent — about 25,000 bachelor&#8217;s and masters degrees are issued in the city every year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So to find out what the startup scene in Valencia looks like, we spoke with eight local investors, executives and founders. The city appears to be strong in areas such as travel, AI, cybersecurity, fintech, agritech, travel tech, biotech, sports tech, and VR. The blockchain/crytpo scene could do with some improvement, according to a few respondents.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s investment scene is not particularly large and most investors focus on seed funding, but it&#8217;s growing as family-owned companies, and individual and institutional investors turn to tech. <a href="https://bigban.org/">BIGBAN</a> is a private nonprofit angel investor network based in Valencia, and incubators and accelerator programs continue to proliferate, supported by corporates and local government initiatives such as <a href="http://www.StartupValencia.org">Startup Valencia</a>.</p>
<p>Notable startups in the city include Streamloots, Voicemod, Jeff, Beroomers, Flywire and Blinkfire Analytics.</p>

<h2>Enrique Penichet, founding partner, Draper B1</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Valencia&#8217;s tech ecosystem is strong on providing tech talent. There are a lot of people with capabilities in AI and cybersecurity. Because of this some corporate accelerators are growing strong here, mainly in fintech, such as Bankia Fintech.</p>
<p>We have a unicorn in fintech Flywire, and a foreign fintech scaleup, Creditas (from Brazil), has established their HQ here. We also have some good startups in fintech growing here such as Criptan, Colectual or The Logic Value.</p>
<p>Valencia has also been traditionally strong in video gaming. ESAT, a globally recognized academy located here, provides great talent, and mainly due to this, we have some successful startups such as Voicemod or Streamloots in the gaming industry. In fact, one of the major gaming events in Spain and Europe, Dreamhack, is held in Valencia.</p>
<p>Due to Lanzadera, together with Station F, one of the biggest accelerators in Europe is located in Valencia, and there are now startups growing in all verticals.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />

Both things are happening, Valencia is a nice place to work, near the Mediterranean Sea. It was recognized by Bloomberg as the No. 1 city in the world to work. So, many people are coming here to work remotely. At the same time, some people are leaving to work from the countryside.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Accelerators and founders.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
A bunch of companies from Valencia have closed Series A rounds. Hopefully, in five years it will be commonplace to see some Series B or C or D happening. Right now, probably only Flywire has accomplished that.</p>
<h2>Javier Moliner Urdiales, CEO, Howlanders</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
E-commerce, travel and Industry 4.0.</p>

People will move in due to quality of life, low costs, the location and local government support.</p>

Javier Megias and Juan Roig.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Heaven knows what will happen to the mental health of children who’ve gone through this past year but if there’s one thing we need right now it&#8217;s mental health provision for young people that can scale. And as much as some of us can’t bear the thought of another video call, a UK startup reckons it’s come up with the magic formula for online therapy for children.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.healios.org.uk/">Healios</a> has raised a £7 million ($10M) Series A round to expand its platform across the UK. If the roll-out is successful, the startup is looking at expanding internationally. The round was led by InHealth Ventures with participation from existing investors AlbionVC.</p>
<p>Healios will use the funding to expand its AI, machine learning, and data science expertise, as well as add to the team. Healios says its platform digitises the clinical pathway, enabling children, adults, and their family members to use clinical services at home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to UK government <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmpubacc/1593/1593.pdf">statistics</a>, one in eight (12.8%) five to 19-year-olds in the UK have a mental health disorder but two-thirds are unable to access NHS care because of soaring demands. And the Covid-19 pandemic has <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n614">made things worse</a>.</p>
<p>Launched in 2013, Healios says it has now worked with 65% of NHS Mental Health Trusts, with  70,000 specialized clinical sessions delivered, which is a high success rate for a startup, considering how hard it is to get NHS approval.</p>
<p>The online, family-focused therapy program for young people zeros in on a range of mental health and neurodiverse conditions. Healios says that <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/about/difference/23-family-intervention-for-psychosis">studies</a> have shown involving family members from the start can reduce suicide by as much as 90%. It also covers anxiety, low mood, autism and ADHD, as well as support to their families.</p>
<p>Unlike some startups in the area of mental health, Healios is not a marketplace of advisers but is an end-to-end provider of these services.</p>
<p>InHealth Ventures and InHealth Group Chair, Richard Bradford, will be joining the Healios board, alongside Cat McDonald of AlbionVC.</p>
<p>Rich Andrews, Founder, and CEO of Healios, said: “This funding will help us reach more families in need and enable us to develop further sector-leading interventions and therapies. By bringing together clinical experts and giving them the tools to reach their patients regardless of where they are, we are closing the access gap which has plagued mental health provision for far too long.”</p>
<p>Andrews also told me: “A young person will have an initial mental health assessment with us. If needed, we&#8217;ll make a diagnosis and then they&#8217;ll move on to other interventions with us, so this is a seamless experience.”</p>
<p>Dr Ben Evans, Managing Director of InHealth Ventures, said: “Healios is a standard-bearer for healthcare innovation. They bring together clinical excellence with digital expertise, working in partnership with the NHS to address a critical, but complex area of care delivery. Healios’ work to date speaks for itself; their holistic approach to diagnosis and treatment has had a substantive impact on clinical outcomes and patient experience.”</p>
<p>Cat McDonald, Investor at AlbionVC, added: “Covid has engendered a pace of innovation previously unseen in healthcare. In particular, we have seen that remote care not only works, but often works much better than traditional alternatives. The option to receive care remotely, at home and in a family-centric setting is the strong preference of most kids suffering from poor mental health.”</p>

Today’s funding round values the startup &#8212; which says it now has 5 million customers globally &#8212; at $3.2 billion, the company said. It will be using the funding to expand into new markets.</p>
<p>At a time when mobile phone makers are seeing declines in sales due to slower renewal cycles, and incrementally fewer features added into newer models, Back Market provides another alternative to people who don&#8217;t want to pay full price for a device that might still be in good condition and new to the user, if not altogether new itself.</p>
<p>Consumers can buy refurbished smartphones at different price points, with the stock ranging from old models through to recently released devices. Prices vary depending on the model and the condition of the device. Other stock includes laptops, tablets, headphones, gaming consoles, and other gadgets and consumer electronics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also part of what you might more generally call the circular economy, where people are recycling items back into the sales market to extend their life.</p>
<p>Used good sales are of course nothing new, but in more recent years the vast availability of new and cheap goods has taken consumers out of the habit of thinking of used as having much attraction or value &#8212; witness sites focused on used goods like eBay now quite dominated by new items. However, the concept has picked up steam and credibility again in the past year of pandemic living, a time when people are looking to save money, with many thinking of the part they play in this world of ours, possibly helping to put a little less of our plastic and other waste into it.</p>
<p>“Our goal now goes beyond making renewed tech a viable option,&#8221; Back Market’s CEO, Thibaud Hug de Larauze, said in a <a href="https://backmarket.reportablenews.com/pr/back-market-raises-335-million-as-its-renewed-electronics-marketplace-approaches-5-million-customers-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>. &#8220;We want to make it the first choice for electronics purchases. The support and confidence of these prominent funds, together with our growing customer base, marks an important step in Back Market’s journey, and more importantly for the refurbished sector as a whole.”</p>
<p>All the same, he estimates that new device sales is a $1.5 trillion market globally. In other words, the opportunity is big (so much to disrupt!) but also quite formidable, all the reason why those focusing on used goods as a big business are trying to up their quality game, as Back Market is doing.</p>
<p>The environmental aspect was one of the reasons for Generation Investment Management in this round: the firm co-founded by Al Gore invests with an ethos of sustainability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back Market’s transparent and trusted approach empowers consumers to change their purchasing behavior by making it easier, safer and more affordable to buy refurbished goods,&#8221; added Shalini Rao, Director of Growth Equity, Generation Investment Management, in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to supporting Back Market as it doubles down in the US and elsewhere globally. The world generates over 50 million tonnes of electronic waste each year. Back Market offers an alternative that has the potential to radically shift unsustainable consumption patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back Market doesn’t refurbish devices directly. Instead, third-party companies act as the sourcing partners for Back Market. They list their inventory on the marketplace and find customers more easily. That is in essense the &#8220;marketplace&#8221; of Back Market (which is not a black market after all but just a play on the idea). Overall, 1,500 companies sell devices on the platform.</p>
<p>Generation Investment Management also participated in today’s funding round as well as existing investors Goldman Sachs Growth Equity, Aglaé Ventures, Eurazeo and daphni.</p>
<p>Back Market also invests heavily in merchant services, parts sourcing and quality control. The idea is that you should be sure the device is going to work as expected if you buy it through Back Market.</p>
<p>The company claims that the overall defective rate of products is now sitting at 5% — there’s a defect warranty included with each purchase.</p>
<p>While Back Market originally started in Europe, it is now active in 13 different markets including the U.S. and Japan. Up next, the startup plans to launch in Canada, Greece, Sweden and Slovakia.</p>
<p>“We are excited to support Back Market, a category-defining business which is re-shaping and growing the refurbished electronics market globally,&#8221; said Chris Caulkin, Managing Director and Head of Technology for EMEA, General Atlantic, in a statement. &#8220;Back Market has built a strong consumer brand centered around quality, sustainability, convenience and affordability. We look forward to working with Thibaud, Quentin, Vianney and the full Back Market team as they accelerate their expansion into new categories and geographies.”</p>

<p>This news comes just four months after BukuKas announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/bukukas-raises-10-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india-to-build-a-end-to-end-software-stack-for-indonesian-smes/">$10 million Series A led by Sequoia Capital India</a>.

<p>“We’ve been growing really fast and there was a lot of interest from some very good people,” chief executive officer Krishnan Menon told TechCrunch. “This is not a capital-need based raise, but more of a tactical raise and having the right people back us long term.”</p>

<p>BukuKas was founded by Menon and chief operating officer Lorenzo Peracchione, who met while working at Lazada Indonesia. Since its launch as as a digital bookkeeping app in December 2019, BukuKas has added new features, including online payments and an e-commerce platform. The app has onboarded about 6.3 million businesses so far and now has a total of 3 million monthly active users. It claims its annualized bookkeeping transaction volume is $25.9 billion USD, or the equivalent of about 2.2% of Indonesia’s <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=ID">gross domestic product</a>.</p>
<p>According to Bank Indonesia, the country’s central bank, there are about <a href="https://jakartaglobe.id/context/govt-push-sme-to-use-online-marketplace-to-pave-way-into-international-market">60 million SMEs</a>, though Menon says that number may range from 55 million to 65 million. The majority still operate mostly offline, but the push to digitization began even before the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the Indonesian government <a href="https://jakartaglobe.id/context/govt-push-sme-to-use-online-marketplace-to-pave-way-into-international-market/">launched a program two years ago with marketplace Blibi</a> to encourage more businesses to sell online, with the goal of helping more SMEs go global.</p>
<p>This means there is a growing roster of startups and services focused on helping small businesses go online. These include Y Combinator-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/indonesian-fintech-startup-bukuwarung-gets-new-funding-to-add-financial-services-for-small-merchants/">BukuWarung</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/warung-pintar-raises-27-5m/">WarungPintar</a>, Grab’s Mitra GrabKios and wholesaler-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/credibook-gets-1-5-million-to-help-indonesian-retail-wholesalers-digitize-their-finances/">CrediBook</a>.

<p>“There’s obviously a macro shift that’s happening in the market right now. People are rushing to get digitized and people are coming out of a rough year. They started to realize ‘I need to upgrade,’ so there’s a rush to get digitized, to manage their money better, a movement to digital payments,” said Menon.</p>
<p>BukuKas’ goal is to become an end-to-end software stack for micro, small and medium enterprises and serve 20 million MSMEs by the end of 2022, with inventory management, invoicing, payment-related analytics and other tools. The company recently took several steps toward that goal. In April, it launched BukuKasPay for business owners to pay suppliers online or accept digital payments, including virtual bank accounts and e-wallets like OVO, Dana, GoPay, LinkAja and ShopeePay from customers. In September 2020, it acquired a digital ledger app called Catatan Keuangan Harian to expand its market share before launching an e-commerce platform called Tokko that enables MSMEs to set up online shops. About 1.3 million merchants have created shops using Tokko in the six months since its release.</p>
<p>Tokko focuses on merchants who find big marketplaces, like Tokopedia, too complicated, and want an alternative way to set up an online brand.</p>
<p>BukuKas’ users include warungs (small stores), fashion retailers, electronics stores, social commerce sellers and service providers. On average, its users make several thousand U.S. dollars per month in revenue, but some earn as high as tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The app is designed to work as a layer on top of WhatsApp. For example, many merchants allow customers to buy on credit, so they can use BukuKas to send automatic reminders through WhatsApp with a payment link. Businesses can also send invoices or take Tokko orders through WhatsApp. Menon said since many Indonesian merchants already relied on WhatsApp to communicate with suppliers and customers, this helps it onboard more users because they don’t have to make major changes to their operational routines. It also creates viral loops, as other businesses get payment reminders or invoices sent through BukuKas, and decide to try the app, too.</p>
<p>“Our thesis is very similar to what Square or Shopify did in the U.S. We keep merchants as the center of the universe, and we keep building solutions for them,” Menon said. “That can be software-related solutions like BukuKas’ early version and Tokko moving further into commerce. We’re moving further into banking solutions, so payments come first, and then actually building out the full banking suite. The end goal is if a merchant five years from now looks back and says, thanks to BukuKas I was able to adapt to the digital era, and sticks with us.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transport for London and London Councils have announced Dott, Lime and Tier Mobility as the winners of its prized e-scooter pilot, confirming </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/job-postings-hint-at-winners-of-nyc-and-london-e-scooter-pilots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last month’s suspicions based on job postings by the companies.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>Last year, <a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/e-scooter-firms-get-the-green-light-to-start-trials-of-up-to-one-year-on-uk-streets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/e-scooter-firms-get-the-green-light-to-start-trials-of-up-to-one-year-on-uk-streets/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">the government legalized e-scooter rental trials</a> by local authorities, although private e-scooter riding is still illegal. This legislation spurred the launch of TfL and London Council’s open and competitive procurement process for viable operators. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The pilot, which will run for up to 12 months, will begin June 7 in some of London’s boroughs, including Canary Wharf and the City of London. More neighborhoods are expected to join as the year progresses, according to TfL. Lambeth and Southwark are also seeking participation. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153369" style="width: 588px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153369" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2153369" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/london-borough-map-Mod.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="578" height="462" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/london-borough-map-Mod.jpg 1425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/london-borough-map-Mod.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/london-borough-map-Mod.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/london-borough-map-Mod.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/london-borough-map-Mod.jpg?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/london-borough-map-Mod.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153369" class="wp-caption-text">Map of London outlining areas for the e-scooter pilot.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rides can only begin and end in participating neighborhoods, which will designate parking bays for the scooters that are enforced by operators’ geofencing capabilities. However, riders will be able to move freely across these boroughs and &#8220;ride-through areas,&#8221; which thus far only appears to be Tower Hamlets. Between 60 and 150 e-scooters will be available to rent in each participating borough. TfL will gradually let operators that demonstrate strong compliance add scooters. Those that don&#8217;t comply could have their scooter numbers reduced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety and data sharing are core requirements for the participating scooter companies. TfL hopes to be able to use data shared by the operators to help London and the United Kingdom shape future policy on e-scooters and investigate them as a viable option for London’s sustainable recovery from the pandemic. </span><a href="http://london.gov.uk/what-we-do/environment/climate-change/zero-carbon-london"><span style="font-weight: 400;">London’s mayor has set a goal of being a zero-carbon city by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so green forms of mobility that decrease reliance on ICE vehicles is essential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re doing all we can to support London’s safe and sustainable recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and it’s clear that e-scooters could act as an innovative, greener alternative to car trips,” said Helen Sharp, TfL’s e-scooter trial lead in a statement. “This new trial will provide the data and insights we need to determine the longer-term role e-scooters could play in our strategy for a greener and healthier future for London.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TfL outlined the following safety requirements for scooters: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lower maximum speed of 12.5 mph; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lights at the front and rear of the vehicles that are always on throughout any rental;  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audible warning systems that can be used without adjusting the rider’s grip of the handlebar;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First-ride policies&#8221; requiring new users to take an e-learning safety course;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rules against riding on sidewalks. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with all governing city bodies, street clutter is of particular importance to London. Aside from strict geofencing regulations, there will also be a mandatory response time for operators in cases where vehicles have been improperly parked, are damaged or are causing an obstruction, according to TfL. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The safety of those using e-scooters, as well as other road users and pedestrians, is absolutely paramount, so it’s important that they are trialled in this rigorous way to ensure high standards,” said Will Norman, London’s walking and cycling commissioner, in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dott, Lime and Tier will set their own rental pricing, but they’ll need to be mindful of the needs of essential workers and those with lower incomes by offering appropriate discounts. Lime already offers its Lime Access Program in operating cities, which provides 50% off rides to those on public assistance and workers who have been most affected by the pandemic. </span></p>

With its ongoing e-bike operations in London, the company was a shoe-in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlin-based Tier Mobility, which also operates in Paris, is the second heaviest hitter. Its recent expansion into Kraków, Poland marked its 100th city, and the company plans to extend coverage in Europe, the Middle East and new markets, as well as add e-bikes to its fleet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to e-scooters, Tier will be bringing its rider-swappable battery business to London, allowing riders to exchange batteries at charging stations hosted in local businesses across London. This would allow riders to earn free trips in the process while bringing increased footfall for businesses trying to recover from the pandemic. Additionally, having this crowdsourced approach has the potential to reduce congestion associated with collection and transporting e-scooters to a warehouse for charging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As seems to be the case with these metropolitan scooter deals, there’s always one promising underdog. In the case of London, that&#8217;s Amsterdam-based Dott, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-e-scooter-and-micromobility-startup-dott-raises-85-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which recently raised $85 million in a Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and operates in about 20 cities in Europe. London will be Dott’s first city in the U.K. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canoo, the Los Angeles-based electric vehicle startup that debuted on the Nasdaq public exchange earlier this year, is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, just months after its merger with special purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>The investigation is broad, covering the Hennessy&#8217;s initial public offering and merger with Canoo, the company&#8217;s operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with the recent departures of certain of the company’s officers, according to a quarterly earnings report posted Monday. Canoo learned of the investigation on April 29. Canoo&#8217;s share price fell more than 3% in after-hours trading following the release of its first-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SEC has also informed the Company that the investigation does not mean that it has concluded that anyone has violated the law, and does not mean that it has a negative opinion of any person, entity or security. We intend to provide the requested information and cooperate fully with the SEC investigation,&#8221; Canoo noted in the regulatory filing. Canoo added that it does not consider the investigation or other lawsuits it is facing to be material to its business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The SEC investigation follows a string of executive departures, a change to some of the core pieces of its business model, the loss of a key automotive partnership and at least one lawsuit brought by shareholders. And that&#8217;s just the activity since the first of the year.</p>
<p>Canoo started as Evelozcity in 2017, founded by former Faraday Future executives Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. The company rebranded as Canoo in spring 2019 and debuted its first vehicle several months later. It was this first vehicle, as well as Canoo&#8217;s plan to offer it only as a subscription, that captured the attention of investors, companies and the media. Last year, Hyundai announced a <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982">partnership with Canoo</a> to co-develop EVs, but that deal fell apart in early 2021 after the company changed its business model and decided to not offer engineering services to other automakers, according to comments made by the company&#8217;s chairman and now CEO Tony Aquila in a March investors&#8217; call.</p>
<p>Canoo has sustained numerous executive departures, including co-founder and CEO Kranz, general counsel Andrew Wolstan, CFO Paul Balciunas and its head of powertrain development. Krause, who was the company&#8217;s first CEO, stepped down in August 2019. Last month, Canoo was also named as a defendant in two class-action complaints filed by shareholders.</p>
<p>Amid the executive exits and business pivots, the company has managed to narrow its quarterly losses despite an increase in R&amp;D expenditures and no revenue. The company reported Monday a net loss of $15.2 million, or 7 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared to a loss of $30.9 million, or 37 cents a share, in the same period last year. The company said it ended the quarter with $641.9 million in cash and equivalents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per a recent <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/ecommerce-in-MENA-opportunity-beyond-the-hype/">report</a> by Bain &amp; Co., e-commerce </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow to $28.5 billion in MENA by 2022 from a 2019 value of $8.3 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt, one of the most active e-commerce countries in the region, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is anticipated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow 33% </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach $3 billion by 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for any e-commerce business to thrive, its last-mile delivery arm has to be well figured out. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bosta.co/">Bosta</a> is one such company in Egypt helping small businesses with logistics and last-mile delivery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the company is announcing it has closed a Series A investment of $6.7 million. U.S. and Middle East VC firm Silicon Badia led the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with participation from 4DX Ventures, Plug and Play Ventures, Wealth Well VC, Khwarizmi VC, as well as other regional and global investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment comes a year after the company raised a $2.5 million round, which takes its total investment raised to $9.2 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bosta </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017 by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-ezzat-67aba7a4">Mohamed Ezzat</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmedgaber20">Ahmed Gaber</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company offers next-day delivery to customers and handles exchange shipments, customer returns and cash collection</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>The idea for Bosta came during Ezzat&#8217;s time at Lynks, his previous consumer goods startup. Lynks, the first YC-backed company from Egypt, allows people in Egypt to buy brands from the U.S., China and the U.K.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As co-founder and COO at Lynks, Ezzat was responsible for logistics, international clearance and last-mile delivery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Egypt experienced an economic downturn coupled with the Egyptian pound devaluation and government restriction on imports</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Lynks it meant slow growth, but Ezzat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was concerned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about fixing the last-mile delivery bit, which, according to him, was a huge pain point</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My nightmare was always the last mile. And at that time, you know that e-commerce is still very, very small. So it&#8217;s only 1% of the whole retail value,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So I was always thinking, how come if we want the e-commerce to grow, and we don&#8217;t have any strong company when it comes to last-mile because, in the end, every transaction on an e-commerce platform is a transaction on a courier platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce is a fragmented sector where 80% of transactions come from small businesses selling on Facebook, Instagram and social media in general</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these businesses lack a strong delivery experience, and Ezzat left Lynks the following year to start Bosta</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being in the parcel delivery industry, Bosta wants to help these companies to grow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">profitably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also tries to simplify logistics and allow its customers to have full control over the delivery process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can use Bosta to get anything to your doorstep. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You buy in our local currency, and we buy everything, handle the shipping, customs, clearance and bring it to your doorstep,&#8221; the CEO added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company doesn&#8217;t own fleets of vehicles to carry out operations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, it operates an Uber-like model where drivers sign up, are made contractors and make money when a delivery </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2017, the company has delivered more than 4 million packages to businesses, more than half since the pandemic outbreak last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bosta completes more than 300,000 deliveries per month, which is a 3.5x increase from when it raised its previous round, Ezzat stated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also claims that more than 2,200 businesses use its platform daily and achieve a 95% delivery success rate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from small businesses, Bosta works with major e-commerce platforms like Souq (an Amazon company) and Jumia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the volume of goods transported, Bosta charges small businesses about 35-40 Egyptian pounds, while the big players </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> less, at 20-25 Egyptian pounds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment, Fawaz H Zu&#8217;bi said in a statement: “E-commerce has always had amazing potential in our region but was always </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being held</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back by something whether payments, logistics, market fragmentation, or customer adoption</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to finally see companies like Bosta emerge to tackle some of these issues and help e-commerce realize its full promise and potential in a region that has now ‘turned on’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next two years, Bosta plans to deliver more than 15 million parcels in Egypt and serve over 20,000 businesses. The funds will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for those causes, as well as expanding operations across Africa, MENA and the GCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The investment is to dominate Egypt,&#8221; said Ezzat. &#8220;We want to make sure that we deliver the next day across Egypt, not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Cairo, where we currently do. And to be a market leader when it comes to e-commerce on the continent and be profitable. This is the main target for us now and also to start operations in Saudi Arabia.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Turnkey solutions might be tempting to healthcare startups looking to take advantage of the current market tailwinds, but startups still have to decide what to outsource and what to build.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital health in the U.S. got a huge boost from COVID-19 as more people started consulting physicians and urgent care providers remotely in the midst of lockdowns. So much so that <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality">McKinsey estimates</a> that up to $250 billion of the current healthcare expenditure in the U.S. has the potential to be spent virtually. The prominence of digital health is undoubtedly here to stay, but how it looks and feels from provider to provider is still a debate among sector startups.</p>
<p>But for providers who want to deliver care virtually across the country, it&#8217;s not as simple as adding a Zoom invite to an annual check-up. The process requires intention every step of the way — right from the clinicians delivering remote care to the choice of payment processor.</p>
<p>Providers and healthcare startups <em>can</em> choose white-label solutions such as publicly-listed Teladoc and Truepill, which have been around for a long time, and have powered the operations of unicorns like Hims and Hers, Nurx, and GoodRx as they look to scale in a compliant but efficient manner.</p>
<p>Turnkey solutions might be tempting to companies looking to take advantage of this opportunity, but startups still have to decide what to outsource and what to build. Should you rely on others for staffing your practice? Do you build your own payment processing service in-house? Do you integrate with Zoom or build your own video-conferencing software? These questions are crucial to think about early on to prepare for future scale regardless of whether a startup is B2B or B2C.</p>
<h2>More than just Zoom</h2>
<p>SteadyMD, which in March <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210330005641/en/SteadyMD-Raises-25-Million-to-Power-Telehealth-Infrastructure-for-Digital-Health-Companies-and-Employers-in-All-50-States">raised</a> a $25 million Series B led by Lux Capital, wants to be the infrastructure layer that makes it easier for other companies to offer telehealth services. It is hoping to address a pain point it ran into years earlier: The complexity of launching compliant telehealth services in all 50 states.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2016 with the intent to provide high-quality, virtual primary care for brick-and-mortar shops. Through that process, SteadyMD built a suite of tools to make it work with EMR integrations, doctor-patient communication channels, digital recruiting and forecasting software, and prescription referrals and operations. The burdensome process struck a chord with the co-founders and they pivoted the company to where it is today: an &#8220;AWS for healthcare&#8221;.</p>
<p>SteadyMD offers a suite of services to its customers, the least of which, says co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guyfriedman/">Guy Friedman</a>, is its video-conferencing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the technology capacities,&#8221; Friedman says. &#8220;The very large companies that have a lot of resources are using us to help them increase their capacity as workforce.&#8221;</p>

The startup wants to help consumers do more than just find insurance, pursuing the superapp concept, but in a new direction. For more on insurtech marketplaces and their growth, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money/">head here</a>. (Insurtech is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic/">super hot in aggregate</a>, it’s worth remembering.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fast-growth-pushes-an-unprofitable-no-code-startup-into-the-public-markets-inside-monday-coms-ipo-filing/"><strong>Monday.com is going public</strong></a><strong>: </strong>We’ve long known that corporate communications and planning startup Monday.com was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/monday-com-surpassed-130m-arr-before-the-remote-work-boom/">north of $100 million in annual recurring revenue</a>. Now, at last, it has filed to go public. So we ripped into the numbers, which show accelerating revenue adds. More importantly than the raw math, however, was the implicit point from the news that the IPO markets remain open, and for more than just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/industrial-automation-startup-bright-machines-hauls-in-435m-by-going-public-via-spac/">the latest SPAC deals</a>. That’s good news for late-stage startups everywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/"><strong>Apple adds lossless for no cost</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">wants to charge</a> for higher-quality streaming. Apple has decided not to. And that’s not great news for the smaller company because it needs to boost its revenue per user over time. Apple, which has infinite money, does not. The Spotify-Apple war is a notable one to watch because it pits an incumbent <em>upstart</em> against an upstart <em>incumbent</em> in the music streaming space. Let’s see how Spotify fires back.</p>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>It appears that every startup in the world just raised more money, so here’s a rundown of the latest deals in quick-fire fashion, ordered by size:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fave-with-2-2-million-seed-looks-to-connect-creators-with-their-fandoms/"><strong>Fave raises $2.2M to connect fans and creators</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Founder Jacquelle Amankonah Horton wants to close the space between fans and the creators they love. Given the general market focus in recent quarters on creators, the company makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/merge-raises-4-5m-to-help-b2b-companies-build-customer-facing-integrations/"><strong>Merge raises $4.5M for its HR and finance API</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Merge offers a single API to connect products to all sorts of finance and HR products. It’s akin to a super API. And with what we presume is a developer-led sales motion and <a href="https://www.merge.dev/pricing">on-demand pricing</a>, it’s right in the middle of the current startup <em>business model</em> zeitgeist.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/"><strong>Telda raises $5M for Egyptian neobanking</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The Telda round is cool not only because we don’t cover Egyptian tech enough, but also because there’s Sequoia money in it. American VCs are looking farther and farther afield for their next deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fresh-out-of-yc-houm-raises-8m-to-improve-the-home-rental-and-sales-market-in-latam/"><strong>Houm raises $8M for LatAm home sales</strong></a><strong>:</strong> TechCrunch described Houm as “an all-in-one platform that helps homeowners rent and sell their properties in” Latin America. The recent Y Combinator grad took part in the accelerator’s winter 2021 batch.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/with-21m-in-funding-code-ocean-aims-to-help-researchers-replicate-data-heavy-science/"><strong>Code Ocean raises $21M for collaborative data science</strong></a><strong>:</strong> In short, Code Ocean provides data jockeys with a “small-scale container platform that lets you wrap up all the necessary components of your data and analysis in an easily shared format,” Devin Coldewey reports. And now it has a lot more money to chase that vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/ankorstore-raises-another-102-million-for-its-wholesale-marketplace/"><strong>Ankorstore raises $102M to supply indie stores</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Hailing from France, Ankorstore provides wholesale items to smaller retailers. And Tiger just poured capital into the company, meaning that the startup has some of the most intriguing financial backing out there today.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/industrial-automation-startup-bright-machines-hauls-in-435m-by-going-public-via-spac/"><strong>One more hardware SPAC</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Bright Machines is going public via a SPAC. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> helped us dig into the company and its accounting results.</p>
<h2>The battle for voice recognition inside vehicles is heating up</h2>
<p>Until recently, integrating affordable voice-recognition software into an automobile was something from science fiction.</p>
<p>But last year, the percentage of vehicles offering in-car connected services reached 45%. By 2024, analysts predict cars with voice recognition will comprise 60% of the market.</p>
<p>Considering how much time many of us spend behind the wheel, there&#8217;s an infinite number of applications for the technology. For our latest Extra Crunch market map, we sized up the general market opportunity before creating a roster of major players and reaching out to investors to see where they&#8217;re placing bets.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Akin to the startup market, Big Tech was incredibly busy in the last few days, so here’s your run-through:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/jd-logistics-ipo/"><strong>JD.com’s logistics subsidiary is going public</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Good news from the Chinese startup market has been somewhat rare lately. Here’s some, which not only helps change the narrative a bit about the country’s tech scene, but also underscores how bonkers the global e-commerce market is.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/spacex-launched-52-more-starlink-satellites-to-orbit-on-saturday/"><strong>SpaceX sent out 52 more Starlink satellites</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Bring on rural, high-speed internet. So we can all move to Montana. (Please.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/"><strong>GoJek and Tokopedia are GoTo Group</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The expected combination of “Indonesia’s two biggest startups” is done, TechCrunch reports. GoJek, of course, is in the ride-hailing business, while Tokopedia is a marketplace. Now it’s a single, massive entity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439924/microsoft-teams-personal-version-launch-available-download?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><strong>Microsoft makes Teams better for your parents</strong></a><strong>:</strong> What happens when your Discord deal dies? Well, you make your current chat-video-groups service better for regular folks, it turns out. Aside from gaming, Teams may be Microsoft’s best shot at a consumer play that works out for some time.</p>
<p>Finally, BigTelco companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/att-confirms-deal-to-combine-its-warnermedia-subsidiary-with-discovery-inc-in-pure-play-43b-deal/">ditching media assets</a> to de-lever ahead of higher infrastructure spend? Say no more, AT&amp;T, we’re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">already hip to it</a>. (Or they could just limit some shareholder return programs for a bit. You know?)</p>

Rob Olson is a partner and head of data strategy at <a href="https://m13.co/">M13</a>, a venture engine focused on investing in the core technologies that are going to drive and change consumer behavior over the next decade.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Does it really take an average of seven to eight years for a successful startup to exit? What can early-stage founders do to accelerate outcomes?</p>
<p>We wanted to know if founding teams can execute faster with a higher degree of success if they’re able to take advantage of relevant executive expertise. After all, that’s the thesis we built our venture model around &#8212; we purposefully designed M13 so that early-stage founders get access to experienced executives they wouldn’t otherwise have the money to hire or the time to vet, onboard and manage.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Even if companies are doing everything right, they still reduce time to exit when they have multiple founders with prior relevant experience as a senior leader or operator.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We looked at years of data from hundreds of successful startups. As it turns out, the impact of relevant executive expertise is even greater than we had anticipated &#8212; to the tune of doubling the rate of return on a venture investment.</p>
<p>When it comes to measuring leadership experience, information about an individual executive’s experience — for example, how long they’ve been an exec — is publicly available. Unfortunately, there isn’t readily available structured data around a founding team’s seniority and how early the founders bring on people with more experience as an operator or leader.</p>
<p>To find out if leadership experience significantly impacts startups’ success, we analyzed nearly 800 executives at more than 200 companies that reached a sizable exit (greater than or equal to a $500 million valuation) via an IPO on a U.S. exchange or an exit via M&amp;A from 2004-2019. About 70% of the companies in our dataset exited between 2016-2019, including notable IPOs like Spotify, Zoom, Uber and Peloton. We decided to exclude companies in the biotech/life sciences space because these companies follow a different growth trajectory than consumer tech and B2B tech and traditionally exit via IPO or M&amp;A at a much earlier stage.</p>
<p>Here’s what our analysis of startups with successful exits revealed.</p>
<h2>Of successful exits, the average actually is 7-8 years</h2>
<p>While there are other intangible variables for startup success, the basic equation is the time and capital required to achieve an exit and the size of that exit.</p>
<p>Our dataset validates the widely accepted statement that successful exits take about seven to eight years:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153061" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153061" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153061" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m13-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="661" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m13-1.png 1760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m13-1.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m13-1.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m13-1.png?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m13-1.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m13-1.png?resize=1536,991 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m13-1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153061" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> M13</p></div></p>
<p>But could a variable like relevant leadership experience actually accelerate the time to exit? We wondered: Beyond time and capital, are there any factors — like experience as a leader or operator — that can have an exponential impact on the exit outcome? And when is the right time for those human capital resources to be introduced to make that impact?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Move over, Xbox and PlayStation. A new foe has appeared in the world of online multiplayer gaming! It&#8217;s the&#8230; uh, Game Boy. As in that unbreakable, gray, 4.19Mhz tank from 1989.</p>
<p>While the Game Boy has had a handful of locally multiplayer games since the beginning, using it meant physically connecting your Game Boy to another Game Boy via an accessory called the link cable. If you wanted to play some Nintendo with someone further than a few feet away&#8230; well, you&#8217;d just have to wait a few decades.</p>
<p>In a wildly impressive display of skill, hardware hacker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/stacksmashing/featured">stacksmashing</a> has managed to reverse-engineer the Game Boy&#8217;s link cable protocol and effectively trick it into working across the internet. The Game Boy connects through the link cable hooked into a Raspberry Pi to a custom desktop client, which in turn pings an online game server that acts as the bridge between you and your opponent(s). The Game Boy thinks it&#8217;s talking to any other ol&#8217; Game Boy, unaware of the fact that it&#8217;s actually communicating with a server that could be halfway around the world.</p>
<p>The first game they&#8217;ve got working? Tetris!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KtHu693wE9o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Getting any given game to work (imagine trading a Pokémon you caught in 1998 with someone across the internet!) will require that game&#8217;s unique communication protocols to be reverse-engineered, so it&#8217;s only Tetris for now. Fortunately, stacksmashing has opened up the source code for all the various components that have been built so far, so there&#8217;s something of a foundation to build upon. And because the whole thing is no fun without anyone to play with, there&#8217;s also a Discord channel just for finding others who&#8217;ve gone down this rabbit hole. There&#8217;s even a custom PCB in the works ($15, with preorders expected to ship by June) that&#8217;ll handle the connection between the link cable and the Raspberry Pi, removing the need for you to shred a link cable to expose its wires and make this work.</p>
<p>Stacksmashing also recently made headlines by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E0PWQvW-14">cracking open and modifying Apple&#8217;s AirTags</a>, as well as turning the Game Boy into a (hilariously underpowered) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ckjr9x214c">Bitcoin miner</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/helping-big-banks-out-affirm-affirm-and-out-chime-chime-gives-amount-a-681-million-valuation/">investment comes just over five months after Amount raised $86 million</a> in a Series C round led by Goldman Sachs Growth at a valuation of $686 million. (The original raise was $81 million, but Barclays</span> Principal Investments invested $5 million as part of a second close of the Series C round). <span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">round came just three months after the Chicago-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">startup quietly raised $58 million in a Series B round in March. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest funding brings Amount’s total capital raised to $243 million since it spun off from </span><a href="https://www.avant.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; an online lender that has raised over $600 million in equity &#8212; in January of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what kind of technology does Amount provide? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple terms, Amount’s mission is to help financial institutions “go digital in months — not years&#8221; and thus, better compete with fintech rivals. The company formed just before the pandemic hit. But as we have all seen, demand for the type of technology Amount has developed has only increased exponentially this year and last.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Adam Hughes says Amount was spun out of Avant to provide enterprise software built specifically for the banking industry. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partners with banks and financial institutions to “rapidly digitize their financial infrastructure and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">compete in the retail lending and buy now, pay later sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Hughes told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the 400-person company has built what it describes as “battle-tested” retail banking and point-of-sale technology that it claims accelerates digital transformation for financial institutions. The goal is to give those institutions a way to offer “a secure and seamless digital customer and merchant experience” that leverages Amount’s verification and analytics capabilities. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HSBC, TD Bank, Regions, Banco Popular and Avant (of course) are among the 10 banks that use Amount’s technology in an effort to simplify their transition to digital financial services. Recently, </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/barclays-us-consumer-bank-expands-point-of-sale-financing-suite-to-include-installment-options-powered-by-amount-301277216.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barclays US Consumer Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> became one of the first major banks to offer installment point-of-sale options, giving merchants the ability to “white label” POS payments under their own brand (using Amount’s technology).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic dramatically accelerated banks&#8217; interest in further digitizing the retail lending experience and offering additional buy now, pay later financing options with the rise of e-commerce,” Hughes, former president and COO at Avant, told TechCrunch. “Banks are facing significant disruption risk from fintech competitors, so an Amount partnership can deliver a world-class digital experience with significant go-to-market advantages.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, he points out, consumers’ digital expectations have changed as a result of the forced digital adoption during the pandemic, with bank branches and stores closing and more banking done and more goods and services being purchased online.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amount delivers retail banking experiences via a variety of channels and a point-of-sale financing product suite, as well as features such as fraud prevention, verification, decisioning engines and account management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Amount clients include financial institutions collectively managing nearly $2 trillion in U.S. assets and servicing more than 50 million U.S. customers, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hughes declined to provide any details regarding the company’s financials, saying only that Amount “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">performed well” as a standalone company in 2020 and that the company is expecting “significant” year-over-year revenue growth in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amount plans to use its new capital to further accelerate R&amp;D by investing in its technology and products. It also will be eyeing some acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see a lot of interesting technology we could layer onto our platform to unlock new asset classes, and acquisition opportunities that would allow us to bring additional features to our platform,” Hughes told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avant itself made its first acquisition earlier this year when it picked up Zero Financial, news that TechCrunch covered </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/avant-doubles-down-on-digital-banking-with-acquisition-of-zero-financial-and-its-neobank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus, partner</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">at WestCap, said his firm invested in Amount based on the belief </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that banks and other financial institutions have “a point-in-time opportunity to democratize access to traditional financial products by accelerating modernization efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Amount is the market leader in powering that change,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” he said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through its best-in-class products, Amount enables financial institutions to enhance and elevate the banking experience for their end customers and maintain a key competitive advantage in the marketplace.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Germany electric aviation startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/volocopter/">Volocopter</a> revealed Monday a new electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft targeting the suburban-to-city commuter.</p>
<p>The four-seater VoloConnect is designed to have a range of 62 miles, making it well-suited for trips between the suburbs and the city, the company said. The aircraft design is a significant departure from the VoloCity, the company&#8217;s first passenger eVTOL that is designed for shorter urban trips. The two-seat VoloCity, which has to be certified, has a 22-mile range.</p>
<p>VoloConnect’s longer range indicates that the company has its sights set on markets outside of major city centers, and that it is looking to more directly compete with rival eVTOL startups. VoloConnect&#8217;s aircraft specs are in line with that of competitors Archer Aviation and Wisk Aero, which each have eVTOL designs with an anticipated range of around 60 miles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>VoloConnect has a hybrid lift-and-push design, combining aspects of what one might typically see in a helicopter with a small aircraft. The vertical lift is facilitated by six propellers that sit parallel to the aircraft body and are connected by two wings. The push comes from two large fans on each side of the craft. Three wheels can retract into and out of the plane’s belly during take-off and landing.</p>
<p>The German-based startup said the new craft can reach a cruising speed of 112 mph (180 km/h) and a top speed of around 155 mph (250 km/h). It aims to achieve certification by 2026.</p>
<p>Electric aviation startups are all competing to be the first company to bring an aircraft to market. Even as Volocopter released this new design, the company is primarily focused on launching its air taxi service, which would use the smaller VoloCity aircraft, in Singapore by 2023. But before Volocopter&#8217;s aircraft can take to the skies, it will first need to achieve type certification with the European Union Aviation Safety Administration, and, in the case of Singapore, the relevant aviation authority there.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After the transaction is consummated, the startup will sport an anticipated equity valuation of $1.6 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.brightmachines.com/">Bright Machines</a> is going public via a SPAC-led combination, it <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210517005272/en/Bright-Machines-a-Leader-in-Intelligent-Software-Defined-Manufacturing-to-Become-a-Public-Company-via-Merger-with-SCVX">announced</a> this morning. The transaction will see the 3-year-old company merge with SCVX, raising gross cash proceeds of $435 million in the process.</p>
<p>After the transaction is consummated, the startup will sport an anticipated equity valuation of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The Bright Machines news indicates that the great SPAC chill was not a deep freeze. And the transaction itself, in conjunction with the previously announced Desktop Metal blank-check deal, implies that there is space in the market for hardware startup liquidity via SPACs. Perhaps that will unlock more late-stage capital for hardware-focused upstarts.</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re first looking at what Bright Machines does, and then the financial details that it shared as part of its news.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Bright Machines?</h2>
<p>Bright Machines is trying to solve a hard problem related to industrial automation by creating microfactories. This involves a complex mix of hardware, software and artificial intelligence. While robotics has been around in one form or another since the 1970s, for the most part, it has lacked real intelligence. Bright Machines wants to change that.</p>
<p>The company emerged in 2018 with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/bright-machines-lands-179m-to-bring-smarter-robotics-to-manufacturing/">a $179 million Series A</a>, a hefty amount of cash for a young startup, but the company has a bold vision and such a vision takes extensive funding. What it’s trying to do is completely transform manufacturing using machine learning.</p>
<p>At the time of that funding, the company brought in former Autodesk co-CEO Amar Hanspal as CEO and former Autodesk founder and CEO Carl Bass to sit on the company board of directors. AutoDesk itself has been trying to transform design and manufacturing in recent years, so it was logical to bring these two experienced leaders into the fold.</p>
<p>The startup’s thesis is that instead of having what are essentially “unintelligent” robots, it wants to add computer vision and a heavy dose of sensors to bring a data-driven automation approach to the factory floor.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
