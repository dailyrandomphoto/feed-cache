										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year has been one of the busiest yet in terms of new commercial launch companies coming online, with companies like Astra and Firefly Aerospace actually getting rockets up and running (if not flying as designed quite yet), and with landmark human spaceflight missions from Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX. And with more constellations in operation, built out of satellites equipped with sensors capable of providing new and more detailed data for commercial use back on Earth, the timing is right for startups everywhere to leverage a new data Gold Rush to build businesses based on in-space resources that just weren’t available before.</p>
<p>Joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a> happening December 14-15 is <strong>Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners</strong>, who focuses largely on frontier technology and specifically on the commercialization of space, drones, autonomous vehicles and the future of agriculture and food technology.</p>
<p>Hatch brings a lot of expertise to the table. She studied aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan before earning her Master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics engineering from Stanford. She then continued on to Boeing, then SpaceX, where she worked with the government on integrating its payloads with the Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to hear from her at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a>. Grab your tickets to join us and save $100!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-commits-over-12b-first-emergency-connectivity-funding-wave">sent out the first checks from its Emergency Connectivity Fund</a>, an effort to help close the &#8220;homework gap&#8221; at schools by covering the cost of computers and internet services. Thousands of school districts, in every state plus D.C., Guam and Puerto Rico, will split this first $1.2 billion distribution, and there&#8217;s still <em>lots</em> more to come.</p>
<p>The problem they are looking to mitigate is the large number of students who, in an age when studying, homework and now even classes are all done online, lack a device or adequate internet connection to participate. This exacerbates an existing inequality, for these students often lack access to other resources and end up falling behind through no fault of their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/fcc-begins-rollout-of-10b-in-connectivity-aid-through-emergency-funds/">The ECF was conceived to combat this</a>, and funded earlier this year as part of the big pandemic recovery bill. It&#8217;s a $7 billion program in total, but the money is being distributed over time as schools and libraries make their formal requests, saying they need to cover the cost of this many tablets, or wireless hotspots, or broadband connections. The FCC seems to be picking up the bill as long as the request is reasonable and the paperwork is in order.</p>
<p>&#8220;From small rural libraries like the Sesser Public Library in Sesser, Illinois, to large school districts like Baltimore City Public Schools, this first wave of funding will provide more than 3 million connected devices for remote learning and will make a major dent in closing one of the cruelest parts of the digital divide,&#8221; said acting FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel in the news release.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not evenly divided, but distributed according to the applications received. The biggest state recipient is New York with $243 million ($192 million of which goes to NYC), followed by Texas with $97 million, and California with $71 million. Several states got far less (Wyoming and South Dakota took in less than $100,000 each), but this could very easily be a question of those districts just choosing to get their paperwork in for the second fund disbursement.</p>
<p>To that end, September 28 marks a new application period, for equipment and services used from this last July to next June — though the FCC noted it is still processing applications from the first batch, so if your district hasn&#8217;t heard back on that, don&#8217;t worry. And if they haven&#8217;t applied yet, best get started!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can check out the full recipient list, broken down by district and amount, in the spreadsheet linked <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-commits-over-12b-first-emergency-connectivity-funding-wave">here</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Starting in 2030, California will require all light-duty autonomous vehicles that operate in the state to emit zero emissions. Signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/23/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-9-23-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>SB 500</ins></a> represents the latest effort by the state to limit the sale of new internal combustion vehicles with an eye towards reducing greenhouse emissions. In 2020, Newsom signed an executive order that effectively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>banned the sale of new gasoline and diesel-powered</ins></a> vehicles by 2035. That same year, the state’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-push-for-zeroemissions-heavy-trucks-032143253.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><ins>Air Resources Board</ins></a> mandated that all new trucks sold in California emit zero emissions by 2045.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for California’s leadership in ensuring this will be the industry standard,” said Prashanthi Raman, head of global government affairs at Cruise, in a statement to Engadget. “The AV industry is primed to lead the way in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cities, and it’s why we’ve operated an all-electric, zero-emissions fleet from the start.” Cruise backed SB 500 through its involvement with the <a href="https://www.emissionzero.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>Emission Zero Coalition</ins></a>, a group that also includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuro-california-dmv-deployment-permit-214528906.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>autonomous delivery startup Nuro</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><ins>Environmental Protection Agency</ins></a>, the transportation sector has been the single largest source of greenhouse emissions in the US since 2019, with light-duty vehicles accounting for more than half of that output. However, autonomous cars currently represent only a tiny fraction of the nearly 15 million vehicles on California roads. Moreover, both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cruise-california-passengers-fully-driverless-rides-161005084.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1"><ins>Cruise</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-san-francisco-trusted-tester-170602490.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><ins>Waymo</ins></a>, two of the most prominent companies testing fully autonomous taxi services in the state, utilize fleets made almost exclusively of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-gm-ev-only-assembly-plant-detroit.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1"><ins>electric</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-19-google-waymo-chrysler-self-driving-minivan.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="1"><ins>hybrid</ins></a> vehicles. This latest move from California then is about preventing autonomous vehicles from becoming major polluters in the future, particularly if driverless taxi services become popular among commuters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Is it just us or has everyone’s calendar hit warp factor 9? We can’t believe there are only 34 days left before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=1weeklefttosave&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weeklefttosave&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> kicks into high gear on October 27. If you don’t have your pass yet, the clock on early-bird savings is winding down fast. Time to bump that quick task to the top of your to-do list, folks.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=1weeklefttosave&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weeklefttosave&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your early-bird pass</a> to TC Sessions SaaS 2021 — and save yourself $100 — before the price <strong>expires on October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Prepare for a full day focused on SaaS and its rapidly expanding ecosystem. We’re talking emerging trends, tips and advice that you can implement in your own startup — now, when you need it most — and world-class networking opportunities.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">the event agenda</a> and start strategizing your day. We’re still adding more presentations, breakouts and interviews with the industry’s top minds, makers and investors. Stay current — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#333d7903-8740-45ee-a389-8e0332035e57">sign up for updates here</a>.</p>
<p>Data is the lifeblood of, well, just about everything but especially SaaS. You’ll find plenty of discussions on how to use, wrangle and share an exponential deluge of information — without getting mired. Take a peek at these three data-driven panels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data, Data Everywhere:</strong> As companies struggle to manage and share increasingly large amounts of data, it’s no wonder that Databricks, whose primary product is a data lake, was valued at a whopping $28 billion for its most recent funding round. We’re going to talk to CEO Ali Ghodsi about why his startup is so hot and what comes next.</li>
<li><strong>Data Warehouse — The Foundation of the Modern Data Stack:</strong> The modern data stack is changing rapidly, with new technology emerging every day. Increasingly, though, architectures are being built around the data warehouse. In this panel discussion, Chandra Gangireddy (Allbirds), Ben Gotfredson (Snowflake), Adam Gross (formerly of Heroku) and Soumyadeb Mitra (RudderStack) will discuss why this new architecture has emerged, what specific technologies are driving the trend and what the data stack of the future looks like.</li>
<li><strong>How Startups are Turning Data into Software Gold:</strong> The era of big data is behind us. Today’s leading SaaS startups are working with data, instead of merely fighting to help customers collect information. We’ll talk with leaders from three data-focused startups: Jenn Knight (AgentSync), Barr Moses (Monte Carlo) and Dan Wright (DataRobot). They’ll discuss how they’re forging new markets to get insight on the way today’s SaaS companies leverage data to build new companies, attack new problems and, of course, scale like mad.</li>
</ul>

It may have a significantly longer flight time along with not just one, but two cameras, including a telephoto model and one with a larger Four Thirds sensor. If accurate, the Mavic 3 would be highly desirable for cinematographers and aerial photographers when it arrives, reportedly later this year.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A Four Thirds sensor would be a huge boon for aerial shooters, allowing for extra detail and a more cinematic look in general. Currently, shooting in that format requires a large, relatively expensive drone and in many cases, a separate camera like DJI&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1186060-REG/dji_x5l_camera_and_3_axis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="35" data-v9y="1">Zenmuse</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> line or </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-mirrorless-camera-lumix-bgh1-163525921.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="36" data-v9y="1">Panasonic&#8217;s BGH1</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. At the same time, a second telephoto camera would make it more versatile.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It will also offer direct USB-C charging so you don&#8217;t need to remove the battery. All of that will boost the weight a bit, up from 907g on the Mavic 2 Pro to 920g for the Mavic 3 Pro. Despite that bump from the extra camera and other new features, the Mavic 3 will be able to fly for 46 minutes, way up from the 31 minutes available on the Mavic 2.</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 will apparently come in two flavors, a Pro and a Cine model, with the latter offering a built-in SSD and a &#8220;1Gbps Lightspeed Data Cable&#8221; option for faster transfers. It will also offer a new version of DJI&#8217;s display-equipped Smart Controller allowing for video transmission over 15km, up from 10km on the Mavic 2 Pro.</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 Pro will cost $1,600, both sources say, which is the same price as the current Mavic 2 Pro. Prices for the Cine model are less clear, but could run around $1,000 more — still a relative deal for such a high tech camera drone. Both are expected to arrive on November 15th.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">boom in venture capital fundraising</a> that the technology startup market has enjoyed since the back half of 2020 has been eye-popping. Record sums have been disbursed around the world as more firms entered the fray to invest in startups, and the late-stage capital flowed like water.</p>
<p>But while the venture capital game seemed to turbocharge in recent quarters, there’s noise coming from the other side of the spectrum: bootstrapping.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Mailchimp’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">$12 billion exit to Intuit</a>, announced mere weeks ago, helped set a high-water mark for bootstrapping, proving that it is possible to build large, valuable technology companies both without huge venture capital investment and in locations outside traditional startup hubs. Mailchimp, based in Atlanta, is just one of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/atlantas-sundry-startups-join-in-global-vc-funding-boom/">host of startup companies building in the city</a>, The Exchange recently reported.</p>
<p>Today’s startups have more fundraising options than ever, providing a number of pathways to scale. These include services like Pipe, which allows startups to sell future revenues in a competitive marketplace, and the myriad venture-debt players that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/as-venture-capital-rebounds-whats-going-on-with-venture-debt/">TechCrunch has covered extensively</a>.</p>
<p>For startups busy funding their growth with revenue, there’s even more good news. Earlier this year, Calendly, another Atlanta-based company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">raised its first material external capital</a> &#8212; at a valuation of just over $3 billion, showing that bootstrapping early doesn’t mean that equity capital sources are closed forever. A number of other companies have followed suit in recent months.</p>
<p>We’re curious if a changing capital landscape, and a startup market made more viable for bootstrapping thanks to business concepts like product-led growth, will shake up the demographics of startup founders, perhaps making their ranks a bit more diverse. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping today</h2>
<p>Go back in time to the dot-com boom, and it was normal for startups to spend early capital on physical hardware. Servers weren’t something you could just call up Amazon and rent by the minute, which meant buying your own and paying co-location fees. That took capital.</p>
<p>And, as has been discussed ad nauseam, it was harder to build digital companies a few decades back. There weren’t infinite APIs for companies to hook into to solve complex technical issues, and there were both fewer folks trained to build new tools and fewer potential customers.</p>
<p>In today’s startup market, much technical risk has been settled, often lowering building costs for startups at the same time. The well-worn riff that it’s easier than ever to start a company today could be wed to the concept that it’s perhaps cheaper, too. That should bode well for bootstrapping.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union has warned it may take action over Russia&#8217;s involvement in &#8220;malicious cyber activities&#8221; against several EU member states.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Ghostwriter&#8221; campaign targeted “numerous members of Parliaments, government officials, politicians, and members of the press and civil society in the EU”, according to <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/09/24/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-on-respect-for-the-eu-s-democratic-processes/">a press release from the European Council</a> on Friday, and was carried out &#8220;by accessing computer systems and personal accounts and stealing data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement by the European executive, comprised of the bloc&#8217;s heads of state, said the EU was considering &#8220;taking further steps,&#8221; but did not elaborate what actions it would take.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s declaration is about strongly denouncing malicious cyber activities, designated as Ghostwriter that some member states have observed and associated with the Russian state,&#8221; Nabila Massrali, a spokesperson for the European Council, told TechCrunch. &#8220;These activities are unacceptable and all involved must put them to an end immediately. Such activities seek to threaten our integrity and security, democratic values and principles and attempt to undermine our democratic institutions and processes. We urge the Russian Federation to adhere to the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace.&#8221;</p>
<p>No specific incidents were mentioned in the press release. But the spokesperson added that the warning comes in light of the upcoming German elections on September 26.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Germany said the Russia-linked Ghostwriter campaign had been “combining conventional cyberattacks with disinformation and influence operations” in an attempt to spread disinformation before the upcoming election. At the time, the German government said it had &#8220;reliable information&#8221; that recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattacks/">cyberattacks</a> — which involved hackers use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> emails in an attempt to get hold of personal login details of federal and state lawmakers — could be attributed to actors in Russia, &#8220;specifically to the Russian military intelligence service GRU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ghostwriter has been ongoing since 2017, according to a 2020 report by FireEye, and has been involved in anti-NATO disinformation campaigns, cyber espionage and politically damaging hack-and-leak operations throughout Europe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a follow-up report released in April this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fireeye/">FireEye</a> linked the Ghostwriter campaign to UNC1151, a threat actor that is believed to be backed by the Kremlin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Since, Prevailion, a cybersecurity startup that specializes in compromise breach monitoring and cyber adversary intelligence, found that the infrastructure associated with UNC1151 is three-times larger than was was previously documented, and its malicious cyber activities are broader and more aggressive than was originally suspected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Karim Hijazi, chief executive of Prevailion, said earlier this month that UNC1151 is &#8220;positioned for a much wider operation, both in Europe and potentially beyond.&#8221;</p>

<p>A handful of foundational models are emerging that rely upon a magnitude of training data that makes them inherently powerful, but it’s not without risk of harmful biases — and we need to collectively acknowledge that fact.</p>
<p>Recognition in itself is easy. Understanding is much harder, as is mitigation against future risks. Which is to say that we must first take steps to ensure that we understand the roots of these biases in an effort to better understand the risks involved with developing AI models.</p>
<h2>The sneaky origins of bias</h2>
<p>Today’s AI models are often pre-trained and open source, which allows researchers and companies alike to implement AI quickly and tailor it to their specific needs.</p>
<p>While this approach makes AI more commercially available, there’s a real downside — namely, that a handful of models now underpin the majority of AI applications across industries and continents. These systems are burdened by undetected or unknown biases, meaning developers who adapt them for their applications are working from a fragile foundation.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">study</a> by Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundation Models, any biases within these foundational models or the data upon which they’re built are inherited by those using them, creating potential for amplification.</p>
<p>For example, YFCC100M is a publicly available data set from Flickr that is commonly used to train models. When you examine the images of people within this data set, you’ll see that the distribution of images around the world is <a href="http://projects.dfki.uni-kl.de/yfcc100m/browse?q=person&amp;adj=&amp;m=b">heavily skewed toward the U.S.</a>, meaning there’s a lack of representation of people from other regions and cultures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These types of skews in training data result in AI models that have under- or overrepresentation biases in their output — i.e., an output that is more dominant for white or Western cultures. When multiple data sets are combined to create large sets of training data, there is a lack of transparency, and it can become increasingly difficult to know if you have a balanced mix of people, regions and cultures. It’s no surprise that the resulting AI models are published with egregious biases contained therein.</p>
<p>Further, when foundational AI models are published, there is typically little to no information provided around their limitations. Uncovering potential issues is left to the end user to test — a step that is often overlooked. Without transparency and a complete understanding of a particular data set, it’s challenging to detect the limitations of an AI model, such as lower performance for women, children or developing nations.</p>
<p>At Getty Images, we evaluate whether bias is present in our computer vision models with a series of tests that include images of real, lived experiences, including people with varying levels of abilities, gender fluidity and health conditions. While we can’t catch all biases, we recognize the importance of visualizing an inclusive world and feel it’s important to understand the ones that may exist and confront them when we can.</p>
<h2>Leveraging metadata to mitigate biases</h2>
<p>So, how do we do this? When working with AI at Getty Images, we start by reviewing the breakdown of people across a training data set, including age, gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’re able to do this because we require a model release for the creative content that we license. This allows us to include self-identified information in our metadata (i.e., a set of data that describes other data), which enables our AI team to automatically search across millions of images and quickly identify skews in the data. Open source data sets are often limited by a lack of metadata, a problem that is exacerbated when combining data sets from multiple sources to create a larger pool.</p>
<p>But let’s be realistic: Not all AI teams have access to expansive metadata, and ours isn’t perfect either. An inherent tradeoff exists &#8212; larger training data that leads to more powerful models at the expense of understanding skews and biases in that data.</p>
<p>As an AI industry, it’s crucial that we find a way to overcome this tradeoff given that industries and people globally depend upon it. The key is increasing our focus on data-centric AI models, <a href="https://eval.how/dcai2021/index.html">a movement beginning to take stronger hold</a>.</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Confronting biases in AI is no small feat and will take collaboration across the tech industry in the coming years. However, there are precautionary steps that practitioners can take now to make small but notable changes.</p>
<p>For example, when foundational models are published, we could release the corresponding <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf">data sheet</a> describing the underlying training data, providing descriptive statistics of what is in the data set. Doing so would provide subsequent users with a sense of a model’s strengths and limitations, empowering them to make informed decisions. The impact could be huge.</p>
<p>The aforementioned <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">study</a> on foundational models poses the question, “What is the right set of statistics over the data to provide adequate documentation, without being too costly or difficult to obtain?” For visual data specifically, researchers would ideally provide the distributions of age, gender, race, religion, region, abilities, sexual orientation, health conditions and more. But, this metadata is costly and difficult to obtain on large data sets from multiple sources.</p>
<p>A complementary approach would be for AI developers to have access to a running list of known biases and common limitations for foundational models. This could include developing a database of easily accessible tests for biases that AI researchers could regularly contribute to, especially given how people use these models.</p>
<p>For example, Twitter recently facilitated a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/could-bug-bounties-help-find-biased-algorithms-this-competition-put-the-idea-to-the-test/">competition</a> that challenged AI experts to expose biases in their algorithms (Remember when I said that recognition and awareness are key toward mitigation?). We need more of this, everywhere. Practicing crowdsourcing like this on a regular basis could help reduce the burden on individual practitioners.</p>
<p>We don’t have all of the answers yet, but as an industry, we need to take a hard look at the data we are using as the solution to more powerful models. Doing so comes at a cost –- amplifying biases — and we need to accept the role we play within the solution. We need to look for ways to more deeply understand the training data we are using, especially when AI systems are used to represent or interact with real people.</p>
<p>This shift in thinking will help companies of all types and sizes quickly spot skews and counteract them in the development stage, dampening the biases.</p>

But there is a question [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. published its first-ever <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/">national AI strategy</a> this week. The decade-long commitment by the government to levelling up domestic artificial intelligence capabilities &#8212; by directing resource and attention toward skills, talent, compute power and data access &#8212; has been broadly welcomed by the country&#8217;s tech ecosystem, as you&#8217;d expect.</p>
<p>But there is a question mark over how serious government is about turning the U.K. into a &#8220;global AI superpower&#8221; given the lack of a funding announcement to accompany the publication.</p>
<p>A better hint is likely to come shortly, with the spending review tabled for October 27 &#8212; which will set out public spending plans for the next three years.</p>
<p>Ahead of that, TechCrunch spoke to Marc Warner, CEO of U.K. AI startup Faculty, who said government needs to show it&#8217;s serious about providing long-term support to develop the U.K.&#8217;s capabilities and global competitiveness with an appropriate level of funding &#8212; while welcoming the &#8220;genuine ambition&#8221; he believes the government is showing to support AI.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK announces a national strategy to &#8216;level up&#8217; AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/embed/#?secret=bXaPc09RiS" data-secret="bXaPc09RiS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Warner&#8217;s startup, which closed a $42 million growth round of funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/flush-with-42m-hot-ai-startup-faculty-plans-to-hoover-up-more-phds-and-steer-clear-of-politics/">earlier this year</a>, has started its own internal education program to attract PhDs into the company and turn out future data scientists. While Warner himself is also a member of the U.K.&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/ai-council">AI Council</a>, an expert advisory group that provides advice to government and which was consulted on the strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is a really pretty good strategy,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a genuine ambition in it which is relatively rare for government and they recognize some of the most important things that we need to fix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The problem &#8212; and it&#8217;s a huge problem &#8212; is that there are currently no numbers attached to this.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while in principle there&#8217;s lots of great stuff in there, in practice it&#8217;s totally critical that it&#8217;s actually backed by the funding that it needs &#8212; and has the commitment of the wider gov to the high-quality execution that doing some of these things are going to require.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warner warned of the risk of the promising potential of a &#8220;pretty serious strategy&#8221; fading away if it&#8217;s not matched with an appropriate &#8212; dare we say it, &#8220;world beating&#8221; &#8212; level of funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a question for the spending review but it seems to me very easy now that having done &#8212; what looks like a really pretty serious strategy &#8212; then&#8230; it fades into a much more generic strategy off the back of not really willing to make the funding commitments, not really willing to push through on the execution side and actually make these things happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked what level of funding he&#8217;d like to see government putting behind the strategy to deliver on its long-term ambitions, Warner said the U.K. needs to aim high &#8212; and do so on a global stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can look around the world and look at the commitments that other countries are making to their AI strategies which are in the hundred of millions to low billions,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;And if we are serious about being globally competitive &#8212; which the strategy is, and I think we should be &#8212; then we&#8217;re talking at least matching the funding of other countries, if not exceeding it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately it comes down to where does this rank in their priority list and if they want to deliver on an ambitious strategy it&#8217;s got to be high,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>Access to talent</h2>
<p>Discussing the broad detail of what the strategy says is needed for the U.K. to up its AI game, Warner highlighted talent as a key component.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a technical field like AI talent is a huge deal. There&#8217;s a global competition for that talent. And it seems like the government is taking that seriously and hopefully going to take actions to make sure the U.K. has all the talent it needs for this kind of stuff &#8212; from a skills perspective and training up people but also from a visa perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From our perspective it&#8217;s just wonderful to be able to access some of the most talented people from across the world to come and work on important problems and so the easier that it can be made for those people &#8212; or for organizations, whether it&#8217;s universities or charities or companies like us or even government departments to start to be able to hire those people it&#8217;s just a massive step forward,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice that they&#8217;re taking computing and data seriously,&#8221; he went on, discussing other elements of the strategy. &#8220;Obviously those are the two fuels for the set of techniques of machine learning that are sort of the foundation of modern AI. And having the government think about how we can make that more accessible is clearly a great thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the fact that they&#8217;re thinking about the long-term risks of AI is novel and basically important,&#8221; he also said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think they&#8217;re relatively honest that our adoption is weaker than we&#8217;d like, as a country, as a set of businesses. And hopefully recognizing that and thinking seriously about how we might go about fixing it &#8212; so, all in all, from a strategy perspective it&#8217;s actually very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strategy also talks about the need to establish “clear rules, applied ethical principles and a pro-innovation regulatory environment” for AI. But the U.K. is already lagging on that front &#8212; with the European Union proposing an AI Regulation earlier this year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/embed/#?secret=QAtzLkmb6h" data-secret="QAtzLkmb6h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Asked for his views on AI regulation Warner advocated for domain-specific rules.</p>
<h2>Domain specific AI rules</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think it would be a big mistake to regulate at the level of just artificial intelligence. Because that&#8217;s sort of equivalent to regulating steel where you don&#8217;t know whether the steel is going to be used in girders or in a knife or a gun,&#8221; he suggested. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Either you pick the kind of legislation that we have around girders and it becomes incredibly lax around the people who are using the steel to make guns or you pick the kind of legislation that we have around guns and it becomes almost impossible to make the girders.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while it&#8217;s totally critical that we regulate AI effectively that is almost certainly done in a domain-specific fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave the example of AIs used in health contexts, such as for diagnosis, as a domain that would naturally require tighter regulation &#8212; whereas a use-case like e-commerce would likely not need such guardrails, he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the government recognizes this in the strategy,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It does talk about making sure the regulation is really thoughtfully attuned to the domain. And that just seems very sensible to me.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think it&#8217;s extremely important that AI is done well and safely and for the benefit of society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s proposed risk-based framework for regulating applications of AI does have a focus on certain domains and use cases &#8212; which are classified as higher or lower risk, with regulatory requirements varying accordingly. But <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Warner said he hasn&#8217;t yet studied the EU proposal in enough detail to have a view on their approach.  </span></p>
<p>TechCrunch also asked the Faculty CEO for his views on the U.K. government&#8217;s simultaneous push to &#8220;reform&#8221; the current data protection framework &#8212; which includes consulting on changes that could weaken protections for people&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>Critics of the reform plan suggest it risks a race to the bottom on privacy standards.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;My view would be that it&#8217;s absolutely critical that uses of AI are both legal and legitimate,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;As in, if people knew what was being done with their data they would be completely comfortable with what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Data legitimacy</h2>
<p>Faculty&#8217;s AI business was in existence (albeit under a different name) before the U.K.&#8217;s version of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was transposed into national law &#8212; although the prior regime was broadly similar. So existing rules don&#8217;t appear to have harmed its prospects as a high value and growing U.K. AI business.</p>
<p>Given that, might the government&#8217;s appetite to reduce the level of data protection that U.K. citizens enjoy &#8212; with the claim that doing so would somehow be &#8220;good for innovation&#8221; &#8212; actually be rather counterproductive for AI businesses which need the trust of users to flourish? (Plus, of course, if any U.K. AI businesses want to do business in the European Union they would need to comply with the GDPR.)</p>
<p>&#8220;GDPR is not perfect,&#8221; argued Warner. &#8220;If you speak to anyone I think that&#8217;s widely recognized &#8212; so I don&#8217;t think that the way it&#8217;s being framed as a choice between one or other, I think we can do better than both and I think that&#8217;s what we should aim for.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there are lots of ways that we can &#8212; over time &#8212; be better at regulating these things. So that we maintain the absolute best in class for legitimacy around the use of these technologies which is obviously totally critical for companies like us that want to do business in a way that&#8217;s widely accepted and even encouraged in society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically I don&#8217;t think we should compromise but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a choice between just following GDPR or not. It&#8217;s more complicated than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting there have been a number of high-profile data scandals emanating from the U.K. in recent years.</p>
<p>And Faculty &#8212; in its pre-rebranding guise as <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/were-there-any-links-between-cambridge-analytica-russia-and-brexit-">ASI Data Science</a> &#8212; was intimately involved in controversial use of data for targeting ads at voters during the U.K.&#8217;s Brexit vote, for example.</p>
<p>Although it has since said it will never do political work again.</p>
<h2>Political campaigning</h2>
<p>ASI Data Science&#8217;s corporate rebranding followed revelations around the data-mining activities of the now defunct and disgraced data company, Cambridge Analytica &#8212; which broke into a global scandal in 2018, and led to parliamentarians around the world asking awkward questions about the role of data and predictive modelling to try to sway voters.</p>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s information commissioner even called for an &#8220;ethical pause&#8221; on the use of data and AI tools for political add targeting, warning that trust in democracy was being undermined by big data techniques opaquely targeting voters with custom political messaging.</p>
<p>During the Brexit referendum, Warner worked with the U.K. government&#8217;s former special advisor, Dominic Cummings, who was a director for the Vote Leave campaign. And Cummings has written extensively that data scientists played a crucial role in winning the Brexit vote &#8212; writing, for instance, in a <a href="https://dominiccummings.com/2016/10/29/on-the-referendum-20-the-campaign-physics-and-data-science-vote-leaves-voter-intention-collection-system-vics-now-available-for-all/">2016 blog post</a> on how data science and AI was used in the referendum, that:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of our central ideas was that the campaign had to do things in the field of data that have never been done before. This included a) integrating data from social media, online advertising, websites, apps, canvassing, direct mail, polls, online fundraising, activist feedback, and some new things we tried such as a new way to do polling&#8230; and b) having experts in physics and machine learning do proper data science in the way only they can – i.e. far beyond the normal skills applied in political campaigns. We were the first campaign in the UK to put almost all our money into digital communication then have it partly controlled by people whose normal work was subjects like quantum information (combined with political input from Paul Stephenson and Henry de Zoete, and digital specialists AIQ). We could only do this properly if we had proper canvassing software. We built it partly in-house and partly using an external engineer who we sat in our office for months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given this infamous episode in his company&#8217;s history, we asked Warner if he would be supportive of AI rules that limit how the technology can be used for political campaigning?</p>
<p>The U.K. government has not made such a proposal but it is eyeing changing in election law &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/uk-eyeing-disclosure-labels-for-online-political-campaigning/">disclosure labels</a> for online political campaigning.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Faculty as an organization is not interested in politics anymore &#8212; it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;re thinking about,&#8221; was Warner&#8217;s response on this. </span></p>
<p>Pushed again on whether he would support limits on AI in the political campaigning domain, he added: &#8220;From Faculty&#8217;s perspective we don&#8217;t do politics anymore. I think it&#8217;s up to the government what they think it&#8217;s best around that area.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Noops is going after the $50 billion snack foods market and plans to take on yogurt next.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two months after securing <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noops-is-flippin-snacks-with-brand-launch-and-closes-on-a-2-million-pre-seed-investment-round-301095789.html">$2 million in pre-seed funding</a>, plant-based pudding startup <a href="https://eatnoops.com/">Noops</a> is announcing an additional $2 million round led by Lerer Hippeau.</p>
<p>The Long Island-based company was founded in 2019 by Hungryroot co-founder Gregory Harry Struck after he adopted a plant-based diet while battling cancer.</p>
<p>“It was born out of a need when a lot of things were eliminated for me,” Struck told TechCrunch. “During this period of change, I thought about consumption and how it affects our well-being and health system.”</p>
<p>Struck recalls a time in the grocery store looking in the dairy case for yogurt, catching a glimpse of pudding and wondering why this product had never been reimagined, nutrition-wise. He went home, turned his house into a commercial kitchen and began experimenting with recipes, sometimes using his three young children as taste-testers.</p>
<p>When Struck found a recipe that worked, he started handing the pudding out to friends and family and ultimately started Noops. The company’s first product is an oat milk-based line that is organic, free of dairy and gluten, contains prebiotics, plant protein and fiber, and has no added sugar. The pudding comes in traditional flavors like chocolate, caramel, mocha and vanilla.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Immi takes in $3.8M to cook up plant-based instant ramen&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/immi-takes-in-3-8m-to-cook-up-plant-based-instant-ramen/embed/#?secret=fltHbpxlnM" data-secret="fltHbpxlnM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Joining Lerer Hippeau in the investment are Siddhi Capital, Idea Farm Ventures, Simple Food Ventures, Animal Capital and American Pie executive Alan Mitzner. The latest round gives the company a total of $5 million raised to date, Struck said.</p>
<p>“This, for us, is very significant in terms of having a partner like Lerer Hippeau believe in us that we can be the next-generation,” he added. “And for us, we know exactly where we are going and can see the future and be a part of it.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment Larry Appel, former CEO of The Fresh Market, and Benjamin McKean, CEO of Hungryroot, will join the company’s advisory board.</p>
<p>Andrea Hippeau, partner at Lerer Hippeau, agreed, saying that it was Struck himself, and his background, that led to the firm’s belief that he could make an impact on the plant-based food category and build a strong company. The plant-based foods market was valued at $29.4 billion in 2020, <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/economics/plant-based-market-skyrocket/">according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report</a>, and is poised to <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/plant-based-food-market-worth-74-billion-by-2027/">grow to $74 billion by 2027</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As investors in the space, Hippeau said the firm is looking at this category as “the next generation of consumables that will be hitting every category.” And, while the food type has reached a number of categories, like meat and seafood, there is not much in the space of pudding, nor have incumbents come out with better-for-you options, Hippeau said.</p>
<p>In fact, of the $348 billion in annual sales generated by the top 25 food and beverage incumbents in the U.S., some $50 billion of the sales can be attributable to snack brands, like Jell-O, which contain animal byproducts and have remained unchanged since launching in 1897, Struck said.</p>
<p>“Grocers are looking for the plant-based alternatives,” Hippeau said. “Noops is making a pudding with the same flavors people like and nutritional to take yogurt on head-on. Gregory and his team understood this and had those connections already established when they came to us.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will go to grow Noops’ distribution channels and network as it services retailers and direct-to-consumers, develop additional partnerships, make some key hires in finance and sales, bring on a second manufacturing partner as it aims to triple production and create more flavors and products, including a breakfast line that will develop a yogurt alternative.</p>
<p>Noops officially launched in Q1 of 2021 and is now available in more than 750 locations of retailers, including Sprouts Farmers Market and Wegmans Foods Markets. In addition, since its pre-launch in 2020, the company has doubled its projected numbers. It intends to launch in Fresh Thyme this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is working on a number of new devices including an Echo with a 15-inch wall-mounted display, a soundbar, new Echo Auto technology and wearables. Some may appear fairly soon at the company&#8217;s September 28th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fall-hardware-event-september-28-181440028.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">hardware event</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/amazon-working-on-large-wall-echo-sound-bar-and-new-auto-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report.</p>
<p>The splashiest-looking product would be an Alexa-enabled Echo with a display size around 15-inches. Codenamed Hoya, it could not only be placed on a stand like a regular Echo device, but mounted on a wall as well. It would serve as a smart-home center to control lights, cameras, locks and other devices, while showing weather, timers, appointments, photos and more. It&#8217;s specifically designed to work in the kitchen, displaying recipes and YouTube cooking videos, while letting you stream Netflix and other apps.</p>
<p>The company may also announce its own soundbar, codenamed Harmony, to accompany a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-branded-tv-us-051047163.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">rumored lineup</a> of Amazon-branded TVs. Unlike third-party Alexa-enabled soundbars, it would have a front-facing camera and support video calls from TVs, much like Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-facebook-portal-tv-review.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Portal TV</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s reportedly developing a new version of Echo Auto (codenamed Marion). The updated version will supposedly have a new design and allow for device charging via inductive technology. Amazon currently has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-alexa-built-in-120032156.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">partnership with Ford</a> to put Alexa in 700,000 vehicles, but it&#8217;s apparently looking to team up with other automakers, too.</p>
<p>Other items in the works include new Echo speakers for 2022 and wearables for kids and seniors (the latter with fall detection). It&#8217;s also reportedly building dedicated processors to improve artificial intelligence along with new technology to help its Fire TV, Echo and other devices work better together.</p>
<p>The company has some other, somewhat more unusual products in the works as well, according to the report. It has been working on a home robot codenamed Vesta that would use the Alexa interface and also an Alexa-powered karaoke microphone — though team working on that project was reportedly disbanded.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Avenue is building a command center for operations teams.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://avenue.so/">Avenue</a> launched Friday to give operations their own tools to monitor teams, and is building a “command center” for this area of business that is often forgotten, co-founder and CEO Justin Bleuel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In addition to the launch the company is announcing $4 million in seed funding, led by Accel, with participation from Flexport and a group of individual investors from companies like Coinbase, Uber, Stripe and Thumbtack.</p>
<p>Bleuel and his co-founder, Jeff Barg, grew up building iOS apps together and then went their separate ways, Bleuel to Uber and Barg to Amazon. While at Uber, Bleuel was working on observability — passive or proactive monitoring — building a lot of the tools in-house to monitor the marketplace for data like rider experience.</p>
<p>Both saw an opening to build these tools themselves for operations teams, and Avenue was born. The technology enables business teams to set up alerts to observe when there is a problem with data, act on it correctly and improve how the overall team functions, think “Datadog or PagerDuty for operations teams,” Bleuel said.</p>
<p>“Data is now all centralized in data warehouses, so you can build on top of them in a way you could not before, like Fivetran, and activate off of it,” he added. “You used to have to build one-to-one alerts for each tool, but now we can actively direct them from the warehouse.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207682" style="width: 1209px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207682" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207682 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png" alt="" width="1199" height="773" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png 1199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Avenue-Product.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207682" class="wp-caption-text">Avenue dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avenue</p></div></p>
<p>The company, founded in 2020, came out of the Y Combinator winter 2021 cohort, and one of its early customers is food pickup service Snackpass, which is using Avenue to monitor uptime and receive notifications when restaurant partners, for example, have an ordering tablet battery die or lose Wi-Fi. Snackpass is able to contact the location and help them figure out why they went offline. As a result, the company was able to cut the percentage of offline stores in half, Bleuel said.</p>
<p>Avenue’s customer sweet spot is marketplace companies or warehouses for monitoring stock. However, the co-founders are also seeing their technology being used by other companies, like furniture delivery companies, to monitor for reliability or know their inventory levels. Customers are also packaging up reports and sharing them with other internal teams on how to improve operations.</p>
<p>The company intends to use the funding to build on its small team of three, especially in engineering to be able to go to market with new products, Barg said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Avenue is working with more than 50 companies and since April has sent out over 200,000 alerts. The company’s model bills customers per alert per month, and the team is looking at a freemium model as well as enterprise levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amit Kumar, partner at Accel, said via email the firm is “very thesis-driven,” one of them being the modern data stack. Accel made early investments into companies like Airbyte, Monte Carlo and Privacer, and saw opportunity for new downstream applications based on the innovation, of which Avenue stood out.</p>
<p>The combination of Bleuel and Barg was “particularly compelling because of their fluency with the problem space” due to their backgrounds at Uber and Amazon and experiencing firsthand how “poorly served” operations teams are and how that can affect the overall business.</p>
<p>He believes the current approach of ops teams in the market today relies heavily on dashboarding, periodic sweeps and color-coded Excel sheets — a process that is “often inaccurate and disorganized.” At the same time, product engineers were flush with well-established tools around observability and incident response.</p>
<p>“Given the rise of &#8216;atoms&#8217; startups powered by a cohort of ex-Uber and ex-Amazon operators, Justin and Jeff were uniquely positioned to find early design partners and customers among their peer networks,” Kumar added. “As ops teams become both increasingly commonplace and essential to business outcomes, I expect their processes to mature and benefit from similar tooling. This is the thesis behind Avenue, and early traction indicates that next-gen leading ops-heavy companies agree.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s central bank said on Friday that all cryptocurrency-related transactions are illegal in the country and they must be banned, citing concerns around national security and &#8220;safety of people&#8217;s assets.&#8221; The world&#8217;s most populated nation also said that foreign exchanges are banned from providing services to users in the country.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, 10 Chinese government agencies vowed to work closely to maintain a &#8220;high pressure&#8221; crackdown on trading of cryptocurrencies in the nation. The People&#8217;s Bank of China separately ordered internet, financial and payment companies from facilitating cryptocurrency trading on their platforms.</p>
<p>The central bank said cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Tether, cannot be circulated in the market as they are not fiat currency. The surge in usage of cryptocurrencies has disrupted &#8220;economic and financial order,&#8221; and prompted a proliferation of &#8220;money laundering, illegal fund-raising, fraud, pyramid schemes and other illegal and criminal activities,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Offenders, the central bank warned, will be &#8220;investigated for criminal liability in accordance with the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinese government will &#8220;resolutely clamp down on virtual currency speculation, and related financial activities and misbehaviour in order to safeguard people&#8217;s properties and maintain economic, financial and social order,&#8221; the People&#8217;s Bank of China said in a statement.</p>
<p>The move has already started to cause panic among some crypto traders, sending the price of bitcoin and several other currencies down. Bitcoin was down 5.5% at the time of publication.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>China, home to some of the world&#8217;s largest crypto mining services, is also going after those businesses. The National Development and Reform Commission said it was launching a nationwide cleanup of cryptocurrency mining &#8212; a task it said was &#8220;imperative.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not the first time China has declared a crackdown on cryptocurrency-related activities, but until now so many government agencies had not collaborated on such efforts.</p>
<p>Regulators in China have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/china-considers-ban-crypto-mining/">weighing a ban on crypto mining</a> for several years. But in recent quarters, several local firms have started to embrace crypto. Chinese app maker Meitu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/china-meitu-crypto-investment/">bought Bitcoin and Ether worth $40 million</a> in March.</p>
<p>Some are optimistic. Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia Pacific business with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore, said in a tweet that, &#8220;China has banned crypto more times than one can count.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has launched Prime Video Channels in India, allowing its customers to subscribe to eight streaming services including Discovery+ and Mubi from one hub (Prime Video website or app), the latest in a series of efforts by the U.S. giant to win customers in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>The new offering makes it easier for users to log in and pay for additional streaming services, the company said. To make things more enticing, Amazon said the services are available at discounted prices for the first year. Discovery+ costs $4 per year, Mubi $27, Hoichoi $8.2, DocuBay $6.8, ErosNow $4, Lionsgate Play $9.5, manoramaMax $9.5 and ShortsTV $4.</p>
<p>The company, which is currently at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/amazon-starts-probe-over-bribe-to-govt-officials-by-its-lawyers-in-india-report-says/">centre of several controversies in India</a>, did not share how much of the revenue it is taking from the streaming services and the duration of the partnerships, which are not exclusive. India is the twelfth market where Amazon has launched Prime Video Channels.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KGv3MFsMnM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/">Amazon launches free video streaming service in India</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon launches free video streaming service in India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/embed/#?secret=KGv3MFsMnM" data-secret="KGv3MFsMnM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Friday’s launch is likely to prove more beneficial to the third-party streaming partners. All the partner services are currently struggling to make inroads in the country. Discovery+ app had fewer than 4 million monthly active users in India last month, for instance. Every other app had fewer than 1 million monthly active users; some didn&#8217;t even have 200,000, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (the data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch).</p>
<p>“With the launch of Prime Video Channels, we now take the next big step in our journey to entertain India by creating a video entertainment marketplace – first of its kind in India – which will not only delight our customers by giving them even more entertainment choices, but also benefit the OTT Channel partners who collaborate with us to leverage Prime Video’s distribution, reach and tech infrastructure,” said Gaurav Gandhi, country manager of Amazon Prime Video India, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Prime Video, which has amassed more than 55 million monthly active users in India, competes with Netflix, Disney’s Hotstar and Times Internet’s MX Player in the country. Both Hotstar and MX Player have established larger reach than Prime Video in India, and Netflix has courted most elite customers in the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The e-commerce group, on its part, has attempted to push for more reach by securing some rights to cricket matches &#8212; though the vast majority of those rights are still owned by Hotstar &#8212; and has also launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/">free, ad-supported streaming service</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups have spent the last decade trying to offer every variation of Airbnb that they can imagine. But <a href="https://www.stayukio.com/">Ukio</a> thinks it has found a way through the ever-growing tangle of housing rental competitors — and regulators — right as remote work becomes the norm.</p>
<p>It offers rentals of one month or longer, featuring a turnkey premium experience in prime city locations in partnership with local property owners. The initial results are promising.</p>
<p>The Barcelona, Spain-based company was founded early last year and has grown to more than 100 apartments between that city and Madrid while maintaining a 95% occupancy rate.</p>
<p>Today it is announcing a large-sized seed round of $9 million from top European investors, with plans to scale to more than 700 apartments across six continental capitals in 2022. Lisbon is the next city on the list, followed by London and Berlin.</p>
<p>Ukio&#8217;s guests so far are split nearly evenly between two use cases, according to co-founder and CEO Stanley Fourteau*. One half is composed of new long-term residents who have landed local jobs and will eventually move into permanent housing. So far, this group tends to stay six months or longer.</p>
<p>A longtime director at Airbnb, Fourteau says that the mainstreaming of remote and distributed work has also brought in a growing group of digital nomad types who are looking for something more than a short-term rental. This half of the user base tends to stay around two or three months, to date.</p>

<p>To indicate that market opportunity, he cited <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-22-gartner-forecasts-51-percent-of-global-knowledge-workers-will-be-remote-by-2021">Gartner report</a> showing the remote-worker demographic could grow to 31% of all workers by the end of this year. But TechCrunch readers might find that number a little conservative. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/">Proptech investors who I surveyed for Extra Crunch</a> in March, for example, described office space as being more of a luxury in the future, with more workers living wherever they wanted — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/the-return-of-neighborhood-retail-and-other-surprising-real-estate-trends/">places with fun &#8220;third spaces&#8221;</a> for entertainment and community, like what many European cities are known for.</p>
<p>Ukio, which is Japanese for “living in the moment,” is hardly the only startup aiming for this changing demographic. A few prominent ones from a long list of them include Blueground, Sonder, Sentinel and Zeus (plus Airbnb’s long-term rental options). So what’s different here?</p>
<p>“Ukio rents, furnishes and manages properties to oversee the entire guest experience,” Fourteau explains. “Our vertically integrated approach allows us to professionalize supply for platforms such as Airbnb (a peer-to-peer marketplace), similarly to how global hotel chains professionalize supply for Booking.com.”</p>
<p>The idea originated from his time at Airbnb, where user demand for long-term rentals never really fit with the company’s platform model. “The core focus of [that] company is in strengthening their relationships with and growing their host community,” he says. If Airbnb were to build a vertically integrated rental operator like Ukio, “it would compete with their existing community and could compromise its relationship with them.”</p>
<p>Today, he says, the most desirable long-term rentals in a city get taken before they get posted on Airbnb or are snatched up from the platform well before demand is met. Ukio-operated apartments, on the other hand, “will be a part of that community for many years to come.”</p>
<p>Ukio’s relationship with property owners is another way of creating a moat around key locations, he believes. “We engage in 7-10-year lease contracts with full tenant management. These agreements optimize their returns, avoiding vacancy rates and reducing management costs. Ukio provides them guaranteed yields and offers a hassle-free solution. As a business, we now receive more inbound requests from landlords wanting to work with Ukio than targeted outreach, with a strong supply pipeline for growth in the next year.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207914" style="width: 1646px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207914" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207914 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png" alt="" width="1636" height="1432" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png 1636w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=768,672 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=680,595 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=1536,1344 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207914" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ukio</p></div></p>
<p>Here’s a more granular look at what he sees providing the differentiation long term, paraphrased for brevity: Ukio uses a 200-point process to choose potential apartments and only works with the owners of the best ones in prime locations. Many of these are single units, which allow for more of a mix spread across a city than startups like Sentral that use entire buildings. Each unit also gets a unique design, versus the templated approach of Blueground and some others. While many competitors are primarily platforms with hosts providing and managing their own units, Ukio has an internal team to manage all properties. It’s also starting out with a focus on Europe, whereas many of its most direct competitors like Zeus are focused on the U.S.</p>
<p>On the tech side, in addition to the supply acquisition tool, it uses a dynamic pricing model to help keep occupancy high, and an internal design system and catalogue to reduce installation and onboarding costs. Ukio’s product-focused co-founder, Stanley&#8217;s brother Jeremy, has a decade of experience from key roles at Zynga, EA, Headspace and most recently Knotel.</p>
<p>As a company whose core product is physical, Ukio faces risks of tightening local regulations as well as COVID-related restrictions. Fourteau (Stanley) acknowledged the issues but argued that Ukio’s particular model is better suited to cope because it is getting such heavy usage from long-term locals. The bigger question in this phase seems to be Ukio’s various well-funded competitors, who will no doubt tweak their models repeatedly to attract the remote workers of the future.</p>
<p>And so, this need for rapid scaling is the context for the large-sized seed round. It was led by French venture firm Breega with participation from Heartcore and Partech, and angels including Iñaki Berenguer, founder of Coverwallet, and Avi Meir, founder of Travelperk.</p>
<p><em>* Disclosure: I went to college with Stan nearly 20 years ago, but we&#8217;d lost touch a decade ago before he sent me this news.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank is gaga for startups in Latin America. Since first announcing it was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-5-billion-latin-america-tech-fund.html">planting a stake</a> in the ground in the region in early 2019, the Japanese conglomerate has plugged more than $5 billion into the region, and it expects that number to top $8 billion by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>Its capital contributions are meaningful to say the least. In 2019, startups across Latin America raised $5.3 billion in funding, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">according to CB Insights</a>. In 2020, they raised roughly the same amount.</p>
<p>This year, the pace of deal-making has shifted into overdrive, with $9.3 billion being invested in Latin American startups in the first six months of the year. SoftBank Group CEO Marcelo Claure believes that by 2023, close to $30 billion will be invested in the region annually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, the world has realized that Latin America has size,&#8221; said Claure, a native of Bolivia, said this week at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. &#8220;It&#8217;s only half of China, but it&#8217;s two times the size of India, and three times the size of Southeast Asia.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also pointed to the fact that people in the region are making money. &#8220;Latin America has the same GDP per capita — $9,000 to $10,000 per year — as China, and that&#8217;s three times (GDP per capita) that of India and two times what people are making in Southeast Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>It&#8217;s a me, Burt Macklin! </em>Chris Pratt is voice acting as Mario in a feature film that Nintendo is working on with Illumination, the studio that made &#8220;Despicable Me.&#8221; Also, they didn&#8217;t tell us at Nintendo Direct who the new &#8220;Smash&#8221; fighter is. But we can&#8217;t be too disappointed, because apparently Anya Taylor-Joy is Peach, Jack Black is Bowser, Charlie Day is Luigi and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/seth-rogen-explains-how-houseplant-promotes-cannabis-without-breaking-the-rules/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">recent TechCrunch Disrupt guest</a> (shameless plug) Seth Rogen is Donkey Kong, giving me <a href="https://twitter.com/El_Silvero/status/1441168463892860932">the representation I always wanted</a> from Nintendo.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&#8217;ll have to wait until December 2022 to see whether that&#8217;s a flop or a hit, but other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">recent TechCrunch Disrupt guest</a> Ryan Reynolds absolutely killed it as the titular &#8220;Detective Pikachu&#8221; in 2019, so let&#8217;s go into this with an open mind.</p>

<p>But, in terms of exciting things, we won&#8217;t have to wait a long time for&#8230; Nintendo unveiled that for the first time since announcing its online subscription Nintendo Switch service in September 2018, it will add a new subscription tier. This tier, called the Nintendo Switch Online+ Expansion membership, will offer access to games from Nintendo 64 and SEGA, like &#8220;Super Mario 64,&#8221; &#8220;Mario Kart 64&#8221; (which you can play online with up to four players), &#8220;Yoshi&#8217;s Story,&#8221; &#8220;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&#8221; and &#8220;Castlevania: Bloodlines,&#8221; with more to be added over time. Nintendo didn&#8217;t say how much this will cost, but it will be available in late October.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 23, 2021. We just put the final bow on Disrupt, which went pretty damn well. Thanks to everyone who came out, and, of course, a big huzzah to the winner of Startup Battlefield (more below).</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/announcing-tc-sessions-saas-on-october-27/">next event is SaaS-focused</a>, so be sure to mark your calendars! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2021-is-cellino/">Cellino wins Disrupt Battlefield:</a> </strong>From an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/here-are-the-five-startup-battlefield-finalists-at-disrupt-2021">incredibly competitive group of finalists</a>, <a href="https://www.cellinobio.com/">Cellino</a> took home the top prize. The startup’s platform to automate stem cell production brings together lasers <em>and</em> AI, it turns out. Its vision impressed the judges during today’s final presentations, besting other strong competitors like Nth Cycle, which was the runner-up. Congrats, Cellino!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/"><strong>Twitter’s product team pounds Red Bull, moves deeper into crypto:</strong></a> The drumbeat of new products from Twitter continued today, with the company announcing “support for tipping with crypto, NFT authentication” and more. The social network has also moved into email newsletters and social audio in recent quarters. And, notably, it has managed the product deluge while not harming its core service &#8212; thus far, at least.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/duolingo-doesnt-want-to-disrupt-the-college-degree/"><strong>The limits of edtech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The CEO of Duolingo joined TechCrunch at Disrupt this year, sitting down with our own edtech expert <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a>. The two dug into the ethics of paywalling education content and how to make money without sacrificing core values.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>While Cellino won our yearly Battlefield competition, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/here-are-the-five-startup-battlefield-finalists-at-disrupt-2021/">joined in the finals</a> by four other startups that we found impressive:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adventr.io/"><strong>Adventr:</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/adventr-uses-patented-voice-control-tech-to-allow-anyone-to-create-interactive-videos/">Software to create interactive videos.</a></li>

<li><a href="https://tatum.io/"><strong>Tatum:</strong></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/tatum-lets-you-interact-with-blockchains-using-api-calls/">An API-hook for the larger crypto economy.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the rest of the startup news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/it-turns-out-fintech-is-worth-as-much-as-saas/"><strong>Fintech valuations are red-hot:</strong></a> Thanks to a few recent IPOs, the public market is making it clear that the value of fintech revenues at tech startups is greater than many expected. For startups, it’s good news.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/clubhouse-announces-wave-making-it-easier-to-start-casual-private-rooms/"><strong>Clubhouse kinda takes on Discord:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Clubhouse is best known for public chats. Discord is best known for private chats. So when Clubhouse released work on private rooms, we took note. The service has a new feature called “Wave” that “makes it easier to start private rooms with friends when you see that they’re online,” per TechCrunch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/ex-apple-designers-ultra-premium-audio-hardware-startup-raises-48-75-million-series-a/"><strong>Syng closes ​​$48.75M Series A for at-home spatial audio:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are content to listen to music with your laptop speakers, Syng is not for you. But if you are the sort of person who tinkers with the music setup of your home for max oomph, Syng’s “triphonic” hardware that wants to bring spatial audio to the home could be your jam.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/vyne-raises-15-5m-seed-round-to-grow-its-merchant-focused-open-banking-solutions/"><strong>Open-banking startup Vyne raises $15.5M:</strong></a> According to our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ingridlunden?lang=en">Ingrid Lunden</a>, the concept of open banking is enjoying a moment in the spotlight. Per my colleague, open banking is “a new approach to payments and other financial services that disrupts traditional card-based infrastructure by linking directly into banks,” and Vyne wants a piece of the action. Focused on merchants, the company just locked down eight figures of new capital for its vision.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/londons-jiffy-scoops-28m-for-speedy-grocery-delivery/"><strong>There’s infinite capital for grocery delivery startups:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Many grocery delivery companies in Europe are working to get deliveries done more quickly. Jiffy is one of them. Jiffy is also racing through its capital raises, putting $28 million on to its balance sheet after being founded this April.</li>
</ul>
<p>To close out our startup section, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/attack-of-the-200m-robotic-raises/">here’s the latest TechCrunch rundown of robotics news.</a></strong> Apple’s Foundation show comes out tomorrow, so this feels somewhat timely for the Asimov fans out there.</p>
<h2>Duolingo doesn’t want to disrupt the college degree</h2>
<p>Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn has appeared at TechCrunch Disrupt before, but this year was his first time representing a public company.</p>
<p>A few months ago, reporter Natasha Mascarenhas described Duolingo’s debut as the &#8220;bellwether edtech IPO of the year,&#8221; so she was well equipped with questions about the company&#8217;s plans for boosting revenue. For example, is premium content in the cards?</p>
<p>“If we wanted to make more money in the short term, we could probably start paywalling things, but I think that would stifle our growth,” said von Ahn.</p>
<p>“If we start charging for some aspects of language learning, eventually we’re just gonna charge for everything.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a recap, along with a video that captures the entire interview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The New York City Council passed bills today that will set minimum pay and improve working conditions for gig workers making deliveries for apps like Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats. More specifically, the bills allow delivery workers to use restaurant bathrooms, limit how far they can be asked to deliver, set minimum payments per trip and ensure that tips get to workers. This legislation is the<a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/work/2021/9/22/22687983/nyc-landmark-food-delivery-worker-pay-bathrooms"> first of its kind</a> in any major U.S. city, setting a precedent for how government intervention can influence the relationship between food delivery companies and their many, many thousands of contractors.</p>
<p>This package of bills was written <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps">with input</a> from <a href="https://losdeliveristasunidos.org/">Los Deliveristas Unidos</a> (LDU), a collective of mostly immigrant app delivery workers that was born out of the Workers Justice Project. The group has been protesting for better working conditions throughout the pandemic, and, in April, they publicly <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/4/23/22397398/los-deliveristas-unidos-backed-by-union">joined forces</a> with SEIU Local 32BJ, NYC&#8217;s largest union of service workers.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The bitter truth is that many food delivery workers can work 12 hours a day in the cold or rain for multiple food service apps and still not make enough to feed their own families,&#8221; the LDU website reads.</p>
<p>An LDU organizer <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db8zx/gig-workers-were-incentivized-to-deliver-food-during-nycs-deadly-flood">told VICE</a> that gig workers can be financially incentivized to work during rain and snow storms, so dangerous weather can be an opportunity to make more money. Earlier this month, as Hurricane Ida pummeled New York City and led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/nyregion/ida-new-york-city-deaths.html">13 deaths</a>, app delivery workers were still bringing people food, wading through feet of flooding to complete an order. DoorDash <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db8zx/gig-workers-were-incentivized-to-deliver-food-during-nycs-deadly-flood">suspended service</a> in Manhattan, and Grubhub suspended service in certain parts of New York City. But many gig workers continued to seek bonuses and incentives where they could, even if it meant putting themselves in physical danger.</p>

<p>The conditions of Hurricane Ida illuminated a truth that has been obvious for years: contractors for delivery apps struggle to make a living wage, which incentivizes them to put themselves in danger for extra cash. At the same time, companies like DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doordash-and-uber-eats-are-hot-theyre-still-not-making-money-11622194203">still aren&#8217;t making money</a>, even after doing more business than ever in the pandemic.</p>
<p>A report from the LDU surveyed more than 500 app-based couriers in NYC and found that, including tips, the average hourly net pay was <a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/6c0bc951-f473-4720-be3e-797bd8c26b8e/09142021CHARTSLos%20Deliveristas%20Unidos-v02.pdf">around $12.21</a>, which falls below New York City&#8217;s $15 minimum wage. On top of that, delivery workers are expected to pay for their own transportation, which in New York City, is often via e-bike. Delivery workers are also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/nyregion/delivery-workers-robberies-nyc.html">especially vulnerable</a> to theft. The report also found that 49% of respondents had been in an accident or crash while making a delivery, and 75% of those people said that they paid for medical care with their own funds. However, DoorDash told TechCrunch that Dashers in Manhattan earn $33 per hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize the unique challenges facing delivery workers in New York City and share the goal of identifying policies that will help Dashers and workers like them. This is why last year, we announced an industry-leading set of initiatives to improve Dasher safety, strengthen earnings, and expand access to restrooms. We will continue to work with all stakeholders, including the City Council, to identify ways to support all delivery workers in New York City without unintended consequences,&#8221; a DoorDash spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>DoorDash also indicated some concerns with the bills, saying that the bathroom access bill doesn&#8217;t actually require restaurants to allow bathroom access; instead, companies like DoorDash have to include provisions in their <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4927206&amp;GUID=4F2D9BC6-74D4-4A24-A889-85104C11881B&amp;Options=ID%7cText%7c&amp;Search=2298">contracts with restaurants</a> that require them to allow delivery workers to use their bathrooms.</p>

<p>Grubhub also expressed support for the bills. The company told TechCrunch in a statement: “These bills are common sense steps to support the delivery workers who work hard every day for New York’s restaurants and residents. Ensuring they receive a living wage and have access to restrooms isn’t just a good idea &#8212; it’s the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>Gig workers for other apps experience similar issues to app delivery couriers. Earlier this week, the Gig Workers Collective &#8212; which represents about 13,000 Instacart contractors &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/instacart-shopper-activist-group-asks-customers-to-delete-the-app-until-demands-for-better-conditions-are-met/?tpcc=ECTW2020">urged customers to delete the app</a> until Instacart meets five demands to increase pay and make conditions better for workers. Because workers for these apps are contractors, rather than employees, they have fewer protections, like the guarantee of earning a minimum hourly wage. Instacart has even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/instacart-ceo-apologizes-for-tipping-debacle/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=inshorts">subsidized workers&#8217; wages</a> with their tips in the past.</p>
<p>For about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/nyregion/nyc-food-delivery-workers.html">80,000</a> delivery workers in New York City, today&#8217;s legislation marks a positive change. But it remains unclear how or if tech companies will be held responsible for paying these minimum wages and guaranteeing that workers&#8217; needs are met.</p>
