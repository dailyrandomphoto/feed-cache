										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a growing number of companies interested in CRISPR&#8217;s potential to upend medicine. It’s probably safe to say there’s only one company interested in using the gene-editing system to create a living, breathing woolly mammoth. Or, at least, something pretty close to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the primary mission of a new company called Colossal. Co-founded by maverick geneticist </span><a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/team/core-faculty/george-church/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Church</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and entrepreneur Ben Lamm, the current CEO of Hypergiant, the company aims to bring one of those creatures back to life using CRISPR to edit the genomes of existing Asian elephants. In that sense the creature would be very similar to a woolly mammoth, but would be more like an elephant-mammoth hybrid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a project that Church’s lab has been invested in for years. But now, Church and Lamm have managed to sell investors on the idea that bringing back a mammoth is more than a science-fiction project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today Colossal announced its launch and a $15 million seed round led by </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/thomas-tull/?sh=69eeff657645"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas Tull</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former CEO of Legendary Entertainment (the company responsible for the likes of Dune, Jurassic World, the Dark Knight). The round includes investments from Breyer Capital, Draper Associates, Animal Capital, At One Ventures, Jazz Ventures, Jeff Wilke, Bold Capital, Global Space Ventures, Climate Capital, Winklevoss Capital, Liquid2 Ventures, Capital Factory, Tony Robbins and First Light Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These two are a powerhouse team who have the ability to completely shift our understanding of modern genetics while developing innovative technologies that not only help bring back lost species, but advance the entire industry,” Robbins tells TechCrunch. “I am proud to be an investor in their journey.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamm comes to Colossal as the founder of Hypergiant, a Texas-based A.I company. He has also built and sold three other companies:</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/conversable-chatbot-will-offer-allergy-info-along-with-a-side-of-wingstop-wings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Conversable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (acquired by LivePerson), </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/chaotic-moon-sells-to-accenture/?_ga=2.258284355.817522353.1631490695-1476558031.1622655185"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaotic Moon Studios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (acquired by Accenture) and Team Chaos (acquired by Zynga). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And big, provocative, projects are part of what Church is already famous for. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Church created the first direct genomic sequencing method in the 1980s, and went on to help initiate the Human genome project. Now, he leads synthetic biological efforts at the Wyss Institute, where he </span><a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/team/core-faculty/george-church/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has focused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on synthesizing entire genes and genomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While CRISPR gene editing has only just entered human trials, and typically aims to edit a single disease-causing gene, Church’s projects often think far bigger – often along the lines of speeding along evolution. In 2015, Church and colleagues edited </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18525"><span style="font-weight: 400;">62 genes in pig embryos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a record at the time), in an effort to create organs for human transplants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company spun out of that endeavor, eGenesis, is behind on Church’s initial timeline (he predicted pig organs would be viable transplants by 2019), but the company is performing </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/12/239014/crispr-pig-organs-are-being-implanted-in-monkeys-to-see-if-theyre-safe-for-humans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preclinical experiments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on monkeys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resurrecting a woolly mammoth has long been in Church’s crosshairs. </span><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2121503-can-we-grow-woolly-mammoths-in-the-lab-george-church-hopes-so/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his lab at Harvard University reported that they had managed to add 45 genes to the genome of an Asian elephant in an attempt to recreate the mammoth. Through a sponsored research agreement, this company will fully support the mammoth work at Church’s lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s pitch for bringing back the Mammoth, per the press release, is to combat the effects of climate change through ecosystem restoration. Lamm expands on that point: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is not to just bring back the Mammoth, that’s a feat in itself,” he says. &#8220;It’s for the successful re-wilding of mammoths. If you take that toolkit, you have all the tools are your disposal to prevent extinction or to bring back critically endangered species.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 1 million plant and animal species are </span><a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/biodiversity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened with extinction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Colossal’s mammoth project, should it succeed, would suggest they have developed the capacity to both repopulate recently dead creatures, and even perform what Lamm calls &#8220;genetic rescue&#8221; to stop them from disappearing in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genetic rescue is the process of increasing genetic diversity in an endangered population – this could be achieved through gene-editing, or in some cases, cloning new individuals to create a wider gene pool (provided the clone and the existing animals have different enough genes). There is already some evidence that this is possible. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 2021, a black footed ferret named </span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/elizabeth-ann-first-cloned-black-footed-ferret-180977065/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Ann</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> became the first cloned endangered species native to North America. She was cloned from the DNA housed in frozen tissue samples collected in 1988. </span></p>

This is a 3d render illustration</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bringing back extinct species might help combat a consequence of climate change, but it doesn’t solve the root problem. As long as the human- based drivers of climate change remain in-tact, there’s not much hope for a newly reborn creature that was killed by climate change the first time; in fact, fluctuating climates were </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21201-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one reason megafauna </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">died off in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, there could be serious </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1617138120300844?via%3Dihub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecosystem ramifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from re-wilding long-dead species, like spreading novel disease, displacing existing species, and altering the actual landscape (elephants are ecosystem engineers, after all). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If tackling biodiversity is part of Colossal’s core pitch, why go directly for the mammoth when there are species that might be saved right now? Lamm notes that the company may also try to edit the genomes of Asian elephants to make them more resilient, however, the mammoth project remains the company&#8217;s “north star.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument, from Lamm’s perspective, is that the mammoth project is a moonshot. Even if the company shoots for the moon and lands among the stars, they will have to develop proprietary technology for de-extinction that might then be licensed or sold to potential buyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very similar to the Apollo program – which was a literal moonshot. A bunch of technologies were created along the way. Things like GPS, the fundamentals of the internet, and semiconductors. All those were highly monetizable,” he says.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, the mammoth project is more like an incubator for developing a host of intellectual property. That might include projects like artificial wombs or other applications of CRISPR, Lamm notes. These products will still face massive scientific hurdles – existing artificial womb projects </span><a href="http://v"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t even near entering human trials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – but those hurdles might be slightly more achievable than living, breathing beings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that Colossal doesn’t have plenty of interim plans while that research is being done. The company is also out to create an especially memorable brand along the way.  Lamm says you could think of the brand as “Harvard meets MTV” says Lamm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there’s no company that Lamm says is a direct comparison to Colossal, he mentioned several large space brands and agencies like Blue Origin, SpaceX, and notably NASA in our conversation — “I think that NASA is the best brand the United States ever made,” he notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you look at SpaceX and Blue Origin and Virgin, my 91 year-old grandmother knew these guys went to space. ULA and other people have been launching rockets and putting satellites up there for decades – nobody cared. These companies did a great job of bringing the public in,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all a bit reminiscent of Elon Musk’s plan for </span><a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/space.2017.29009.emu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sending humans to Mars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although Starship (the vehicle that’s supposed to get us there) hasn’t moved beyond </span><a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-orbital-test-flight-readiness-musk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prototype test</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> flights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big ideas, says Lamm, draw in the public. The intellectual property developed along the way can pacify investors in the meantime. The perspective is inescapably sci-fi, but perhaps it’s supposed to be that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s not to say that the company isn’t absolutely dead-set on bringing a mammoth to life. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This capital, says Lamm, should be sufficient to help develop a viable mammoth embryo. They’re aiming to have the first set of calves born in the next four to six years. </span></p>

The new funding, which the two companies say is in the millions, comes just months after Oculii closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/oculii-looks-to-supercharge-radar-for-autonomy-with-55m-round-b/">$55 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>Oculii and GM have already been working together “for some time now,” CEO Steven Hong told TechCrunch in a recent interview. While he declined to specify exactly how GM plans to use Oculii’s software, it could be used to bolster the capabilities of the automaker&#8217;s hands-free advanced driver assistance system known as Super Cruise. Hong added that the company is also working with a few other OEMs, including one on the cap table.</p>
<p>“When a company like GM says, this is great technology and this is something that we potentially want to use down the line, it makes the entire supply chain take notice and effectively work more closely with you to adopt the solution, the technology, into what they&#8217;re selling to the OEMs,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup has no intention of building hardware. Instead, Oculii wants to license software to radar companies. The startup claims it can take low-cost, commercially available radar sensors – sensors that weren’t designed for autonomous driving, but rather for limited scenarios like emergency breaking or parking assist – and use its AI software to enable more autonomous maneuvering, Hong said.</p>
<p>“We really believe that the way to deliver something that&#8217;s scalable is through software, because software fundamentally improves with data,” he said. “Software fundamentally improves with better hardware in each generation that&#8217;s released. Software fundamentally over time gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper, much faster than hardware, for example.”</p>
<p>The news is certainly bullish for radar, a sensor that is generally used for assistive capabilities because of its imaging limitations. But if Oculii can actually improve the performance of radar, which tend to be much cheaper than lidar, it could mean massive cost savings for automakers.</p>
<p>Tesla, the largest electric vehicle maker by sales volume in the world, recently nixed radar sensors from its advanced driver assistance system, in favor of a “pure vision” approach that uses cameras and a supercomputer-powered neural network. Hong said that the radar Tesla eliminated was very low resolution, and “wasn&#8217;t really adding anything to their existing pipeline.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But he doesn’t think the company would always necessarily count out radar, should the technology improve. “Fundamentally, each of these sensors improves [the] safety case and gets you closer and closer to 99.99999% reliability. At the end of the day, that&#8217;s the most important thing, is getting as many nines of reliability as you can.”</p>

		Co-founder of Axis Communications, Martin Gren is an entrepreneur and inventor of the first network camera.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When Axis Communications released the first internet protocol (IP) camera after the 1996 Olympic games in Atlanta, there was some initial confusion. Connected cameras weren’t something the market had been clamoring for, and many experts questioned whether they were even necessary.</p>
<p>Today, of course, traditional analog cameras have been almost completely phased out as organizations have recognized the tremendous advantage that IoT devices can offer, but that technology felt like a tremendous risk during those early days.</p>
<p>To say that things have changed since then would be a dramatic understatement. The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) represents one of the ways physical security has evolved. Connected devices have become the norm, opening up exciting new possibilities that go far beyond recorded video. Further developments, such as the improvement and widespread acceptance of the IP camera, have helped power additional breakthroughs including improved analytics, increased processing power, and the growth of open-architecture technology. On the 25th anniversary of the initial launch of the IP camera, it is worth reflecting on how far the industry has come — and where it is likely to go from here.</p>
<h2>Tech improvements herald the rise of IP cameras</h2>
<p>Comparing today’s IP cameras to those available in 1996 is almost laughable. While they were certainly groundbreaking at the time, those early cameras could record just one frame every 17 seconds — quite a change from what cameras can do today.</p>
<p>But despite this drawback, those on the cutting edge of physical security understood what a monumental breakthrough the IP camera could represent. After all, creating a network of cameras would enable more effective remote monitoring, which — if the technology could scale — would enable them to deploy much larger systems, tying together disparate groups of cameras. Early applications might include watching oil fields, airport landing strips or remote cell phone towers. Better still, the technology had the potential to usher in an entirely new world of analytics capabilities.</p>
<p>Of course, better chipsets were needed to make that endless potential a reality. Groundbreaking or not, the limited frame rate of the early cameras was never going to be effective enough to drive widespread adoption of traditional surveillance applications. Solving this problem required a significant investment of resources, but before long these improved chipsets brought IP cameras from one frame every 17 seconds to 30 frames per second. Poor frame rate could no longer be listed as a justification for shunning IP cameras in favor of their analog cousins, and developers could begin to explore the devices’ analytics potential.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important technological leap was the introduction of embedded Linux, which made IP cameras more practical from a developer point of view. During the 1990s, most devices used proprietary operating systems, which made them difficult to develop for.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even within the companies themselves, proprietary systems meant that developers had to be trained on a specific technology, costing companies both time and money. There were a few attempts at standardization within the industry, such as the Wind River operating system, but these ultimately failed. They were too small, with limited resources behind them — and besides, a better solution already existed: Linux.</p>
<p>Linux offered a wide range of benefits, not the least of which was the ability to collaborate with other developers in the open source community. This was a road that ran two ways. Because most IP cameras lacked the hard disk necessary to run Linux, hardware known as JFFS was developed that would allow a device to use a Flash memory chip as a hard disk. That technology was contributed to the open source community, and while it is currently on its third iteration, it remains in widespread use today.</p>
<p>Compression technology represented a similar challenge, with the more prominent data compression models in the late ’90s and early 2000s poorly suited for video. At the time, video storage involved individual frames being stored one-by-one — a data storage nightmare. Fortunately, the H.264 compression format, which was designed with video in mind, became much more commonplace in 2009.</p>
<p>By the end of that year, more than 90% of IP cameras and most video management systems used the H.264 compression format. It is important to note that improvements in compression capabilities have also enabled manufacturers to improve their video resolution as well. Before the new compression format, video resolution had not changed since the ’60s with NTSC/PAL. Today, most cameras are capable of recording in high definition (HD).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1996</strong>: First IP camera is released.<br />
<strong>2001</strong>: Edge-based analytics with video motion detection arrive.<br />
<strong>2006</strong>: First downloadable, edge-based analytics become available.<br />
<strong>2009</strong>: Full HD becomes the standard video resolution; H.264 compression goes mainstream.<br />
<strong>2015</strong>: Smart compression revolutionizes video storage.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The growth of analytics</h2>
<p>Analytics is not exactly a “new” technology — customers requested various analytics capabilities even in the early days of the IP camera — but it is one that has seen dramatic improvement. Although it might seem quaint by today’s high standards, video motion detection was one of the earliest analytics loaded onto IP cameras.</p>
<p>Customers needed a way to detect movement within certain parameters to avoid having a tree swaying in the wind, or a squirrel running by, trigger a false alarm. Further refinement of this type of detection and recognition technology has helped automate many aspects of physical security, triggering alerts when potentially suspicious activity is detected and ensuring that it is brought to human attention. By taking human fallibility out of the equation, analytics has turned video surveillance from a reactive tool to a proactive one.</p>
<p>Reliable motion detection remains one of the most widely used analytics, and while false alarms can never be entirely eliminated, modern improvements have made it a reliable way to detect potential intruders. Object detection is also growing in popularity and is increasingly capable of classifying cars, people, animals and other objects.</p>
<p>License plate recognition is popular in many countries (though less so in the United States), not just for identifying vehicles involved in criminal activity, but for uses as simple as parking recognition. Details like car model, shirt color or license plate number are easy for the human eye to miss or fail to notice — but thanks to modern analytics, that data is cataloged and stored for easy reference. The advent of technology like deep learning, which features better pattern recognition and object classification through improved labeling and categorization, will drive further advancements in this area of analytics.</p>
<p>The rise of analytics also helps highlight why the security industry has embraced open-architecture technology. Simply put, it is impossible for a single manufacturer to keep up with every application that its customers might need. By using open-architecture technology, they can empower those customers to seek out the solutions that are right for them, without the need to specifically tailor the device for certain use cases. Hospitals might look to add audio analytics to detect signs of patient distress; retail stores might focus on people counting or theft detection; law enforcement might focus on gunshot detection — with all of these applications housed within the same device model.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the COVID-19 pandemic drove interesting new uses for both physical security devices and analytics — though some applications, such as using thermal cameras for fever measurement, proved difficult to implement with a high degree of accuracy. Within the healthcare industry, camera usage increased significantly — something that is unlikely to change. Hospitals have seen the benefit of cameras within patient rooms, with video and intercom technology enabling healthcare professionals to monitor and communicate with patients while maintaining a secure environment.</p>
<p>Even simple analytics like cross-line detection can generate an alert if a patient who is a fall risk attempts to leave a designated area, potentially reducing accidents and overall liability. The fact that analytics like this bear only a passing mention today highlights how far physical security has come since the early days of the IP camera.</p>
<h2>Looking to the future of security</h2>
<p>That said, an examination of today’s trends can provide a glimpse into what the future might hold for the security industry. For instance, video resolution will certainly continue to improve.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the standard resolution for video surveillance was 720p (1 megapixel), and 10 years before that it was the analog NTSC/PAL resolution of 572&#215;488, or 0.3 megapixels. Today, the standard resolution is 1080p (2 megapixels), and a healthy application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s law</a> indicates that 10 years from now it will be 4K (8 megapixels).</p>
<p>As ever, the amount of storage that higher-resolution video generates is the limiting factor, and the development of smart storage technologies such as Zipstream has helped tremendously in recent years. We will likely see further improvements in smart storage and video compression that will help make higher-resolution video possible.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity will also be a growing concern for both manufacturers and end users.</p>
<p>Recently, one of Sweden’s largest retailers was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57707530">shut down for a week</a> because of a hack, and others will meet the same fate if they continue to use poorly secured devices. Any piece of software can contain a bug, but only developers and manufacturers committed to identifying and fixing these potential vulnerabilities can be considered reliable partners. Governments across the globe will likely pass new regulations mandating cybersecurity improvements, with California’s <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/iot-manufacturers-what-you-need-to-know-about-california-s-iot-law">recent IoT protection law</a> serving as an early indicator of what the industry can expect.</p>
<p>Finally, ethical behavior will continue to become more important. A growing number of companies have begun foregrounding their ethics policies, issuing guidelines for how they expect technology like facial recognition to be used — not abused.</p>
<p>While new regulations are coming, it’s important to remember that regulation always lags behind, and companies that wish to have a positive reputation will need to adhere to their own ethical guidelines. More and more consumers now list ethical considerations among their major concerns—especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic—and today’s businesses will need to strongly consider how to broadcast and enforce responsible product use.</p>
<h2>Change is always around the corner</h2>
<p>Physical security has come a long way since the IP camera was introduced, but it is important to remember that these changes, while significant, took place over more than two decades. Changes take time — often more time than you might think. Still, it is impossible to compare where the industry stands today to where it stood 25 years ago without being impressed. The technology has evolved, end users’ needs have shifted, and even the major players in the industry have come and gone according to their ability to keep up with the times.</p>
<p>Change is inevitable, but careful observation of today’s trends and how they fit into today’s evolving security needs can help today’s developers and device manufacturers understand how to position themselves for the future. The pandemic highlighted the fact that today’s security devices can provide added value in ways that no one would have predicted just a few short years ago, further underscoring the importance of open communication, reliable customer support and ethical behavior.</p>
<p>As we move into the future, organizations that continue to prioritize these core values will be among the most successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fortnite maker Epic Games is appealing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">last week&#8217;s ruling in its court battle</a> with Apple, where a federal judge said Apple would no longer be allowed to block developers from adding links to alternative payment mechanisms, but stopped short of dubbing Apple a monopolist. The latter would have allowed Epic Games to argue for alternative means of serving its iOS user base, including perhaps, through third-party app stores or even sideloading capabilities built into Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system, similar to those on Google&#8217;s Android OS.</p>
<p>Apple immediately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">declared</a> the court battle a victory, as the judge had agreed with its position that the company was &#8220;not in violation of antitrust law&#8221; and had also deemed Apple&#8217;s success in the app and gaming ecosystem as &#8220;not illegal.&#8221; Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, said the ruling was not a win for either developers or consumers. On Twitter, he hinted that the company may appeal the decision <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370884994928641">when he said</a>, &#8220;We will fight on.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a court filing published on Sunday (see below), Epic Games officially stated its attention to appeal U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers&#8217; final judgment and &#8220;all orders leading to or producing that judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the judge&#8217;s decision, Epic Games had been ordered to pay Apple the 30% of the $12 million it earned when it introduced its alternative payment system in Fortnite on iOS, which was then in breach of its legal contract with Apple.</p>
<p>The appellate court will revisit how Judge Gonzalez Rogers defined the market where Epic Games had argued Apple was acting as a monopolist. Contrary to both parties&#8217; wishes, Gonzalez Rogers defined it as the market for &#8220;digital mobile gaming transactions&#8221; specifically. Though an appeal may or may not see the court shifting its opinion in Epic Games&#8217; favor, a new ruling could potentially help to clarify the vague language used in the injunction to describe how Apple must now accommodate developers who want to point their customers to other payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>So far, the expectation floating around the developer community is that Apple will simply extend the &#8220;reader app&#8221; category exception to all non-reader apps (apps that provide access to purchased content). Apple recently settled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">with a Japanese regulator</a> by agreeing to allow reader apps to point users to their own website where users could sign up and manage their accounts, which could include customers paying for subscriptions &#8212; like Netflix or Spotify subscriptions, for instance. Apple said this change would be global.</p>
<p>In briefings with reporters, Apple said the details of the injunction issued with the Epic Games ruling, however, would still need to be worked out. Given the recency of the decision, the company has not yet communicated with developers on how this change will impact them directly nor has it updated its App Store guidelines with new language.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reached for comment, Epic Games said it does not have any further statements on its decision to appeal at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BitSight, a startup that assesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/bitsight-a-provider-of-security-ratings-raises-60m-at-a-valuation-of-around-600m/">the likelihood that an organization will be breached</a>, has received a $250 million investment from credit rating giant Moody’s, and acquired Israeli cyber risk assessment startup VisibleRisk for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>Boston-based BitSight says the investment from Moody’s, which has long warned that cyber risk can <a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/moodys-threat-of-cyber-risk-is-of-growing-importance-to--pr_339656">impact credit ratings</a>, will enable it to create a cybersecurity risk platform, while the credit ratings giant said it plans to make use of BitSight’s cyber risk data and research across its integrated risk assessment product offerings.</p>
<p>The investment values BitSight at $2.4 billion and makes Moody’s the largest shareholder in the company.</p>
<p>“Creating transparency and enabling trust is at the core of Moody’s mission,” Moody’s president and CEO Rob Fauber said in a statement. “BitSight is the leader in the cybersecurity ratings space, and together we will help market participants across disciplines better understand, measure, and manage their cyber risks and translate that to the risk of cyber loss.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BitSight&#8217;s purchase of VisibleRisk, a cyber risk ratings joint venture created by Moody’s and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/israels-team8-raises-104m-to-make-bigger-cybersecurity-bets/">Team8</a>, brings in-depth cyber risk assessment capabilities to BitSight&#8217;s platform, enabling the startup to better analyze and calculate an organization’s financial exposure to cyber risk. VisibleRisk, which has raised $25 million to date, says its so-called “cyber ratings” are based on cyber risk quantification, which allows companies to benchmark their cyber risk against those of their peers, and to better understand and manage the impact of cyber threats to their businesses.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bitsight">BitSight</a> will also create a risk solutions division focused on delivering a suite of critical solutions and analytics serving stakeholders including chief risk officers, C-suite executives, and boards of directors. This division will be led by VisibleRisk co-founder and CEO Derek Vadala, who previously headed up Moody&#8217;s cyber risk group.</p>
<p>Steve Harvey, president and CEO of BitSight, said the company&#8217;s partnership with Moody’s and its acquisition of VisibleRisk will expand its reach to &#8220;help customers manage cyber risk in an increasingly digital world.”</p>
<p>BitSight was founded in 2011 and has raised a total of $155 million in outside funding, most recently closing a $60 million Series D round led by Warburg Pincus. The startup has just shy of 500 employees and more than 2,300 global customers, including government agencies, insurers and asset managers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[It appears that Freshworks is pretty reasonably priced in its current range.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two major private tech companies announced IPO price ranges this morning, with Toast targeting a market value of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/toast-looks-toward-18b-valuation-in-upcoming-ipo/">nearly $18 billion</a> at the top end of its range and Freshworks <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001544522/000162828021018417/freshworkss-1a1.htm">looking to price</a> its equity between $28 and $32 per share. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">calculates</a> that the company would be worth around $8.9 billion at $32 per share, not employing a fully diluted share count.</p>
<p>Inclusive of shares represented by fully vested options and the like, Freshworks&#8217; valuation could reach $9.6 billion, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/86012/Customer-support-software-company-Freshworks-sets-terms-for-$855-million-IP">Renaissance Capital reports</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Toast, with a revenue mix including four distinct products, Freshworks is a more straightforward software company. That means we can do much more interesting work to understand its valuation. So, this morning, let&#8217;s unpack how Freshworks is considering valuing itself in its IPO at its present range, look at some market comps and come to a conclusion regarding whether we expect the unicorn to raise its valuation before it floats.</p>
<h2>Lies, damned lies and revenue multiples</h2>
<p>As a refresher, in the first half of 2021 (Q1 and Q2), Freshworks posted revenues of $168.9 million. That annualizes to $337.9 million, thanks to numerical rounding.</p>
<p>At a valuation of $9.6 billion &#8212; recall that simple IPO valuations for the company and lower share-price points from its IPO range generate <em>lower</em> valuations and therefore more <em>conservative</em> multiples than what we&#8217;ll be discussing here &#8212; Freshworks would be worth 28.4x its current revenue run rate, set during H1 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year at this time, SpotOn was on the brink of announcing a $60 million Series C funding round at a $625 million valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward to almost exactly one year later, and a lot has changed for the payments and software startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, SpotOn said it has closed on $300 million in Series E financing that values the company at $3.15 billion &#8212; more than 5x of its valuation at the time of its Series C round, and significantly higher than its $1.875 billion valuation in May (yes, just three and a half months ago) when it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/spoton-raises-125m-in-a16z-led-series-d-triples-valuation-to-1-75b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $125 million in a Series D funding event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led both the Series D and E rounds for the company, which says it has seen 100% growth year over year and a tripling in revenue over the past 18 months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investors DST Global, 01 Advisors, Dragoneer Investment Group, Franklin</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Templeton and Mubadala Investment Company too doubled down on their investments in SpotOn, joining new backers Wellington Management and Coatue</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Management. Advisors Douglas Merritt, CEO of Splunk, and Mike Scarpelli, CFO of Snowflake, also made individual</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">investments as angels. With the new capital, SpotOn has raised $628 million since its inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest investment is being used to finance the acquisition of another company in the space &#8212; Appetize, a digital and mobile commerce payments platform for enterprises such as sports and entertainment venues, theme parks and zoos. SpotOn is paying $415 million in cash and stock for the Los Angeles-based company.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 key areas SaaS startups must address to scale infrastructure for the enterprise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/4-key-areas-saas-startups-must-address-to-scale-infrastructure-for-the-enterprise/embed/#?secret=PGP8FDOipg" data-secret="PGP8FDOipg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2017 inception, SpotOn has been focused on providing software and payments technology to SMBs with an emphasis on restaurants and retail businesses. The acquisition of Appetize extends SpotOn’s reach to the enterprise space in a major way. Appetize will go to market as SpotOn and will work to grow its client base, which already includes an impressive list of companies and organizations including Live Nation, LSU, Dodger Stadium and Urban Air. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Appetize currently covers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">65% of all major league sports stadiums, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specializing in contactless payments, mobile ordering and menu management. So for example, when you’re ordering food at a game or concert, Appetize’s technology makes it easier to pay in a variety of contactless ways through point of sale (POS) devices, self-service kiosks, handheld devices, online ordering, mobile web and API integrations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpotOn is taking on the likes of Square in the payments space. But the company says its offering extends beyond traditional payment processing and point-of-sale software. Its platform aims to give SMBs the ability to run their businesses “from building a brand to taking payments and everything in between.” SpotOn’s goal is to be a “one-stop shop” by incorporating tools that include things such as custom website development, scheduling software, marketing, appointment scheduling, review management, analytics and digital loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combined company will have 1,600 employees &#8212; 1,300 from SpotOn and 300 from Appetize. SpotOn will now have over 500 employees on its product and technology team, according to co-founder and co-CEO Zach Hyman. It will also have clients in the tens of thousands, a number that SpotOn says is growing by “thousands more every month.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition is not the first for SpotOn, which also acquired </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeatNinja last year and Emagine in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in Appetize it saw a company that was complementary both in its go-to-market and tech stacks, and a “natural fit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;SMEs are going to benefit from the scalable tech that can grow with them, including things like kiosks and offline modes, and for the enterprise clients of Appetize, they&#8217;re going to be able to leverage products like sophisticated loyalty programs and extended marketing capabilities,” Hyman told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpotOn was not necessarily planning to raise another round so soon, Hyman added, but the opportunity came up to acquire Appetize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We spent a lot of time together, and it was too compelling to pass up,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Appetize &#8212; which has raised over $77 million over its lifetime, according to </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/appetize/company_financials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; too saw the combination as a logical one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was important to us to retain a stake in the business. We were not looking to cash out,” said Appetize CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Max Roper. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are deeply invested in growing the business together. It&#8217;s a big win for our team and our clients over the long term. This is a rocketship that we are excited to be on.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic only emphasized the need for more digital offerings from small businesses to enterprises alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There has been a high demand for our services and now as businesses are faced with a Covid resurgence, no one is closing down,” Hyman said. “So they see a responsibility to install the necessary technology to properly run their business.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the moves SpotOn has made, for example, is launching a vaccination alert system in its reservation management software platform to make it easier for consumers to confirm they are vaccinated for cities and states that have those requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, a16z </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Partner David George too was bullish on the idea of a combined company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told TechCrunch that the two companies fit together “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely nicely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It felt like a no-brainer for us to want to lead the round, and continue to support them,” George said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since first investing in SpotOn in May, the startup’s growth has “exceeded” a16z’s expectations, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When companies are growing as fast as it is organically, they don’t need to rely on acquisitions to fuel growth,” he said. “But the strategic rationale here is so strong, that the acquisition will only turbocharge what is already high growth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Series E capital is primarily funding the acquisition, SpotOn continues to double down on its product and technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is our time to shine and invest in the future with forward thinking technology,” Hyman told TechCrunch. “We’re thinking about things like how are consumers going to be ordering their beer at a Dodgers game in three years? Are they going to be standing in line for 25 minutes or are they going to be interacting and buying merchandise in other unique ways? Those are the things we’re looking to solve for.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This summer, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">launched</a> its live audio app and Clubhouse rival, Spotify Greenroom, with the promises of more programming to come in the months ahead to augment its then primarily user-generated live content. Today, the company is making good on that earlier commitment, with the launch of six new shows on Spotify Greenroom focused on pop culture and music, in addition to what Spotify calls &#8220;playlist-inspired shows&#8221; &#8212; meaning those that are inspired by Spotify&#8217;s own playlists.</p>
<p>This includes a new show based on the popular playlist Lorem, which launched in 2019, showcasing an eclectic mix of music that has included indie pop, R&amp;B, garage rock, hip-hop, and more, <a href="https://www.oswegonian.com/2020/03/12/spotify-drops-new-playlist-lorem-tailor-made-for-generation-z/">focused on a younger, Gen Z audience</a>. That playlist today has over 884,000 &#8220;likes&#8221; on Spotify and has <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/11/spotify-lorem-playlist-interview">risen to become</a> one of the places new artists are able to break through on the platform. Now, Lorem listeners will be connected to &#8220;Lorem Life,&#8221; a Spotify Greenroom show that will feature a mix of culture and discussions about music, the environment, sustainability, fashion, and space, Spotify says. The show is hosted by Gen Z influencers and TikTok stars, Dev Lemons and Max Motley, who will engage with other artists and influencers. It begins airing on Wednesday, September 15, at 9 PM ET.</p>
<p>Another new &#8220;playlist-inspired&#8221; show is &#8220;The Get Up LIVE.&#8221; If the name sounds familiar, it&#8217;s because &#8220;The Get Up&#8221; was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/spotify-takes-on-radio-with-its-own-daily-morning-show/">introduced last fall</a> as Spotify&#8217;s own take on a daily morning show by mixing music with talk radio-style content led by hosts who discuss the news, pop culture, entertainment, and other topics. To date, that content has not been provided as a live program, however. Instead, the show has been pre-recorded then made available as a playlist that gives listeners the feel of a daily FM radio show. Now, &#8220;The Get Up&#8217;s&#8221; co-hosts Kat Lazo and Xavier “X” Jernigan will record their show live on Greenroom, starting on Wednesday, Sept. 15 at 11 AM ET.</p>
<p>This odd time seems to contradict Spotify&#8217;s original intention of providing a show for those who commute to the office. But with the rise of remote work in the face of the unending pandemic, addressing the commuter audience may be of less interest, with the new program. However, Spotify tells us &#8220;The Get up LIVE&#8221; will be complementary to the daily show, which will still run as normal &#8212; that&#8217;s why it has a later airing.</p>
<p>Other new Greenroom shows include &#8220;A Gay in the Life,&#8221; hosted by the married couple, actor Garrett Clayton and writer and educator Blake Knight, who will discuss LGBTQIA+ news and issues (weekly, 8 PM ET, starting today); &#8220;Take a Seat,&#8221; hosted by Ben Mandelker and Ronnie Karam of the &#8220;Watch What Crappens&#8221; podcast, who will recap reality shows and dive into other pop culture fascinations (weekly, 10 PM ET, starting today); &#8220;The Movie Buff,&#8221; hosted by film buff and comedian Jon Gabrus, who will review and break down the latest hot movies (weekly, 11 PM ET, starting today); and &#8220;The Most Necessary: Live,&#8221; a complement to Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;Most Necessary&#8221; playlist, where host B.Dot will discuss up-and-comers in hip-hop (weekly, 9 PM ET, starting Tuesday).</p>
<p>In addition to the new programs, Deuxmoi’s show &#8220;Deux Me After Dark&#8221; will also air this evening (Sept. 13) at 9 PM ET to recap the red carpet looks and gossip from this year&#8217;s Met Gala alongside guest Hillary Kerr, co-founder of Who What Wear.</p>

<p>The app had gotten off to a slower start this year, given its roots had been in sports talk live programming, which didn&#8217;t necessarily connect with Spotify&#8217;s music fans. Plus, it has faced growing competition from not only Clubhouse, which inspired its creation, but also other top social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and more. Without dedicated programs to garner user interest in yet another live audio app, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/spotifys-clubhouse-rival-greenroom-tops-140k-installs-on-ios-100k-on-android/">had only seen 141,000 new downloads</a> for Greenroom on iOS a little over a month after its launch, and fewer on Google Play. But Spotify&#8217;s long-term vision for the service was to more closely tie Greenroom to the music, artists, programs, and podcasts that were already available on its flagship music streaming app &#8212; and these new shows are an example of that plan in action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As if <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">the Boston startup market needed additional momentum</a>, it appears restaurant software startup Toast will dramatically bolster its valuation in its upcoming IPO.</p>
<p>For a city perhaps best known internationally for its hard tech and biotech efforts, to see Toast not only rebound from its early-pandemic layoffs to a public debut, but to target a valuation closer to $20 billion than $10 billion, is a coup.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001650164/000119312521270772/d166297ds1a.htm">new S-1/A filing</a> this morning, Toast indicated an early IPO range of between $30 and $33 per share, leading to a maximum fundraise of $825 million in its IPO. The company was last valued at $4.9 billion in early 2020, when Toast raised $400 million. The company is set to dramatically supersede that valuation mark thanks to expanding revenues and an especially strong second quarter.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Let&#8217;s dig into the company&#8217;s new IPO price range, calculate simple and fully diluted results, and see what we can learn from where Toast may price. Recall that the company has a mix of recurring software (SaaS) incomes as well as fintech revenue (payments, mostly). Its revenue mix is interesting, and how Toast prices could help us better understand how to value vertical SaaS startups that are pursuing a payments-and-SaaS business approach.</p>
<p>Into the filing!</p>
<h2>Toast&#8217;s IPO valuation</h2>
<p>Toast is selling 21,739,131 Class A shares in its IPO. They get one vote. Class B shares get 10. If you were considering buying into Toast&#8217;s IPO in hopes of having a say in its future, don&#8217;t. You won&#8217;t. The company&#8217;s IPO is really a method by which public-market investors can endorse the company&#8217;s current management group &#8212; or decline to buy any ownership at all.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we feel about corporate governance structures designed to eliminate the influence of common shareholders, Toast will have 499,332,681 shares outstanding after its IPO, or 502,593,550 if its underwriters choose to purchase their allotted greenshoe option.</p>
<p>At the company&#8217;s expected IPO price range of $30 to $33 per share, Toast is worth $14.98 billion at the low end, and $16.48 billion at the top. Inclusive of shares from its underwriters&#8217; option, Toast&#8217;s simple IPO valuation range expands from $15.08 billion at the bottom to $16.59 billion at the top.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When people talk about &#8220;online food delivery&#8221; services, chances are that they&#8217;ll think of the Uber Eats, Instacarts and Getirs of this world. But today a startup that&#8217;s tackling a different aspect of the market &#8212; addressing the supply chain that subsequently turns the wheels of the bigger food distribution machine &#8212; is announcing a big round of funding as it continues to grow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grubmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GrubMarket</a>, which provides software and services that help link up and manage relationships between food suppliers and their customers &#8212; which can include wholesalers and other distributors, markets and supermarkets, delivery startups, restaurants, and consumers &#8212; has picked up $120 million in a Series E round of funding.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a wide mix of investors. Liberty Street Funds, Walleye Capital, Japan Post Capital, Joseph Stone Capital, Pegasus Tech Ventures, Tech Pioneers Fund are among the new backers, who are being joined by existing investors Celtic House Asia Partners, INP Capital, Reimagined Ventures, Moringa Capital Management, and others, along with other unnamed participants</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?w=680" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2201464" width="680" height="459" alt="" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg 5103w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=768,518 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=680,459 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=1536,1036 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=2048,1381 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />Mike Xu, GrubMarket&#8217;s founder and CEO (pictured, above), tells me that the company is currently profitable in a big way. It&#8217;s now at a $1 billion annualized run-rate, having grown revenues 300% over last year, with some markets like New York growing even more (it went from less than $10 million ARR to $100 million+).</p>
<p>With operations currently in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Missouri, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington, and some 40 warehouses nationwide. GrubMarket had a pre-money valuation of over $1 billion, and now it will be looking to grow even more, both in terms of territory and in terms of tech, moving ahead in a market that is largely absent from competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still the first mover in this space,&#8221; Xu said when I asked him in an interview about rivals. &#8220;No one else is doing consolidation on the supply chain side as we are. We are trying to consolidate the American food supply chain through software technologies, while also trying to find the best solutions in this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>(And for some context, the $1 billion+ valuation is more than double GrubMarket&#8217;s valuation in October 2020, when it raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/grubmarket-raises-60m-at-a-500m-valuation-as-food-delivery-stays-center-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$60 million at a $500 million post-money valuation</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Longer term, the plan will be to look at an IPO provisionally filing the paperwork by summer 2022, Xu added.</p>
<p>GrubMarket got its start several years ago as one of many companies looking to provide a more efficient farm-to-table service. Tapping into a growing consumer interest in higher quality, and more traceable food, it saw an opportunity to build a platform to link up producers to the consumers, restaurants and grocery stores that were buying their products. (Grocery stores, incidentally, might be independent operations, or something much bigger: one of GrubMarket&#8217;s biggest customers is Whole Foods, which uses GrubMarket for produce supply in certain regions of the U.S. It is currently is the company&#8217;s biggest customer.)</p>
<p>As we wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/grubmarket-raises-60m-at-a-500m-valuation-as-food-delivery-stays-center-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a>, GrubMarket &#8212; like many other grocery delivery services &#8212; found that the pandemic initially provided a big fillip, and a big rush of demand, from that consumer side of the business, as more people turned to internet-based ordering and delivery services to offset the fact that many stores were closed, or they simply wanted to curtail the amount of shopping they were doing in-person to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>But fast forward to today, while the startup still serves consumers, this is currently not the primary part of its business. Instead, it&#8217;s B2B2C, serving companies that in turn serve consumers. Xu says that overall, demand from consumers has dropped off considerably compared to a year ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that restaurant re-openings have meant more people are dining out again and spending less time at home,&#8221; Xu said, &#8221; and also they can go back to physical grocery stores, so they are not as interested as they were before in buying raw ingredients online. I don&#8217;t want to offend other food tech companies, but I think many of them will be seeing the same. I think B2C is really going to slow down going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The opening for GrubMarket has been not just positioning itself as a middleman between producers and buyers, but to do so by way of technology and consolidating what has been a very regionalized and fragmented market up to now.</p>
<p>GrubMarket has snapped up no less than 40 companies in the last three years. While some of these have been to help it expand geographically (it made 10 acquisitions in the Los Angeles area alone), many have also been made to double down on technology.</p>
<p>These have included the likes of <a href="https://www.farmigo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Farmigo</a>, once a <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/farmigo-local-food-communities/?_ga=2.164545404.254421615.1631522567-209244718.1579131500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt Battlefield contender</a> that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/farmigo-shuts-down-its-online-farmers-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pivoted</a> into becoming a software provider to CSAs (an area that GrubMarket sees a lot of opportunity), as well as software to help farms manage their business staffing, insurance and more: Pacific Farm Management is an example of the latter.</p>
<p>GrubMarket&#8217;s own in-house software, WholesaleWare, a cloud-based service for farmers and other food producers, saw its sales grow 3,500% over the last year, and it is now managing more than $4 billion in wholesale and retail activity across the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p class="p1">There will be obvious ways to extend what GrubMarket does deeper into the needs of its customers on the purchasing end, but this is in many ways also a very crowded market. (And not just crowded, but crowded with big companies. Just today, Toast, the company that builds software for restaurants, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210913/p12#a210913p12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for a $717 million IPO</a> at potentially a $16.5 billion valuation.) So instead, GrubMarket will continue to focus on what has been a more overlooked aspect, that of the suppliers.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I am focused on the food supply chain,&#8221; Xu said. &#8220;Operators in the food supply chain business most of the time don’t have any access to software and e-commerce technology. But we are not just a lightweight online ordering system. We do a lot of heavyweight lifting around inventory management, pricing and customer relations, and even HR management for wholesales and distributors.&#8221; That will also mean, longer term, that GrubMarket will likely also start to explore connected hardware to help those customers, too: robotics for picking and moving items are on that agenda, Xu said.</p>
<p>“GrubMarket has built a profitable, high-growth business underpinned by its best-in-class technology platform that’s reinventing how businesses access healthy, fresh foods,” said Jack Litowitz, director of strategic investments at Reimagined Ventures, in a statement. “We’re proud to support GrubMarket as it continues to expand into new regions and grow its WholesaleWare 2.0 software platform. At Reimagined Ventures, we always seek to invest in businesses that are disrupting inefficient industries in innovative ways. Mike Xu and the GrubMarket team have built one of these businesses. We’re excited to back their vision and work in making the food supply chain more efficient.”</p>
<p>&#8220;GrubMarket is transforming the trillion-dollar food distribution industry with unprecedented speed by implementing advanced digital solutions and operational discipline. The company&#8217;s scale, growth, and profitability are extraordinarily impressive. Pegasus is delighted and honored to be part of GrubMarket&#8217;s exciting journey ahead,&#8221; added Bill Reichert, partner at Pegasus Tech Ventures.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The next <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mcu" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>Marvel Cinematic Universe</ins></a> show will premiere on Disney+ in November and, appropriately enough, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hawkeye" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Hawkeye</ins></em></a><em> </em>has a festive setting. Clint Barton (aka Hawkeye) just wants to spend Christmas with his family, but his enemies have other plans.</p>
<p>The series marks the return of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. This time around, he has a new partner: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-avengers-kate-bishop-hawkeye-release-date-182816765.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Kate Bishop</a> (Hailee Steinfeld), the self-professed &#8220;world&#8217;s greatest archer.&#8221; <em>Hawkeye</em> is said to center on the relationship between the two toxophilites, with Clint training Kate to take over as Hawkeye, as the character does in the comics. There are hints of that passing of the torch in the trailer. It shows the pair meeting for the first time and forming a bond as they work together to battle some goons.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYb3B1ETlk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>There are a few nods to other parts of the MCU here, including the existence of a Broadway musical about Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) and a tip of the cap toward the &#8220;masked vigilante&#8221; Hawkeye battled in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Something we <em>don&#8217;t </em>see in the trailer is an appearance by Florence Pugh, who made her MCU bow as assassin Yelena Belova in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/black%20widow" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Black Widow</ins></em></a><em> </em>this summer. She was <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/hawkeye-disney-plus-florence-pugh-vera-farmiga-cast-1234845371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>cast</ins></a> in <em>Hawkeye</em> last December.</p>
<p>In any case, you won&#8217;t have to wait too long to see what happens when Yelena, Clint and Kate encounter each other. The eight-episode first season of <em>Hawkeye</em>will debut on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>November 24th</ins></a> on Disney+.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One. More. Week. Just seven days until more than 10,000 people around the world storm the internet to attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23. We’re talking three event- and programming-packed days focused on anything — and everything — related to early-stage tech startups.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from iconic founders, unicorn makers, boundary-benders — all of it served up with a gigantic side of DIY tips, actionable advice, encouragement and inspiration. And, because Disrupt is highly interactive, you’ll have plenty of opportunity to engage, ask questions and receive answers.</p>
<p><strong>Admit one:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your TC Disrupt 2021 pass</a> — for less than $100 — and go find or create the opportunities that can help you move your business forward.</p>
<p>We’ll hit a few of the highlights, but be sure to check the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 agenda</a> for all the interviews, panel discussions, breakout sessions and events.

We have more than 80 presentations (and counting) on tap. Talk about something for everyone. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/discover-all-things-biotech-with-mayfield-at-disrupt-2021/">Biotech</a>? Covered. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/were-focusing-on-fintech-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">Fintech</a>? Also covered. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/fundraising-for-your-startup-weve-got-you-covered-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">Fundraising</a>? Well, of course.

Don’t miss your chance to see the future of tech take the stage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The Startup Battlefield translated easily to the virtual format. You could see the excitement, enthusiasm and possibility of the young founders, and I loved that. You could also ask questions through the chat feature, and you don&#8217;t always have time for questions at a live event. — Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember we said you’ll find plenty of actionable advice? Don’t miss the expert VC guidance in these two sessions: <strong>Crafting a Pitch Deck that Can’t Be Ignored</strong> and <strong>Pitch Deck Teardown</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Disrupt is a great sweet spot, and highly valuable, for anyone in the idea stage all the way through to having raised some angel money. Soak up the pitch deck teardowns and the VC presentations. They’re telling you what they&#8217;re looking for, what motivates them, what pushes them to contact you for a meeting. And that’s exactly what every startup raising capital needs to know. — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://jumpcloud.com">JumpCloud</a>, the late-stage startup that is modernizing the notion of corporate directories in a cloud context, announced a $159 million Series F investment on a healthy $2.56 billion valuation today.</p>
<p>Sapphire Ventures led the round with new investors participating, including Owl Rock, Whale Rock Capital, Sands Capital and Endeavor Catalyst, along with existing investors General Atlantic, BlackRock and H.I.G. Growth Partners. The company has now raised almost $356 million with $259 million coming over the most recent two rounds.</p>
<p>JumpCloud CEO Rajat Bhargava says that investor interest in the company is driven by his belief that the directory structure is the center of an IT organization, especially as it relates to identity, and that includes mobile device management, single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, privileged access management and identity governance. He sees all these approaches coming together in the directory structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that those are all part of one core directory platform. So when you think of a directory very holistically and broadly, it is really about securely and frictionlessly connecting users and their identities to whatever they may need to access,&#8221; Bhargava told me.</p>
<p>They do this by going after SMBs and mid-market companies with a cloud product that simplifies the management of these complex systems. Jai Das, who is managing director at lead investor at Sapphire Ventures, believes that this part of the market was being mostly left out of directory services because of that complexity before JumpCloud and others attempted to fill the void.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large enterprises have put in place various directory and security solutions to solve these problems, but with large investments in tech outlays and IT support teams. SMBs and mid-sized enterprises don’t have the big budgets or large staff to replicate the large enterprise model,&#8221; Das said. He adds that developing for this market is a huge challenge because it requires &#8220;building a product with all of the features large enterprises require, plus it has to be easy to use, easy to deploy and not [be] terribly expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the company is not revealing any revenue metrics, Bhargava did say that they have added 2,000 customers since we last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/jumpcloud-raises-75m-series-e-as-cloud-directory-service-thrives-during-pandemic/">spoke in November</a>, for a total of 5,000, and he said that the company should double head count by the end of the year from the 300 last November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He also said that he has been making progress at building a diverse company, and one way he does that is just asking every hiring manager if they interviewed historically underrepresented candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;The simple act of just asking that question makes such a massive difference inside of an organization. We&#8217;ve encouraged all of our hiring managers to interview diverse candidates but we also, when there&#8217;s an offer about to be made or when they&#8217;re in the [interview] process, we are asking them did you talk to [diverse] candidates. And then if you didn&#8217;t, we&#8217;re going to ask you to go search for those folks [before making a hiring decision],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bhargava didn&#8217;t want to talk about and IPO when we spoke last year, and not much changed this time around. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see. It&#8217;s just not part of what we&#8217;re worried about or focused on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He did indicate however, that with such a substantial amount of money on the balance sheet, he would consider some strategic acquisitions. &#8220;We will focus on M&amp;A and where it makes sense will integrate different components and teams into our business,&#8221; he said. With a tight labor market, that could be about adding engineering, as well as adding functionality to the platform, he said.</p>

<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Vacation was good, and a big thanks to Mary Ann and Natasha &#8212; not to mention Grace and Chris! &#8212; for keeping things flowing while I mostly sat around reading books and playing video games. But enough being maudlin! To the news!</p>
<ul>
<li>Investors <a href="https://twitter.com/SamRo/status/1437373171892637697">are kinda thinking</a> that the run-up in stocks needs to take a breather. And that the reset could land between 5% and 10%, with another 10% of respondents expecting a correction of <em>more</em> than 10%. Yowza.</li>
<li>China <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3148556/alipay-operator-ant-group-create-separate-app-lending-business">may break up Ant</a>, keeping the pace of its regulatory deluge going as this week starts. And the Chinese government thinks that its country has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-vows-consolidate-bloated-electric-040922526.html">too many EV companies</a>. If the market or central planning will wind up taking point on solving the &#8220;problem&#8221; is not clear.</li>
<li>The Apple v. Epic decision is still driving conversation. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">TechCrunch&#8217;s coverage</a>, and here&#8217;s <a href="https://500ish.com/apple-won-a-battle-to-lose-the-war-3ce6c3701918">the MG piece</a> I mentioned.</li>
<li>Toast and Freshworks have new filings up. Which is good news if you want to dig into new S-1/A reports. Forge is going public via a SPAC.</li>
<li>And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/babyscripts-secures-12m-to-roll-out-its-virtual-maternity-care-model/">Babyscripts</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/commercetools-raises-140m-at-a-1-9b-valuation-as-headless-commerce-continues-to-boom/">Commercetools</a> raised rounds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/southeast-asia-focused-jungle-ventures-announces-225m-first-close-for-its-fourth-fund/">while Jungle Ventures raised a fund</a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has lost another legal challenge in Europe over the employment status of drivers: The Court of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:5029&amp;showbutton=true&amp;keyword=uber">has ruled</a> that drivers for Uber are employed, rather than self-employed contractors.</p>
<p>The court also found drivers are covered by an existing collective labor agreement in the country &#8212; which pertains to taxi drivers &#8212; meaning<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Uber faces increased costs to comply with the agreement which sets pay requirements and covers benefits like sick pay. (And it may be liable</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for paying driver back pay in some cases.)</span></p>
<p>The court also ordered Uber to pay €50,000 in costs.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing giant has some 4,000 drivers working on its platform in the Dutch capital.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam court rejected Uber&#8217;s customary defence that it&#8217;s just a technology platform that connects passengers with taxi service providers &#8212; finding instead that drivers are only self-employed &#8220;on paper&#8221;.</p>
<p>The judges highlighted the nature of the service being provided by drivers and the fact Uber exerts controls over how they can work and earn through its app and algorithms.</p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s top court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service/">already ruled</a> back in 2017 that Uber is a transport provider and must comply with local transport laws &#8212; so you&#8217;d be forgiven for déjà vu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Dutch lawsuit was filed by the national trade union center, FNV, last year &#8212; with the hearing kicking off at the end of June.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the FNV&#8217;s VP, Zakaria Boufangacha, said: &#8220;This statement shows what we have been saying for years: Uber is an employer and the drivers are employees, so Uber must adhere to the collective labor agreement for Taxi Transport. It is also a signal to The Hague that these types of constructions are illegal and that the law must therefore be enforced.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="nl" dir="ltr">Een grote overwinning voor de rechten van de Uber-chauffeurs. Uber is werkgever en de chauffeurs zijn medewerkers, dus vallen onder de taxi-cao, zegt de rechter vandaag. Dat betekent een beter loon en meer rechten voor de chauffeurs.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/WhpqeXZuVw">https://t.co/WhpqeXZuVw</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Uber has been contacted for a response to the ruling. At the time of writing the company had not responded &#8212; but, per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/dutch-court-rules-uber-drivers-are-employees-not-contractors-newspaper-2021-09-13/">Reuters</a>, Uber said it intends to appeal and &#8220;has no plans to employ drivers in the Netherlands&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Uber confirmed it is appealing, with a spokesperson saying: &#8220;Nothing will change for drivers who use the app, as we appeal this ruling.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maurits Schönfeld, Uber&#8217;s general manager for Northern Europe, added:  “We are disappointed with this decision because we know that the overwhelming majority of drivers wish to remain independent. Drivers don’t want to give up their freedom to choose if, when and where to work. In the interest of drivers, we will therefore appeal the court’s decision, whilst also continuing to improve platform work in the Netherlands.”</p>
<p>In the U.K., Uber lost a string of tribunal rulings over its employment classification over a number of years &#8212; going on to lose in front of the U.K. supreme court this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">February</a>.</p>
<p>Following that Uber said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">would treat drivers in the U.K. as workers</a>, although disputes remain (such as over its definition of working time). In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57254962">May</a>, Uber also said it would recognize a U.K. trade union for the first time.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, however, the company continues to fight employment lawsuits &#8212; and to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">lobby European Union lawmakers</a> to deregulate platform work&#8230;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The EU has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">said it wants to find a way to improve platform work</a>. However it&#8217;s not yet clear what any pan-EU &#8220;reform&#8221; may look like. </span></p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted with questions on its platform work initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital labour platforms are clearly worried, evident through investing heavily on their lobbying power and throwing more resources on the EU level. These companies &#8212; including Uber of course &#8212; have also recently come together to create a new funding lobby group that is specifically targeting to influence policies on platform work,&#8221; said <a href="https://twitter.com/jilltoh">Jill Toh</a>, a PhD researcher in data rights at the University of Amsterdam, talking to TechCrunch after the Amsterdam ruling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw how Uber wielded and amended laws in their Prop 22 campaign in California, and together with other companies in Europe, they&#8217;re attempting to do so again. It&#8217;s disheartening to see that the Commission in its two consultations on platform worker regulation has only been talking to tech companies and has held no meetings with trade unions or other platform work representatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of this is incredibly problematic and concerning especially if the EC consultations result in a directive on platform work. Overall, the wins in the courts are important for workers, but there remains the issue of corporate power and influence in Brussels, as well as the lack of public enforcement to these court decisions,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A Commission spokeswoman told us its second-stage consultation on how to improve the working conditions for people working through digital labour platforms is still ongoing (until 15 September).</p>
<p>&#8220;Depending on the outcome of this consultation, the Commission intends to put forward a proposal by the end of this year,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim of the second-stage consultation is to gather social partners&#8217; views on how to ensure that people working through platforms have decent working conditions, while supporting the sustainable growth of digital labour platforms in the EU. In this context, social partners are also consulted on the possible content of the EU-level initiative, in areas such as (but not only) facilitating employment status classification and access to labour and social protection rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spokeswoman added that the Commission is closely following developments in Member States and taking into account in its analytical work.</p>

The DoD wants to launch missions venturing beyond Earth orbit, and existing electric and solar spacecraft are neither suitable for that job nor suitable to smaller vehicles, the department&#8217;s Defense Innovation Unit said.</p>
<p>The nuclear propulsion system will ideally offer &#8220;high delta-V&#8221; (above 33ft/s) while scaling down to less than 2,000kg in dry mass (4,409lbs on Earth). On top of providing electricity for the payload, the technology will hopefully keep the spacecraft warm when in shadow and minimize radiation both on the ground and to other components. Responses are expected by September 23rd, with contracts handed out as quickly as 60 to 90 days afterward.</p>
<p>Officials acknowledged they were making the request as a matter of expediency. NASA and other agencies are already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/darpa-lockheed-martin-blue-origin-nuclear-spacecraft-100547792.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">developing or backing nuclear spacecraft</a>, but those won&#8217;t be ready for a long while. The DoD is hoping for a prototype within three to five years — this technology would serve as a stopgap that puts nuclear propulsion into service relatively quickly for near-term projects.</p>
<p>While the request didn&#8217;t provide clues as to what spacecraft were in the works, the focus on smaller spacecraft suggests it could involve probes, satellites or other vehicles with modest goals. You won&#8217;t see this power human trips to Mars. All the same, it&#8217;s clear the DoD is frustrated by the limitations of existing spacecraft engines and wants a fast track to more powerful designs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With supply chains under constant stress because of the pandemic, freight forwarding has become one of the hottest startup sectors in the last two years. Indeed, international freight forwarding is now a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1066803/freight-forwarding-market-size-worldwide/">$199 billion market</a>. And the evidence is mounting.</p>
<p>In November last year, digital freight forwarder Forto raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">another $50 million</a> in a round led by Inven Capital. In April this year, Nuvocargo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/nuvocargo-raises-12m-to-digitize-the-freight-logistics-industry/">raised</a> $12 million to digitize the freight logistics industry. In May, Zencargo, with a freight-forwarding platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/zencargo-raises-42m-to-expand-its-digital-first-freight-forwarding-platform-internationally/">raised</a> $42 million. In June, freight forwarder sender <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-80m-at-a-1b-valuation/">raised</a> $80 million at a $1 billion+ valuation. In July Freightify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/freightify-lands-2-5m-to-make-rate-management-easier-for-freight-forwarders/">landed</a> $2.5 million to make rate management easier for freight forwarders.</p>
<p>And today, <a href="http://Vector.ai">Vector.ai</a>, which says it helps freight forwarders improve productivity via its AI platform, has raised $15 million in a Series A led by U.S. VC Bessemer Venture Partners. It was joined by existing investors Dynamo Ventures and Episode 1. Bessemer’s investment is yet another sign that U.S. VC continues to make incursions into the U.K. and European tech scene.</p>

<p>Vector now plans to accelerate its international expansion plans as an automated system for freight forwarders.</p>
<p>The problem it’s tackling is this: Freight forwarders lose time to repetitive administrative tasks as they execute shipments, such as hunting through customer emails etc., rather than concentrating on higher-value activities. Vector.ai says it’s machine learning platform can automate these tasks.</p>
<p>Its customers now include Fracht, EFL, NNR Global Logistics, The Scarbrough Group, Steam Logistics and Navia Freight, as well as other top-10 freight forwarders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>James Coombes, co-founder, and CEO of Vector.ai, commented: “Most employees within freight forwarders spend the majority of their time communicating with the 10-25 different entities that might be associated with a given shipment and coordinating freight movement and documentation. Communication usually runs through email and attachments… The volume of freight continues to rise globally &#8212; and with the <a href="https://www.export.org.uk/news/579204/Is-the-UK-being-disproportionately-impacted-by-soaring-freight-prices-due-to-Brexit-.htm">added burden of Brexit</a> and pandemic disruptions such as the recent port closure in China &#8212; freight forwarders are facing staffing shortages, steep wage increases and shipping delays that continue to cost companies money in lost revenue and spoiled goods. They cannot afford to keep wasting time on low-level processing, which is why we created the technology to automate basic tasks.”</p>
<p>Mike Droesch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, said: “Vector.ai is one of the early leaders in an emerging category of freight forwarding workflow automation and digitization tools. It has built an intuitive and industry-focused product &#8212; which is already winning over some of the largest freight forwarders.”</p>
<p>Vector competes with <a href="https://www.shipamax.com/">Shipamax</a> out of the U.K. which has raised $9.5 million, <a href="https://rpalabs.com/">RPA Labs</a> out of the U.S., which has raised $1.2 million and <a href="http://slync.io">slync.io</a>, also in the U.S., which has raised $75.9 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security operations teams face a daunting task these days, fending off malicious hackers and their increasingly sophisticated approaches to cracking into networks. That also represents a gap in the market: building tools to help those security teams do their jobs. Today, an Israeli startup called <a href="https://www.rezilion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rezilion</a> that is doing just that &#8212; building automation tools for DevSecOps, the area of IT that addresses the needs of security teams and the technical work that they need to do in their jobs &#8212; is announcing $30 million in funding.</p>
<p>Guggenheim Investments is leading the round, with JVP and Kindred Capital also contributing. Rezilion said that unnamed executives from Google, Microsoft, CrowdStrike, IBM, Cisco, PayPal, JP Morgan Chase, Nasdaq, eBay, Symantec, RedHat, RSA and Tenable are also in the round. Previously, the company had raised $8 million.</p>
<p>Rezilion&#8217;s funding is coming on the back of strong initial growth for the startup in its first two years of operations.</p>
<p>Its customer base is made up of some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies, including two of the &#8220;Fortune 10&#8221; (the top 10 of the <a href="https://fortune.com/fortune500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune 500</a>). CEO Liran Tancman, who co-founded Rezilion with CTO Shlomi Boutnaru, said that one of those two is one of the world&#8217;s biggest software companies, and the other is a major connected device vendor, but he declined to say which. (For the record, the top 10 includes Amazon, Apple, Alphabet/Google, Walmart and CVS.)</p>
<p>Tancman and Boutnaru had previously co-founded another security startup, CyActive, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/10/paypal-confirms-acquisition-of-cyactive-plans-to-open-new-security-hub-in-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by PayPal in 2015</a>; the pair worked there together until leaving to start Rezilion.</p>

<p>There are a lot of tools out in the market now to help automate different aspects of developer and security operations. Rezilion focuses on a specific part of DevSecOps: Large businesses have over the years put in place a lot of processes that they need to follow to try to triage and make the most thorough efforts possible to detect security threats. Today, that might involve inspecting every single suspicious piece of activity to determine what the implications might be.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem is that with the volume of information coming in, taking the time to inspect and understand each piece of suspicious activity can put enormous strain on an organization: It&#8217;s time-consuming, and, as it turns out, not the best use of that time because of the signal to noise ratio involved. Typically, each vulnerability can take 6-9 hours to properly investigate, Tancman said. &#8220;But usually about 70-80% of them are not exploitable,&#8221; meaning they may be bad for some, but not for this particular organization and the code it&#8217;s using today. That represents a very inefficient use of the security team&#8217;s time and energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight of out 10 patches tend to be a waste of time,&#8221; Tancman said of the approach that is typically made today. He believes that as its AI continues to grow and its knowledge and solution becomes more sophisticated, &#8220;it might soon be nine out of 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rezilion has built a taxonomy and an AI-based system that essentially does that inspection work as a human would do: It spots any new, or suspicious, code, figures out what it is trying to do, and runs it against a company&#8217;s existing code and systems to see how and if it might actually be a threat to it or create further problems down the line. If it&#8217;s all good, it essentially whitelists the code. If not, it flags it to the team.</p>
<p>The stickiness of the product has come out of how Tancman and Boutnaru understand large enterprises, especially those heavy with technology stacks, operate these days in what has become a very challenging environment for cybersecurity teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are using us to accelerate their delivery processes while staying safe,&#8221; Tancman said. &#8220;They have strict compliance departments and have to adhere to certain standards,&#8221; in terms of the protocols they take around security work, he added. &#8220;They want to leverage DevOps to release that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Rezilion has generally won over customers in large part for simply understanding that culture and process and helping them work better within that: &#8220;Companies become users of our product because we showed them that, at a fraction of the effort, they can be more secure.&#8221; This has special resonance in the world of tech, although financial services, and other verticals that essentially leverage technology as a significant foundation for how they operate, are also among the startup&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>Down the line, Rezilion plans to add remediation and mitigation into the mix to further extend what it can do with its automation tools, which is part of where the funding will be going, too, Boutnaru said. But he doesn&#8217;t believe it will ever replace the human in the equation altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will just focus them on the places where you need more human thinking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just removing the need for tedious work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that grand tradition of enterprise automation, then, it will be interesting to watch which other automation-centric platforms might make a move into security alongside the other automation they are building. For now, Rezilion is forging out an interesting enough area for itself to get investors interested.</p>
<p>“Rezilion’s product suite is a game changer for security teams,” said Rusty Parks, senior MD of Guggenheim Investments, in a statement. “It creates a win-win, allowing companies to speed innovative products and features to market while enhancing their security posture. We believe Rezilion has created a truly compelling value proposition for security teams, one that greatly increases return on time while thoroughly protecting one’s core infrastructure.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[MarginEdge’s tool is a restaurant management app that works with a business’ point of sale to streamline inventory, cost-tracking, ordering and recipes to eliminate the paperwork.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marginedge.com/">MarginEdge</a> announced Monday it raised $18 million in Series B funding to give restaurant operators a real-time view into their costs.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Bo Davis founded the company with Roy Phillips and Brian Mills in 2015. Both Davis and Phillips are veterans of the restaurant industry: Davis was previously the founder of conveyor belt sushi restaurant chain Wasabi, while Phillips was an executive at Bloomin Brands.</p>
<p>What they recognized with independent restaurants was that they struggled with workflow like invoices and tracking food costs and were either building internal tools to help them stay on top of things or were still operating with pen and paper or spreadsheets.</p>
<p>“We focused on building something our friends would like,” Davis told TechCrunch. “We spent three years on the product and worked with 20 restaurants to use the software and focus on getting it right instead of rushing to market.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bite Ninja scoops up pre-seed funding to reimagine restaurant working environments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/bite-ninja-scoops-up-pre-seed-funding-to-reimagine-restaurant-working-environments/embed/#?secret=PJ8j9BAuJC" data-secret="PJ8j9BAuJC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>MarginEdge’s tool is a restaurant management app that works with a business’ point of sale to streamline inventory, cost-tracking, ordering and recipes to eliminate the paperwork. It also captures all invoices, receipts or bills and converts them to line-item details within 24 hours. It is designed for independent restaurant owners that have under 50 units, Davis said.</p>
<p>Since launching its app in 2018, the Virginia-based company is seeing its platform used in over 2,500 restaurants. It raised a Series A in 2019, then an A2 in 2020 and with the latest round, led by Schooner, has raised $25 million in total.</p>
<p>IGC Hospitality, which operates restaurant properties, is not only an investor, but is also a customer, said Jeffrey Brosi, founder and managing partner. The company was using some different technology platforms to manage inventory and sales, but was looking for something to manage its whole inventory process.</p>
<p>“Bo came in and did a presentation, and it was amazing,” Brosi added. “The biggest thing for us is [being] user friendly. MarginEdge also has great customer service. We’ve invested in a few companies in the hospitality industry, and know the pain points and what we want to fix. If it makes sense financially, we will invest. This was one pain point that we didn’t have, and Bo filled that void.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like all restaurants over the past 18 months, Davis said the global pandemic caused MarginEdge to step back and evaluate. Despite many restaurants going out of business, he credits his business taking off again to restaurants rethinking their processes.</p>
<p>“We were lucky enough to be in a good position with capital that we could keep our team,” he added. “Revenue decreased for the first time, but we grew 45% even with COVID and as of Q1 was seeing 200% annual growth.”</p>
<p>MarginEdge has over 400 employees and its platform processes 45,000 invoices a week. Davis intends to invest the new funding in building out the leadership team, product development, building new features for the back office and on data science, an area he just received an advanced degree in, he said.</p>
<p>The company is using benchmark data around sales, food costs and labor costs and would like to provide more insights to its customers as it relates to inflation, which affects all of those aspects, and as a result, the menu prices.</p>
<p>“A lot of it is using data to understand menu pricing and what other people are doing so you are not pricing yourself out of the market or operating on margins where you can’t survive,” Davis added. “It will be all about predicting rather than reporting. The two things in the kitchen that are hardest are the startup prep list and the inventory late at night, and we make both easier.”</p>
