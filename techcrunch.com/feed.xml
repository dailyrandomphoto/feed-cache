										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Curio Wellness <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/curio-wellness-launches-30m-fund-to-help-women-and-minorities-own-a-cannabis-dispensary/">announced its innovative franchise program in 2020</a>, and today it’s bringing the program across the United States. The company is now accepting franchise applications in ten states, including MD, VA, PA, OH, MO, NJ, FL, MA, MI, and IL.</p>
<p>The program is designed to lower barriers to opening a dispensary. Anyone can apply to secure a franchise license, and diverse founders can seek capital through the Curio Wellness Fund. Curio Wellness expects to be able to sponsor 40 to 50 retail stores. The company is also rebranding its retail operations to Far &amp; Dotter.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to Jerel Registre, Managing Director at Curio WMBE Fund, who says the fund raised 20 million to date and expects to close the fundraising on October 31. He’s proud of the fund’s investor base, pointing to the diverse investor base representing 40% of the fund.</p>
<p>“My focus on the fund is driving diverse entrepreneurship,” Registre said. “The reason cannabis is such a great industry to do that in is that it’s a growing opportunity. It’s just a great ocean to put the boat on in terms of increasing diversity among entrepreneurs. It’s an area of the economy, and it’s a hot industry where there’s an understanding of the need for diversity.”</p>
<p>Registre points out that while the cannabis industry’s customer and employee base are often diverse, there’s often a lack of diversity in the executive and business ownership group. That’s what Curio Wellness is trying to address.</p>
<p>The fund provides selected franchisees with up to 93% of the capital needed to open a location. But it’s more than capital. It’s clear while speaking to Registre that his team is dedicated to formulating a proven strategy for their franchises. He points to Chick-fil-a as an example, saying, while he doesn’t like the company’s relationship with its franchisees, it provides a market-leading cohesive brand statement. Through Curio&#8217;s program, franchisees are provided with two phases of support. The first provides capital to franchisees to open their Curio Wellness Center and assist them in obtaining licenses, selecting a location and hiring and training employees. Once the location is operational, the fund intends to provide ongoing support around managing, sales and marketing, store operations, and ensuring employees stay updated on product information.</p>
<p>“After more than two years of effort to design an effective method of providing capital to diverse entrepreneurs in the cannabis industry, it is a personal honor to officially begin the application process and to truly expand diversity and enable economic empowerment in the industry,” said Registre. “The Fund is a true testament to Curio’s goal to address systemic barriers and create generational wealth among aspiring women, BIPOC, and disabled veteran entrepreneurs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This program is spinning up at the right time. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/2020-was-a-defining-year-for-cannabis-what-comes-next/">Cannabis was one of the winners of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, resulting in record sales and consumer acceptance. As a result, the time is right for dispensary ownership to reflect their local neighborhoods better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is looking to create a standalone advisory committee for election-related policy decisions, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/technology/facebook-election-commission.html">The New York Times</a>. The company has reportedly approached a number of policy experts and academics it is interested in recruiting for the group, which could give the company cover for some of its most consequential choices.</p>
<p>The group, which the Times characterizes as a commission, would potentially be empowered to weigh in on issues like election misinformation and political advertising — two of Facebook&#8217;s biggest policy headaches. Facebook reportedly plans for the commission to be in place for the 2022 U.S. midterm elections and could announce its formation as soon as this fall.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s election commission could be modeled after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-will-reconsider-trumps-ban-in-two-years/">Oversight Board</a>, the company&#8217;s first experiment in quasi-independent external decision making. The Oversight Board began<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/"> reviewing cases in October of last year</a>, but didn&#8217;t gear up in time to impact the flood of election misinformation that swept the platform during the U.S. presidential election. Initially, the board could only make policy rulings based on material that was already removed from Facebook.</p>
<p>The company touts the independence of the Oversight Board, and while it does operate independently, Facebook created the group and appointed its four original co-chairs. The Oversight Board is able to set policy precedents and make binding per-case moderation rulings, but ultimately its authority comes from Facebook itself, which at any point could decide to ignore the board&#8217;s decisions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5OAcgPomyG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board/">Facebook’s Oversight Board throws the company a Trump-shaped curveball</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook’s Oversight Board throws the company a Trump-shaped curveball&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board/embed/#?secret=5OAcgPomyG" data-secret="5OAcgPomyG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A similar external policy-setting body focused on elections would be<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/facebook-trump-oversight-board-decision/"> very politically useful</a> for Facebook. The company is a frequent target for both Republicans and Democrats, with the former claiming Facebook censors conservatives disproportionately and the latter calling attention to Facebook&#8217;s long history of incubating conspiracies and political misinformation.</p>
<p>Neither side was happy when Facebook decided to suspend political advertising after the election — a gesture that failed to address the exponential spread of organic misinformation. Facebook asked the Oversight Board to review its decision to suspend former President Trump, though the board ultimately kicked its most controversial case <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board/">back to the company itself</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Y Combinator application season is upon us. I have been through YC a couple of times and have reviewed thousands of applications as a volunteer in later years.</p>
<p>Typically, you hear advice focused on ways to improve your YC application so it gets accepted. Here are some tips on what not to do and why so many YC applications get rejected. I&#8217;ve also put down some advice about what else to anticipate and take into consideration as you navigate the application process.</p>
<p>In short, don’t overthink your application, and keep it simple and straightforward.</p>
<h2>When should I submit my YC application?</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When in doubt, read YC’s instructions and answer the question literally. Avoid verbose marketing lingo and keep answers short and concise.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The best applications are often those made at the last minute, because applicants do not overthink their responses and toil over details they think need to be shoved into a question. While I do not recommend submitting applications at the deadline because the system has had issues receiving submissions, you can capture the essence of last-minute submissions by being clear and concise.</p>
<p>Remember that your application should be good enough to get an interview, not win a prize. Go back to work instead of spending more time perfecting an application.</p>
<p>YC experiments frequently. For this batch and the last, there was an early deadline that would give accepted teams access to YC before the batch officially began. Applying early gives you an opportunity to land an interview in the early round and to update your application to be considered in the standard round.</p>
<h2>Is it OK to submit my YC application late?</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a lot of advice out there on how to grab people&#8217;s attention, but there&#8217;s one aspect of marketing that <a href="https://robertkatai.com/">Robert Katai</a> thinks isn&#8217;t talked about as often: maintaining their attention. The solution, he says, is a combination of content strategy and positioning.</p>
<p>Based in Romania, Katai is known for his podcasts and speeches covering the gamut of content marketing. A product manager at online graphic design platform <a href="https://www.creatopy.com/">Creatopy</a>, he also works with clients as a freelance content strategist, and it is in this capacity that he was recommended to TechCrunch via our growth marketer survey. (If you have growth marketers to recommend, please <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">fill out the survey</a>!)</p>
<p>Katai was recommended by multiple Romanian clients and contacts who vouched for his content strategy prowess, so we were curious to know more. Who is he? And is his advice applicable beyond borders?</p>
<p>The short answer is yes. In a freewheeling interview, Katai spoke about how content marketing should integrate with users&#8217; daily lives, and how content can be repurposed across multiple formats. He also shared some insights on the booming Romanian startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you help your clients as a freelancer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Robert Katai: </strong>One of the two things I&#8217;m doing is that I&#8217;m helping clients with creating their content strategy based on their objective. You can get web traffic, but you can also create a message and build the brand. You don&#8217;t have to start at the beginning; You can rebuild the brand later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, I&#8217;m working with a Romanian outsourcing company that started in 1993. They pioneered this industry in our city of Cluj-Napoca, but lately they started to realize that they should be more attractive from a sales as well as from an employee perspective. So I worked with them to perform an internal audit to see why employees love the company, why they leave, why they stay and what they want from the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192106" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192106" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192106" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?w=300" alt="Robert Katai" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192106" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Robert Katai.</p></div></p>
<p>From there, I got to the idea that they needed to reshape their brand to not just have people notice them but to also maintain their attention. And here comes the content: I started an ambassador program, because there are people outside of the company who love it.</p>
<p>I also recommended they create an internal print magazine. It&#8217;s a very well-designed magazine that their 200 to 300 employees can take home and read. It&#8217;s not just about the job; it&#8217;s also about their hobbies, things to do in the city and some thought leadership articles that can inspire them to have a better life.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the second way you are helping clients?</strong></p>
<p>Apart from content strategy, I&#8217;m working with clients on their positioning for their audience, community and market, but also sometimes in terms of employer branding. Content can be a bridge between the two ways I am helping clients, because I&#8217;m using a lot of content marketing here and not focusing only on performance or growth marketing hacks. I&#8217;m helping them understand that if they want to establish a memorable, long-lasting brand in the market, they have to make content marketing part of their life.</p>
<p>If they want to reposition themselves in the industry, they need to say: Okay, these are the kinds of content we have to create for our goals; who will amplify the content, who will connect with us, and who will consume the content. Today, content creation is free — everybody can do it. The hard part is how you distribute and amplify that. And here&#8217;s how I can help the startups: Make a big piece of content and repurpose it in several small pieces; get it in front of people so that the brand is on their minds.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>How can brands achieve that top-of-mind status?</strong></p>
<p>We all know that there are four kinds of content: Text, video, pictures and audio. These four formats never die. The platform can change, but the format will stay the same. A video can be an Instagram Reel, a documentary or something else, but it&#8217;s a video. The same goes for a photo. So the content strategy I&#8217;m working with is how brands can use that content ecosystem.</p>
<p>When I work with my clients — and also with Creatopy where I&#8217;m a product marketer — I recommend them to use content to build their brand and be visible to their users every day in their feeds. Every morning, when their customers are waking up and checking their phones, they don&#8217;t open a newspaper. They will open Twitter, Instagram or Facebook, and maybe then when they get out of the bathroom and make coffee, they will open YouTube and connect with Alexa.</p>
<p>I really believe that brands should create content that can just be in the mind of the user. Snackable content, Reels, TikTok … It doesn&#8217;t matter what we call it.</p>
<p><strong>You also talked about repurposing content. Can you explain that?</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the interview you&#8217;ve done with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/to-stay-ahead-of-your-competitors-start-building-your-narrative-on-day-one/">Peep Laja</a>. You could have recorded it as a video. And he covered several topics, so you could have several short videos — 30 seconds, three minutes, whatever. You can publish them daily on your site or social media channels with a comment that says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the link to the full article.&#8221; But remember that on LinkedIn, that link will need to go into the comments section, not the post itself.</p>
<p>You can also have a longer video that you can publish on social media or on Wistia, asking people to give their email — so now you also have subscribers.</p>
<p>Then the second type of content you can create is audio. You already have it from the recording. You don&#8217;t have to publish the full 45-minute conversation, but you can have a five-minute audio clip, and again link to the articles.</p>
<p>Now we have video and audio, but what if you also designed quotes with his headshot and messaging? If it&#8217;s part of a series, you should also give it a name.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just motivational; it&#8217;s educational, too, so you should take these quotes and create carousels for Instagram and LinkedIn. The first slide should grab attention — it can be a question. The second slide can be a link to the interview so that even if people don&#8217;t click it, it will be on their minds. Then you can have slides with insights.</p>
<p>The last slide will always be a call to action: Asking people to share, comment or save it for later — it&#8217;s the new currency on Instagram! And once you have your Instagram carousel, you create a PDF and publish it on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>So now you have five formats of content from one piece of content.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, how much do we owe you?! Just kidding, we actually do some of that for the Equity podcast, for instance. Now, what other advice do you have for startups?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big advocate of documenting the process. Just imagine if Mark Zuckerberg had done that and you could read how he launched Facebook and so on. Noah Kagan is doing that right now. I think startup founders should do it, not just from the PR and marketing perspective, but for their audience. Even if your audience is not paying for your product right now, they are staying with you and giving your brand an essence in the industry.</p>
<p>Just think about what Salesforce is doing right now: They <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/there-could-be-more-to-the-salesforce-video-streaming-service-than-meets-the-eye/">launched Salesforce+</a>, which is like Netflix for B2B. It&#8217;s to get the attention of professionals and also maintain it, and I believe this is the currency of the big companies today: People&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p><b>Do you work with any startups in Romania? And do you have any impressions to share on the </b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/8-investors-tell-us-the-story-behind-the-romanian-startup-boom/"><b>Romanian startup ecosystem</b></a><b>?</b></p>
<p>Yes, I help a few Romanian startups with their content marketing and positioning. Sometimes other startups email me with questions, so I help them, too, but I don&#8217;t charge for email advice. I work with the ones that are looking for a long-term or project-based collaboration.</p>
<p>Startup founders here in Romania are curious, and very courageous to experiment even if it won&#8217;t necessarily work. And Romanian startups are very smart. For instance, <a href="https://planable.io/">Planable</a> is doing a great job with content, social media and positioning. We also have social media analytics company <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/">Socialinsider</a>, which this year launched virtual events, and <a href="https://www.typingdna.com/">TypingDNA</a>, which wants to get rid of needing to log in with passwords and was founded by a former colleague.</p>
<p>I also found that the founders here work harder than their teams and don&#8217;t just leave others do the work — at least the ones I have met. We have several startup events in Romania: <a href="https://www.howtoweb.co/">How to Web</a>, and <a href="https://techsylvania.com/">Techsylvania</a> here in Transylvania.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like this name, but people say that Cluj-Napoca is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/06/the-silicon-valley-of-transylvania/">&#8220;Silicon Valley of Romania.&#8221;</a> Lots of startups have been launched here, but the city that is getting more and more traction is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oradea">Oradea</a>, where the bet on education is paying off.</p>
<p><em>(If you are a tech startup founder or investor in Cluj or Oradea, fill in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/we-want-your-city-in-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">TechCrunch&#8217;s European Cities Survey 2021</a>.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Though YouTube has supported picture-in-picture viewing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/youtubes-picture-in-picture-mode-is-live-for-all-u-s-android-users/">on Android devices</a> since 2018, YouTube told TechCrunch today that it plans to launch the feature to all iOS users in the U.S. on both iPhone and iPad. For now, YouTube is inviting Premium subscribers to test this feature, which lets users watch picture-in-picture videos in a mini player while browsing other apps. The testing period for Premium users ends on October 31, but YouTube does not have a timeline to share on when all U.S. iOS users will gain access to the feature.</p>
<p>Though this is a mobile feature, Premium subscribers must enable the ability to test it <a href="http://youtube.com/new">via the YouTube experiments website</a> on the desktop. Last year, YouTube made opting into experiments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/youtube-premium-subscribers-get-a-new-perk-with-launch-of-testing-program/">a Premium perk</a>.</p>
<p>If you scroll down on the experiments website, you&#8217;ll see &#8220;Picture-in picture on iOS&#8221; with the option to try it. Then, if you watch a video on the YouTube app, you should see a picture-in-picture display of the video when you navigate out of the app.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?w=671" alt="" width="671" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=148,150 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=296,300 296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=768,778 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=671,680 671w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=1517,1536 1517w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=2022,2048 2022w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=96,96 96w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /></p>
<p>Once viewing a video via picture-in-picture, you can adjust where the video appears on your screen and how big it is. When you tap on the video, you&#8217;ll return to the YouTube app. If you lock your phone, the video will pause.</p>
<p>Some users have <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/24/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone/">reported</a> that you might need to delete and reinstall the YouTube app to get it to work.</p>
<p>This feature is different from existing picture-in-picture functionality on the YouTube iOS app because it allows you to continue watching a video even while navigating elsewhere on your phone. Similar features already exist on streaming apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/netflix-finally-gets-picture-in-picture-support-on-ipad/">Netflix</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The May 2021 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">executive order</a> from the White House on improving U.S. cybersecurity includes a provision for a software bill of materials (SBOM), a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building a software product.</p>
<p>An SBOM is the full list of every item that’s needed to build an application. It enumerates all parts, including open-source software (OSS) dependencies (direct), transitive OSS dependencies (indirect), open-source packages, vendor agents, vendor application programming interfaces (APIs) and vendor software development kits.</p>
<p>Software developers and vendors often create products by assembling existing open-source and commercial software components, the executive order notes. It’s useful to those who develop or manufacture software, those who select or purchase software and those who operate the software.</p>
<p>As the executive order describes, an SBOM enables software developers to make sure open-source and third-party components are up to date. Buyers can use an SBOM to perform vulnerability or license analysis, both of which can be used to evaluate risk in a product. And those who operate software can use SBOMs to quickly determine whether they are at potential risk of a newly discovered vulnerability.</p>
<p>“A widely used, machine-readable SBOM format allows for greater benefits through automation and tool integration,” the executive order says. “The SBOMs gain greater value when collectively stored in a repository that can be easily queried by other applications and systems. Understanding the supply chain of software, obtaining an SBOM and using it to analyze known vulnerabilities are crucial in managing risk.”</p>
<p>An SBOM is intrinsically hierarchical. The finished product sits at the top, and the hierarchy includes all of its dependencies providing a foundation for its functionality. Any one of these parts can be exploited in this hierarchical structure, leading to a ripple effect.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, given the potential impact, there has been a lot of talk about the proposed SBOM provision since the executive order was announced. This is certainly true within the cybersecurity community. Anytime there are attacks such as the ones against Equifax or Solarwinds that involve software vulnerabilities being exploited, there is renewed interest in this type of concept.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clearly, the intention of an SBOM is good. If software vendors are not upgrading dependencies to eliminate security vulnerabilities, the thinking is we need to be able to ask the vendors to share their lists of dependencies. That way, the fear of customer or public ridicule might encourage the software producers to do a better job of upgrading dependencies.</p>
<p>However, this is an old and outmoded way of thinking. Modern applications and microservices use many dependencies. It’s not uncommon for a small application to use tens of dependencies, which in turn might use other dependencies. Soon the list of dependencies used by a single application can run into the hundreds. And if a modern application consists of a few hundred microservices, which is not uncommon, the list of dependencies can run into the thousands.</p>
<p>If a software vendor were to publish such an extensive list, how will the end users of that software really benefit? Yes, we can also ask the software vendor to publish which of the dependencies is vulnerable, and let’s say that list runs into the hundreds. Now what?</p>
<p>Clearly, having to upgrade hundreds of vulnerable dependencies is not a trivial task. A software vendor would be constantly deciding between adding new functionality that generates revenue and allows the company to stay ahead of its competitors versus upgrading dependencies that don’t do either.</p>
<p>If the government formalizes an SBOM mandate and starts to financially penalize vendors that have vulnerable dependencies, it is clear that given the complexity associated with upgrading dependencies the software vendors might choose to pay fines rather than risk losing revenue or competitive advantage in the market.</p>
<p>Revenue drives market capitalization, which in turn drives executive and employee compensation. Fines, as small as they are, have negligible impact on the bottom line. In a purely economic sense, the choice is fairly obvious.</p>
<p>In addition, software vendors typically do not want to publish lists of all their dependencies because that provides a lot of information to hackers and other bad actors as well as to competitors. It’s bad enough that cybercriminals are able to find vulnerabilities on their own. Providing lists of dependencies gives them even more possible resources to discover weaknesses.</p>
<p>Customers and users of the software, for their part, don’t want to know all the dependencies. What would they gain from studying a list of hundreds of dependencies? Rather, software vendors and their customers want to know which dependencies, if any, make the application vulnerable. That really is the key question.</p>
<p>Prioritizing software composition analysis (SCA) ensures that when dependencies are analyzed in the context of an application, the dependencies that make an application vulnerable can be dramatically reduced.</p>
<p>Instead of publishing a list of 1,000 dependencies, or 100 that are vulnerable, organizations can publish a far more manageable list in the single digits. That is a problem that organizations can much more easily deal with. Sometimes a software vendor can fix an issue without having to upgrade the dependency. For example, it can make changes in the code, which is not always possible if we are merely looking for the list of vulnerable dependencies.</p>
<p>There is no reason to disdain the concept of SBOM outright. By all means, let’s make the software vendors responsible for being transparent about what goes into their software products. Plenty of organizations have paid a steep price because of software vulnerabilities that could have been prevented in the form of data breaches and other cybersecurity attacks.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s heartening to see the federal government take cybersecurity so seriously and propose ways to enhance the protection of applications and data.</p>
<p>However, let’s make SBOM specific to the list of dependencies that actually make the application vulnerable. This serves both the vendor and its customers by cutting directly to the sources of vulnerabilities that can do damage. That way, we can address the issues at hand without creating unnecessary burdens.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is rolling out a major update for its iOS smartphone app with new controls, improved management and cool visuals. Version 4.0 also gives you the choice between two different sized widgets for your iPhone home screen. As detailed by <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/558/tesla-releases-new-iphone-tesla-app-android-coming-soon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Tesla Software Updates</em></a>, both feature the same information: the name of the car, battery percentage, location (or charging info), unlock status, an image of the vehicle and the time the information was last updated. Tesla previously had a &#8220;Today&#8221; extension for iOS that was nowhere near as comprehensive as the new widgets.</p>
<p>In terms of controls, you can send commands to your car immediately upon opening the app, instead of waiting for the vehicle to wake up. There&#8217;s also enhanced phone key support that essentially lets you unlock multiple Teslas.</p>
<p>An updated visual that should be immediately noticeable is the new 3D vehicle render. There are also new animations when you charge your car and in the climate and controls sections. Design-wise, Tesla has ditched the charging section and now displays that info when your car is plugged in. You can also view Supercharging history from within the app. While the speed limit, valet mode and sentry mode settings have been moved to a new category titled Security, which includes tips on how to use the Bluetooth, phone key and location services.</p>
<p>To sum up, this is the biggest update to the EV maker&#8217;s iOS app in a while. Recently, Tesla has mainly focused on providing bug fixes and improvements, outside of the introduction of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-powerwall-owners-can-now-help-balance-the-grid-in-california-052917432.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Virtual Power Plant</a> enrolment in July.</p>

<h3>Collecting Crypto Opportunities</h3>
<p><em><strong>Dapper Labs</strong> launched the digital collectible craze into the mainstream earlier this year with its smash hit NBA Top Shot.

		Adi Levanon has been an early-stage VC for nearly a decade, with a strong focus on fintech investments since 2015, both in the U.S. and Israel. Currently, she is the Tel Aviv-based investor at <a href="https://flintcap.com/">Flint Capital</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">“Even with its vast local talent, it seems Israel still has many hurdles to overcome in order to become a global fintech hub. [ … ] Having that said, I don’t believe any of these obstacles will prevent Israel from generating disruptive global fintech startups that will become game-changing businesses.”</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3731717,00.html">wrote</a> that back in 2018, when I was determined to answer whether Israel had the potential to become a global fintech hub. Suffice to say, this prediction from three years ago has become a reality.</p>
<p>In 2019, Israeli fintech startups raised over $1.8 billion; in 2020, they were said to have raised $1.48 billion despite the pandemic. Just in the first quarter of 2021, Israeli fintech startups raised $1.1 billion, according to IVC Research Center and Meitar Law Offices.</p>
<p>It’s then no surprise that Israel now boasts over a dozen fintech unicorns in sectors such as payments, insurtech, lending, banking and more, some of which reached the desired status just in the beginning of 2021 —  like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/melio-raises-110m-on-a-1-3b-valuation-to-bring-b2b-payments-for-smbs-into-the-21st-century/">Melio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/papaya-global-raises-100m-more-at-a-1b-valuation-for-tools-to-hire-pay-and-manage-distributed-workforces/">Papaya Global</a>, which raised $110 million and $100 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve been fortunate to invest (both as a venture capitalist and personally) in successful early-stage fintech companies in the U.S., Israel and emerging markets  —  Alloy, Eave, MoneyLion, Migo, Unit, AcroCharge and more.</p>
<p>The major shifts and growth of fintech globally over these years has been largely due to advanced AI-based technologies, heightened regulatory scrutiny, a more innovative and adaptive approach among financial institutions to build partnerships with fintechs, and, of course, the COVID pandemic, which forced consumers to transact digitally.</p>
<p>The pandemic pushed fintechs to become essential for business survival, acting as the main contributor of the rapid migration to digital payments.</p>
<p>So what is it about Israeli-founded fintech startups that stand out from their scaling neighbors across the pond? Israeli founders first and foremost have brought to the table a distinct perspective and understanding of where the gaps exist within their respective focus industries —  whether it was Hippo and Lemonade in the world of property and casualty insurance, Rapyd and Melio in the world of business-to-business payments, or Earnix and Personetics in the world of banking data and analytics.</p>
<p>This is even more compelling given that many of these Israeli founders did not grow within financial services, but rather recognized those gaps, built their know-how around the industry (in some cases by hiring or partnering with industry experts and advisers during their ideation phase, strengthening their knowledge and validation), then sought to build more innovative and customer-focused solutions than most financial institutions can offer.</p>
<p>Having this in mind, it is becoming clearer that the Israeli fintech industry has slowly transitioned into a mature ecosystem with a combination of local talent, which now has expertise from a multitude of local fintechs that have scaled to success; a more global network of banking and insurance partners that have recognized the Israeli fintech disruptors; and the smart fintech -focused venture capital to go along with it. It’s a combination that will continue to set up Israeli fintech founders for success.</p>
<p>In addition, a major contributor to the fintech industry comes from the technological side. It is never enough to reach unicorn status with just the tech on the back end.</p>
<p>What most likely differentiates Israeli fintech from other ecosystems is the strong technological barriers and infrastructure built from the ground up, which then, of course, leads to the ability to be more customized, compliant, secured, etc. If I had to bet on where I believe Israeli fintech startups could become market leaders, I’d go with the following.</p>
<h2>Voice-based transactions</h2>
<p>Voice technologies have come a long way over the years; where once you knew you were talking to a robot, now financial institutions and applications offer a fully automated experience that sounds and feels just like a company employee.</p>
<p>Israel has shown growing success in the world of voice tech, with companies like Gong.io providing insights for remote sales teams; Bonobo (acquired by Salesforce) offering insights from customer support calls, texts and other interactions; and Voca.ai (acquired by Snapchat) offering an automated support agent to replace the huge costs of maintaining call centers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI-powered voice transcription service Otter.ai is expanding its Otter Assistant feature for Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Cisco Webex. Otter.ai first released this feature for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/otter-ais-new-assistant-can-automatically-transcribe-your-zoom-meetings/">Zoom users earlier this year in May</a>. With this new integration, Otter Assistant can now join and transcribe meetings on more platforms, even if the Otter user is not attending the meeting.</p>
<p>The Otter Assistant automatically joins calendared meetings and records, takes notes and shares transcriptions with meeting participants. If a user decides to skip a meeting altogether, they catch up on the discussion through the recorded notes afterwards. The tool can also help in instances where you have overlapping meetings or larger meetings where only a portion of them are relevant to you.</p>
<p>To use the new tool, users need to synchronize their calendars with the service. The assistant will then automatically join all future meetings, where it appears in the meeting as a separate participant, for transparency’s sake.</p>
<p>“With more companies adapting to a hybrid work model where professionals work and take meetings in-office, at home, and on mobile, many are looking to Otter as a tool to improve team communication and collaboration,” said Otter.ai co-founder and CEO Sam Liang in <a href="https://blog.otter.ai/press-release-otter-assistant/">a statement</a>. “We’re excited to make using Otter even easier and more accessible no matter where or how people conduct and participate in meetings.”</p>
<p>The new integration will be handy for those who attend meetings across several platforms, as the tool can keep all of your meeting notes in one place. The Otter Assistant is available to Otter.ai Business users. The business tier starts at <a href="https://otter.ai/pricing">$20 per month</a> and includes features like two-factor authentication, advanced search, audio imports, custom vocabulary, shared speaker identification and more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The offer management platform provides “deal desk” software for recruiters to easily manage compensation strategies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you haven’t noticed yet, the hiring market is a hot one &#8212; and getting more complicated as enterprise talent acquisition leaders face technology gaps while assessing candidates. This leads to difficulty in determining compensation.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://kcpr.mxfig.com/5c538c40d7ccca0f92010099/l/KjwTCTHPBd5v2jTeu?messageId=1wZPjR23diElFlfUU&amp;rn=gIsxWYIBSZulGdzlmcoNkI&amp;re=gIt92YuwWah12ZAh2YuVncjh2YlRnLsxWYoNmI&amp;sc=false">Compa</a>. The offer management platform provides “deal desk” software for recruiters to more easily manage their compensation strategies to create and communicate offers that are easy to understand and are unbiased.</p>
<p>Charlie Franklin, co-founder and CEO of Compa, told TechCrunch it was frustrating to lose a candidate at the compensation stage, so the company created its software to reduce the challenge of relying on crowdsourcing data or surveys to compare pay.</p>
<p>“Recruiters often lack the data and tools to figure out how much to pay people and communicate that effectively,” Franklin told TechCrunch. “We see talent acquisitions teams like a sales team. If you think of it from that perspective, they need to close a candidate, but to ask the recruiter to operate off of a spreadsheet slows that process down.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194156" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194156" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194156" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg 3088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194156" class="wp-caption-text">Compa co-founders, from left, Charlie Franklin, Joe Malandruccolo and Taylor Cone. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Compa</p></div></p>
<p>With Compa, recruiters can input pay expectations and compare recent offers and collaborate with other team members and hiring managers to reach pay consensus quicker. The software automates all of the market intelligence in real time and provides insights about compensation across similar industries and organizations.</p>
<p>The company, based in both California and Massachusetts, emerged from stealth Thursday with $3.9 million in seed funding led by Base10 Partners. Participation in the round also came from Crosscut Ventures and Acadian Ventures, as well as a group of strategic angel investors including 2.12 Angels, Oyster HR CEO Tony Jamous and Scout RFP co-founders Stan Garber and Alex Yakubovich.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jamison Hill, partner at Base10 Partners, said via email his firm was doing research in the ESG “megatrend,” particularly looking for startups focused on compensation management, when it came across Compa.</p>
<p>He was attracted to the founders’ “clarity and conviction” on the company’s vision, their understanding of the pay gap in the market, how Compa’s solution would “create a new wave of smarter, more-data driven recruiting teams” and how it was enabling employers to use compensation and a positive offer management approach to differentiate itself from competitors.</p>
<p>“They deeply understand the nuances that come with enterprise-level HR teams and bring that expertise to every aspect of Compa&#8217;s product offering, which is why we believe Compa can emerge as a leader in this trend and chose to partner with this very special team,” Hill added.</p>
<p>Franklin, who previously led human resources M&amp;A at Workday, founded Compa last year with  Joe Malandruccolo, who was on the engineering side at Facebook and Oculus, and Taylor Cone, who has done innovation consulting for organizations like Stanford University.</p>
<p>The company was bootstrapped prior to going after the seed round and will use the capital to expand the team and create additional products that fit into its mission of “making compensation fair and competitive for everyone,” Franklin said.</p>
<p>Going forward, he adds that job offers and compensation need to catch up to how quickly the world is changing. As more people work remotely and companies want to attract a diverse workforce, compensation will be an important factor.</p>
<p>“This is a long-term trend we are seeing in HR — compensation becoming more transparent — not just a spreadsheet shared internally, but a transition from secretive to open and accountable, Franklin said. “Technology is catching up to that, and we have the ability to produce outcomes that drive differences in pay.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founders Fund and Paradigm are leading an investment in a platform that&#8217;s aiming to wed music rights with NFTs, allowing user to buy shares of songs through the company&#8217;s marketplace, earning royalties as the music they&#8217;ve invested in gains popularity.</p>
<p>The venture, called <a href="https://royal.io/">Royal</a>, is led by Justin Blau, an EDM artist who performs under the name 3LAU, and JD Ross, a co-founder of home-buying startup Opendoor. Blau has been one of the more active and visible figures in the NFT community, launching a number of upstart efforts aimed at exploring how musicians can monetize their work through crypto markets. Blau says that as Covid cut off his ability to tour, he dug into NFTs full-time, aiming to find a way to flip the power dynamics on &#8220;platforms that were extracting all the value from creators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#8220;</span></p>
<p>Back in March, weeks before many would first hear about NFTs following the $69 million Beeple sale at Christies, Blau set his own record, selling a batch of custom songs and custom artwork for a collective $11.7 million worth of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Royal&#8217;s investment announcement comes just as a broader bull run for the NFT market seems to reach a fever pitch with investors dumping hundreds of million of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies into community NFT projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes. While visual artists interested in putting their digital works on the blockchain have seen a number of platforms spring up and mature in recent months to simplify the process of monetizing their art, there have been fewer efforts focused on musicians.</p>
<p>Paradigm and Founders Fund are leading a $16 million seed round in Royal, with participation from Atomic &#8212; where Ross was recently a General Partner. Ross&#8217;s fellow Opendoor co-founder Keith Rabois led the deal for Founders Fund.</p>

<p>The company isn&#8217;t sharing an awful lot about their launch or product plans, including when the platform will actually begin selling fractionalized assets, but it seems pretty clear the company will be heavily leveraging Blau&#8217;s music and position inside the music industry to bring early fans/investors to the platform. Users can sign-up for early access on the site currently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As NFT startups chase more complex ownership splits that aim to help creators share their success with fans, there&#8217;s plenty of speculation taking off around how regulators will eventually treat them. While the ICO boom of 2017 led to plenty of founders receiving SEC letters alleging securities fraud, entrepreneurs in this wave seem to be working a little harder to avoid that outcome. Blau says that the startup&#8217;s team is working closely with legal counsel to ensure the startup is staying fully compliant.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s bigger challenge may be ensuring that democratizing access to buying up music rights actually benefits the fans of those artists or creates new fans for them, given the wide landscape of crypto speculators looking to diversify. That said, Blau notes there&#8217;s plenty of room for improvement among the current ownership spread of music royalties, largely spread among labels, private equity groups and hedge funds.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;A true fan might want to own something way earlier than a speculator would even get wind of it,&#8221;Blau says. &#8220;Democratizing access to asset classes is a huge part of crypto’s future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jessica Ko was head of design at Google and then Opendoor, she realized that her teams spent about 90% of their time digging around Dropbox looking for assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, they’d find older versions. Or they couldn’t find what they were looking for. Or even worse, they’d accidentally pick the wrong asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was such a chaotic process,” Ko recalls. “Anyone could go in and alter things and change folder structures around. It was a total mess, and just continued like that because there was no alternative.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Opendoor grew in size, the problem became an even bigger one, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Designers were quitting because it was giving them so much anxiety,” Ko recalls. “Dropbox hadn’t solved it yet. Google Drive was not a good alternative either. Designers deal with files the most, and we’re exchanging files constantly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the frustration and stress the problem of file storage and sharing caused, not being able to locate the correct assets also led to errors, which in turn led to lots of money lost, according to Ko.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We spent a lot of money on photo shoots because we couldn&#8217;t find new things, or people would have to recreate designs,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, she said, designers weren’t the only ones who needed to access the assets. Finance teams were constantly needing them for things like creating pitch decks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2018, Ko left Opendoor to set about solving the problem she was tired of dealing with by creating file storage for modern design workflows and processes. Or put more simply, she wanted to build a new kind of cloud storage that would serve as an alternative to Dropbox and Google Drive “built by, and for, creatives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2020, Ko (CEO) teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Zirbel (CTO) to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launch San Francisco-based </span><a href="https://www.playbook.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which she describes as the “Dropbox for designers,” to tackle the challenge. And today, the startup has emerged from stealth and announced it has raised $4 million in a seed funding round led by Founders Fund at a $20 million post-money valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors in the round include Abstract, Inovia, Maple, Basis Set, Backend, Wilson Sonsini and a number of angels, including Opendoor co-founder and CEO Eric Wu, Gusto co-founder Eddie Kim and SV Angel&#8217;s Beth Turner.</span></p>
<p>In a nutshell, Playbook claims it can automatically imports, tags, categorizes an organization&#8217;s entire media library, in minutes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When starting out, the first thing Playbook set out to do was attempt to reinvent the way folders exist for assets, with subfolders underneath. And then, the company set about trying to change the way people share files. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since so much is done over email and Slack these days, version control becomes even more difficult,” Ko told TechCrunch. So Playbook, she said, has built a storage system that can be accessed by all parties as opposed to just sending files via different channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For years, these assets have been dropped into what feels like a file cabinet,” Ko said. “But these days, sharing assets is much more collaborative and there’s different kinds of parties involved such as freelancers and contractors. So who is managing these files, and controlling the versions has become very complex.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playbook offers 4TB of free storage, which Ko says is 266 times the free version of Google Storage and 2,000 times that of Dropbox</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The hope is that this encourages users to use its platform as an all-around creative hub without worrying about running out of storage space. It also a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">utomatically scans, organizes and tags files and has worked to make it easier to browse files and folders visually.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194268" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194268" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2194268 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0-Playbook-Team-e1629938420572.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194268" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Playbook</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Playbook opened a beta version of its product to the design community and got about 1,000 users in two months. People continued to sign up and the company at one point had to close the beta so that it could manage all the new users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it has about 10,000 users signed up in beta. Early users include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individual freelancers to design teams at companies like Fast, Folx and Literati.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seven-person company wants to focus on getting the product “right” before attempting to monetize and launch to enterprises (which will likely happen next year), Ko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Playbook is focused on the needs of freelancers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company believes that the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/freelance-work-grows-amid-covid-19-math-stats-game-hiring-in-demand.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponential growth of freelancers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post-pandemic means “cloud storage needs to be smarter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to first solve that use case, and unlock the problem from the bottom up,” Ko told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, another strategy behind that initial focus is that freelancers can also introduce Playbook to the companies and enterprises they work for, so the marketing then becomes built into the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They can transfer assets and files through Playbook to their clients, who tend to adopt,” she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Playbook is helping manage over 2 million assets and says it has “hundreds of waitlist sign-ups” every month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Zirbel said the startup wants to branch out into i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mage scanning, similarity, content detection, previewing and long-term cloud storage and tons of integrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are lots of interesting technology challenges when you focus on the creative side of cloud storage,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Fund’s John Luttig said when the firm first met Ko and Zirbel last year, it was “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clear that they had a depth of understanding and thoughtfulness around file management” that his firm hadn’t seen before. Plus, in his view, there has been very little innovation in cloud storage since Dropbox launched in 2007. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The product leverages modern design, collaboration principles, and artificial intelligence to make file management much faster and easier,” he wrote via email. “Given their design-centric backgrounds, they’re extremely well-positioned to rethink the user experience for file systems from the ground up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playbook, he said, is able to leverage recent advancements in computer vision and design “to build a far better product to manage and share files.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Good news, TechCrunch family, <a href="https://twitter.com/sabakarimm">Techstars&#8217; Saba Karim</a> is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt (September 21-23)</a> this year.</p>

It&#8217;s a popular topic not only because of how important decks remain in today&#8217;s venture capital world, but also because what they should contain slowly changes over time &#8212; what not to include, as well.</p>
<p>Karim has a background in making people pay attention. Before he had his current role at Techstars, he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabakarim/">CMO at Evolve</a>, for example. Earlier in his career, Karim helped found and run Rawberry in Australia, before working for Telstra. He was also the marketing director at T.H. Capital Ventures in Sydney, before jetting to Boston to work as the VP of growth at StartupCMO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">St. Louis-based grocery chain Schnucks (one of those “With a name like Smucker&#8217;s, it has to be good” situations, one imagines) <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/26/2287087/0/en/Schnuck-Markets-Becomes-World-s-First-Grocer-to-Deploy-Intelligence-Robots-Chainwide.html">announced this week</a> that it will be deploying technology from Simbe Robotics across its 111 U.S. locations.</p>
<p>The deal comes a year and a half into a global pandemic that has substantially increased interest in automation, particularly around essential businesses &#8212; a qualifier that certainly applies to grocery stores.</p>
<p>Simbe’s mobile robots provide inventory scanning, offering a constantly updating picture of what’s on the store shelves and what needs to be restocked. Anyone who’s ever worked retail can almost certainly tell you that doing inventory is one of the biggest headaches in the industry, often requiring hours-long shutdowns or overnight marathons to complete.</p>
<p>The &#8220;multi-year&#8221; chain-wide rollout comes four years after Schnucks first began piloting the tech. Over the years, the partnership has gradually expanded. Simbe says its shelf-scanning Tally robot is capable of reducing out of stock items by 20-30% and can detect 14 times more missing inventory than traditional human scanning.</p>

Photographed on Friday, Aug. 13, 2021, in Des Peres, Mo. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Simbe</p></div></p>
<p>“By deploying Tally to all stores, we are fully operationalizing these insights into our supply chain and expanding our ability to leverage real-time data to make revenue impacting decisions,” Schnucks VP Dave Steck said in a release. “Tally has become an integral component of our stores, streamlining operations and ultimately creating a better store experience for our customers and teammates.”</p>
<p>A number of companies are working to automate the world of inventory scanning, including Brain Corp and Bossa Nova, though the latter was dealt a massive setback when Walmart ended a large contract at the end of 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Which terms come to mind when you think about SaaS?</p>
<p>&#8220;Solutions,&#8221; &#8220;cutting-edge,&#8221; &#8220;scalable&#8221; and &#8220;innovative&#8221; are just a sample of the overused jargon lurking around every corner of the techverse, with SaaS marketers the world over seemingly singing from the same hymn book.</p>
<p>Sadly for them, new research has proven that such jargon-heavy copy — along with unclear features and benefits — is deterring customers and cutting down conversions. Around 57% of users want to see improvements in the clarity and navigation of websites, suggesting that techspeak and unnecessarily complex UX are turning customers away at the door, according to <a href="https://www.creative-copywriter.net/saas-marketers-its-time-to-tune-up-your-2021-strategy">The SaaS Engine</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not to say SaaS marketers aren’t trying: Seventy percent of those surveyed have been making big adjustments to their websites, and 33% have updated their content. So how and why are they missing the mark?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			They say there’s no bigger slave to fashion than someone determined to avoid it, and SaaS marketing is no different. To truly stand out, you need to do thorough competitor analysis.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There are three common blunders that most SaaS marketers make time and again when it comes to clarity and high-converting content:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not differentiating from competitors.</li>
<li>Not humanizing &#8220;tech talk.&#8221;</li>
<li>Not tuning their messaging to prospects’ stage of awareness at the appropriate stage of the funnel.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re going to unpack what the research suggests and the steps you can take to avoid these common pitfalls.</p>
<h2>Blending into the competition</h2>
<p>It’s a jungle out there. But while camouflage might be key to surviving in the wild, in the crowded SaaS marketplace, it’s all about standing out. Let’s be honest: How many SaaS homepages have you visited that look the same? How many times have you read about &#8220;innovative tech-driven solutions that will revolutionize your workflow&#8221;?</p>
<p>The research has found that of those using SaaS at work, 76% are now on more platforms or using existing ones more intensively than last year. And as always, with increased demand comes a boom in competition, so it’s never been more important to stand out. Rather than imitating the same old phrases and copy your competitors are using, it&#8217;s time to reach your audience with originality, empathy and striking clarity.</p>
<p>But how do you do that?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Picsart COO Tammy Nam said it was now past a $100 million run rate, and that it was worth more than $1 billion after the SoftBank round. That was the extent of our ability to mine her for details.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://picsart.com/">Picsart</a> announced this morning that it has raised a $130 million round led by SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2. The new capital infusion pushes the company&#8217;s valuation north of the $1 billion mark, though it declined to get more specific.</p>
<p>Per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>, the company&#8217;s preceding round of capital, in 2019, valued the company at around $600 million. We can infer from the two figures that Picsart&#8217;s valuation went up materially in its latest round.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not incredibly hard to figure out why. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">chatted with the company earlier this year</a>, noting that it was over the $50 million ARR mark, and that the company expected to crest the $100 million ARR threshold this year. The company said today it has surpassed that goal. Precisely how far? The company would not disclose.</p>
<p>Picsart COO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammynam/">Tammy Nam</a> told TechCrunch in an interview this week that her company was now past a $100 million run rate, and that it was worth more than a flat $1.0 billion after the SoftBank round. That was the extent of our ability to mine her for details.</p>
<p>What we can say, then, is that the company is doing nine figures of revenue that start with one, and that it is worth ten figures that also start with a one. That gives Picsart a maximum revenue multiple of just under 20x, though we expect the correct figure is in the low tens.</p>
<p>What makes the Picsart news fun, apart from its constituent large numbers, is that its product is quite cool. That&#8217;s something that we can&#8217;t say about most unicorns that we write about here at TechCrunch. The company builds mobile and desktop image and video editing tools for consumers and professionals alike, which means that you have likely seen work created by its tools in the wild. And frankly, because they are something that anyone can use &#8212; unlike, say, HR-focused APIs or what have you &#8212; it&#8217;s a startup that feels more tangible than most.</p>
<p>Picsart provides both free and paid services. Its paid products include more images for users to work with &#8212; watermark removal and the like. The company also offers a teams-focused plan with multi-seat purchase options, though Nam said that because her team had not yet publicized the option to their user base, it&#8217;s too early to tell how the product is faring. It&#8217;s effectively in beta, she explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More broadly, the company&#8217;s monetization efforts are succeeding. We can tell that from Picsart&#8217;s revenue growth. Happily, Nam provided a bit more context, saying that the company had millions of subscribers today. She sees more room for growing, explaining that if her company tripled its gross subscriber number, the resulting cohort would still be a &#8220;drop in the bucket&#8221; when compared to its active user tally. There again, Picscart was somewhat coy with the data. It previously said that it had reached 100 million monthly actives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/creative-focused-app-picsart-hits-100m-maus-attracting-brands-tired-of-trolls/">in October of 2017</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/creative-focused-app-picsart-hits-100m-maus-attracting-brands-tired-of-trolls/">130 million in 2019</a> and around 150 million earlier this year. Picsart would only say that it has <em>more</em> than 150 million today.</p>
<p>Turning to the company&#8217;s revenue mix between consumers and business users, Nam stressed that the dividing line between the two is especially blurry among Generation Z, which by our understanding is a key Picsart user demographic. That makes it difficult to parse the precise revenue mix at the company today. However, Nam told TechCrunch that its business revenue represented around 30% of total revenue in an interview earlier this year, which provides directional guidance for us today.</p>
<p>She also noted in our recent chat that business usage of Picsart was rising, as SMBs became increasingly digital in the COVID-19 era. How that shift in market demand will impact Picsart&#8217;s revenue mix over time should prove interesting.</p>
<p>So, what about an IPO? Sadly, that was likely just delayed. It&#8217;s great news for Picasart that it raised so much new capital, but for those of us hungry to get more S-1s, and more quickly, such large capital events can delay liquidity as the company in question wants to put the new funds to work.</p>
<p>Still, provided an even medium growth rate, we&#8217;d hazard that Picsart won&#8217;t struggle to match its final private valuation when it does file. We just want that to happen quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airbnb announced on Thursday it will allow anyone with available space to sign up to provide housing for Afghan refugees. The new initiative aims to build upon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/airbnb-to-provide-free-temporary-housing-for-20000-afghan-refugees/">Airbnb’s initial commitment</a> to provide free temporary housing for 20,000 Afghan refugees.</p>
<p>The company says existing Airbnb hosts and anyone else can sign up to provide free or discounted stays to Afghan refugees through its dedicated <a href="https://www.airbnb.org/">website for emergency housing</a>. Airbnb notes it waives its fees on all refugee stays. For those who are unable to open up their homes but are still eager to help, Airbnb says they can aid the crisis by donating money to support housing for Afghan refugees.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Airbnb announced its initial commitment to house 20,000 Afghan refugees and said the company will cover the costs for the housing, using funds from contributions to its nonprofit Airbnb.org and a specific Refugee Fund established by that division, as well as personal contributions from Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky himself.</p>

<p>“Since the announcement, we have received enormous interest from people within the Airbnb community and beyond looking for ways to support Airbnb and Airbnb.org’s work with partner organizations to house Afghan refugees. In many cases, we have heard from people who want to offer their space free of charge,” the company said <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/how-to-support-afghan-refugees/">in a statement.</a> “​​The response has been overwhelming and today we’re sharing more details on how people can help us expand on efforts to meet this unprecedented need for temporary, emergency stays for refugees arriving from Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>Airbnb.org and Airbnb are also extending support to the federal government, along with states and cities that have expressed interest in receiving refugees to help provide stays as needed.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s housing initiatives come at a time when tens of thousands of people are attempting to flee Afghanistan. Amid the crisis, companies and governments are facing increasing pressure to aid refugees fleeing the country. There are currently nearly 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan, according to the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/afghanistan.html">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is infamous for spinning up products and killing them off, often in very short order. It&#8217;s an annoying enough habit when it&#8217;s stuff like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/">messaging apps</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/google-shuts-down-its-internal-stadia-game-studios/">games</a>. But the tech giant&#8217;s ambitions stretch into many domains that touch human lives these days. Including, most directly, healthcare. And &#8212; it turns out &#8212; so does Google&#8217;s tendency to kill off products that its PR has previously touted as &#8220;life saving&#8221;.</p>
<p>To wit: Following a recent reconfiguration of Google&#8217;s health efforts &#8212; reported earlier by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-health-shutting-down-david-feinberg-leaves-2021-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider </a>&#8212; the tech giant confirmed to TechCrunch that it is decommissioning its clinician support app, Streams.</p>
<p>The app, which Google Health <a href="https://health.google/for-clinicians/streams/">PR</a> bills as a &#8220;mobile medical device&#8221;, was developed back in 2015 by DeepMind, an AI division of Google &#8212; and has been used by the U.K.&#8217;s National Health Service in the years since, with a number of NHS Trusts inking deals with DeepMind Health to roll out Streams to their clinicians.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, one NHS Trust &#8212; London&#8217;s Royal Free &#8212; is still using the app in its hospitals.</p>
<p>But, presumably, not for too much longer, since Google is in the process of taking Streams out back to be shot and tossed into its deadpool &#8212; alongside the likes of its ill-fated social network, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/looking-back-at-google/">Google+,</a> and Internet balloon company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/">Loon</a>, to name just two of a frankly endless list of now defunct Alphabet/Google products.</p>
<p>Other NHS Trusts we contacted which had previously rolled out Streams told us they have already stopped using the app.</p>
<p>University College London NHS Trust confirmed to TechCrunch that it severed ties with Google Health earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our agreement with Google Health (initially DeepMind) came to an end in March 2021 as originally planned. Google Health deleted all the data it held at the end of the [Streams] project,&#8221; a UCL NHS Trust spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust also told us it stopped using Streams this summer (in July) &#8212; and said patient data is in the process of being deleted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Following the decommissioning of <span class="il">Streams</span> at the Trust earlier this summer, data that has been processed by Google Health to provide the service to the Trust will be deleted and the agreement has been terminated,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As per the data sharing agreement, any patient data that has been processed by Google Health to provide the service will be deleted. The deletion process is started once the agreement has been terminated,&#8221; they added, saying the contractual time frame for Google deleting patient data is six months.</p>
<p>Another Trust, Taunton &amp; <span class="il">Somerset, also confirmed its involvement with Streams had already ended. </span></p>
<p>The Streams contracts DeepMind inked with the NHS Trusts were for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/deepmind-health-inks-another-5-year-nhs-app-deal-in-face-of-ongoing-controversy/">five years</a> &#8212; so these contracts were likely approaching the end of their terms, anyway.</p>
<p>Contract extensions would have had to be agreed by both parties. And Google&#8217;s decision to decommission Streams may be factoring in a lack of enthusiasm from involved Trusts to continue using the software &#8212; although if that&#8217;s the case it may, in turn, be a reflection of Trusts&#8217; perceptions of Google&#8217;s weak commitment to the project.</p>
<p>Neither side is saying much publicly.</p>
<p>But as far as we&#8217;re aware the Royal Free is the only NHS Trust still using the clinician support app as Google prepares to cut off Stream&#8217;s life support.</p>
<h2>No more Streams?</h2>
<p>The Streams story has plenty of wrinkles, to put it politely.</p>
<p>For one thing, despite being developed by Google&#8217;s AI division &#8212; and despite DeepMind founder Mustafa Suleyman saying the goal for the project was to <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/predicting-patient-deterioration">find ways to integrate AI</a> into Streams so the app could generate predictive healthcare alerts &#8212; the Streams app doesn&#8217;t involve any artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>An algorithm in Streams alerts doctors to the risk of a patient developing acute kidney injury but relies on an existing AKI (acute kidney injury) algorithm developed by the NHS. So Streams essentially digitized and mobilized existing practice.</p>
<p>As a result, it always looked odd that an AI division of an adtech giant would be so interested in building, provisioning and supporting clinician support software over the long term. But then &#8212; as it panned out &#8212; neither DeepMind nor Google were in it for the long haul at the patient&#8217;s bedside.</p>
<p>DeepMind and the NHS Trust it worked with to develop Streams (the aforementioned Royal Free) started out with wider ambitions for their partnership &#8212; as detailed in an early 2016 memo we reported on, which set out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/nhs-memo-details-googledeepminds-five-year-plan-to-bring-ai-to-healthcare/">five-year plan to bring AI to healthcare</a>. Plus, as we noted above, Suleyman kept up the push for years &#8212; <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/predicting-patient-deterioration">writing</a> later in 2019 that: &#8220;Streams doesn’t use artificial intelligence at the moment, but the team now intends to find ways to safely integrate predictive AI models into Streams in order to provide clinicians with intelligent insights into patient deterioration.&#8221;</p>
<p>A key misstep for the project emerged in 2017 &#8212; through press reporting of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/deepmind-nhs-health-data-deal-had-no-lawful-basis/">data scandal</a>, as details of the full scope of the Royal Free-DeepMind data-sharing partnership were published by <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086454-revealed-google-ai-has-access-to-huge-haul-of-nhs-patient-data/">New Scientist</a> (which used a freedom of information request to obtain contracts the pair had not made public).</p>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s data protection watchdog went on to find that the Royal Free had not had a valid legal basis when it passed information on millions of patients&#8217; to DeepMind during the development phase of Streams.</p>
<p>Which perhaps explains DeepMind&#8217;s eventually cooling ardour for a project it had initially thought &#8212; with the help of a willing NHS partner &#8212; would provide it with free and easy access to a rich supply of patient data for it to train up healthcare AIs which it would then be, seemingly, perfectly positioned to sell back into the self same service in future years. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/20/deepmind-wants-its-healthcare-ai-to-charge-by-results-but-first-it-needs-your-data/">Price tbc</a>.</p>
<p>No one involved in that thought had properly studied the detail of U.K. healthcare data regulation, clearly.</p>
<p>Or &#8212; most importantly &#8212; bothered to consider fundamental patient expectations about their private information.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bw1VA2lb4c"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/deepmind-nhs-health-data-deal-had-no-lawful-basis/">DeepMind NHS health data deal had &#8216;no lawful basis&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DeepMind NHS health data deal had &#8216;no lawful basis&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/deepmind-nhs-health-data-deal-had-no-lawful-basis/embed/#?secret=bw1VA2lb4c" data-secret="bw1VA2lb4c" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So it was not <em>actually</em> surprising when, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/13/deepmind-hands-off-role-as-health-app-provider-to-parent-google/">2018</a>, DeepMind announced that it was stepping away from Streams &#8212; handing the app (and all its data) to Google Health &#8212; Google&#8217;s internal health-focused division &#8212; which went on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/google-completes-controversial-takeover-of-deepmind-health/">complete its takeover of DeepMind Health in 2019</a>. (Although it was still shocking, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/google-gobbling-deepminds-health-app-might-be-the-trust-shock-we-need/">as we opined at the time</a>.)</p>
<p>It was Google Health that Suleyman suggested would be carrying forward the work to bake AI into Streams, writing at the time of the takeover that: &#8220;The combined experience, infrastructure and expertise of DeepMind Health teams alongside Google’s will help us continue to develop mobile tools that can support more clinicians, address critical patient safety issues and could, we hope, save thousands of lives globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>A particular irony attached to the Google Health takeover bit of the Streams saga is the fact that DeepMind had, when under fire over its intentions toward patient data, claimed people&#8217;s medical information would never be touched by its adtech parent.</p>
<p>Until of course it went on to hand the whole project off to Google &#8212; and then lauded the transfer as great news for clinicians and patients!</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s takeover of Streams meant NHS Trusts that wanted to continue using the app had to ink new contracts directly with Google Health. And all those that had rolled out the app did so. It&#8217;s not like they had much choice if they did want to continue.</p>
<p>Again, jump forward a couple of years and it&#8217;s Google Health now suddenly facing a major reorg &#8212; with Streams in the frame for the chop as part of Google&#8217;s perpetually reconfiguring project priorities.</p>
<p>It is quite the ignominious ending to an already infamous project.</p>
<p>DeepMind&#8217;s involvement with the NHS had previously been seized upon by the U.K. government &#8212; with former health secretary, Matt Hancock, trumpeting an AI research partnership between the company and Moorfield’s Eye Hospital as an exemplar of the kind of data-driven innovation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/uk-health-minister-sets-out-tech-first-vision-for-future-care-provision/">he suggested would transform healthcare service provision in the U.K</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily for Hancock he didn&#8217;t pick Streams as his example of great &#8220;healthtech&#8221; innovation. (Moorfields confirmed to us that its research-focused partnership with Google Health is continuing.)</p>
<p>The hard lesson here appears to be don&#8217;t bet the nation&#8217;s health on an adtech giant that plays fast and loose with people&#8217;s data and doesn&#8217;t think twice about pulling the plug on digital medical devices as internal politics dictate another chair-shuffling reorg.</p>
<p>Patient data privacy advocacy group, <a href="https://medconfidential.org">MedConfidential</a> &#8212; a key force in warning over the scope of the Royal Free&#8217;s DeepMind data-sharing deal &#8212; urged Google to ditch the spin and come clean about the Streams cock-up, once and for all.</p>
<p>“Streams is the Windows Vista of Google &#8212; a legacy it hopes to forget,&#8221; MedConfidential&#8217;s Sam Smith told us. &#8220;The NHS relies on trustworthy suppliers, but companies that move on after breaking things create legacy problems for the NHS, as we saw with wannacry. Google should admit the decision, delete the data, and learn that experimenting on patients is regulated for a reason.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Questions over Royal Free&#8217;s ongoing app use</h2>
<p>Despite the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office&#8217;s 2017 finding that the Royal Free&#8217;s original data-sharing deal with DeepMind was improper, it&#8217;s notable that the London Trust stuck with Streams &#8212; continuing to pass data to DeepMind.</p>
<p>The original patient databset that was shared with DeepMind without a valid legal basis was never ordered to be deleted. Nor &#8212; presumably has it since been deleted. Hence the weight of the call for Google to delete the data now.</p>
<p>Ironically the improperly acquired data should (in theory) finally get deleted &#8212; once contractual timeframes for any final back-up purges elapse &#8212; but only because it&#8217;s Google itself planning to switch off Streams.</p>
<p>And yet the Royal Free confirmed to us that it is still using Streams, even as Google spins the dial on its commercial priorities for the umpteenth time and decides it&#8217;s not interested in this particular bit of clinician support, after all.</p>
<p>We put a number of questions to the Trust &#8212; including about the deletion of patient data &#8212; none of which it responded to.</p>
<p>Instead, two days later, it sent us this one-line statement which raises plenty more questions &#8212; saying only that: &#8220;The Streams app has not been decommissioned for the Royal Free London and our clinicians continue to use it for the benefit of patients in our hospitals.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not clear how long the Trust will be able to use an app Google is decommissioning. Nor how wise that might be for patient safety &#8212; such as if the app won&#8217;t get necessary security updates, for example.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also asked Google how long it will continue to support the Royal Free&#8217;s usage &#8212; and when it plans to finally switch off the service. As well as which internal group will be responsible for any SLA requests coming from the Royal Free as the Trust continues to use software Google Health is decommissioning &#8212; and will update this report with any response. (Earlier a Google spokeswoman told us the Royal Free would continue to use Streams for the &#8220;near future&#8221; &#8212; but she did not offer a specific end date.)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://telecareaware.com/breaking-google-health-shutting-down-most-employees-scattered-to-other-divisions/">press reports</a> this month on the Google Health reorg &#8212; covering an internal memo first obtained by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-health-shutting-down-david-feinberg-leaves-2021-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a> &#8212; teams working on various Google health projects were reported to be being split up to other areas, including some set to report into Google&#8217;s search and AI teams.</p>
<p>So which Google group will take over responsibility for the handling of the SLA with the Royal Free, as a result of the Google Health reshuffle, is an interesting question.</p>
<p>In earlier comments, Google&#8217;s spokeswoman told us the new structure for its reconfigured health efforts &#8212; which are still being badged &#8220;Google Health&#8221; &#8212; will encompass all its work in health and wellness, including Fitbit, as well as AI health research, Google Cloud and more.</p>
<p>On Streams specifically, she said the app hasn&#8217;t made the cut because when Google assimilated D<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">eepMind Health it decided to focus its efforts on another digital offering for clinicians &#8212; called <a href="https://health.google/for-clinicians/care-studio/">Care Studio</a> &#8212; which it&#8217;s currently piloting with two U.S. health systems (namely: Ascension &amp; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). </span></p>
<p>And anyone who&#8217;s ever tried to use a Google messaging app will surely have strong feelings of déjà vu on reading that&#8230;</p>
<p>DeepMind&#8217;s co-founder, meanwhile, appears to have remained blissfully ignorant of Google&#8217;s intentions to ditch Streams in favor of Care Studio &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/mustafasuleymn/status/1174342121450401792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1174342121450401792%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2019%2F09%2F19%2Fgoogle-completes-controversial-takeover-of-deepmind-health%2F">tweeting</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/google-completes-controversial-takeover-of-deepmind-health/">back in 2019</a> as Google completed the takeover of DeepMind Health that he had been &#8220;proud to be part of this journey&#8221;, and also touting &#8220;huge progress delivered already, and so much more to come for this incredible team&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the end, Streams isn&#8217;t being &#8220;supercharged&#8221; (or levelled up to use current faddish political parlance) with AI &#8212; as his 2019 blog post had envisaged &#8212; Google is simply taking it out of service. Like it did with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/17/crunchweek-google-reader-samsung-s4-dropbox-mailbox/">Reader</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/farewell-allo/">Allo</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/15/google-kills-its-tango-augmented-reality-platform-shifting-focus-to-arcore/">Tango</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/google-play-music-to-shut-down-starting-in-september-will-disappear-by-december/">Google Play Music</a>, or&#8230;. well, the list goes on.</p>
<p>Suleyman&#8217;s own story contains some wrinkles, too.</p>
<p>He is no longer at DeepMind but has himself been &#8220;folded into&#8221; Google &#8212; joining as a VP of artificial intelligence policy, after initially being placed on an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-21/google-deepmind-co-founder-placed-on-leave-from-ai-lab">extended leave of absence from DeepMind</a>.</p>
<p>In January, allegations that he had bullied staff were reported by the <a href="https://archive.is/TcMvW">WSJ</a>. And then, earlier this month, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/deepmind-mustafa-suleyman-google-allegations-bullying-settlements-2021-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a> expanded on that &#8212; reporting follow-up allegations that there had been confidential settlements between DeepMind and former employees who had worked under Suleyman and complained about his conduct (although DeepMind denied any knowledge of such settlements).</p>
<p>In a statement to Business Insider, Suleyman apologized for his past behavior &#8212; and said that in 2019 he had &#8220;accepted feedback that, as a co-founder at DeepMind, I drove people too hard and at times my management style was not constructive&#8221;, adding that he had taken time out to start working with a coach and that that process had helped him &#8220;reflect, grow and learn personally and professionally&#8221;.</p>
<p>We asked Google if Suleyman would like to comment on the demise of Streams &#8212; and on his employer&#8217;s decision to kill the app &#8212; given his high hopes for the project and all the years of work he put into that particular health push. But the company did not engage with the request.</p>
<p>We also offered Suleyman the chance to comment directly. We&#8217;ll update this story if he responds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most fascinating aspects of Boston Dynamics’ transition into a commercial organization is watching the company &#8212; and its partners &#8212; figure out real-world jobs for Spot. There’s no question that the tech is impressive, but there’s always been the broader subject of usefulness beyond the company’s initial purpose of serving as off-road pack mules.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some interesting examples since Spot first went on sale, including inspection for constructions sites and potentially dangerous settings &#8212; from nuclear power plants to off-shore oil rigs. There have also been some, shall we say, more controversial gigs, including Spot’s time as an electronic K9 for the NYPD.</p>
<p>But maybe finding the perfect job for Spot entails thinking both outside the box and Earth’s gravitational pull. NASA’s JPL in California has been working with the quadrupedal robot for a couple of years now, first as part of a DARPA challenge and now as a potential way to explore extraterrestrial caves. For this week’s installment of Actuator, we spoke to JPL NeBula Autonomy Project lead Ali Agha about the partnership.</p>
<p><strong>How long has NASA been working with Spot?</strong></p>
<p>We have been working with the SPOT robots for about two years now. We initially integrated our NeBula autonomy and AI solutions on the Spot robot as one of our robots participating in the DARPA Subterranean challenge competition. However, since then we have extended the application of these robots and JPL’s NeBula autonomy solution to planetary cave exploration and surface exploration as well as terrestrial disaster response and mining efforts.</p>
<p><strong>What is the advantage of using legs (as opposed to wheels) on the Martian surface?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a no-road terrain on Earth. The ability to walk will allow traversing different elements of such a terrain much better than a typical wheeled vehicle. Similarly, legged locomotion can potentially enable totally new missions when exploring extreme and challenging terrains on planetary bodies in the solar system beyond our home planet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_HpWIhFFD54?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How closely does NASA/JPL work with a company like Boston Dynamics on a project like this?</strong></p>
<p>We have had an amazing collaboration with Boston Dynamics and work closely with them. On our project, JPL and Boston Dynamics’ efforts are highly synergistic. At JPL, we develop autonomy and AI solutions (called NeBula) acting as the robot brain to enable fully autonomous exploration of extreme and challenging environments with very minimal (to none) prior information about the terrain or environmental conditions.</p>
<p>NeBula is agnostic to the choice of robotic platform and can be used on wheeled rovers, legged platforms, as well as drones. On the other hand, Boston Dynamics is developing cutting-edge incredible robotic locomotion systems that can maintain the stability of the system over extreme environments. As a result, the combination of an autonomy solution like NeBula with a capable locomotion system like Boston Dynamics’ Spot opens up avenues for totally new classes of planetary and terrestrial missions.</p>
<p><strong>I know autonomy is a big piece of this. Do the robots need to be able to function with no human intervention?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, autonomy is the main focus of our project. In planetary exploration, specifically, when exploring underground caves, there is no, or very minimal, prior information about the environment. Further, when robots enter the cave, they typically lose communication with the surface and are on their own to accomplish the mission objectives.</p>
<p>As a result, autonomy is a crucial capability to enable such missions to accomplish mission goals with no human intervention when the robot is out of communication exploring previously unseen terrains and environments. To this end, JPL has been developing autonomy and AI solutions (called NeBula) acting as the robot brain, which is now being paired with Boston Dynamics Spot robots as the robot body.</p>

<p>A bit closer to Earth (as in, roughly 100 to 150 feet above our heads), Alphabet’s Wing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/wing-approaches-100000-drone-deliveries-two-years-after-logan-australia-launch/">announced this week</a> that it’s approaching 100,000 drone deliveries two years after launching in the Brisbane-adjacent city of Logan, Australia. The announcement follows recent insight into Amazon’s struggles in the drone delivery space.</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch,” I think we’ll launch new services in Australia, Finland and the United States in the next six months. The capabilities of the technology are probably ahead of the regulatory permissions right now.”</p>

<p>A closer look at some of those 100,000 deliveries:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,000 cups of coffee</li>
<li>1,700 children’s snack packs</li>
<li>1,200 hot chooks (roasted chicken, in Australian)</li>
<li>2,700 sushi rolls</li>
<li>1,000 loaves of bread</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of food, LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">Coco just raised $36 million</a> for its delivery robots. The round brings its total funding up to $43 million. The UCLA spinout is currently piloting its 50-pound, remote-piloted robots in a variety of Los Angeles neighborhoods. The company tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are currently operating in Santa Monica and in five different L.A neighborhoods. Later this year we are expanding into a number of other major U.S. cities. We have partnered with national restaurant brands like SBE (Umami Burger) and are actively scaling across many locations, and we are serving a wide range of family operated restaurants like Bangkok West Thai in Santa Monica and San Pedro Brewing Company in Los Angeles. We are out of the pilot phase and are launching with dozens of new merchants every day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, California-based fast casual salad chain Sweetgreens <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/salad-chain-sweetgreen-buys-kitchen-robotics-startup-spyce/">just acquired Spyce</a>. Built by MIT alums, the company develops kitchen robotics, which it has rolled out in a pair of Boston-based restaurants. Sweetgreens eventually plans to implement these in some of its 120+ locations, though no timeline has been given as of yet.</p>

<p>In this week’s small-ray-of-sunshine-in-an-otherwise-horrifying-situation news, a team of young women roboticists <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/americas/afghanistan-women-robotics-team-intl-scli/index.html">managed to evacuate Kabul</a> amid the Taliban takeover. The team has found refuge in Mexico on a 180-day humanitarian visa, with an option to extend their stay.</p>
<p>“From now on forward we will have opportunities for many more achievements in our lives, and thus be part of the fight for a better life,&#8221; team member Fatemah Qaderyan said at a press conference on their arrival in the country. &#8220;Although we are far from our homes, we will always be united and thanks to your help we will achieve it, thank you very much, we really appreciate having all our things here in Mexico with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team also <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/12/trump-afghan-girls-robots-240474">made international headlines in 2017</a>, as they entered the U.S. on a 10-day “parole,” in spite of the Trump administration’s executive order banning entry from predominately Muslim countries.</p>

<p>Before we go, a thought on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/">Tesla robot</a>. Or, rather, a story. A few years ago, I was asked to be on a panel discussing robots for a group of people who weren’t really familiar with the field. That’s fine. There’s a lot to be said for getting outside your comfort zone. At the end, we opened things up to Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>As is nearly always the case with these things, the first question &#8212; well, it wasn’t a question really. It was more of a laundry list of things the asker would like to see a robot do. She went on to describe a small drone that flies from surface to surface, cleaning different parts of the house. I told her it sounded great, and I’d love to see her invent it.</p>

<p>Point is, I think the vast majority of people outside of robotics have an entirely unrealistic idea of what’s possible with technology today. There’s a reason iRobot spent the better part of a decade banging its head against the wall, working out a robot that can vacuum floors. There’s also a reason that the Roomba is really the only semi-ubiquitous home robot. Always be wary of robots announced onstage as a press event.</p>
<p>I’m not saying a Tesla robot is impossible. I’m just saying we have to temper our expectations of what is. Sometimes you go in expecting a robot and get someone in a spandex onesie doing the Dougie:</p>
