										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robots are no longer the high-tech tools reserved for university labs, e-commerce giants and buzzy Silicon Valley startups. The local grocer now has access too.</span></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tortoise-eca6" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tortoise-eca6">Tortoise, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the one-year-old Silicon Valley startup known for its remote repositioning electric scooters, has taken its tech and adapted it to delivery carts. The company recently partnered with online grocery platform Self Point to provide neighborhood stores and specialty brand shops with electric carts that — with help from remote teleoperators — deliver goods to local consumers.</p>
<p>The companies have launched the product offering in Los Angeles with three customers. Each customer, which includes Kosher Express, has two to three carts that can be used to make deliveries up to a three-mile radius from the store. Unlike the network models used by some autonomous sidewalk delivery companies, grocery stores lease the delivery carts and are responsible for storage, charging and packing it up with goods that their customers have ordered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The initial Self Point/Tortoise launch is small. But it has the makings of expanding far beyond Los Angeles. More importantly for Tortoise, it&#8217;s a validation of the company&#8217;s larger vision to make remote repositioning a horizontal business with numerous applications.</p>
<p>Tortoise started by equipping electric scooters with cameras, electronics and firmware that allow teleoperators in distant locales to drive the micromobility devices to a rider or deliver it back to its proper parking spot. Now, it has taken that same hardware and software and used it to build its own delivery cart.</p>
<p>Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko has said the company&#8217;s remote repositioning kit can be used for security and cleaning bots as well as electric wheelchairs and other accessibility devices. He&#8217;s even fielded inquiries from farmers interested in using remote repositioning scooters to monitor crops.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a practical point of view we&#8217;re not trying to not be everywhere overnight, but there&#8217;s really no technological constraint for us,&#8221; Shevelenko said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The emergence of COVID-19 and its effects on consumer behavior prompted Tortoise to home in on delivery carts as its second act.</p>
<p>&#8220;We kind of quickly realized that we&#8217;re living in a once-in-a-generation change in consumer behavior where now everything is online and people are expecting it to be delivered same day,&#8221; Shevelenko said. Tortoise was able to go from the first renderings in May to a delivery cart launch by the fourth quarter because of its ability to repurpose its hardware, software and workforce.</p>
<p>The company still remains bullish on its initial application in micromobility. Earlier this year, Tortoise, GoX and and tech incubator Curiosity Labs launched a six-month pilot in Peachtree Corners, Georgia that allows riders to use an app to hail a scooter. The scooters are outfitted with Tortoise&#8217;s tech. Once riders hail the scooter, a Tortoise employee hundreds of miles away remote controls the scooter to the user. After riders complete trips, the scooters drive themselves back to a safe parking spot. From there, GoX employees charge and sanitize the scooters and then mark them with a sticker that indicates they have been properly cleaned.</p>
<p>While partnership with Self Point is Tortoise&#8217;s next big project, Shevelenko was quick to note that the company is only focused on one slice of the on-demand delivery pie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low speeds and hot foods don&#8217;t work too well,&#8221; he said. Startups such as Kiwibot and Starship have smaller robots that focus on that market, Shevelenko added. Tortoise&#8217;s delivery carts were designed specifically to hold large amounts of groceries, alcohol and other goods.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw kind of a big opening in grocery,&#8221; he said, adding that relying on remote operators and its kit is a low-cost combination that can be used today while automated technology continues to develop. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing for last-mile delivery what globalized call centers did for customer support.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">France is going forward with its plan to tax big tech companies. The government has sent out notices to tech giants, as reported by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2cfe3d07-7e69-4f57-b634-8b6002f967cb">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-usa-tax/france-orders-tech-giants-to-pay-digital-tax-idUKKBN28522M">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/internet/reseaux-sociaux/facebook/malgre-les-menaces-de-sanctions-de-washington-la-taxe-gafa-sera-bien-prelevee-en-2020-confirme-paris_4195055.html">AFP</a>. There could be retaliation tariffs on French goods in the U.S.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, France’s Economy Minister <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bruno-le-maire" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bruno-le-maire">Bruno Le Maire <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been pushing hard for a tax reform. Many economy ministers in Europe think tech companies aren’t taxed properly. They generate revenue in one country, but report to tax authorities in another country. They take advantage of countries with low corporate tax to optimize the bottom line.</p>
<p>Le Maire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/05/european-union-plans-to-tax-tech-giants-on-local-revenue/">first pitched</a> the idea of a European tax on big tech companies based on local revenue. But he failed to get support from other European countries — European tax policies require a unanimous decision from members of the European Union.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The French government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/france-doesnt-want-to-wait-for-european-tax-reform-to-tax-tech-giants/">chose not to wait</a> for other European countries and started working on its own local tax. There are two requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>You generate more than €750 million in revenue globally and €25 million in France.</li>
<li><em>And</em> you’re operating a marketplace (Amazon’s marketplace, Uber, Airbnb…) or an advertising business (Facebook, Google, Criteo…).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you meet those two requirements, you have to pay 3% of your French revenue in taxes.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">the OECD</a> has been working on a way to properly tax tech companies with a standardized set of rules that would work across the globe. But OECD members have yet to reach a compromise.</p>
<p>France and the U.S. have been arguing on and off for the past couple of years about the tech tax. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/us-and-france-reach-a-compromise-on-frances-tax-on-tech-giants/">August 2019</a>, then U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron reached a deal by promising that the French government would scrap the French tax as soon as the OECD finds a way to properly tax tech companies in countries where they operate.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/us-could-impose-100-tariffs-on-french-goods-following-frances-tax-on-tech-giants/">December 2019</a>, the U.S. promised 100% tariffs on French wine, cheese and handbags because the previous deal wasn&#8217;t good enough. In <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2cfe3d07-7e69-4f57-b634-8b6002f967cb">January 2020</a>, the two sides agreed to wait a little bit to see if the OECD framework would come through.</p>
<p>And here we are. According to the French government, OECD negotiations have failed, so it’s time to start collecting the French digital tax. Let’s s see how the U.S. reacts during the Trump-Biden transition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> makes a broad shift in strategy, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-25/ibm-planning-about-10-000-job-cuts-in-europe-ahead-of-unit-sale">Bloomberg reported this morning</a> that the company would be cutting around 10,000 jobs in Europe. This comes on the heels of last month&#8217;s announcement that the organization will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">spinning out its infrastructure services business</a> next year. While IBM wouldn&#8217;t confirm the layoffs, a spokesperson suggested there were broad structural changes ahead for the company as it concentrates fully on a hybrid cloud approach.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ibm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ibm">IBM <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had this to say in response to a request for comment on the Bloomberg report: &#8220;Our staffing decisions are made to provide the best support to our customers in adopting an open hybrid cloud platform and AI capabilities. We also continue to make significant investments in training and skills development for IBMers to best meet the needs of our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that means basically if you don&#8217;t have the currently required skill set, chances are you might not fit with the new version of IBM. IBM CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">Arvind Krishna alluded to the changing environment</a> in an interview with Jon Fortt at the CNBC Evolve Summit earlier this month when he said:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The Red Hat acquisition gave us the technology base on which to build a hybrid cloud technology platform based on open-source, and based on giving choice to our clients as they embark on this journey. With the success of that acquisition now giving us the fuel, we can then take the next step, and the larger step, of taking the managed infrastructure services out. So the rest of the company can be absolutely focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence.</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM CEO Arvind Krishna wants to completely transform his organization&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/embed/#?secret=fws8NlIkDa" data-secret="fws8NlIkDa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The story has always been the same around IBM layoffs, that as they make the transition to a new model, it requires eliminating positions that don&#8217;t fit into the new vision, and today&#8217;s report is apparently no different, says Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM is in the biggest transformation of the company&#8217;s history as it moves from services to software and specialized hardware with Quantum. That requires a different mix of skills in its employee base and the repercussions of that manifest itself in the layoffs that IBM has been doing, mostly quietly, for the last 5+ years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>None of this is easy for the people involved. It&#8217;s never a good time to lose your job, but the timing of this one feels worse. In the middle of a recession brought on by COVID, and as a second wave of the virus sweeps over Europe, it&#8217;s particularly difficult.</p>
<p>We have reported on a number of IBM layoffs over the last five years. In May, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/ibm-confirms-layoffs-are-happening-but-wont-provide-details/">confirmed layoffs</a>, but wouldn&#8217;t confirm numbers. In 2015, we reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/26/sources-say-ibm-planning-on-laying-off-12000-over-next-year/">a 12,000 employee layoff</a>.</p>

		Will Butler is a writer, producer and podcast host from California. Legally blind since age of 19, Will has written and produced numerous stories about adjusting to vision loss. Will joined <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/">Be My Eyes</a> as its VP in 2019 after four years at <a href="https://lighthouse-sf.org/">Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired</a> in San Francisco. You can listen to Will’s interviews with leaders from the world of blindness and accessibility on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/the-be-my-eyes-podcast/id1470367534">The Be My Eyes podcast</a> and the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/13-letters/id1498477431">13 Letters podcast</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was pronounced legally blind in 2009, I didn’t know one other person who called themselves blind – least of all “low vision” or “visually impaired.” Today, I manage the largest blindness community in the world, <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/">Be My Eyes</a>, a support platform where more than 4 million people and companies use live video to support users in almost 200 languages. And though the growth of our collective community is a crucial step making our lives better, it’s just one piece of what makes today, as I’ve heard many others say, “a great time to be blind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s because in the past 10 years, “sight tech” has taken off. What we might have once called “assistive” or “special needs” technology has gone mainstream – and the technology developed by and for people with disabilities is now used by you, your kids, your grandparents – regardless of whether you identify as having a disability or not.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sight tech – or more broadly, eyes-free tech – now touches every part of our lives and the devices that we depend on. And it’s not just blind and visually impaired people who are benefitting. It’s everyone. That’s why I’m pleased to be hosting the </span><a href="http://sighttechglobal.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first ever Sight Tech Global conference on December 2 and 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to sit down with the tech world’s most important figures in sight tech and talk about the past, present and future of how designing for the blind informs and affects all of our lives. </span>Registration is free; <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/conference-registration/">sign up today</a>.</p>
<h2>What is Sight Tech?</h2>
<p>Inventions to help the blind “see” have quietly been spurring innovation for decades. Often, idealistic inventors create with a charitable mindset – to help the needy or return something lost – but the real technological advances in sight tech have done a lot more than simply suggest a cure for human disability. They’ve created new abilities for everyone, and opened new doors to unpredictable innovation: The 12-inch record, the computer keyboard, and the text recognition software that laid the foundation for the modern database were all brought to market, initially, for blind consumers.</p>
<p>There was a time when a personal assistant, someone to read to you or a car at your door, were once thought of as “special” – but no longer. Today, every device shipped by Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft includes these capabilities and more, not as a bonus but as a necessity to compete in today’s competitive hardware and software markets. So whether you use your phone in dark mode or talk to Siri while you’re driving, you too use “sight tech” that was invented initially for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>Over and over again, designing for blind consumers has shown an ROI far beyond helping the needy. Audiobooks, which were heavily resisted by publishers when first developed for blind readers in 1934, now are the book industry’s only growing business. Likewise, coding your website for a blind person’s screen reader might seem like extra work until you realize it optimizes your SEO and makes your website more usable to about a billion other non-standard device users, as well. The world of sight tech is absolutely full of these types of happy surprises; unexpected synchronicities and wide applicability that started with designing for a seemingly small group.</p>
<p>Founded by former TechCrunch COO Ned Desmond earlier this year, <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/">Sight Tech Global</a> provides a new venue for those who are passionate about AI, blind tech, digital inclusion and equal access for all to gather and hear from the accessibility community’s greatest thinkers and doers. Best of all, this free, all-virtual conference is a benefit for the <a href="https://www.vistacenter.org/">Vista Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired</a> which has been helping individuals with blindness or low vision for the past 75 years.</p>
<p>Here’s a little preview of what we’ll be unveiling, cheering, arguing and dreaming about at Sight Tech Global. I hope you’ll join us! Here is a <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/">link to the full agenda</a>.</p>
<h2>Achieving perfect mobility</h2>
<p>For most, the self-driving car is a long-promised luxury. For those of us who can’t get a driver’s license, it’s the key to an unprecedented level of independence. Researchers at Waymo are intent on making sure that, when the first self-driving taxi arrives on your doorstep, it shouldn’t matter whether you can see or not: You should be able to hop in and take a ride.</p>
<p>Similarly, maps are much more than just a handy tool for those of us with visual impairments. In many cases, they’re the only option for finding your bearings – the difference between independence and codependence. Blind and sighted inventors alike have been pushing for better, more exact navigational tools for decades, and today the team at GOOD Maps has harnessed the power of lidar, data and and faster-than-ever processors to make sure that someone with no sight can get themselves within arm&#8217;s reach of exactly what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>Join product managers from Waymo, Waymap, Goodmaps and more to hear about the future of getting from point A to point B.</p>
<h2>The next talking computer</h2>
<p>Since the late 1980s, companies like Freedom Scientific and Humanware have laid the foundation for accessible computing, writing software and building devices that can convert visual information into sound or touch. Those devices were operating computers, rendering digital Braille and delivering audio books to readers long before there was an app for that.</p>
<p>Today, mainstream tech giants Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are creating screen readers and assistive devices of their own, not to mention the thousands of third-party apps for navigation, sensory optimization, recognizing text and images and more. And with this new functionality native to operating systems, established assistive tech companies are evolving, too.</p>
<p>We’ll take a deep dive into what’s next for the “screen reader” – and how new tech from AI to AR, and headgear to haptics are shaking up interfaces and reshaping paradigms across our industry.</p>
<p>Over the course of two days, we’ll be hearing from the accessibility leaders at Apple, Microsoft, Google, Vispero, Humanware, Amazon and more.</p>
<h2>Tech that doesn’t discriminate</h2>
<p>Even the greatest new tech creates great new problems. And as AI swoops in to save the day, allowing blind and visually impaired people to overcome barriers in their work and social lives, AI can also introduce new biases that we never expected. When training our systems to recognize, categorize and interact with real people, how do we account for disability and a diverse range of functional needs? How do we make machines that don’t inherit our own cultural prejudices?</p>
<p>We’ll also be joined by some of the blindness and disability community’s greatest advocates: people like Lainey Feingold, Haben Girma and George Kerscher, who will take a hard look at access to information as a civil right, how far we’ve come and how far we have to go in the era of AI.</p>
<p>Sight Tech Global is December 2-3 – all-virtual and 100% free. All sponsorship proceeds benefit the Vista Center for the Blind. It&#8217;s not too late to sponsor &#8211; <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/sponsorship-opportunities/">learn more here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of insurtech unicorn Root&#8217;s IPO, it felt safe to say that the big transactions for the insurance technology startup space were done for the year.</p>
<p>After all, 2020 had been a big one for the broad category, with insurtech marketplaces raising lots, rental insurance startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lemonade" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lemonade">Lemonade <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/softbank-backed-lemonade-files-to-go-public/">going public</a>, Root itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/inside-roots-ipo-filing">debuting even more recently</a> on the back of its automotive insurance business, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/understanding-hippos-valuation-in-a-post-lemonade-ipo-world/">big round to help Hippo keep building</a> its homeowners company and more.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But yesterday brought with it even more news: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/metromile" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="metromile">Metromile, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a startup competing in the auto insurance market, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pay-per-mile-auto-insurer-metromile-is-heading-to-public-markets-via-spac/">going public via a blank-check company</a> (SPAC), and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201124005400/en/Hippo-Secures-350-Million-Capital-Investment">Hippo raised a huge, unpriced round</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />So let&#8217;s talk about why Metromile might be plying the public markets, and why Hippo may have have decided to pick up more cash. Hint: The reasons are related.</p>
<h2>A market hungry for growth</h2>
<p>The Lemonade IPO was a key moment for neoinsurance startups, a key part of the broader insurtech space. When the rental insurance provider went public, it helped set the tone for public exit valuations for companies of its type: fast-growing insurance companies with slick consumer brands, improving economics, a tech twist and stiff losses.</p>
<p>For the Roots and Metromiles and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hippo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hippo">Hippos, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> it was an important moment.</p>
<p>So, when Lemonade <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/insurtech-unicorn-lemonade-raises-ipo-range-ahead-of-debut">raised its IPO range</a>, and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/lemonade-and-accolade-open-sharply-higher-as-public-markets-rally/">traded sharply higher after its debut</a>, it boded well for its private comps. Not that rental insurance and auto insurance or homeowners insurance are the same thing. They very most decidedly are not, but Lemonade&#8217;s IPO demonstrated that private investors were correct to bet <em>generally</em> on the collection of startups, because when they reached IPO-scale, they had something that public investors wanted.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon-web-services" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is currently having an outage, taking a chunk of the internet down with it.</p>
<p>Several AWS services were experiencing problems as of early Wednesday, according to <a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/">its status page</a>. That means any app, site or service that relies on AWS might also be down, too. (As I found out the hard way this morning when my Roomba refused to connect.)</p>
<p>Amazon says the issue is largely localized to North America. The company didn&#8217;t give a reason for the outage, only that it was experiencing increased error rates and that it was working on a resolution. The irony is that the outage is also affecting the company&#8217;s &#8220;ability to post updates to the Service Health Dashboard,&#8221; so not even Amazon is immune from its own downtime.</p>
<p>So far a number of companies that rely on AWS have tweeted out that they&#8217;re experiencing issues as a result, including Adobe and Roku.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> shares are up just under 25% at the moment, according to Yahoo Finance data. Slack is worth $36.95 per share as of the time of writing, valuing it at around $20.8 billion. The well-known former unicorn has been worth as little as $15.10 per share inside the last year and worth as much as $40.07.</p>
<p>Inversely, shares of Salesforce are trading lower on the news, falling around 3.5% as of the time of writing. Investors in the San Francisco-based SaaS pioneer were either unimpressed at the combination idea, or perhaps worried about the price that would be required to bring the 2019 IPO into their fold.</p>
<p>Why Salesforce, a massive software company with a strong position in the CRM market, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/ncino-marks-second-successful-ipo-of-company-built-on-salesforce-platform/">aspirations of becoming an even larger platform player</a>, would want to buy Slack is not immediately clear though there are possible benefits. This includes the possibility of cross-selling the two companies products&#8217; into each others customer bases, possibly unlocking growth for both parties. Slack has wide marketshare inside of fast-growing startups, for example, while Salesforce&#8217;s products roost inside a host of megacorps.</p>

<p>TechCrunch reached out to Salesforce, Slack and Slack&#8217;s CEO for comment on the deal&#8217;s possibility. We&#8217;ll update this post with whatever we get.</p>
<p>While Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">bought Quip for $750 million in 2016</a>, which gave it a kind of document sharing and collaboration, Salesforce Chatter has been the only social tool in the company&#8217;s arsenal. Buying Slack would give the CRM giant solid enterprise chat footing and likely a lot of synergy among customers and tooling.</p>
<p>But Slack has always been more than a mere chat client. It enables companies to embed workflows, and this would fit well in the Salesforce family of products, which spans sales, service, marketing and more. It would allow companies to work both inside and outside the Salesforce ecosystem, building smooth and integrated workflows. While it can theoretically do that now, if the two were combined, you can be sure the integrations would be much tighter.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says it would give Salesforce a sticky revenue source, something they are constantly searching for to keep their revenue engine rumbling along. &#8220;Slack could be a good candidate to strengthen its platform, but more importantly account for more usage and &#8216;stickiness&#8217; of Salesforce products &#8212; as collaboration not only matters for CRM, but also for the vendor&#8217;s growing work.com platform,&#8221; Mueller said.  He added that it would be a way to stick it to former-friend-turned-foe Microsoft.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Slack has come under <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/10/28/microsoft-teams-reaches-115-million-dau-plus-a-new-daily-collaboration-minutes-metric-for-microsoft-365/">withering fire from Microsoft in recent quarters</a>, as the Redmond-based software giant poured resources into its competing Teams service. Teams challenges Slack&#8217;s chat tooling and Zoom&#8217;s video features and has seen huge customer growth in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Finding Slack a corporate home amongst the larger tech players could ensure that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t grind it under the bulk of its enterprise software sales leviathan. And Salesforce, a sometimes Microsoft ally, would not mind adding the faster-growing Slack to its own expanding software income.</p>
<p>The question at this juncture comes down to price. Slack investors won&#8217;t want to sell for less than a good premium on the pre-pop per-share price, which now feels rather dated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sure, we&#8217;re heading into a holiday weekend here in America, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the good ship TechCrunch is going to slow down. We&#8217;re diving right back in next week with another installment in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/announcing-the-extra-crunch-live-event-series/">season two of Extra Crunch Live</a>, our regular interview series with startup founders, venture capitalists and other leaders from the technology community.</p>
<p>This series is for Extra Crunch members, so if you haven&#8217;t signed up you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=jaidaspost">hop on that train right here</a>.</p>
<p>Next week I&#8217;m virtually sitting down with <a href="https://twitter.com/jai_das?lang=en">Jai Das</a>, a well-known managing director at <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Das has invested in companies like MuleSoft (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">sold for $6.5 billion</a>), Alteryx (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/24/alteryx-rises-11-in-data-analytics-ipo/">now public</a>), Square (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/19/square-nyse-pop/">also public</a>), Sumo Logic (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/unpacking-the-sumo-logic-s-1-filing/">yep, public</a>) while at Sapphire, having previously worked corporate venture jobs at Intel Capital and Agilent Ventures. (Sapphire was itself originally SAP&#8217;s corporate venture capital arm, but it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/sap-spinout-sapphire-ventures-raises-1-4b-for-new-investments/">split off from its parent in 2011, rebranded and kept on raising funds</a>.)</p>
<p><em>Here <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/why-bessemers-byron-deeter-thinks-saas-companies-could-grow-even-faster-in-2021/">are notes</a> from the last episode of Extra Crunch Live with Bessemer&#8217;s Byron Deeter.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be fun as there&#8217;s so much to talk about. I&#8217;m still bubbling up my question list, so to avoid giving the Sapphire PR team too much pre-discussion ammo let&#8217;s just say that corporate venture capital&#8217;s place in the 2020 boom is an interesting topic for both founders and investors alike.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll want to press Das on the current market for software startups, where we are in the historical arc of SaaS multiples, the importance of API-led tech upstarts, where founders might look to build the next great enterprise startup and if there are any new platforms bubbling up that could be a foundation for future founders to later leverage.</p>
<p>As this is an Extra Crunch Live, I&#8217;ll also work in a few questions from the audience (that means you, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=jaidaspost">make sure your Extra Crunch subscription is live</a>), to augment my own clipboard of notes.</p>
<p>This is going to be a good one. I&#8217;ll see you next Tuesday for the show.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Below are links to add the event to your calendar and to save the Zoom link. We’ll share the YouTube link shortly before the discussion:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you launch an application in the public cloud, you usually put everything on one provider, but what if you could choose the components based on cost and technology and have your database one place and your storage another?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what <a href="http://cast.ai">Cast.ai</a> says that it can provide, and today it announced a healthy $7.7 million seed round from TA Ventures, DNX, Florida Funders and other unnamed angels to keep building on that idea. The round closed in June.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Yuri Frayman says that they started the company with the idea that developers should be able to get the best of each of the public clouds without being locked in. They do this by creating <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> clusters that are able to span multiple clouds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Cast does not require you to do anything except for launching your application. You don&#8217;t need to know  [&#8230;] what cloud you are using [at any given time]. You don&#8217;t need to know anything except to identify the application, identify which [public] cloud providers you would like to use, the percentage of each [cloud provider&#8217;s] use and launch the application,&#8221; Frayman explained.</p>
<p>This means that you could use Amazon&#8217;s RDS database and Google&#8217;s ML engine, and the solution decides how to make that work based on your requirements and price. You set the policies when you are ready to launch and Cast will take care of distributing it for you in the location and providers that you desire, or that makes most sense for your application.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cKbtarELGt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/startups-are-helping-cloud-infrastructure-customers-avoid-vendor-lock-in/">Startups are helping cloud infrastructure customers avoid vendor lock-in</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups are helping cloud infrastructure customers avoid vendor lock-in&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/startups-are-helping-cloud-infrastructure-customers-avoid-vendor-lock-in/embed/#?secret=cKbtarELGt" data-secret="cKbtarELGt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company takes advantage of cloud-native technologies, containerization and Kubernetes to break the proprietary barriers that exist between clouds, says company co-founder Laurent Gil. &#8220;We break these barriers of cloud providers so that an application does not need to sit in one place anymore. It can sit in several [providers] at the same time. And this is great for the Kubernetes application because they&#8217;re kind of designed with this [flexibility] in mind,&#8221; Gil said.</p>
<p>Developers use the policy engine to decide how much they want to control this process. They can simply set location and let Cast optimize the application across clouds automatically, or they can select at a granular level exactly the resources they want to use on which cloud. Regardless of how they do it, Cast will continually monitor the installation and optimize based on cost to give them the cheapest options available for their configuration.</p>
<p>The company currently has 25 employees with four new hires in the pipeline, and plans to double to 50 by the end of 2021. As they grow, the company is trying keep diversity and inclusion front and center in its hiring approach; they currently have women in charge of HR, marketing and sales at the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have very robust processes on the continuous education inside of our organization on diversity training. And a lot of us came from organizations where this was very visible and we took a lot of those processes [and lessons] and brought them here,&#8221; Frayman said.</p>
<p>Frayman has been involved with multiple startups, including <a href="http://cujo.ai">Cujo.ai</a>, a consumer firewall startup that participated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/cujo/">in TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in New York in 2016.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers have laid out a major legislative proposal <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2102">today</a> to encourage the reuse of industrial data across the Single Market by creating a standardized framework of trusted tools and techniques to ensure what they describe as &#8220;secure and privacy-compliant conditions&#8221; for sharing data.</p>
<p>Enabling a network of trusted and neutral data intermediaries, and an oversight regime comprised of national monitoring authorities and a pan-EU coordinating body, are core components of the plan.</p>
<p>The move follows the European Commission&#8217;s data strategy announcement in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">February</a>, when it said it wanted to boost data reuse to support a new generation of data-driven services powered by data-hungry artificial intelligence, as well as encouraging the notion of using &#8220;tech for good&#8221; by enabling “more data and good quality data” to fuel innovation with a common public good (like better disease diagnostics) and improve public services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The wider context is that personal data is already regulated in the bloc (such as under the General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR), which restricts reuse. While commercial considerations can limit how industrial data is shared.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive believes harmonzied requirements that set technical and/or legal conditions for data reuse are needed to foster legal certainty and trust &#8212; delivered via a framework that promises to maintain rights and protections and thus get more data usefully flowing.</p>
<p>The Commission sees major business benefits flowing from the proposed data governance regime. &#8220;Businesses, both small and large, will benefit from new business opportunities as well as from a reduction in costs for acquiring, integrating and processing data, from lower barriers to enter markets, and from a reduction in time-to-market for novel products and services,&#8221; it writes in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2103">press release</a>.</p>
<p>It has further data-related proposals incoming in 2021, in addition to a package of digital services legislation it&#8217;s due to lay out early next month &#8212; as part of a wider reboot of industrial strategy which prioritises digitalization and a green new deal.</p>
<p>All legislative components of the strategy will need to gain the backing of the European Council and parliament so there&#8217;s a long road ahead for implementing the plan.</p>

<h2>Data Governance Act</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EU lawmakers often talk in shorthand about the data strategy being intended to encourage the sharing and reuse of &#8220;industrial data&#8221; &#8212; although the Data Governance Plan (DGA) unveiled today has a wider remit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Commission envisages the framework enabling the sharing of data that&#8217;s subject to data protection legislation &#8212; which means personal data; where privacy considerations may (currently) restrain reuse &#8212; as well as industrial data subject to intellectual property, or which contains trade secrets or other commercially sensitive information (and is thus not typically shared by its creators primarily for commercial reasons). </span></p>
<p>In a press conference on the data governance proposals, internal market commissioner Thierry Breton floated the notion of &#8220;data altruism&#8221; &#8212; saying the Commission wants to provide citizens with an organized way to share their own personal data for a common/public good, such as aiding research into rare diseases or helping cities map mobility for purposes like monitoring urban air quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through personal data spaces, which are novel personal information management tools and services, Europeans will gain more control over their data and decide on a detailed level who will get access to their data and for what purpose,&#8221; the Commission writes in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2103">Q&amp;A</a> on the proposal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s planning a public register where entities will be able to register as a &#8220;data altruism organisation&#8221; &#8212; provided they have a not-for-profit character; meet transparency requirements; and implement certain safeguards to &#8220;protect the rights and interests of citizens and companies&#8221; &#8212; with the aim of providing &#8220;maximum trust with minimum administrative burden&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>The DGA envisages different tools, techniques and requirements governing how private sector bodies share data versus private companies.</p>
<p>For public sector bodies there may be technical requirements (such as encryption or anonymization) attached to the data itself or further processing limitations (such as requiring it to take place in &#8220;dedicated infrastructures operated and supervised by the public sector&#8221;), as well as legally binding confidentiality agreements that must be signed by the reuser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever data is being transferred to a reuser, mechanisms will be in place that ensure compliance with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en">GDPR</a> and preserve the commercial confidentiality of the data,&#8221; the Commission&#8217;s PR says.</p>
<p>To encourage businesses to get on board with pooling their own data sets &#8212; for the promise of a collective economic upside via access to bigger volumes of pooled data &#8212; the plan is for regulated data intermediaries/marketplaces to provide &#8220;neutral&#8221; data-sharing services, acting as the &#8220;trusted&#8221; go-between/repository so data can flow between businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;To ensure this neutrality, the data-sharing intermediary cannot exchange the data for its own interest (e.g. by selling it to another company or using it to develop their own product based on this data) and will have to comply with strict requirements to ensure this neutrality,&#8221; the Commission writes on this.</p>
<p>Under the plan, intermediaries&#8217; compliance with data handling requirements would be monitored by public authorities at a national level.</p>
<p>But the Commission is also proposing the creation of a new pan-EU body, called the European Data Innovation Board, that would try to knit together best practices across Member States &#8212; in what looks like a mirror of the steering/coordinating role undertaken by the European Data Protection Board (which links up the EU&#8217;s patchwork of data protection supervisory authorities).</p>
<p>&#8220;These data brokers or intermediaries that will provide for data sharing will do that in a way that your rights are protected and that you have choices,&#8221; said EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up the bloc&#8217;s digital strategy, also speaking at today&#8217;s press conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that you can also have personal data spaces where your data is managed. Because, initially, when you ask people they say well actually we do want to share but we don&#8217;t really know how to do it. And this is not only the technicalities &#8212; it&#8217;s also the legal certainty that&#8217;s missing. And this proposal will provide that,&#8221; she added.</p>

<h2>Data localization requirements &#8212; or not?</h2>
<p>The commissioners faced a number of questions over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">hot button issue of international data transfers</a>.</p>
<p>Breton was asked whether the DGA will include any data localization requirements. He responded by saying &#8212; essentially &#8212; that the rules will bake in a series of conditions which, depending on the data itself and the intended destination, may mean that storing and processing the data in the EU is the only viable option.</p>
<p>&#8220;On data localization &#8212; what we do is to set a GDPR-type of approach, through adequacy decisions and standard contractual clauses for only sensitive data through a cascading of conditions to allow the international transfer under conditions and in full respect of the protected nature of the data. That&#8217;s really the philosophy behind it,&#8221; Breton said. &#8220;And of course for highly sensitive data [such as] in the public health domain it is necessary to be able to set further conditions, depending on the sensitivity, otherwise&#8230; Member States will not share them.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JmmEP3SHMA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that&#8217;s cold comfort for Facebook</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;For instance it could be possible to limit the reuse of this data into public secure infrastructures so that companies will come to use the data but not keep them. It could be also about restricting the number of access in third countries, restricting the possibility to further transfer the data and if necessary also prohibiting the transfer to a third country,&#8221; he went on, adding that such conditions would be &#8220;in full respect&#8221; of the EU&#8217;s WTO obligations.</p>
<p>In a section of its Q&amp;A that deals with data localization requirements, the Commission similarly dances around the question, writing: &#8220;There is no obligation to store and process data in the EU. Nobody will be prohibited from dealing with the partner of their choice. At the same time, the EU must ensure that any access to EU citizen&#8217;s personal data and certain sensitive data is in compliance with its values and legislative framework.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the presser, Breton also noted that companies that want to gain access to EU data that&#8217;s been made available for reuse will need to have legal representation in the region. &#8220;This is important of course to ensure the enforceability of the rules we are setting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is very important for us &#8212; maybe not for other continents but for us &#8212; to be fully compliant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commissioners also faced questions about how the planned data reuse rules would be enforced &#8212; given ongoing criticism over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement</a> of Europe&#8217;s data protection framework, GDPR.</p>
<p>&#8220;No rule is any good if not enforced,&#8221; agreed Vestager. &#8220;What we are suggesting here is that if you have a data-sharing service provider and they have notified themselves it&#8217;s then up to the authority with whom they have notified actually to monitor and to supervise the compliance with the different things that they have to live up to in order to preserve the protection of these legitimate interests &#8212; could be business confidentiality, could be intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a thing that we will keep on working on also in the future proposals that are upcoming &#8212; the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act &#8212; but here you have sort of a precursor that the ones who receive the notification in Member States they will also have to supervise that things are actually in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also responding on the enforcement point, Breton suggested enforcement would be baked in up front, such as by careful control of who could become a data reuse broker.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Firstly] we are putting forward common rules and harmonized rules&#8230; We are creating a large internal market for data. The second thing is that we are asking Member States to create specific authorities to monitor. The third thing is that we will ensure coherence and enforcement through the European Data Innovation Board,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just to give you an example&#8230; enforcement is embedded. To be a data broker you will need to fulfil a certain number of obligations and if you fulfil these obligations you can be a neutral data broker &#8212; if you don&#8217;t you cannot. So it will be easy to apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside the DGA, the Commission also announced an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2188">Intellectual Property Action Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Vestager said this aims to build on the EU&#8217;s existing IP framework with a number of supportive actions &#8212; including financial support for SMEs involved in the Horizon Europe R&amp;D program to file patents.</p>
<p>The Commission is also considering whether to reform the framework for filing standards essential patents. But in the short term Vestager said it would aim to encourage industry to engage in forums aimed at reducing litigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;One example could be that the Commission could set up an independent system of third party essentiality checks in view of improving legal certainty and reducing litigation costs,&#8221; she added of the potential reform, noting that protecting IP is an important component of the bloc&#8217;s industrial strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we head into the biggest shopping period of the year &#8212; which this year may well have an even stronger online component than usual because of COVID-19 &#8212; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has launched its latest effort to combat the sale of counterfeit goods on its site.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant today <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201125005567/en/Amazon-Launches-IP-Accelerator-in-Europe-to-Help-Small-Businesses-Protect-Their-Brands-and-Tackle-Counterfeit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that its <a href="http://brandservices.amazon.com/ipaccelerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP Accelerator</a> is now live in Europe &#8212; specifically France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands and the United Kingdom &#8212; to help SMBs selling on Amazon obtain trademarks on their intellectual property, protect their brands and tackle the sale of counterfeit goods, connecting companies with recommended legal firms to carry out work. Joining the IP Accelerator is free, while the legal aid is provided as &#8220;low-cost assistance&#8221;, with those costs coming in the form of &#8220;competitive, pre-negotiated rates,&#8221; Amazon said.</p>
<p>The European launch &#8212; in Amazon&#8217;s six biggest markets in Europe, covering more than 150,000 small and medium businesses selling on Amazon&#8217;s platform, which account for more than half the products sold in the region &#8212; comes just over a year after Amazon kicked off an IP Accelerator in the U.S., in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-intellectual-property-accelerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon today said that the U.S. effort has so far yielded 6,000 trademark applications submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by SMBs working through the program.</p>
<p>Amazon has long struggled with counterfeit and other illicit items sold through its marketplace &#8212; which brings in third-party sellers and is built on the very concept of economies of scale, offering a vast array of choices to shoppers, and the IP Accelerator comes on the heels of a lot of other proactive efforts to battle the situation.</p>
<p>They have included Amazon filing a number of lawsuits &#8212; both on its own and in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/amazon-and-valentino-team-up-in-joint-lawsuit-against-new-york-counterfeiter-over-rockstud-knock-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">partnership with others</a>, and most recently, just this month, being the plaintiff in a case that interestingly extended outside its own platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-sues-online-influencers-engaged-in-a-counterfeit-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">target online influencers</a>.</p>
<p>It also has built a lot of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/amazon-expands-transparency-anti-counterfeit-codes-to-europe-india-and-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology</a> to help track and spot illicit goods.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s working with government authorities, most recently in an initiative to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201124005382/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">halt the import</a> of counterfeit inventory before it gets sold or delivered to buyers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Sisyphean task in some regards: Amazon&#8217;s growth means more sellers, and more goods to triage, and more chances for dodgy items. But it&#8217;s one that is very much in Amazon&#8217;s interest to get right: If it can&#8217;t protect IP, the best brands will stay away, and consumers will start to lose confidence in the platform, too.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yXlhINbAi5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-sues-online-influencers-engaged-in-a-counterfeit-scheme/">Amazon sues online influencers engaged in a counterfeit scheme</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon sues online influencers engaged in a counterfeit scheme&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-sues-online-influencers-engaged-in-a-counterfeit-scheme/embed/#?secret=yXlhINbAi5" data-secret="yXlhINbAi5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That&#8217;s where initiatives like the IP Accelerator come in, where the idea is that it gives sellers who are smaller more direct control over their own brand destinies.</p>
<p>The focus on SMBs is very specific and not just because of their collective selling power on Amazon. They <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">are most often not in full possession of their legal options, and perhaps also worried about the costs of getting involved in trademarking, with a recent <a href="https://www.clustercollaboration.eu/sites/default/files/news_attachment/roadmap_-_intellectual_property_action_plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> from the European Intellectual Property Office finding that just 9% of SMBs have registered IP rights, versus 36% of larger companies.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We know from our conversations with small business owners that there is often confusion about why IP rights are important and how sellers can secure them,&#8221; said Francois Saugier, vice president for EU Seller Services, Amazon, in a statement. &#8220;As part of our broader commitment to supporting small businesses, we have set up IP Accelerator to make the IP registration process as easy and as affordable as possible for entrepreneurs in the early days of their businesses.”</p>
<p>In addition to legal assistance, SMBs in the program can then join Amazon&#8217;s Brand Registry. This currently covers some 350,000 brands and gives businesses the ability to manage and track their brands, using automated algorithms built by Amazon and giving participants a hotline to reporting and acting on potential copycats and other trademark criminals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/11/13/amazon-primed-disrupt-legal-field-launch-ip-accelerator-program/id=115796/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One IP publication, IP Watchdog, describes how</a> the IP Accelerator is a particularly disruptive concept in part because of that quick access to the Brand Registry: Previously, a company would have had to have a trademark approved by the patent office before joining. Now, it seems that as long as the application is in progress &#8212; via the legal firms that have been picked to be a part of the IP Accelerator &#8212; you can join the registry. Businesses generally try to join to get a leg up on their marketing, and critics see the Accelerator as one way to potentially game that system.</p>
<p>(The other way that the IP Accelerator is disruptive, according to the article? By forcing a pricing structure for trademarking services that departs from the norm, for a potentially very large audience of customers, which also could lay the groundwork for a wider set of legal services for businesses.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The business of providing business services to SMBs on the platform is an interesting one.</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">number of startups emerge in recent times</a> that are looking to acquire and roll up the best of the SMBs that sell on Amazon with big ambitions of their own.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ynxr0rGc7o"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/">SellerX raises $118M to buy up and grow Amazon marketplace businesses</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Their plans are to use economies of scale to run these businesses better, with better supply-chain management, marketing, IP control and more. That strategy is predicated on the fact that those small businesses are finding it a challenge to take their enterprises to the next level on their own.</p>
<p>In that regard, Amazon&#8217;s IP Accelerator potentially gives those smaller sellers another helping hand to stay independent (or at least grow their businesses enough to catch the attention of these consolidators).</p>
<p>“Great ideas are the core of every good business. Turning those ideas into a reality relies on IP,&#8221; Pippa Hall, director of Innovation and chief economist at the U.K.’s Intellectual Property Office, said in a statement. &#8220;Understanding, protecting and getting the most out of your IP is a crucial ingredient of success. A good IP strategy should sit at the heart of every good business plan.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unacademy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unacademy">Unacademy, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an online learning platform in India, has added two more marquee investors to its cap table. The Bangalore-based startup, which focuses on K-12 online education, said on Wednesday it has raised new funds from Tiger Global Management and Dragoneer Investment Group.</p>
<p>The funding round, which is between $75 million to $100 million in size (according to a person familiar with the matter; Unacademy has not disclosed the figure), valued the four-and-a-half-year-old startup at $2 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/facebook-backs-indian-education-startup-unacademy/">up from about $500 million in February this year</a> when Facebook joined its list of backers, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation/">$1.45 billion in September</a>, when SoftBank led the round.</p>
<p>“Our mission from Day One has been to democratise education and make it more affordable and accessible. We have consistently built the most iconic products that deliver high quality education to everyone. Today, I’m delighted to welcome Tiger Global and Dragoneer as our partners in the journey. They are both marquee global investors with a history of partnering with innovative companies that are making an impact on people’s lives,” said Gaurav Munjal, co-founder and chief executive of Unacademy, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://unacademy.com/">Unacademy</a> helps students prepare for competitive exams to get into college, as well as those who are pursuing graduate-level courses. On its app, students watch live classes from educators and later engage in sessions to review topics in more detail. In recent months, the startup has held several online interviews of high-profile individuals, such as Indian politician Shashi Tharoor, on a range of topics, which has expanded its appeal beyond its student base.</p>

<p>The platform has amassed over 47,000 educators, who teach students in 5,000 cities in India in more than 14 languages. Over 150,000 live classes are conducted on the platform each month and the collective watch time across platforms is more than 2 billion minutes per month, the startup said.</p>
<p>“The opportunity to improve lives through online education is enormous because of its sheer accessibility. The Unacademy team has innovated rapidly to build a leading platform that is taking education to the farthest corners of India. We are very excited to partner with Unacademy and look forward to seeing it scale further,” said Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>

<p>Scores of education startups in India have reported skyrocketing growth in recent months as schools remain shut across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic. Even as most Indians tend not to pay for online services — just ask Google and Facebook, both of which count India as their biggest market by users but make little in the country — the education category is an outlier. Indian families continue to spend heavily on their children’s education in hopes of paving the way for a better future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/coinbase-launches-margin-trading-for-some-users/">a few months after</a> launching margin trading on Coinbase Pro, the company is <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-pro-disables-margin-trading-42f5862f8a66">disabling the feature</a>. Margin trading lets you trade on leverage. But it works both ways — margin trading lets you multiply your gains <em>and</em> your losses.</p>
<p>Starting on November 25, at 2 p.m. PT, users won’t be able to place new margin trades. Existing margin positions will expire over the coming days and weeks. Once those positions expire, margin trading will be disabled for good.</p>
<p>The company is following guidance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Interestingly, the CFTC was well aware of the company’s plans to launch margin trading.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coinbase">Coinbase <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it has regular conversations with the CFTC and gives them a heads up about upcoming products and services. The same thing happened with margin trading.</p>
<p>Margin trading hasn’t been available on Coinbase’s main website. It has been limited to some Coinbase Pro users with a cap on the number of users who can access the feature.</p>
<p>And yet, Coinbase wouldn’t have launched margin trading if the company could have anticipated a change of course on the regulatory front. More than 100,000 users signed up to the wait list, indicating some interest from Coinbase’s user base.</p>
<p>But the company has no choice but to end margin trading as it tries to be as compliant as possible with current regulation. Let’s see if other exchanges that operate in the U.S. will follow suit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wegift.io/">WeGift</a>, the London-based startup that has built an &#8220;incentive marketing&#8221; platform that lets businesses easily issue e-gift cards and other digital rewards to customers, has raised $8 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Dubbed a Series A extension, the round is led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/albion-vc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="albion-vc">AlbionVC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Existing investors, including Stride.vc, SAP.iO fund and Unilever Ventures, also followed on. Following the fundraise, Ed Lascelles, general partner at AlbionVC, is joining the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wegift" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wegift">WeGift <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> board.</p>
<p>WeGift says it will use the additional capital to continue building out its &#8220;real-time infrastructure&#8221; for digital rewards and incentives. This will include investment in building its supply chain through direct integrations with brands, and product development &#8220;that serves corporate marketing teams looking to acquire, activate and retain customers at scale&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Aron Alexander, WeGift wants to digitise the $700 billion rewards and incentives industry, which is largely still powered by legacy systems built for physical gift cards.</p>
<p>“Currently payments are a one way street,” WeGift’s Alexander <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/wegift/">told TechCrunch in June</a>. “Payments technology is built to enable businesses to take money from consumers but it doesn’t let businesses send money to consumers.</p>
<p>“We’ve created a new category of digital non-cash rewards to power customer acquisition, retention and loyalty globally: the ‘Twilio for e-gift cards&#8217; ”.</p>
<p>To do this, WeGift offers a “cloud-based, open API” platform that allows businesses to automate sending digital incentives. This is combined with analytics, making it easier to track ROI on incentive marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>Since we last covered the startup, WeGift has grown its network to more than 700 brand partners (such as Nike and Uber) across 30 markets and 20 currencies. It claims “hundreds of clients,” such as Vodafone, Samsung, VoucherCodes, Perkbox and Sodexo, among others.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve become a favourite of the telecom and energy industry with companies like Vodafone, Utilita, LookAfterMyBills and E.ON using our platform,” Alexander tells me.</p>
<p>WeGift is disclosing 317% in annual revenue growth, but isn’t providing actual revenue numbers. Notably, the company has also opened a New York office.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With COVID-19 making commuters switch to bikes, and cities wanting cleaner air, the e-bike revolution is only just getting started. Further evidence of this is the news that today British e-bike manufacturer <a href="https://www.furosystems.com/">FuroSystems</a> has closed its first institutional venture funding round of £750,000 with participation by <a href="https://tspventures.co.uk/">TSP Ventures</a> and European impact investment bank <a href="https://www.clearlyso.com/">ClearlySo</a>, as well as a number of angel investors.</p>
<p>Not unlike the &#8220;new wave&#8221; of startup e-bike makers such as <a href="http://VanMoof.com">VanMoof</a> and <a href="http://Cowboy.com">Cowboy</a>, London-based FuroSystems is also bringing an interesting take on the e-bike concept. Key to its appeal is that its bikes are very light and can therefore be pedaled like normal bikes when not using the electric motor. Furthermore, their pricing is also highly competitive compared to conventional bikes.</p>
<p>Unlike many e-bike makers, it also has a folding e-bike, the <a href="https://www.furosystems.com/fx/">Furo X</a>, whose carbon-fiber frame makes it one of the lightest e-bikes in the world, weighing just 15 kg. The high-density removable lithium-ion battery has a range of 55 km. FuroSystems also makes a point of using industry-standard parts such as Shimano gears and hydraulic disk brakes, which makes it competitive with others such as Gocycle and Brompton.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These factors are helping to make them a hit amongst commuters.</p>
<p>As a result the company, which also makes electric scooters, says it has seen demand surge since the coronavirus lockdown, with year-on-year sales up fivefold. Unusually, the company says it has been profitable since it started, but this latest funding will be used to invest in R&amp;D to create its next line of products.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Eliott Wertheimer said in a statement: “We’re currently experiencing a once-in-a-century shift in transport, thanks to increasing awareness of the impact we are having on our environment along with a renewed desire to make healthier personal choices. Electric bikes and electric scooters are crucial to solving the mobility issues we see today, of congestion and pollution.”</p>
<p>Wertheimer added that part of the bike manufacturing is likely to be brought to Portugal in order to fulfill demand.</p>
<p>TSP Ventures CEO Chris Smith, commented: “The e-bike market has exploded in recent years with sales set to reach €10 billion by 2025 and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/furosystems" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="furosystems">FuroSystems <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is at the intersection of this burgeoning industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has also designed and manufactured the Fuze, a high-end e-scooter with over 800W of available peak power; double front and rear suspension; dual mechanical disc brakes; remote key lock and alarm system; reinforced inflatable pneumatic 10” wheels. The power and top speed is able to be adjusted to comply with local regulations.</p>

<p>Upcoming will be the Aventa, an e-bike with aerospace-grade alloys; a boost system; hydraulic disk brakes; nine gears; high-performance clutch; integrated 504Wh battery; and the weight below 17 kg. Prices for the Aventa will start at £1,399 and it will be available to pre-order from FuroSystems.com at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Founders Albert Nassar and Eliott Wertheimer met whilst studying mechanical and aerospace engineering, respectively, at the University of Bristol. Nassar went on to work with the autonomous drone inspection team at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, which later spun-out as Perceptual Robotics, whilst Wertheimer developed small nuclear batteries for tiny satellites in partnership with the European Space Agency and different U.K. universities. The pair reunited at Imperial College’s Business School in 2015, and created FuroSystems in 2017.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/universal-service-fund">Universal Service Fund</a> includes subsidies to build telecommunication infrastructure across the United States, especially for low-income or high-cost areas, rural telehealth services, and schools and libraries. The FCC issued an order on June 30 banning U.S. companies from using the fund to buy technology from Huawei and ZTE, claiming that both companies have close ties with the Chinese Communist Party and military.</p>

<p>Many smaller carriers rely on Huawei and ZTE, two of the world’s biggest telecom equipment providers, for cost-efficient technology. After surveying carriers, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-communications-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-communications-commission">FCC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> estimated in September that replacing Huawei and ZTE equipment <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-huawei-zte-network-replacement-cost-173935939.html">would cost more than $1.8 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Under the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act, passed by Congress this year, most of that amount would be eligible for reimbursements under a program referred to as &#8220;rip and replace.&#8221; But the program <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1331709/lawmakers-urge-fcc-to-initiate-rip-and-replace-effort">has not been funded by Congress yet</a>, despite bipartisan support.</p>
<p>In today’s announcement about ZTE, chairman Ajit Pai also said the FCC will vote on rules to implement the reimbursement program at its next Open Meeting, scheduled to take place on December 10.</p>
<p>The FCC passed its order barring companies deemed national security threats from receiving money from the Universal Service Fund in November 2019. Huawei fought back by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/huawei-sues-fcc-over-unconstitutional-ban-the-use-of-federal-subsidies-to-buy-its-equipment/">suing the FCC over the ban</a>, claiming it exceeded the agency&#8217;s authority and violated the Constitution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, we had the chance to talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> co-founder Ev Williams, along with operator-turned investor James Joaquin, who helps oversee the day-to-day of the mission-focused venture firm they separately co-founded six years ago, <a href="https://obvious.com/">Obvious Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>We collectively discussed lot of venture-y things, some of which we&#8217;ll publish next week, so stayed tuned. In the meantime, we spent some time talking specifically with Williams about both <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/medium" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="medium">Medium <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and some of the day&#8217;s biggest headlines. Following are some excerpts from that chat, lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of tech CEOs have been saying goodbye to San Francisco in 2020. Do you think the trend is attracting too much attention, or perhaps not enough?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EW: I moved away to New York from the Bay Area a little over a year ago with my family. I&#8217;d lived in San Francisco for 20 years, and I had never lived in New York and thought, &#8216;Why not go? Now seems like a good time.&#8217; Turns out I was wrong. [Laughs.] It was a very bad time to move to New York. So I was there for for six months and quickly came back to California, which is a great place to be in a world where you&#8217;re not going into bars and restaurants and seeing people.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You moved when COVID took hold?</strong></p>
<p>EW: Yes. In March, Manhattan suddenly seemed not ideal. So now I&#8217;m on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peninsula">peninsula</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m from San Francisco. It was really, for me, just honestly looking for a change. But an enabling factor that could be common in many of these cases is the fact that I no longer have to be in the office in San Francisco every day, [whereas] for most of 20 years [beforehand], all my work life was in an office in San Francisco, generally with a company I had started, so I thought it was important to be there.</p>
<p>This was pre COVID and remote work. But remote work was becoming more common. And I noticed in 2018 or so, with this massive number of companies that were in San Francisco &#8212; startups and large public companies and pre-IPO companies &#8212; that competition for talent had gotten more extreme than it had ever been. So it got me &#8212; along with a lot of founders and CEOs &#8212; thinking about maybe the advantage of hiring locally and having everybody in the same office [was a pro] that was starting to get outweighed by the cons &#8230; And, of course, the tools and technology that make remote work possible were getting better all the time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Given that you co-founded Twitter, I have to ask about this presidential transition that is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/24/trump-carries-on-election-fight-440496">maybe</a>, finally happening. In January, Donald Trump will lose the privileges he enjoyed as president. </strong><strong>Given the amount of <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325099845045071873">disinformation</a> he has published routinely, do you think Twitter should have cracked down on him sooner? How would you rate its handling of a president who really tested its boundaries in every way?</strong></p>
<p>EW: I think what Twitter has done especially recently is a pretty good solution. I mean, I don&#8217;t agree with the the notion that he should have been removed altogether a long time ago. Having the visibility, literally seeing, what the president is thinking at any given moment, as ludicrous as it is, is helpful.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter co-founder Ev Williams to step down from the company&#8217;s board&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/22/twitter-co-founder-ev-williams-to-step-down-from-the-companys-board/embed/#?secret=hUjgkRXHQ0" data-secret="hUjgkRXHQ0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What he would be doing if he didn&#8217;t have Twitter is unclear, but he&#8217;d be doing something to get his message out there. And what the company has done most recently with the warnings on his tweets or blocking them is great. It&#8217;s providing more information. It&#8217;s kind of &#8216;buyer beware&#8217; about this information. And it&#8217;s a bolder step than any platform had taken previously. It&#8217;s a good version of an in-between where previously [people would] talk about just kicking people off, [and] allowing freedom of speech.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You started Blogger, then Twitter, then Medium. As someone who has spent much of your career  focused on content and distribution, do you have any other thoughts about what more Twitter or other platforms could be doing [to tackle disinformation]? Because there is going to be somebody who comes along again with the same autocratic tendencies.</strong></p>
<p>EW: I think all of society gets more information savvy &#8212; that&#8217;s one hope over the long term. It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that if something was in &#8220;media,&#8221; it was accepted as true. And now I think everyone&#8217;s skeptical. We&#8217;ve learned that that&#8217;s not necessarily the case and certainly not online.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;re now at the point where a lot of people have lost faith in everything published or shared anywhere. But I think that&#8217;s a step along the evolution of just getting more media savvy and knowing that sources really matter, and as we build both better tools, things will get better.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Speaking of content platforms, Medium charges $50 per year for users to access an unlimited amount of articles from individual writers and poets. Have you said how many subscribers the platform now has?</strong></p>
<p>EW: We haven&#8217;t given a precise number, but I can tell you it&#8217;s in the high hundreds of thousands. It&#8217;s been a been a couple years now, and I&#8217;m a very firm believer in the model &#8212; not only that people will pay for quality information, but that it&#8217;s just a much healthier model for publishers, be they individuals or companies, because it creates that feedback loop of &#8216;quality gets rewarded.&#8217;</p>
<p>If people aren&#8217;t getting value, they unsubscribe, and that isn&#8217;t the case with an advertising model. If people click, you keep making money, and you can kind of keep tricking people or keep appealing to lowest-common-denominator impulses. There were a couple of decades where the mantra was &#8216;No one will pay for content on the internet,&#8217; which obviously seems silly now. But that was the established belief for such a long time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you ever think you should have charged from the outset? I sometimes wonder if it&#8217;s harder to throw on the switch afterward.</strong></p>
<p>EW: Yes, and no. When we first switched to this model in 2017, we created a subscription, but the vast majority of content was &#8212; and actually still is &#8212; outside of the paywall. And our model is different than most because it&#8217;s a platform, and we don&#8217;t own the content, and we have an agreement with our creators that they can publish behind the paywall if they want, and we will pay them if they do that. But they can also publish outside the paywall if they&#8217;re not interested in making money and want maximum reach. And those models are actually very complementary because the scale of the platform brings a lot of people in through the top of the funnel.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Obvious Ventures closes an irrationally sized third fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/obvious-ventures-closes-an-irrationally-sized-third-fund/embed/#?secret=qXsklOPkQO" data-secret="qXsklOPkQO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Scale is really important for most businesses, but for a paywall, it&#8217;s especially important because people have to be visiting with enough frequency to actually hit the paywall and be motivated to pay.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Out of curiosity, what do you make of <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, a startup that invites writers to create their own newsletters using a subscription model and then takes a cut of their revenue in exchange for a host of back-end services.</strong></p>
<p>EW: There&#8217;s a bit of a creator renaissance going on right now that is part of a bigger wave of a people being willing to pay for quality information and independent writers and thinkers actually breaking out on their own and building brands and followings. And I think we&#8217;re going to see more of that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Medium has raised $132 million over the years. Will you raise more? Where do you want to take the platform in the next 12 to 24 months?</strong></p>
<p>EW: We&#8217;re not yet profitable, so I anticipate that we will raise more money.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a very big business to be built here. While more and more people are willing to pay for content, I don&#8217;t think that means that most people will subscribe to dozens of sources, whether they&#8217;re websites with paywalls or newsletters. If you look at how basically every media category has evolved, a lot of them have gone through this shift from free to paid, at least at the higher end of the market. That includes music, television and even games. And at the high end, there tend to be players who own a large part of the market, and I think that comes down to offering the best consumer value proposition &#8212; one that gives people lots of optionality, lots of personalization and lots of value for one price.</p>
<p>I think that the same thing is going to play out in this area, and for the subscription that&#8217;s able to reach critical mass, that&#8217;s a multi-billion-dollar business. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re aiming to build.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has launched yet another Starlink mission, adding 60 more Starlink satellites to its low-Earth orbit constellation. That&#8217;s good news for its efforts to blanket the globe in high-speed broadband, and today&#8217;s flight is even better news for its equally important ambition of developing more reusable rocket systems, since the first-stage booster that helped launch today&#8217;s Falcon 9 rocket made a record-breaking seventh trip.</p>
<p>SpaceX broke its own reusability records of six flights for a reused first-stage rocket component, and it also recovered the booster with a controlled landing using its drone flight in the Atlantic Ocean, which means it could potentially break this record with yet another future flight for this same booster.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s launch took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, lifting off at 9:13 PM EST (6:13 PM PST). The flight also used a fairing cover to protect the payload on its way to space that had flown previously, including one half that&#8217;s flown one prior mission, and another that&#8217;s been used twice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpaceX aims for greater usability as a way to continue to reduce costs &#8212; every time it flies a component used in a previous mission, it realizes some degree of cost savings versus using all new parts. Today&#8217;s mission represents likely its most cost-effective flight to date as a result.</p>
<p>This is SpaceX&#8217;s sixteenth Starlink mission thus far, and it has now launched nearly 1,000 total small satellites for its constellation. The service is currently operating in beta, and recently expanded from parts of the U.S. to areas in southern Canada.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is getting into online events. The company has been spotted testing a new feature that allows users to sign up for Zoom classes through Pinterest, while creators use Pinterest&#8217;s class boards to organize class materials, notes and other resources, or even connect with attendees through a group chat option. The company confirmed the test of online classes is an experiment now in development, but wouldn&#8217;t offer further details about its plans.</p>
<p>The feature itself was discovered on Tuesday by reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong</a>, who found details about the online classes by looking into the app&#8217;s code.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Currently, you can visit some of these &#8220;demo&#8221; profiles directly &#8212; like &#8220;<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pinsmeditation/_saved/">@pinsmeditation</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pinzoom123/_saved/">@pinzoom123,</a>&#8221; for example &#8212; and view their listed Class Communities. However, these communities are empty when you click through. That&#8217;s because the feature is still unreleased, Wong says.</p>
<p>When and if the feature is later launched to the public, the communities would include dedicated sections where creators will be able to organize their class materials &#8212; like lists of what to bring to class, notes, photos and more. They could also use these communities to offer a class overview and description, connect users to a related shop, group chat feature and more.</p>

<p>Creators are also able to use the communities &#8212; which are basically enhanced Pinterest boards &#8212; to respond to questions from attendees, share photos from the class and otherwise interact with the participants.</p>
<p>When a user wants to join a class, they can click a &#8220;book&#8221; button to sign up, and are then emailed a confirmation with the meeting details. Other buttons direct attendees to download Zoom or copy the link to join the class.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that Pinterest would expand into the online events space, given its platform has become a popular tool for organizing remote learning resources during the coronavirus pandemic. Teachers have turned to Pinterest to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/pinterest-launches-a-today-tab-featuring-daily-recommendations-and-trending-topics/">keep track of lesson plans</a>, get inspiration, share educational activities and more. In the early days of the pandemic, Pinterest reported record usage when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/pinterest-launches-a-today-tab-featuring-daily-recommendations-and-trending-topics/">saw more searches and saves</a> globally in a single March weekend than ever before in its history, as a result of its usefulness as a online organizational tool.</p>
<p>This growth has continued throughout the year. In October, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/pinterest-stock-soars-more-than-10percent-revenue-up-49percent.html">Pinterest&#8217;s stock jumped on strong earnings</a> after the company beat on revenue and user growth metrics. The company brought in $443 million in revenue, versus $383.5 million expected, and grew its monthly active users to 442 million, versus the 436.4 million expected. Outside of the coronavirus impacts, much of this growth was due to strong international adoption, increased ad spend from advertisers boycotting Facebook and a surge of interest from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/pinterest-breaks-daily-download-record-thanks-to-user-interest-in-ios-14-design-ideas/">users looking for iOS 14 home screen personalization ideas</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the U.S. has failed to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control, many classes, events and other activities will remain virtual even as we head into 2021. The online events market may continue to grow in the years that follow, too, thanks to the kickstart the pandemic provided the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are experimenting with ways to help creators interact more closely with their audience,&#8221; a Pinterest spokesperson said, when asked for more information.</p>
<p>Pinterest wouldn&#8217;t confirm additional details about its plans for online events, but did say the feature was in development and the test would help to inform the product&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>Pinterest often tries out new features before launching them to a wider audience. Earlier this summer, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/pinterest-has-begun-testing-a-new-version-of-stories-called-story-pins-with-u-s-creators/">reported on a Story Pins feature the company had in the works</a>. Pinterest then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/">launched the feature in September.</a> If the same time frame holds up for online events, we could potentially see the feature become more widely available sometime early next year.</p>
