-----></p>
<p>In light of Women’s History Month, we’re taking a look at the status of gender diversity in investment portfolios because women remain underrepresented in the field of entrepreneurship. Let’s delve into the numbers — and why your deal flow may not be diverse enough.</p>
<h2>Women entrepreneurs and fundraising</h2>
<p>There is an unmet need of $260 billion to $320 billion for women-owned company funding, according to a 2013 <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/335791468167041761/pdf/949160WP0Box380cessCreditMSME0Final.pdf">study</a> conducted by the International Finance Corporation. A <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sources_of_economic_hope_womens_entrepreneurship.pdf">survey</a> of women from 350 tech startups reinforced this: 72% of women respondents said that they faced difficulty attaining financial capital when they were starting their businesses and nearly 80% of them had to rely on personal funding. Furthermore, women founders receive <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/03/02/female-founders-funding-2019/">less than 3%</a> of all VC dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The stark contrast between the ease of fundraising for men compared to women is apparent. <a href="https://financialallianceforwomen.org/download/access-to-capital-by-high-growth-women-owned-businesses/">Data show that men were four times as likely as women to access equity financing from angel investors or VCs</a> (14.4% against 3.6%). The ease with which men tap into multiple sources for capital explains why they start companies with almost twice the capital of women founders on average.</p>
<h2>So, why is fundraising harder for women-led startups?</h2>
<p>Women’s struggle to attain capital can perhaps be explained by looking into the diversity in fund management firms. Fund managers’ lack of diversity ultimately contributes to the resulting funding inequality when it comes to their portfolios. <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/jh572x5wd4r0/7qRourAWPj0U9R7MN5nWgy/711a6d8344bcd4fbe0f1a6dcf766a3c0/WVC_Report_-_The_Untapped_Potential_of_Women-Led_Funds.pdf">Data from Women in VC</a> show that only 5.6% of U.S. VC firms are women-led and only 4.9% of VC partners in the U.S. are women.</p>
<p>“Empowering women and people of color to drive the investment strategy of venture firms is the fastest and most effective course correction” for the lack of gender-diverse portfolios, the Women in VC report said. “Venture investors have extraordinary power to impact broader society norms. They decide what founders get funded, what businesses stand a chance at success, and what products get brought to market. These things, in turn, exert a determining influence on our culture.”</p>
<p>Investors must address the diversity issue within their ranks first; they must be aware of the existing unconscious bias and take extra actions toward improving their efforts in actively trying to source and invest in women-led startups.</p>
<h2>Why is diverse deal flow important?</h2>
<p>Diversifying an investment portfolio to include more women-led ventures means trusting in the leadership of women, which research has shown to be worth believing in. A 2012 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-012-1553-6">study</a> of company performance showed that more than 150 listed German firms excelled when they had at least 30% women representation on their executive boards.</p>
<p>Even more interesting, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a7db/04f990334daf8f0c47e587f61055b16518d0.pdf">another study</a> argues that women make better board directors than men. The findings revealed that women are more effective at accounting for multiple competing interests, solving problems creatively and building consensus. By comparison, male directors often made decisions based on rules, regulations and tradition.</p>
<p>Undeniably, companies managed by effective women leaders are set to provide a lucrative return on investment. Roy Adler, a Fulbright scholar and professor of marketing at Pepperdine University, conducted a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267822127_Women_in_the_Executive_Suite_Correlate_to_High_Profits">19-year study</a> that found a correlation between companies with the best record of promoting women to senior positions and higher profitability — between 18% to 69% higher than the median Fortune 500 companies in their respective industries.</p>
<p>While the numbers prove that the financial returns can be promising, the bigger impact and importance of investing in gender diversity is the overall economic growth and prosperity that follows. Increasing opportunities for women entrepreneurs sets off a domino effect that local and global markets can benefit from.</p>
<p>McKinsey estimated that if total gender equality was achieved, the global gross domestic product (GDP) could be increased by up to<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth#:~:text=How%20advancing%20women's%20equality%20can%20add%20%2412%20trillion%20to%20global%20growth,-September%201%2C%202015&amp;text=A%20McKinsey%20Global%20Institute%20report,gaps%20in%20work%20and%20society."> $28 trillion globally by 2025</a>. In fact, by not investing in women, the downsides prove to be quite massive. <a href="https://www.unescap.org/resources/economic-and-social-survey-asia-and-pacific-2007">A study by the United Nations</a> showed that the Asia-Pacific region, including China and the United States, loses at least $42 billion annually in GDP by not fully engaging women’s participation in their economy.</p>
<p><a href="Seedstars.com">Seedstars</a>, the Swiss investment holding group that focuses on investing in tech high-growth companies from emerging markets, <a href="https://cares.seedstars.com/the-benefits-of-developing-women-entrepreneurship">provides a more in-depth view</a> of the benefits of developing women entrepreneurship, specifically in developing countries.</p>
<p>The numbers make it evident that gender diversity is underutilized but highly valuable. In Melanne Verveer and Kim K. Azzarelli’s book “Fast Forward,” experts weigh in on the topic of gender inclusivity.</p>
<p>“The biggest destroyer of wealth creation is patriarchy,” Pax World Funds CEO Joseph Keefe said. “It’s not just up to women to ‘lean in’. Shareholders seeking better returns would do well to lean on companies to appoint and promote more women.”</p>
<p>“Women remain hugely underrepresented at positions of power in every single sector across this country,” Barnard College president Debora Spar noted. “We have fallen into what I call the 16% ghetto, which is that if you look at any sector, be it aerospace engineering, Hollywood films, higher education, or Fortune 500 leading positions, women max out at roughly 16%. That is a crime, and it is a waste of incredible talent.”</p>
<h2>Moving gender inclusivity forward</h2>
<p>Taking active measures to ensure that we are fully including women is necessary to make an impact. Since 2018, Seedstars has been actively working on gender equity within its core activities, highlighted in the group&#8217;s theory of change, such as sourcing of ventures, capacity-building programs and investment activities.</p>
<p>To date, Seedstars has supported more than 600 women-led enterprises and invested in 14 businesses co-founded by women. Additionally, Seedstars is working on gender equity when it comes to mentors, jury members and training delivery experts. Recent numbers show that about 30% of all Seedstars program participants are women, a number that Seedstars is proud to have increased over the past years (2018 numbers were more around 20%, depending on the region) and is committed to increasing that figure in the coming years.</p>
<p>Through the combined efforts of our own initiatives and those from investors who do their part in promoting gender diversity, the world is bound to reap the benefits of investing in what is proving to be one of the most powerful demographic groups the world is yet to fully embrace.</p>
<p>Recognizing the issue is the first step to solving any problem. The increase in awareness and action is sure to bring forth important development that makes the future brighter for women entrepreneurs everywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.mercadolibre.com/">Mercado Libre</a>, one of the largest e-commerce and financial services company from Latin America by market cap, has selected the startup and Y Combinator alumni Pachama as its strategic partner in developing projects to restore ecosystems in Latin America.</p>
<p>The selection of <a href="https://pachama.com/">Pachama</a> is part of a program initiated by Mercado Libre, Latin America&#8217;s answer to Amazon, which is called <a href="https://regeneraamerica.com/">Regenera America</a>. The $8 million that Mercado Libre is investing will be in two reforestation projects: the &#8220;Mantiqueira Conservation Project&#8221;, organized under the auspices of The Nature Conservancy and the &#8220;Corridors of Live Project&#8221;, designed and implemented by the Instituto de Pesquisas Ecologicas.</p>
<p>Both projects will focus on the reforestation of over three thosuand hectares, through natural regeneration and planting over 1 million trees, restoring biodiversity corridors and protecting hydrological basins in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, the two companies said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pachama will provide satellite and machine learning technologies to verify and monitor the carbon sequestration produced by the sweeping reforestation efforts in a deal which leapfrogs Mercado Libre ahead of Microsoft as the young startup&#8217;s largest customer.</p>
<p>Software tools provided by Pachama will also increase the efficiency and transparency of the actual reforestation efforts on the ground, the companies said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>The deal between the two companies, and Mercado Libre&#8217;s big buy was announced earlier today at a press conference in Argentina and the agreement marks the first time Mercado Libre has tapped money from a recently issued $400 million Sustainability Bond that was designed to finance projects of what the e-commerce giant called &#8220;triple impact&#8221; in the Latin American region. The bond was issued by JP Morgan and BNP Paribas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re taking our first steps. We have always tried to do things the hard way and go to the core of problems. We have had a very interesting debate internally about when is the right time to start buying carbon offsets and carbon credits but we also realize that the … getting up and running of projects that generate carbon credits in Latin America was potentially even more of a challenging situation and more of a longterm solution,&#8221; said Mercado Libre chief financial officer Pedro Arnt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a building block of a longer term strategy thinking through not just what we can do for the next two or three years,&#8221; Arnt said. </span></p>
<p>The Regenera America project has four pieces, Arnt said: measuring and reporting emissions internally for the company; buying clean energy for the company&#8217;s operations; providing electric vehicles for its own fleet and assisting its last mile and logistics partners in electrifying their own transportation; and the development of reforestation efforts across Latin America.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is setting up an example for more traditional industries across Latin America,&#8221; said Diego Saez-Gil, the co-founder and chief executive of Pachama. MercadoLibre is the largest company by market cap in Latin America and serves as a standard bearer for the forward thinking businesses in the region, he said. &#8220;Latin America is one of the biggest holders of biodiversity and carbon stocks in the world, and should be playing a more active role in climate mitigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big step for Pachama as well. The deal marks the first time the young company has involved itself in project origination and provide a new revenue stream to compliment its existing lines of business.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are incredibly excited to start helping new reforestation projects get off the ground that have the capabilities to plant millions of trees and remove millions tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. If we are to solve climate change we need more projects like these to start as soon as possible,&#8221; said Saez-Gil in a statement. &#8220;We are confident that technologies such as AI and satellite imagery are key to scaling these efforts with high integrity, efficiency and transparency. Partnering with world-class organizations such as Mercado Libre, The Nature Conservancy and IPE for our first projects represents an incredible opportunity for us.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Introduced in late-2019, the Move was a very Sonos approach to the Bluetooth speaker. It was an attempt to bring the company’s long-standing premium approach to a more portable form factor. Accordingly, the press photos feature a lot of shots of the product on porches and around pools.</p>
<p>Today’s arrival of the Roam, however, takes an even bigger step to full portability, with a smaller, lighter, more ruggedized and waterproof design that puts it more in line with popular offerings from companies like JBL. It’s also priced at a much more palatable $169, more than half the Move’s starting price.</p>

<p>Of course, you can still get plenty of cheaper (and quite good) portable Bluetooth speakers. JBL’s Flip 5, for instance, retails for about $40 less. But what you’re paying for, in part, is the Sonos ecosystem. As such, I suspect the clearest play from the outset here is Sonos’ base. And thankfully, for the company, there are no doubt a lot of Sonos users who have been waiting for a long time for a compatible speaker they can toss in their suitcase &#8212; or, rather, will be able to toss into their suitcases when they use suitcases again.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections, the system utilizes Sonos’ new Sound Swap feature, which switches the music to the next closest speaker when the play/pause button is held down. The speaker works with more than 100 streaming services, per the company’s count, including, of course Sonos Radio. It also can be controlled with Alexa and Google Assistant or via AirPlay 2.</p>

<p>I got all of this information by way of a virtual briefing, as is how business is done these days, so I can’t speak specifically to the sound. That said, I’d imagine it’s a step down from the very good and quite expensive Move. But again, this is a speaker you’re buying specifically with flexibility in mind. On that note, the speaker gets about 10 hours of playback on a charge and can go 10 days when not in use.</p>
<p>The speaker arrives on April 20th.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos&#8217; Blue Origin will be providing NASA with a valuable scientific tool ahead of the U.S. space agency&#8217;s goal of returning to the Moon: The ability to run experiments in simulated lunar gravity much closer to home, in suborbital space.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/feature/nasa-blue-origin-to-bring-lunar-gravity-conditions-closer-to-earth.html">revealed</a> that Blue Origin will be modifying its reusable New Shepard sub-orbital launch vehicle to add Moon gravity approximation via rotation of the spacecraft&#8217;s capsule. That&#8217;ll effectively turn it into one big centrifuge, which will mean that objects inside will experience a gravitational force very close to that found on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like there aren&#8217;t already ways to simulate lunar gravity, but the way that New Shepard will implement its system will provide two benefits that none of these existing methods can match: Longer duration, offering over two minutes of continuous artificial Moon gravity exposure, and larger payload capacity, which will unlock experimental capabilities that are currently impossible just due to space restrictions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Blue Origin anticipates that this new capability for New Shepard will be ready to roll by 2022 – important timing because the whole idea is to help support NASA&#8217;s Artemis program, which is its mission series that will see a return to human Moon exploration, including establishment of a more permanent crewed research presence both in lunar orbit and on the surface.</p>
<p>Gravity on the surface of the Moon is about one-sixth as powerful as that here on Earth. NASA also points out that it will require experimentation not only in preparation for lunar missions, but also to support eventually crewed launches to Mars, which has gravity that&#8217;s just over one-third as strong as it is here.</p>
<p>Blue Origin is also working with NASA on human landers for its lunar missions, through a space industry team-up that includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://foundation.app/NyanCat/nyan-cat-219">creator of the Nyan Cat</a>, Chris Torres, has organized an informal collection of meme originators &#8211; the creators or original popularizers of meme images &#8212; into a two-week-long auction of their works. Under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=memeconomy&amp;src=typed_query">#memeconomy</a> the creators of memes like <a href="https://foundation.app/badluckbrian/bad-luck-brian-4263">Bad Luck Brian</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/IdasCreatures/coughing-cat-4587">Coughing Cat</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/steveibsen/the-kitty-cat-dance-4567">Kitty Cat Dance</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/realscumbagsteve">Scumbag Steve</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PRguitarman/status/1368995286434127877">Twerky Pepe</a> and some others are finally finding a way to monetize the creation of genuine cultural phenomenons that have been used freely for decades.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re mostly being hosted on booming new crypto art and collectibles platform Foundation, which launched in February and has <a href="https://fnd.info/">already hosted $6M</a> in sales of over 1,000 NFTs. I have a lot to say about NFTs and can&#8217;t say them all here, but I found this project fascinating and wanted to note it. The fact is that memes are Internet art (sorry). They are unique creations that took elements of participatory and performance art and injected them into the veins of the internet. In many ways, they have millions of creators, as the original editions may have planted the seed but every use and permutation gave them additional strands of DNA, crafting their cultural importance upload by upload. They have let us express ourselves &#8212; our desire, disgust, joy and lust &#8212; when words just wouldn&#8217;t suffice.</p>
<p>These &#8220;originals&#8221; are made original by the act of them being minted on the blockchain by the original artists. I know, it&#8217;s a distinction that may seem slim when the same images can be had anywhere at any time, but that&#8217;s the beauty of the re-organization that is happening within all of DeFi and crypto at the moment. We are stripping out layers of commerce and communication that benefited only platforms and participants that took part in the origination and sale of art from the perspective of frameworks like the DMCA and DRM. Those relationships are being rethought. The recapture of value for works that have already been broadly distributed has been historically relegated to &#8216;licensing them for t-shirts&#8217;. And extremely rarely elevated to the <a href="https://foundation.app/NyanCat/nyan-cat-219">level of fine art sale.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now that we&#8217;re all living on the Internet, Internet art is just art. And so are memes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s fascinating to see some of the people who have created things that have let so m​any of us express ourselves get paid.</p>
<p>One famous case of this, of course, is the Pepe and its creator Matt Furie. Though Furie&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/sundance-feels-good-man-charts-a-path-of-redemption-for-pepe/">attempts to redeem Pepe</a> have focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/pepe-the-frog-creator-reaches-settlement-over-infowars-usage/">attempting to reclaim</a> him from a legacy of racist and hateful memes, Pepe and his friends are a cool cast of characters and it would be heartening to see Furie reclaim them by minting them himself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke a bit to Torres about the project and why he got interested in it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why did you decide to organize this informal schedule of meme NFTs?</strong></p>
<p>Torres: The idea has always kind of been in the back of my mind since discovering the NFT universe. The idea of NFTs were always so attractive to me, a place where you can create your own original art and gain proper attribution for your work. Memes have always had a rough time on the Internet, because their creators are usually taken advantage of, and I have personally seen artists have their works stolen and monetized to the tune of millions of dollars without even proper credit. So the idea has always been down deep in my subconscious but this week things have really amped up enough to finally give me the power I need to make it happen!</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did you get in contact with the creators?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, they all contacted me! It&#8217;s unbelievable knowing I&#8217;m in direct contact with some fantastic iconic internet legends from the past. Some of these have existed solely as enigmas on the Internet, it&#8217;s great connecting with them. Things started with casual conversations with Bad Luck Brian, but then Trollface messaged me, then Me Gusta, then Kitty Cat Dance, then things just kept amping up.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How has it felt to have your creation formally rewarded after spending so long in the cultural meme-ory?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s still very surreal, to be honest. The NFT community is full of very talented people with so many thoughts and ideas on how to build a better future for the crypto space. I&#8217;ve actually used this power for good this week by starting up #Memeconomy with all these talented meme creators and will be trying my hardest to get these guys the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What excites you about NFTs and art?</strong></p>
<p>The number one thing that&#8217;s kept me excited for NFTs is just knowing that it&#8217;s a perfect way to empower artists to take ownership of their own works. I&#8217;ve been hanging out in the Clubhouse chats, reading everything I can on Twitter, and just have been losing sleep being so enthralled by it all. Every day I wake up and there&#8217;s a new meta of NFTs out there. It&#8217;s cool to see all this artistic knowledge evolving in real time. I absolutely live off that energy, and it&#8217;s inspired me to be more creative than ever.</p>
<p>The world of NFTs is complex and fascinating and deserves a deeper look that looks at the economic, ecological and technical aspects. We&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/what-the-nft-vc-david-pakman-dumbs-down-the-digital-collectibles-frenzy-and-why-its-taking-off-now/">already hosted</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts/">written about</a> various <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">projects in the space</a>.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The introduction of GPT-3 in 2020 was a tipping point for artificial intelligence. In 2021, this technology will power the launch of a thousand new startups and applications. GPT-3 and similar models have brought the power of AI into the hands of those looking to experiment &#8212; and the results have been extraordinary.</p>
<p>Trained on trillions of words, GPT-3 is a 175-billion parameter transformer model — the third of such models released by OpenAI. GPT-3 is remarkable in its ability to generate human-like text and responses &#8212; in some respects, it’s eerie. When prompted by a user with text, GPT-3 can return coherent and topical <a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideAI">emails</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sushant_kumar/status/1283314235842297856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1283314235842297856%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevminator.com%2Fforums%2Ftopic%2Ftweet-generator-gpt-3-openai-api-example%2F">tweets</a>, <a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">trivia</a> and much more.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In 2021, this technology will power the launch of a thousand new startups and applications.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Suddenly, authoring emails, customer interactions, social media exchanges and even news stories can be automated &#8212; at least in part. While large companies are pondering the pitfalls and risks of generating text (remember Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/25/microsoft-apologizes-for-hijacked-chatbot-tays-wildly-inappropriate-tweets/">disastrous</a> Tay bot?), startups have already begun sweeping in with novel applications &#8212; and they will continue to lead the charge in transformer-based innovation.</p>
<p>OpenAI researchers first released the paper introducing GPT-3 in May 2020, and what started out as some nifty use cases on Twitter has quickly become a hotbed of startup activity. Companies have been formed on top of GPT-3, using the model to generate emails and marketing copy, to create an interactive nutrition tracker or chatbot, and more. Let OthersideAI take a first pass at writing your emails, or try out Broca or Snazzy for your ad copy and campaign content, for instance.</p>
<p>Other young companies are harnessing the API to accelerate their existing efforts, augmenting their technical teams’ capabilities with the power of 175 billion parameters and quickly bringing otherwise difficult products to market with much greater speed and data than previously possible. With some clever prompt engineering (a combination of an instruction to the model with a sample output to help guide the model), these companies leverage the underlying GPT-3 system to improve or extend an existing application’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Sure, a text expander can be a useful tool for shorthand notation &#8212; but powered by GPT-3, that shorthand can be transformed into a product that generates contextually aware emails in your own style of writing.</p>
<p>As early-stage technology investors, we are inspired to see AI broadly, and natural language processing specifically, become more accessible via the next generation of large-scale transformer models like GPT-3. We expect they will unlock new use cases and capabilities we have yet to even contemplate.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/music">Techstars Music</a> is announcing 11 new companies that have joined its ranks, along with a partnership with Atlanta media company/record label Quality Control.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to mentally bunch everything Techstars does together under the singular &#8220;Techstars&#8221; name, it&#8217;s actually made up of 40+ interconnected accelerator programs each with its own focus and portfolio. The majority of these are focused on a specific region — programs like Techstars Boulder, Boston or LA. Others focus on a specific vertical or industry — like sports, space, or, in this case, music.</p>
<p>So what all does that &#8220;music&#8221; focus cover? It&#8217;s not just music creation tools, or apps for artists. As Techstars Music Managing Director Bob Moczydlowsky put it in a Q&amp;A <a href="https://www.techstars.com/the-line/5-questions/bob-moczydlowsky">last year</a>, &#8220;we don’t invest in music companies — we invest in companies solving problems for music.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Their past portfolio includes <a href="https://endel.io">Endel</a>, which generates &#8220;personalized soundscapes&#8221; meant to help you focus or fall asleep faster, and <a href="https://blinkidentity.com">Blink Identity</a>, a company looking to replace the paper/digital concert ticket with facial recognition machines at the venue&#8217;s entrance.</p>
<h2><strong>The companies in the 2021 class, in alphabetical order:</strong></h2>

<p>Along with this latest class, Techstars Music is also announcing that it&#8217;s partnering with Quality Control, the media house behind Quality Control Music — best known as the label behind Migos, Lil Yachty and Lil Baby. Quality Control joins Techstars Music as a &#8220;member&#8221; company (sort of like their equivalent to an LP, offering investment, helping to vet companies and mentoring them once they&#8217;re in); existing members include Amazon Music, AVEX, Bill Silva Entertainment, Concord, Peloton, Entertainment One, Right Hand Music Group, Royalty Exchange, Sony and Warner Music Group.</p>
<p>Moczydlowsky tells me that Techstars Music alumni companies have raised over $105 million since the first class in 2017 and that the group above has already raised over $3 million ahead of its demo day in May.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games is quickly becoming a more dominant force in gaming infrastructure M&amp;A after a string of recent purchases made to bulk up their Unreal Engine developer suite. Today, the company announced that they&#8217;ve brought on the team from photogrammetry studio Capturing Reality to help the company improve how it handles 3D scans of environments and objects.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed.</p>
<p>Photogrammetry involves stitching together multiple photos or laser scans to create 3D models of objects that can subsequently be exported as singular files. As the computer vision techniques have evolved to minimize manual fine-tuning and adjustments<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, designers have been beginning to lean more heavily on photogrammetry to import real-world environments into their games. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QL1gGw8efz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/cloud-gaming-platforms-were-2020s-most-overhyped-trend/">Cloud-gaming platforms were 2020&#8217;s most overhyped trend</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloud-gaming platforms were 2020&#8217;s most overhyped trend&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/cloud-gaming-platforms-were-2020s-most-overhyped-trend/embed/#?secret=QL1gGw8efz" data-secret="QL1gGw8efz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Using photogrammetry can help studio developers create photorealistic assets in a fraction of the time it would take to create a similar 3D asset from scratch. It can be used to quickly create 3D assets of everything from an item of clothing, to a car, to a mountain. Anything that exists in 3D space can be captured and as game consoles and GPUs grow more capable in terms of output, the level of detail that can be rendered increases as does the need to utilize more detailed 3D assets.</p>
<p>The Bratislava-based studio will continue operating independently even as its capabilities are integrated into Unreal. Epic announced some reductions to the pricing rates for Capturing Reality&#8217;s services, dropping the price of a perpetual license fee from nearly $18,000 to $3,750. In FAQs on the studio&#8217;s site, the company notes that they will continue to support nongaming use clients moving forward.</p>
<p>In 2019, Epic Games acquired Quixel, which hosted a library of photogrammetry &#8220;megascans&#8221; that developers could access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://detail.co">Detail</a>, a new startup working on an app for iOS and macOS so that you can turn your iPhone into a software-optimized camera for live video. The startup wants to make it easy to use the phone that you have in your pocket with the livestreaming platform that you already use, such as Zoom, Google Meet, Twitch, Hopin or YouTube Live.</p>
<p>Over the past year, if you have had to present something to a large audience over a livestream, chances are you’ve faced a few challenges. First, as Joanna Stern of the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/webcam-showdown-macbook-air-dell-xps-theyre-pretty-bad/415D393C-4320-442B-974D-1887E20C057F">demonstrated</a>, laptop webcams suck. There’s no way you’re going to look good with your computer.</p>
<p>Second, if you’re willing to invest some money, you can buy a ring light, a dedicated camera, a good microphone, etc. The issue is that it’s expensive. More importantly, it’s been really hard to buy some of this stuff as many remote workers have been looking for those devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Third, you might be good at teaching something, but not good at video production. Those are different skills and somehow people are telling you that you should know everything about white balance, anti-flickering and more.</p>
<p>As for Detail, the company wants to make it as easy as possible to go from zero to livestream. The best camera that you have is most likely the one in your pocket, right there on the back of your smartphone. For the past few years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/">computational photography</a> has led to tremendous improvements when it comes to taking photos with your phone. But there’s still some work to do on the livestreaming front.</p>

<p>Detail founder Paul Veugen <a href="https://medium.com/detailapp/the-third-act-1a6472bd1932">rightly points out</a> that hosting a live video has become a commodity. But everything that happens before you send the video feed over the internet could be improved.</p>
<p>At first Detail is going to be an iPhone and Mac app that works hand in hand like <a href="https://reincubate.com/camo/">Camo</a> and <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/epoccam">EpocCam</a>. There are going to be some easy-to-use settings to tweak color grades, add filters, etc. It’s going to be a more opinionated take on the smartphone-as-a-webcam movement.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the team is composed of some of the people that worked on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/human/">Human</a>, an app I started covering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/03/meet-human-a-beautiful-fitness-tracking-app-to-effortlessly-stay-healthy/">way back in 2013</a>. Human was a passive fitness tracking app — you could set it up and get insights about how active you had been over the past few days. Essentially, it was like Apple’s activity rings before Apple introduced the Apple Watch. Human was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/mapbox-is-acquiring-passive-fitness-tracking-app-human/">acquired by Mapbox</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>Detail raised a $2 million pre-seed round led by Connect Ventures. Hustle Fund, Alexander Ljung, Anke Huiskes, Arthur Kosten, Elodie and Tony Jamous, Hiten Shah, Janis Krums, Mart Kelder, Micha Hernandez van Leuffen, Othman Laraki, Omri Amir and Sten Tamkivi are also participating in the round.</p>

<p>As you can see, Detail is still in active development and the beta test is going to start soon. But it’s an intriguing app and I’m going to keep an eye on it to see how it pans out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://capsule.social">Capsule</a>&#8216;s plan to launch a super simple decentralized social media platform which is safe from censorship by Big Tech has advanced another stage: The nascent startup has closed a seed round of funding ($1.5M) led by Beacon Fund, a dedicated crypto fund by Polychain Capital &#8212; which is itself focused on startups building on Dfinity&#8217;s decentralized network for next-gen &#8216;open&#8217; apps (aka, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/dfinity-launches-an-open-source-platform-aimed-at-the-social-networking-giants/">the Internet Computer</a>).</p>
<p>As we reported in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/cryptocat-author-gets-insanely-fast-backing-to-build-p2p-tech-for-social-media/">January</a>, the idea for Capsule started with a tweet that almost immediately pulled in a pre-seed raise of $100k. That&#8217;s now been topped up with seed financing to get a prototype to market later this month.</p>
<p>Mobile apps are also on the cards and the funding will be used to build out Capsule&#8217;s team as well (currently it&#8217;s around four people).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Capsule founder Nadim Kobeissi, a cryptography researcher who previously authored the open-source E2E-encrypted desktop chat app Cryptocat, says they&#8217;re on track to put out an MVP this month &#8212; once they&#8217;ve made a few tweaks to the infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prototype is ready,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We’re investigating switching some of the infrastructure from GUN to IPFS [InterPlanetary File System; aka a p2p hypermedia protocol], and improving the user interface. We could launch an MVP now but are choosing to hold off by a few weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Polychain Capital outted its Beacon Fund last September. The $14.5M investment vehicle is funded by Polychain, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Dfinity Foundation &#8212; and aims to support entrepreneurs and teams building on Dfinity&#8217;s the Internet Computer (TIC); aka a serverless architecture for natively hosting software and services (which it refers to as the &#8220;first blockchain computer that runs at web speed with infinite capacity&#8221;).</p>
<p>Kobeissi&#8217;s original concept for Capsule, meanwhile, was to create self-hosting microservices. He says that hasn&#8217;t changed &#8212; but sees potential for TIC to help solve some specific technical issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Internet Computer will hopefully be helping us build a &#8216;customized mini-blockchain&#8217; to solve two issues with Capsule: Global authenticated timestamps for posts as well as a root of trust for user’s authentication keys for posts,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We were looking to solve these issues somehow before this investment and were already considering Dfinity as the potential solution given that it has a programming language that allows for building these &#8216;custom mini-blockchains&#8217; as we see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest will still be a self-hosting, self-contained, precisely engineered micro-services concept, with IPFS (previously GUN) as a decentralized database/connectivity back-end,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Given the intent with TIC is to hosts all sorts of decentralized apps it&#8217;s possible &#8212; indeed, likely &#8212; that a bunch of decentralized social media plays will emerge. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/dfinity-launches-an-open-source-platform-aimed-at-the-social-networking-giants/">Last year</a>, for example, Dfinity launched a proof of concept for an &#8216;open&#8217; version of the professional social network, LinkedIn &#8212; which it punningly called &#8216;LinkedUp&#8217;.</p>
<p>It went on to demo a TikTok clone &#8212; and to open TIC up to outside developers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/dfinity-demos-its-tiktok-clone-opens-up-its-internet-computer-to-outside-developers/">last summer</a>. So there could soon be a bunch of apps built atop its network touting social networking services without the meddling hand of Big Tech. Where, then, does Kobeissi see Capsule&#8217;s USP &#8212; i.e. if/when there&#8217;s a sea of decentralized &#8216;mega-apps&#8217; that can also claim resilience to censorship?</p>
<p>&#8220;We think Capsule’s value will lie in its exceptional user experience, quality, performance, ease of use and high quality engineering that draws on advanced technologies such as TIC and IPFS without saddling bloat,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Others may use the same technology but I think we can do a good job on building something simple that just works and that is a pleasure to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, I think that Capsule will be to Facebook what healthy, vegetarian diets are to a McDonald’s diet,&#8221; he adds more generally of his intent for the service. &#8220;Capsule may be a social media service but its relationship with its users and developers will be fundamentally different than Big Tech platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Below are a few screenshots showing current mock-ups of the Capsule interface.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December, Walmart partnered with TikTok on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">the first pilot test of a new livestreamed shopping experience</a> in the U.S. on the video platform. That test seemingly performed well, as today Walmart announced it will return to TikTok to host another livestream shopping event, the &#8220;Spring Shop-Along: Beauty Edition,&#8221; which will feature TikTok creators and influencers in an hour-long livestream.</p>
<p>The retailer didn&#8217;t disclose to what extent its first TikTok live shopping event drove sales, but noted that it netted 7x more views than it had anticipated and was able to grow its TikTok follower base by 25%. These metrics were encouraging enough to send Walmart back to the platform for another go &#8212; this time, to promote beauty products instead of apparel, which had been the focus of the holiday livestream.</p>
<p>The new Spring Shop-Along will run this Thursday, March 11 at 9 p.m. EST on the Walmart TikTok channel. Like the prior holiday event, the new livestream shopping event will see various TikTok creators joining to talk about and demonstrate their favorite items. One participating creator has already been announced: Gabby Morrison (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gabbymorr?lang=en">@GabbyMorr</a>) who has over 3.5 million TikTok followers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2123002" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123002" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123002" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="443" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png 1840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=1536,1002 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123002" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Gabby and others will demo their skincare, makeup and hair routines and reveal the Walmart beauty products they&#8217;re using during the 60-minute live event. Featured beauty brands will include NYX, Maybelline, The Lip Bar, Bliss, Kim Kimble and Marc Jacobs fragrances.</p>
<p>Viewers watching the event will be able to get beauty tips as well as shop the products featured directly in the TikTok app by tapping on product &#8220;pins.&#8221; This will allow them to add items to their cart that they can then check out either during or after the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brands have found a unique home on TikTok to create content that speaks to the community and inspires engagement, whether it&#8217;s participating in trends or discovering new products,&#8221; said Blake Chandlee, president of TikTok Global Business Solutions, in a statement about Walmart&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the shoppable livestream experience, it&#8217;s exciting to see how the TikTok community loves engaging with their favorite creators and discovering new products. We look forward to continue building innovative ways to power the path from discovery to purchase, and seeing brands like Walmart bring their creativity to users,&#8221; Chandlee added.</p>
<p>Walmart had already signaled its interest in leveraging TikTok for e-commerce ahead of the holiday livestream. Notably, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">had planned to invest in TikTok</a> when the video app was threatened with a ban under the Trump administration, unless it sold its U.S. operations to an American company. That forced sale, which would have spun out TikTok&#8217;s U.S. business to new owners Oracle and Walmart, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">shelved</a> for the time being as the Biden administration <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-walmart-is-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-11612958401">reviews</a> the agency action under Trump.</p>

<p>Walmart had said its plan to partner with TikTok on livestream shopping wasn&#8217;t a result of its deal talks, however &#8212; it&#8217;s been an active brand on TikTok&#8217;s platform for well over a year. The retailer even <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/a-true-influencer-program-inside-walmarts-growing-army-of-employee-tiktokers/">tasked its employees to make TikTok videos</a>, in addition to running its own TikTok channel.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, the retailer declined to provide further metrics about its first livestream on TikTok, but felt the pilot test delivered above expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were happy with getting 7x more views than anticipated and the 25% increase in TikTok follower growth after the first event. We were also pleased with the smooth checkout experience,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We aren’t able to share sales numbers, but can share that we hit the projections we set ahead of the event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following this week&#8217;s live shopping event, Walmart says it plans to bring more shopping experiences to TikTok in the months to come, by continuing to partner with creators to highlight different products via different formats.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The launch of the service, and the announcement that Shopify will be the company&#8217;s first customer, comes as the company&#8217;s most direct competitor, Climeworks, made moves of its own &#8212; striking a deal with the Swedish sequestration services company Northern Lights to move forward with its own direct air capture as a service offering.</p>

The removal and sequestration will be done by CE’s plant development partner, <a href="https://www.1pointfive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.1pointfive.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615385146024000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3WRJFnmCJ3-jSSRVOdwL3srk2Kw">1PointFive</a> — the U.S. development company that&#8217;s currently engineering CE’s first industrial-scale facility, the company said. That facility is due to be completed in 2024. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Early customers for direct air capture (DAC) &#8212; especially companies with ambitious climate goals &#8212; can have outsized impact today: not only does procuring DAC services enable companies to hit &#8216;net-zero&#8217; pledges faster, but it helps DAC technology come down the &#8216;learning curve,&#8217; driving cost reductions and making DAC services more affordable and accessible for a wider customer base in the future,&#8221; said Noah Deich, president and founder of the climate focused advocacy group Carbon180. &#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to see Carbon Engineering announce a way for early corporate leaders &#8212; and hopefully a wave of fast followers &#8212; to devote more of their climate spend toward DAC.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Their timeframe puts the Carbon Engineering timetable on roughly even footing with Climeworks for getting to market. Luckily for both firms, given the billions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions that need to be captured and sequestered it&#8217;s a market that&#8217;s definitely big enough for both of them. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">With its commitment, Shopify becomes the largest publicly announced purchaser of direct-air-capture-based carbon removal.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Carbon Engineering’s mission has always been to deliver a highly scalable and affordable solution for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,” said CE CEO, Steve Oldham, in a statement. “We’re on the brink of large-scale deployment of our technology and the next critical step is accumulating market interest and securing customers. This new service allows us to do that. It also makes it easy for companies and governments to include permanent carbon removal in their net-zero plans. We’re thrilled to expand our relationship with Shopify and welcome them as our first carbon removal customer, and we look forward to supporting others so we can collectively make large-scale carbon removal a reality.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Carbon removal unit purchases will be fulfilled by distributed air capture facilities deployed by 1PointFive, Carbon Engineering&#8217;s development partner, which is backed by deep-pocketed investors including <a href="https://www.oxylowcarbon.com/">Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, LLC</a>, a subsidiary of Occidental, and <a href="https://www.rusheen.com/">Rusheen Capital Management</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carbon Engineering is also working with<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> <a href="https://pale-blu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pale-blu.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615385146024000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuF-j_Fv-oA8qeD_Z-ckz2rymsZQ">Pale Blue Dot Energy</a> out of the U.K. to bring its direct air capture technology across the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“We welcome this news and applaud Shopify on their climate leadership position,” said 1PointFive Chairman Richard Jackson. “Alongside climate experts like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we recognize that permanent carbon removal is going to be necessary to achieve our vision of a sustainable low-carbon world. 1PointFive looks forward to bringing large-scale carbon removal capability based on CE’s technology to the market, helping customers worldwide to achieve their climate goals.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of cybersecurity has seen a huge proliferation of new technology and services over the years. But with the primary focus being on solutions for larger enterprises, it leaves a big gap in the market for small and medium businesses, not least because they are increasingly finding themselves to also be a focus of malicious hackers. Today, a startup called <a href="http://actzero.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActZero</a> is coming out of stealth with a set of solutions aimed specifically at SMBs. Along with its public launch, it&#8217;s also announcing that it has raised a seed round of $40 million to get its business going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main focus is SMB security,&#8221; Sameer Bhalotra, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview. The way he and the others at ActZero see it, many startups have emerged to target the security issues faced by big government and large enterprises. &#8220;But we want to help the small and medium businesses who we feel might need help the most. No one has stitched the products together the way SMBs need them to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>That solution is focused around monitoring, managed detection and response, he said, not just to discover but to contain cyber threats, which ActZero powers by way of a comprehensive, cloud-based AI platform. The AI in turn helps automate some of its services, bringing down the pricing and making it all something within the budgetary reach of a typical SMB. ActZero&#8217;s smallest customers have a few hundred employees, while the biggest have a headcount of around 3,500.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are bringing technology to bear to democratize access,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Point72 Hyperscale, a VC firm backed by Stephen Cohen, who may be most well known for his track record in private equity. That money was raised, Bhalotra said, &#8220;on day one&#8221; of ActZero being founded in 2019.</p>
<p>$40 million may sound like a lot for a seed round, especially for a company that had yet to launch a service or acquire a customer. But it&#8217;s money that has been put to work already.</p>
<p>Some of the funding was used to acquire IntelliGo, a security startup out of Canada, last year, to give the company a head start on training its AI models with IntelliGo&#8217;s data, and also to bring on the startup&#8217;s customers to be its first users.</p>
<p>Another reason for the large funding round and strong confidence in what was just a concept at the time is the track record of the startup&#8217;s executives.</p>
<p>A previous security company co-founded by Bhalotra, StackRox, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by RedHat</a>, and another, Impermium, where he was a key executive, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/15/impermium-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Google</a> where he became a cybersecurity executive. He was also senior director for cybersecurity in the Obama White House, among many other critical roles.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NjHQmCgk2L"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/">RedHat is acquiring container security company StackRox</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;RedHat is acquiring container security company StackRox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/embed/#?secret=NjHQmCgk2L" data-secret="NjHQmCgk2L" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Co-founder Ed Gardner was a longtime security architect and program manager first at Akamai, then Amazon and then Microsoft. ActZero&#8217;s COO Chris Finan also spent years at Impermium, Shape Security and in a number of security roles over many years in Washington.</p>
<p>The work that they and others on the ActZero team put into managing cybersecurity in years past saw their primary focus train on formidable opponents that came in the form of state actors or those financed by large entities intent on stealing state intelligence, intellectual property from major companies, money laundering and disrupting networks and normal activity for other motives. &#8220;Cyberdefense was mostly about big banks and government agencies,&#8221; Bhalotra said, speaking with just a little wistfulness in his voice, maybe because it was, relatively speaking, a lot simpler back then.</p>
<p>These are not exactly the same kinds of issues that SMBs have traditionally faced, but times are changing. In more recent years, the evolution of cybercrime has been swift and &#8212; ironically &#8212; democratized in the process, where not even the smallest companies are totally safe.</p>
<p>In some ways, the threat is proportionately worse for less well-equipped smaller companies not set up to weather risky financial events. Recent research from the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/security/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ponemon Institute and IBM</a> found that the average cost of a breach can reach into the millions of dollars, which can cripple smaller businesses.</p>
<p>You can liken the situation in enterprise security somewhat to the offline world of organized crime, where there are higher levels of groups that are dealing with huge sums of money and engaging in major industries, while there are also lower levels involved in more localized and smaller activities, and even low runs working in petty crime.</p>
<p>A lot of the primary threat for SMBs in recent years has been around ransomware &#8220;and criminal organizations have innovated on their business models and they have now moved beyond ransomware to data extortion,&#8221; said Finan. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually been fascinating to see how vertically integrated these organizations have become. You might have accounts receivable arms, R&amp;D arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes malicious hackers will attack SMBs as part of their &#8220;testing&#8221; process, he added. Their arsenal of tools of course now also include artificial intelligence, giving them machine speed to fuel malicious human intent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rise of COVID-19, which has led to so much more business and activity being carried out online, has led to a growing &#8220;opportunity&#8221; for them, Finan said. &#8220;I have been astounded by the level of sophistication, and COVID has accelerated that shift downmarket.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that SMBs, even those with thousands of employees, may lack the knowledge, budget or human resources to hire the kinds of security teams they need to have to address all of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish that these small businesses were still under the radar because they are not up to the challenge for dealing with these groups,&#8221; said Bhalotra. &#8220;It&#8217;s just not the case any longer that they&#8217;re being ignored. We want to democratize cyber defense because hackers target everyone. We see multiple attacks daily, and they vary tremendously.&#8221;</p>
<p>There have been tools built to address security for SMBs before, although traditionally the focus has been around antivirus, firewalls and other basics. The key with what ActZero is doing is that it&#8217;s conceiving of SMB solutions on par with what is being built for their larger counterparts. It&#8217;s a next-generation security approach being taken also by a few others, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/enterprise-cybersecurity-startup-bluevoyant-raises-82-5m-at-a-430m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueVoyant</a> and <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2019/09/skout-cybersecurity-raises-25m-in-funding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skout</a>, both of which have also raised <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/temasek-bluevoyant-197626/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizeable rounds of funding</a>.</p>
<p>The bet is that the ActZero team&#8217;s track record and knowledge sets them up to be leaders in this area.</p>
<p>“ActZero has developed an elegant solution for addressing the most pressing security concerns of SMBs today with its unified, AI-powered platform,” said Dan Gwak, head of Point72 Hyperscale, in a statement. “ActZero is unique in its appreciation for and realization of a combined people and automation model. We believe that ActZero has the potential to transform how security solutions are delivered to help businesses achieve better security posture more affordably. We’re excited to partner with them on this critical journey.”</p>

SoFi, a digital personal finance company, got </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sofi-bank-charter/fintech-startup-sofi-gets-preliminary-approval-for-u-s-bank-charter-idUSKBN27D27W"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preliminary approval for a bank charter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last October. By acquiring Golden Pacific, the company gets a fast track into that process. Once the transaction closes later this year, GPB will become a subsidiary of the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A national bank charter will give SoFi the ability to accept deposits and make loans that use SoFi’s member deposits as opposed to funding its loan offerings as a nonbank, by contracting external underwriters at a premium.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the proposed acquisition, SoFi said it would switch its current de novo (i.e., net new) bank application to a change of control application. GPB currently has about $150 million in assets, but if the OCC and Federal Reserve grants SoFi a national bank charter, the company said it will then put $750 million toward its national, digital business plan. At the same time, it will maintain GPB’s community bank business and footprint, including its current three physical branches. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi expects the acquisition to close by year’s end. At that time, GPB’s community bank business will operate as a division of SoFi Bank, N.A., a renaming of GPB&#8217;s bank entity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPB President and CEO Virginia Varela will continue to lead the GPB community bank business under the direction of Paul Mayer, who will serve as president of SoFi Bank, N.A.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that by pursuing a national bank charter, we will be able to help even more people get their money right with enhanced value and more products and services,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto in a written statement. “We are thrilled to have found a partner in Golden Pacific Bank to both accelerate our pursuit to establish a national bank subsidiary, as well as begin to expand our offerings in SoFi’s financial products and Galileo’s technology platform to serve local communities.”</span></p>

Square Financial Services completed the charter approval process with the FDIC and Utah Department of Financial Institutions, meaning it was ready for business as of last week.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies have turned to self-serve sales, which may encourage people to try freemium or open-source versions of a product. Some percentage of these users may turn into paying customers, and in the best case will act as leaders to bring a product into their organization.</p>
<p><a href="https://calixa.io/">Calixa</a>, an early-stage startup, believes that this type of sale, known as a bottom-up sales motion, requires a new kind of tool to manage the process, and today it announced a $4.25 million seed round.</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins led the round with help from Operator Collective, Liquid 2 Ventures and a bunch of individual investors. The round closed in February 2020, but is only being announced today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Calixa co-founder and CEO Thomas Schiavone says the roots of the company began when he was working at Twilio in 2010 and saw how powerful it was for developers to purchase tooling themselves. An idea began to form that CRM tools like Salesforce weren&#8217;t built to deal with this kind of sales motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I realized [at Twilio] was that developers were just signing up more and more every day and that if you really wanted to stay on top of what was going on and try to effectively grow and retain those accounts, you weren&#8217;t looking in Salesforce,&#8221; Schiavone told me.</p>
<p>He said that he decided to start Calixa in 2019 to solve this problem once and for all. While this kind of user-driven, bottom-up sale has been in place at software companies for years, he still saw a dearth of tools for dealing with its unique qualities in one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw a great opportunity to build something that democratizes [ … ] running a bottom-up company by not only giving all customer-facing teams the ability to see what&#8217;s going on with customers, but also take action,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This ability to manage the process and maybe extend a trial, issue a credit or even reset a password while letting these teams see and understand the underlying customer data was what set it apart from traditional CRMs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The central thesis here is that Salesforce and other CRMs don&#8217;t have that data. They&#8217;re too divorced or too much in this rigid world of the typical sales model, and you need something different to be an effective company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To use the product, you simply sign up and then link the various accounts the product needs to compile the data it needs. It uses various API connectors to make this happen and all it requires is that you enter your username and password to access the accounts and begins pulling together the data.</p>
<p>Bucky Moore, a partner at lead investor Kleiner Perkins says that the pandemic has accelerated the move to a bottom-up approach as in-person sales models have been impossible. &#8220;Core to the success of this strategy is a data-driven understanding of each customer and user. By democratizing this capability to companies of all sizes, Calixa&#8217;s opportunity is to become the de facto customer operations platform for the modern software business,&#8221; Moore said.</p>
<p>Schiavone reports the company has seven employees spread across the U.S., Canada and Columbia. He says that as he hires, he will have offices in cities close to his clusters of employees, but he sees a hybrid approach where employees can decide just how much they want to be in the office.</p>
<p>The company spent last year building the product and working with 21 beta customers. The product will be generally available starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security vulnerability in a popular iPhone call recording app exposed thousands of users&#8217; recorded conversations.</p>
<p>The flaw was discovered by Anand Prakash, a security researcher and founder of PingSafe AI, who found that the aptly named <a href="http://www.recorderforiphone.com/">Call Recorder</a> app allowed anyone to access the call recordings from other users — by knowing their phone number.</p>
<p>But using a readily available proxy tool like Burp Suite, Prakash could view and modify the network traffic going in and out of the app. That meant he could replace his phone number registered with the app with the phone number of another app user, and access their recordings on his phone.</p>
<p>TechCrunch verified Prakash&#8217;s <a href="https://www.pingsafe.ai/blog/how-we-could-have-listened-to-anyones-call-recordings?=7194ef805fa2d04b0f7e8c9521f97343">findings</a> using a spare phone with a dedicated account.</p>
<p>The app stores its user&#8217;s call recordings on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloud-storage/">cloud storage</a> bucket hosted on Amazon Web Services. Although the public was open and lists the files inside, the files could not be accessed or downloaded. The bucket was closed by press time.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the cloud storage bucket had more than 130,000 audio recordings, amounting to some 300 gigabytes. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apps">app</a> says it has more than 1 million downloads to date.</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted the app developer and held this story until the flaw was fixed. A new version of the app was submitted to Apple&#8217;s app store on Saturday. The release notes said the app update was to &#8220;patch a security report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite a brief response to our initial email acknowledging the security issue, the app developer Arun Nair has not returned several requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The investment firm <a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/">Flagship Pioneering</a> has incubated a lot of life sciences companies since it was founded in 2000. In fact, while a general partner with Flagship Pioneering over the last 15 years, David Berry has started more than 30 companies, five of which trade publicly right now: Seres Therapeutics, Sensen Bio, Evelo Biosciences, T2 Biosystems, and Axcella Health.</p>
<p>Berry is often a company&#8217;s first CEO, then transitions out of the company within 18 months. But he has no plans to leave his post as CEO of <a href="https://www.valohealth.com/">Valo Health</a>, a three-year-old, Boston-based, 110-person drug discovery company that Berry and Flagship seem to think could become one of the firm&#8217;s most important companies yet. That&#8217;s notable, considering that Flagship incubated 11-year-old Moderna, which currently boasts a $50 billion market cap thanks in large part its coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s no surprise, given Berry&#8217;s and Flagship&#8217;s track record that Valo has attracted believers. Notably, today it is announcing a fresh $110 million in extended Series B financing from Koch Disruptive Industries that brings the round total to $300 million and the overall amount the young company has raised to more than <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/valo-health/company_financials">$450 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, given that there are hundreds of drug discovery companies in the world seizing on the latest advancements in AI, machine learning and computation, it&#8217;s easy to wonder what&#8217;s so special about this one. We got Berry&#8217;s take during a chat with him yesterday, parts of which we are featuring below edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Valo is trying to accelerate the creation of drugs, and it has a computational platform called Opal to do it faster and more effectively than many rivals. Is there a way to make it clearer to outsiders why this platform is so unique? </strong></p>
<p>DB: First, from day one, we were operating on a different scale [than past Flagship Pioneering companies]. Typically, when you look at Flagship companies, there&#8217;s an [exclusive] initial commitment by Flagship of plus or minus $50 million. But because of the scale of the opportunity that we saw ahead of us with Valo, we actually started out by bringing in external financing partners as part of a Series A that was right around $100 million.</p>
<p>[Also unique is the] breadth of what we&#8217;re trying to achieve through our systematic approach to R&amp;D, as opposed to a targeted approach to thinking about it. There&#8217;s been an historical challenge in life sciences in that companies are primarily viewed based on what their lead therapeutic asset looks like. But if you have the potential to change the scope, the scale, the potential, the speed, the probability of success, [and] the cost of developing drugs, you&#8217;re not going to look like a typical therapeutics company.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So your focus on multiple therapeutic areas at once &#8212; oncology, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases &#8212; is a distinguishing element of the company. How are you tackling so much simultaneously?</strong></p>
<p>DB: The legacy biopharma model is basically this point-to-point system [where up to 15 groups] do some work, and then they basically take the result of it and they throw it over a wall to another group that has its own framework. The model is intrinsically disintegrated. They use mice. They use cell lines. They use extracted organs. And those just don&#8217;t represent what a full, intact living human actually looks like, and they don&#8217;t reflect what the disease looks like in the context of that human.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re doing is what I would call that next transformation . . . enabled by high-quality human-centric data [that we analyze] in an end-to-end, but componentized manner. What I mean by that is we&#8217;ve created a single underlying architecture so that we&#8217;re using the same species, we&#8217;re using the same decision-making criteria. we&#8217;re using the same KPIs throughout the entirety of the R&amp;D cascade, [and] we&#8217;re using the same bases of the core computation. We&#8217;re using the same self-reinforcing model to learn as we go. We have a local expression, because we have to perform a certain set of tasks in order to comply with the regulatory environment. But by doing it in this way as we do those tasks, we&#8217;re learning a lot more and we&#8217;re keeping that human centricity, so when we uncover, for example, a new target in cardiovascular disease or neurodegenerative disease, it&#8217;s based on our human data. It&#8217;s not based on a dog model or mouse model or something along those lines. It&#8217;s not based on cells adapted to plastic in a lab.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Where is that human data coming from? Is the data you&#8217;re feeing into Opal somehow better or different than what others are using?</strong></p>
<p>DB: We haven&#8217;t we haven&#8217;t yet disclosed where our datasets are coming from, but we have reason to believe that the scale and quality of the data sets are substantially high. We have not seen data sets that compare in scope and size. We have announced one subset of our data lake, but I would call it a small subset through a data partnership we announced earlier. [Editor&#8217;s note: this is with a company called Global Genomics Group, which gives Valo access to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valo-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-g3-the-worlds-largest-and-detailed-cardio-metabolic-datasets-301197305.html">cardio-metabolic dataset</a>.]</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve been at this for a few years. Have you had any major breakthroughs?</strong></p>
<p>DB: I believe what we&#8217;ve done over the last two years is build an incredibly strong technology basis and foundation [for] transformation. We&#8217;ve announced four therapeutic programs that we&#8217;ve launched thus far, and each represents not only something where we&#8217;ve been able to develop a therapeutic candidate in very short periods of time, but we&#8217;ve also been able to overcome historical barriers that made developing those sorts of candidates much more difficult, and we were able to overcome those barriers in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you elaborate on one of those therapies to underscore your point?</strong></p>
<p>DB: One of the programs we announced is called NAMPT. What was really interesting about it is it&#8217;s a very powerful cancer target. The downside of it is it&#8217;s known to cause a very particular toxicological effect &#8212; it causes retinal toxicity &#8212; and we wanted to figure out whether we could get the benefit of the molecule by targeting the target but avoid getting that molecule into the retina, which required a very specific design. Long story short, in a couple of weeks, we were able to achieve a molecule that had enough differentiation between the blood in the eye that it shouldn&#8217;t have any substantial effects.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are any of these four candidates heading into the market any time soon?</strong></p>
<p>DB: I would love them to be in the market soon, but they&#8217;re not yet there. We are expecting that with the financing in hand, we should ultimately have molecules in clinical trials, and ultimately, we&#8217;re very excited to be able to transition some of the drugs that we are developing into [viable offerings in the market].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you sell then sell these to a big pharma company, or would Valo be marketing these itself?</strong></p>
<p>DB: Both are viable potential paths. Because we&#8217;re developing a number of different therapeutics, it gives us flexibility in the way we think about our ultimate business model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is facing another privacy complaint in Europe: A startup lobby group, <a href="https://francedigitale.org">France Digitale</a>, has asked the country&#8217;s data protection watchdog to investigate alleged breaches of EU rules.</p>
<p>The complaint, reported earlier by <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/french-startup-lobby-files-privacy-complaint-against-apple">Politico</a>, follows two similar complaints lodged in Germany and Spain by EU privacy campaign group noyb <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>All these complaints are (directly and indirectly) targeting Apple&#8217;s IDFA &#8212; aka its mobile device Identifier for Advisers &#8212; with noyb arguing Apple should be gathering consent from users in the EU prior to assigning this unique device (whose purpose is, as the name suggests, to enable device tracking for ad targeting).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zJ0pW8IcCq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/">Apple&#8217;s IDFA gets targeted in strategic EU privacy complaints</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s IDFA gets targeted in strategic EU privacy complaints&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/embed/#?secret=zJ0pW8IcCq" data-secret="zJ0pW8IcCq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>France Digitale&#8217;s complaint also raises competition concerns, pointing to a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change/"> looming switch by Apple</a> &#8212; to require opt in for third party apps to track users &#8212; and contrasting that with a &#8216;personalized advertising&#8217; setting in iOS which it says lets Apple track users and is switched on by default.</p>
<p>It suggests that default is contrary to requirements under EU law (citing consent standards in the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR).</p>
<p>The France Digitale complaint also raises questions over the level of data access Apple provides iOS users related to the ad targeting it carries out &#8212; saying users are only provided with &#8220;generic data (year of birth, sex, location)&#8221;, rather than fuller targeting data.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the complaint, an Apple spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>The allegations in the complaint are patently false and will be seen for what they are, a poor attempt by those who track users to distract from their own actions and mislead regulators and policymakers. Transparency and control for the user are fundamental pillars of our privacy philosophy, which is why we’ve made App Tracking Transparency equally applicable to all developers including Apple. Privacy is built into the ads we sell on our platform with no tracking. We hold ourselves to a higher standard by allowing users to opt out of Apple&#8217;s limited first-party data use for personalized advertising, a feature that makes us unique.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CNIL has also been contacted for comment on the complaint.</p>
<p>The latest IDFA-related complaint against Apple is a little unusual as it&#8217;s not coming from a privacy group &#8212; but a startup lobby.</p>
<p>Evidently, though, Apple&#8217;s decision to switch to requiring opt-in from iOS users to third party tracking (rather than opt out) is ruffling feathers. (The move also led to a publisher lobby group in France to file a competition complaint last year). The not-so-subtle subtext, here, is Apple is being accused of privacy hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Asked why France Digitale is making a privacy complaint against Apple, a spokesman told TechCrunch: &#8220;Startups play by the rules. We expect the world&#8217;s largest tech company to do so. We believe no scale-up can thrive without a regulatory level-playing field.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are merely asking the CNIL to enforce the law. Privacy watchdogs investigate our startup members all the time. Lets them use their expertise on the bigger cats,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>While the group has attracted some quick publicity with the complaint to the CNIL, under GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism the matter would have to be referred to Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission &#8212; which is Apple&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the EU &#8212; which would then take a decision on whether or not to investigate. So there&#8217;s unlikely to be any quick regulatory action on this issue.</p>
