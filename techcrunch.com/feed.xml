										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new UK public body that will be tasked with helping regulate the most powerful companies in the digital sector to ensure competition thrives online and consumers of digital services have more choice and control over their data has launched today.</p>
<p>The Digital Markets Unit (DMU), which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">announced in November last year</a> &#8212; following a number of market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/competition-policy-must-change-to-help-startups-fight-winner-takes-all-platforms-says-uk-report/">reviews</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/competition-policy-must-change-to-help-startups-fight-winner-takes-all-platforms-says-uk-report/">studies</a> examining concerns about the concentration of digital market power &#8212; does not yet have statutory powers itself but the government has said it will consult on the design of the new &#8220;pro-competition regime&#8221; this year and legislate to put the <span class="il">DMU</span> on a statutory footing as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
<p>Concerns about the market power of adtech giants Facebook and Google are key drivers for the regulatory development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4bb.png" alt="💻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Our new Digital Markets Unit, launched today, will help make sure tech giants can’t exploit their market dominance to crowd out competition and stifle innovation online. </p>
<p>Find out more: <a href="https://t.co/PCBCYwuA3o">https://t.co/PCBCYwuA3o</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ybvn81uuBK">pic.twitter.com/Ybvn81uuBK</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Competition &amp; Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/CMAgovUK/status/1379690636513792001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>As a first job, the unit will look at how codes of conduct could work to govern the relationship between digital platforms and third parties such as small businesses which rely on them to advertise or use their services to reach customers &#8212; to feed into future digital legislation.</p>
<p>The role of powerful intermediary online gatekeepers is also being targeted by lawmakers in the European Union who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">proposed legislation at the end of last year</a> which similarly aims to create a regulatory framework that can ensure fair dealing between platform giants and the smaller entities which do business under their terms.</p>
<p>The UK government said today that the DMU will take a sector neutral approach in examining the role of platforms across a range of digital markets, with a view to promoting competition.</p>
<p>The unit has been asked to work with the comms watchdog Ofcom, which the government named<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/uk-names-its-pick-for-social-media-harms-watchdog/"> last year</a> as its pick for regulating social media platforms under planned legislation due to be introduced this year (aka, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">Online Safety Bill</a> as it&#8217;s now called).</p>
<p>While that forthcoming legislation is intended to regulate a very wide range of online harms which may affect consumers &#8212; from bullying and hate speech to child sexual exploitation and other speech-related issues (raising plenty of controversy, and specific concerns about associated <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/endgame-for-end-to-end-encryption/">implications</a> for privacy and security) &#8212; the focus for the DMU is on business impacts and consumer controls which may also have implications for competition in digital markets.</p>
<p>As part of its first work program, the government said the secretary of state for digital has asked the DMU to work with Ofcom to look specifically at how a code would govern the relationships between platforms and content providers such as news publishers &#8212; &#8220;including to ensure they are as fair and reasonable as possible&#8221;, as its press release puts it.</p>
<p>This suggests the DMU will be taking a considered look at recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">legislation passed in Australia</a> &#8212; which makes it mandatory for platforms to negotiate with news publishers to pay for reuse of their content.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the head of the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which the DMU will sit within, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p097vbtc">told the BBC </a>that Australia’s approach of having a backstop of mandatory arbitration if commercial negotiations between tech giants and publishers fail is a &#8220;sensible&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>The DMU will also work closely with the CMA&#8217;s enforcement division &#8212; which currently has a number of open investigations into tech giants, including considering complaints against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">Google</a>; and an in-depth probe of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">Facebook&#8217;s Giphy acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Other UK regulators the government says the DMU will work closely with include the data protection watchdog (the ICO) and the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
<p>It also said the unit will also coordinate with international partners, given digital competition is an issue that&#8217;s naturally globally in nature &#8212; adding that it&#8217;s already discussing its approach through bilateral engagement and as part of its G7 presidency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Digital Secretary will host a meeting of digital and tech ministers in April as he seeks to build consensus for coordination on better information sharing and joining up regulatory and policy approaches,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The DMU will be led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-hayter-649576/?originalSubdomain=uk">Will Hayter</a>, who takes up an interim head post in early May following a stint at the Cabinet Office working on Brexit transition policy. Prior to that he worked for several years at the CMU and also Ofcom, among other roles in regulatory policy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.avant.com/">Avant</a>, an online lender that has raised over $600 million in equity, announced today that it has acquired Zero Financial and its neobank brand, Level, to further its mission of becoming a digital bank for the masses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, Chicago-based Avant started out primarily as an online lender targeting “underserved consumers,” but is evolving into digital banking with this acquisition. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company notched gross revenue of $265 million in 2020 and has raised capital over the years from backers such as General Atlantic and Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our path has always been to become the premier digital bank for the everyday American,” Avant CEO James Paris told TechCrunch. “The massive transition to digital over the last 12 months made the timing right to expand our offerings.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition of Zero Financial and its neobank, Level (plus its banking app assets), will give Avant the ability to offer “a full ecosystem of banking and credit product offerings&#8221; through one fully digital platform, according to Paris. Those offerings include deposits, personal loans, credit cards and auto loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed other than the fact that the acquisition was completed with a combination of cash and stock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2016, San Francisco-based Zero Financial has raised $147 million in </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zero-financial/company_financials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debt and equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Crunchbase. New Enterprise Associates (NEA) led its $20 million Series A in May of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level was unveiled to the public in February of 2020, c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reated by the same California-based team that founded the “debit-style” credit card offering Zero, according to this FintechFutures </span><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/02/us-gets-new-challenger-level-bank-by-zero-creators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The challenger bank was created to target millennials dissatisfied with the incumbent banking options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Financial co-founder and CEO Bryce Galen said that Avant shared his company&#8217;s mission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenge the status quo by bringing innovative financial services products to consumers who might otherwise be unable to access them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avant, notes Paris, uses thousands of AI-driven data points to determine credit risk. With this acquisition, that lens will be expanded with data, such as a deposit customer’s cash flow, how they manage their finances and whether they pay their bills on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will allow us to make credit decisions faster and deliver personalized options to help underbanked consumers gain financial freedom, at any and every stage of their financial journey,” Paris told TechCrunch. “It will also build long-term engagement and loyalty and help grow our reach beyond the 1.5 million customers we’ve served to date.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a growing number of fintechs, Avant operates under the premise that a person’s ability to get credit shouldn’t be dictated by a credit score alone.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pramyEMoON"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/">Which neobanks will rise or fall?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=pramyEMoON" data-secret="pramyEMoON" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A significant amount of Americans have poor, bad or no credit at all. For these people, accessing credit isn’t exactly easy and often comes with extra fees,” Paris said. That’s why, he added, Avant has focused on providing options for such consumers with “transparent, rewards-driven products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level’s branchless, all-digital platform offers things such as cashback rewards on debit card purchases, a “competitive APY” on deposits, early access to paychecks and no hidden fees, all of which are especially beneficial for consumers on the path to financial freedom, according to Paris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception in 2012, Avant has connected more than 1.5 million consumers to $7.5 billion in loans and 400,000 credit cards. The company launched its credit card in 2017 and over the past two years alone, it has grown its number of credit card users by 170%.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than 200 million people in India transact money digitally, but fewer than 30 million invest in mutual funds and stocks.</p>
<p>An Indian startup that is attempting to change this figure by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/groww-raises-6-2m/">courting millennials</a> announced a new financing round on Wednesday and turned into the newest unicorn in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://groww.in">Groww</a> has raised $83 million in its Series D financing round, which valued the Indian startup at more than $1 billion, up from $250 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/groww-an-investment-app-for-millennials-in-india-raises-30m-led-by-yc-continuity/">$30 million Series C in September last year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tiger Global led the new round, and existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, YC Continuity and Propel Venture Partners participated in it, said the four-year-old Indian startup, which has raised $142 million to date.</p>
<p>On a side note, Groww is the eighth Indian startup to attain the unicorn status this year &#8212; and fourth this week. Social commerce Meesho <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">turned a unicorn on Monday</a>, fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">CRED on Tuesday</a>, and earlier today epharmacy firm PharmEasy <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/04/pharmeasy-raises-350-mn-round-led-by-prosus-and-tpg-enters-unicorn-club/">announced</a> a new financing round that valued the firm at about $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Groww allows users to invest in mutual funds, including systematic investment planning (SIP) and equity-linked savings, gold, as well as stocks, including those listed at U.S. exchanges. The app offers every fund that is currently available in India.</p>
<p>The startup has amassed over 8 million registered users, two-thirds of whom are first-time investors, Lalit Keshre, co-founder and chief executive of Groww, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Keshre said the startup &#8212; &#8212; co-founded by four former Flipkart executives including Harsh Jain, Neeraj Singh and Ishan Bansal &#8212; will deploy the fresh funds to accelerate its growth, and hire more talent. “We now have the fuel for longer-term thinking and faster growth,” he said.</p>
<p>More than 60% of Groww users come from smaller cities and towns of India and 60% of these have never made such investments before, said Keshre. The startup said it has conducted workshops in several small cities to educate people about the investment world.</p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has also accelerated the startup&#8217;s growth as youngsters explore new hobbies. The startup competes with a handful of firms including Zerodha, Paytm Money, Upstox, ET Money, Smallcase, and traditional firms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started Groww almost five years back to make investing accessible and transparent to everyone in India. We have made good progress, but it feels we have just got started,&#8221; said Keshre.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, a unicorn that helps connect consumers&#8217; bank accounts to financial applications, has raised a $425 million Series D, it announced this morning. TechCrunch understands that the new capital infusion, led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/altimeter-capital">Altimeter Capital</a>, values the company at around $13.4 billion.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Plaid, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">former takeover target</a> for consumer credit giant Visa, is raising more capital. After its $5.3 billion sale to the larger company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">fell through this January</a>, it became clear that Plaid would chart its own future, sans a corporate parent.</p>
<p>When the Visa-Plaid deal did finally grind to a halt in the face of regulatory scrutiny there was chatter amongst startup and venture folks that the sale dying out was a good thing. Why? Because Plaid had had a great 2020 and was generally agreed to be worth far more than what Visa had agreed to pay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Series D valuation confirms the sentiment. And it wasn&#8217;t merely Altimeter that was willing to put capital into the company at its new valuation. The group was joined by two more news investors, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/silver-lake">Silver Lake Partners</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ribbit-capital">Ribbit Capital</a>. Silver Lake is a private equity leviathan with dozens of billions of dollars under management, while Ribbit is known for its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ribbit-capital/recent_investments">myriad fintech bets</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Plaid has picked up a hybrid of investor scale, late-stage guidance, and fintech acumen in a single round. A number of prior investors also put capital into round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wxKKaEdY7B"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/plaids-zach-perret-every-company-is-a-fintech-company/">Plaid&#8217;s Zach Perret: &#8216;Every company is a fintech company&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Plaid&#8217;s Zach Perret: &#8216;Every company is a fintech company&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/plaids-zach-perret-every-company-is-a-fintech-company/embed/#?secret=wxKKaEdY7B" data-secret="wxKKaEdY7B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Plaid CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/zachperret?lang=en">Zachary Perret</a> about the deal, who told TechCrunch in a brief phone call that Altimeter was selected as its new lead investor over other options due to shared alignment regarding the future of financial services for consumers. He added that he&#8217;s excited to learn from his trio of new backers, which will help the company build for the long-term.</p>
<p>The CEO also made passing mention of a future IPO, though TechCrunch doesn&#8217;t expect to see paperwork regarding a potential flotation from Plaid for some time; it was, however, refreshing to hear an executive admit to having future financial goals.</p>
<p>Regarding the amount of capital that it raised, Perret said that it was the &#8220;right level&#8221; of capital to allow Plaid to invest in scale, both in terms of its team and its product lineup. The CEO also said that the funds will allow his company to be opportunistic.</p>
<p>The last 12 months for Plaid have been busy. Perret mentioned the time period several times during the interview, explaining how rapidly the world evolved regarding the digitization of consumer financial services over the last year.</p>
<p>Finally, what of growth? What was Plaid willing to share on the growth front was light, merely disclosing that it grew its customer count by 60% in 2020. Perret said that the figure represented an acceleration from previous years. With around 650 staffers today, Plaid grew its headcount by around 20% in the first quarter according to its CEO.</p>
<p>Plaid sits in the midst of the fintech boom that TechCrunch has covered extensively over the past several quarters. As far as external signals go, watching the companies that must partially comprise Plaid&#8217;s customer base expand is about as close as we can get to other growth metrics. That particular signal bodes well for Plaid.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how well the company can fend off domestic and international competition. It certainly now has the funds to do so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Artificial intelligence has become a fundamental cornerstone of how a lot of business software works, providing a useful boost in reading, understanding, and using the often-fragmented trove of data that organizations generate these days. In the latest development, an Israeli startup called <a href="https://www.bluedotcorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue dot</a>, which uses AI to help companies handle their tax accounting, is announcing $32 million in funding to continue its growth, specifically addressing the demand from companies for more user-friendly tools to help read and correctly itemize expenses for tax purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tax sector is very complicated, and we are playing in a very large space, but it&#8217;s a huge revolution,&#8221; Blue dot&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Isaac Saft said in an interview. &#8220;Business and enterprise accounting is just not going to look the same in the future as it does today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Ibex Investors in partnership with Lutetia Technology Partners, with past investors Lamaison Partners, Viola and Target Global also contributing. Blue dot <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vatbox-the-leading-ai-driven-cloud-based-tax-compliance-platform-announces-a-new-company-name-blue-dot-301259604.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded only last week from its original name, VATBox</a> (part of the funding will be used to help Blue dot move deeper into the U.S. market, where the concept of VAT is not quite so ubiquitous: there is no national sales tax and states determine the rates themselves).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/104757-49/company/profile#general-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pitchbook</a> notes that under its previous name, the startup last raised money in 2017, a $20 million Series B led by Viola at a $120 million post-money valuation.</p>
<p>While Blue dot is not disclosing valuation today, it&#8217;s likely to be significantly higher than this based on some of its engagements. In addition to customers like Amazon, tobacco giant BAT and Dell, it also has a partnership with one of the bigger names in expense accounting, <a href="https://www.concur.co.uk/tax-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAP Concur, which uses Blue dot</a> to power its expense data entry tool to automatically read charges and figure out how to itemize them so that employees or accountants don&#8217;t need to go through the pain of that themselves.</p>
<p>As Saft describes it, part of what is propelling his company&#8217;s business is the bigger trend of consumerization and the role that it has played in enterprise services: the working world has picked up a lot of technology tools, led by the smartphone, to help them organize their personal lives, and a lot of what they are being &#8220;served&#8221; through technology is increasingly personalized with lower barriers of entry, whether its on e-commerce sites, entertainment or social media. In the working world, they can often be frustrated as a result with how much work something like expenses can involve &#8212; a process that gets ever more complicated the more strict tax regimes become.</p>
<p>Blue dot&#8217;s approach is to essentially view the tax accounting process as something that can be improved with AI to make it easier for people to use &#8212; whether those people are workers itemizing their expenses, or accounts auditing them and running those through even bigger accounting processes. With a machine learning system that both takes into account a company&#8217;s own internal compliance and company policies, and the wider tax and regulatory framework, Blue dot helps &#8220;read&#8221; an expense and figure out how to notate it, how much tax should be accounted and where, and so on.</p>
<p>This is especially important as the process of entering and managing expenses gets pushed out to the people spending the money, rather than dedicated accountants handling that work on their behalf. An awareness of how modern offices are functioning today and evolving is one reason why investors were interested here.</p>
<p>“We believe Blue dot can change the way organizations worldwide manage accounting and its tax implications for their expenses,” Gal Gitter, a partner at Ibex, said in a statement. “There’s been a major market shift away from centralization of enterprise functions, including procurement. As that accelerates, more companies will be looking for ways to replace costly and complex manual processes with digital, automated solutions that use data and AI to essentially enable transactions to report themselves, which Blue dot delivers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No-code startups continue to see a lot of traction among enterprises, where employees &#8212; strictly speaking, non-technical, but still using software every day &#8212; are getting hands-on and building apps to take on some of the more repetitive aspects of their jobs, the so-called &#8220;citizen coders&#8221; of the working world.</p>
<p>And in one of the latest developments, a <a href="https://bryter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryter</a> &#8212; an AI-based no-code startup that has built a platforms used by some 100 global enterprises to date across some 2,000 business applications and workflows &#8212; is announcing a new round of funding to double down on that opportunity. The Berlin-based company has closed a Series B of $66 million, money that it will be investing into its platform and expanding in the U.S. out of a New York office it opened last year. The funding comes on the heels of seeing a lot of demand for its tools, CEO and co-founder Michael Grupp said in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great year for low-code and no-code platforms,&#8221; said Grupp, who co-founded the company with Micha-Manuel Bues and Michael Hübl. &#8220;What everyone has realized is that most people don&#8217;t actually care about the tech. They only care about the use cases. They want to get things done.&#8221; Customers using the service include the likes of McDonald’s, Telefónica, and PwC, KPMG and Deloitte in Europe, as well as banks, healthcare and industrial enterprises.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tiger Global is leading this round, with previous backers Accel, Dawn Capital, Notion Capital and Cavalry Ventures all also participating, along with a number of individual backers (they include Amit Agharwal, CPO of DataDog; Lars Björk, former CEO of Qlik; Ulf Zetterberg, founder and CEO of Seal Software; and former ServiceNow global SVP James Fitzgerald). The valuation is not being disclosed; Bryter has raised around $90 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/bryter-raises-16m-for-a-no-code-platform-for-non-technical-people-to-build-enterprise-automation-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accel and Dawn co-led Bryter&#8217;s Series A of $16 million</a> less than a year ago, in June 2020, a rapid funding pace that underscores both interest in the no-code/low-code space &#8212; Bryter&#8217;s enterprise customer base has doubled from 50 since then &#8212; and the fact that startups in it are striking while the iron is hot.</p>
<p>Bryter&#8217;s not the only one: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/genesis-raises-45m-to-expand-its-fintech-focussed-low-code-platform-to-more-verticals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/rows-formerly-dashdash-raises-16m-to-build-and-populate-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creatio</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/ushur-raises-25m-for-its-no-code-platform-to-build-customer-communication-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ushur</a> are among the many startups building &#8216;hands-on tech creation for non-techie people&#8217; that have raised money in the last several months.</p>
<p>Automation has been the bigger trend that has propelled a lot of this activity. Knowledge workers today spend most of their time these days in apps &#8212; a state of affairs that pre-dates the Covid-19 pandemic, but has definitely been furthered throughout it. While some of that work still requires manual involvement and evaluation from those workers, software has automated large swathes of those jobs.</p>
<p>RPA &#8212; robotic process automation, where companies like UiPath, Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism have taken a big lead &#8212; has accounted for a significant chunk of that activity, especially when it comes to reading forms and lots of data entry. But there remains a lot of other transactions and activities within specific apps where RPA is typically not used (not yet at least!). And this is where non-tech workers are finding that no-code tools like Bryter, which use artificial intelligence to deliver more personalised, yet scalable, automation, can play a very useful role.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sit on top of RPA in many cases,&#8221; said Grupp.</p>
<p>The company says that business functions where its platform has been implemented include compliance, legal, tax, privacy and security, procurement, administration, and HR, and the kinds of features that are being built include virtual assistants, chatbots, interactive self-service tools, and more.</p>
<p>These don&#8217;t replace people as such but cut down the time they need to spend in specific tasks to process and handle information within them, and could in theory also be used to build tools for customers to interact with services more easily, cutting down on the amount of time that agents are getting details and handling engagements.</p>
<p>That scalability, and the rapid customer up-take from a pool of users that extends beyond tech early-adopters, are part of what attracted the funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bryter has all the characteristics of a top-tier software company: high quality product that solves a real customer pain point, a large market opportunity and a world-class founding team,&#8221; said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. &#8220;The feedback from Bryter&#8217;s customers was resoundingly positive in our research, and we are excited to see the company reach new heights over the coming years.”</p>
<p>“Bryter has seen explosive growth over the last year, signing landmark customers across a large number of sectors and use cases. This does not come as a surprise. In the pandemic-affected world, digitalisation is no longer a nice to have, it is an imperative,&#8221; added Evgenia Plotnikova, a partner at Dawn Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China is pushing forward an internet society where economic and public activities increasingly take place online. In the process, troves of citizen and government data get transferred to cloud servers, raising concerns over information security. One startup called <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/threatbook/company_financials">ThreatBook</a> sees an opportunity in this revolution and pledges to protect corporations and bureaucracies against malicious cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Antivirus and security software has been around in China for several decades, but until recently, enterprises were procuring them simply to meet compliance requests, Xue Feng, founder and CEO of six-year-old ThreatBook, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Starting around 2014, internet accessibility began to expand rapidly in China, ushering in an explosion of data. Information previously stored in physical servers was moving to the cloud. Companies realized that a cyber attack could result in a substantial financial loss and started to pay serious attention to security solutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the meantime, cyberspace is emerging as a battlefield where competition between states plays out. Malicious actors may target a country&#8217;s critical digital infrastructure or steal key research from a university database.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of cyberattacks between countries is reflective of their geopolitical relationships,&#8221; observed Xue, who oversaw information security at Amazon China before founding ThreatBook. Previously, he was the director of internet security at Microsoft in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;If two countries are allies, they are less likely to attack one another. China has a very special position in geopolitics. Besides its tensions with the other superpowers, cyberattacks from smaller, nearby countries are also common.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like other emerging SaaS companies, ThreatBook sells software and charges a subscription fee for annual services. More than 80% of its current customers are big corporations in finance, energy, the internet industry, and manufacturing. Government contracts make up a smaller slice. With its Series E funding round that closed 500 million yuan ($76 million) in March, ThreatBook boosted its total capital raised to over 1 billion yuan from investors including Hillhouse Capital.</p>
<p>Xue declined to disclose the company&#8217;s revenues or valuation but said 95% of the firm&#8217;s customers have chosen to renew their annual subscriptions. He added that the company has met the &#8220;preliminary requirements&#8221; of the Shanghai Exchange&#8217;s STAR board,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/"> China&#8217;s equivalent to NASDAQ</a>, and will go public when the conditions are ripe.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes our peers 7-10 years to go public,&#8221; said Xue.</p>
<p>ThreatBook compares itself to CrowdStrike from Silicon Valley, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/crowdstrike-a-cybersecurity-unicorn-files-to-go-public/">which filed to go public in 2019</a> and detect threats by monitoring a company&#8217;s &#8220;endpoints&#8221;, which could be an employee&#8217;s laptops and mobile devices that connect to the internal network from outside the corporate firewall.</p>
<p>ThreatBook similarly has a suite of software that goes onto the devices of a company&#8217;s employees, automatically detects threats and comes up with a list of solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like installing a lot of security cameras inside a company,&#8221; said Xue. &#8220;But the thing that matters is what we tell customers after we capture issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>SaaS providers in China are still in the phase of educating the market and lobbying enterprises to pay. Of the 3,000 companies that ThreatBook serves, only 300 are paying so there is plentiful room for monetization. Willingness to spend also differs across sectors, with financial institutions happy to shell out several million yuan ($1 = 6.54 yuan) a year while a tech startup may only want to pay a fraction of that.</p>
<p>Xue&#8217;s vision is to take ThreatBook global. The company had plans to expand overseas last year but was held back by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a handful of inquiries from companies in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. There may even be room for us in markets with mature [cybersecurity companies] like Europe and North America,&#8221; said Xue. &#8220;As long as we are able to offer differentiation, a customer may still consider us even if it has an existing security solution.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">The creator economy platform, which allows artists to be directly funded by their fans, received new attention amid the Covid-19 pandemic as creators were forced to push more of their work online. The creator payments space has seen a multitude of new entrants in recent months but the eight-year-old Patreon has already built up an extensive network. In a blog post last year, Patreon noted that more than 30,000 creators signed up for the service in the first weeks of March 2020.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Patreon makes money by taking a 5-12 percent fee from creators depending on which of the company&#8217;s services they use. The company wrapped a $90 million round in September that valued the company at $1.2 billion.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Other investors in this new round include Woodline Partners, Wellington Management, Lone Pine Capital and New Enterprise Associates, the report notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European regulators have questions about a Facebook data breach, Clubhouse adds payments and a robotics company has SPAC plans. This is your Daily Crunch for April 6, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Facebook faces questions over data breach</strong></p>
<p>A data breach involving personal data (such as email addresses and phone numbers) of more than 500 million Facebook accounts came to light over the weekend thanks to a story <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">in Business Insider</a>. Although Facebook said the breach was related to a vulnerability that was &#8220;found and fixed&#8221; in August 2019, the Irish Data Protection Commission — Facebook&#8217;s lead data regulator in the European Union — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach/">suggested that it&#8217;s seeking the &#8220;full facts&#8221; in the matter</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The newly published dataset seems to comprise the original 2018 (pre-GDPR) dataset and combined with additional records, which may be from a later period,” said deputy commissioner Graham Doyle in a statement. &#8220;A significant number of the users are EU users. Much of the data appears to been data scraped some time ago from Facebook public profiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, it looks like EU regulators may also look into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral/">Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of customer service company Kustomer</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Encrypted chat app Signal is <a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/">adding payments</a> to the services it provides, a long-expected move and one the company is taking its time on. A U.K.-only beta program will allow users to trade the cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.mobilecoin.com/">MobileCoin</a> quickly, easily, and most importantly, privately.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the U.K., or have some way to appear to be, you&#8217;ll notice a new Signal Payments feature in the app when you update. All you need to do to use it is link a MobileCoin wallet after you buy some on the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the only one that lists it right now.</p>
<p>Once you link up, you&#8217;ll be able to instantly send MOB to anyone else with a linked wallet, pretty much as easily as you&#8217;d send a chat. (No word on when the beta will expand to other countries or currencies.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just as Signal doesn&#8217;t have any kind of access to the messages you send or calls you make, your payments are totally private. MobileCoin, which Signal has been working with for a couple years now, was built from the ground up for speed and privacy, using a zero-knowledge proof system and other innovations to make it as easy as Venmo but as secure as … well, Signal. You can read more about their approach <a href="https://github.com/UkoeHB/Mechanics-of-MobileCoin/blob/master/Mechanics-of-MobileCoin-v0-0-39-preview-10-11.pdf">in this paper (PDF)</a>.</p>

<p>MobileCoin just snagged a little over $11 million in funding last month as rumors swirled that this integration was nearing readiness. Further whispers propelled the value of MOB into the stratosphere as well, nice for those holding it but not for people who want to use it to pay someone back for a meal. All of a sudden you&#8217;ve given your friend a Benjamin (or perhaps now, in the U.K., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/computing-pioneer-and-lgbt-icon-alan-turing-will-grace-the-50-note-in-2021/">a Turing</a>) for no good reason, or that the sandwich has depreciated precipitously since lunchtime.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason you <em>have</em> to hold the currency, of course, but swapping it for stable or fiat currencies every time seems a chore. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-payments-messaging-cryptocurrency/">Speaking to Wired</a>, Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike envisioned an automatic trade-out system, though he is rarely so free with information like that if it is something under active development.</p>
<p>While there is some risk that getting involved with cryptocurrency, with the field&#8217;s mixed reputation, may dilute or pollute the goodwill Signal has developed as a secure and disinterested service provider, the team there seems to think it&#8217;s inevitable. After all, if popular payment services are being monitored the same way your email and social media are, perhaps we ought to nip this one in the bud and go end-to-end encrypted as quickly as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of Democratic lawmakers wrote to Mark Zuckerberg this week to press the CEO on his plans to curate a version of Instagram for children. In a hearing last month, Zuckerberg confirmed<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"> reporting by BuzzFeed</a> that the company was exploring an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/03/25/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-congress-hearing-exploring-instagram-kids/7001956002/">age-gated version of its app</a> designed for young users.</p>
<p>Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Representatives Lori Trahan (D-MA) and Kathy Castor (D-FL) signed the <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/instagram_kids_letter.pdf">letter</a>, expressing &#8220;serious concerns&#8221; about the company&#8217;s ability to protect the privacy and well-being of young users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has an obligation to ensure that any new platforms or projects targeting children put those users’ welfare first, and we are skeptical that Facebook is prepared to fulfill this obligation,&#8221; the lawmakers wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They cited previous failures with products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/facebook-messenger-kids/">Messenger Kids</a>, which had a flaw that allowed kids to chat with people beyond their privacy parameters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although software bugs are common, this episode illustrated the privacy threats to children online and evidenced Facebook’s inability to protect the kids the company actively invited onto this platform,&#8221; the lawmakers wrote.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mn21Ajb9vB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/">MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/embed/#?secret=mn21Ajb9vB" data-secret="mn21Ajb9vB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In light of these and other previous privacy and security issues on Facebook’s platforms, we are not confident that Facebook will be able to adequately protect children’s privacy on a version of Instagram for young users.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter set a deadline of April 26 for the company to provide answers to a comprehensive and helpfully specific set of questions about a future kid-targeted product.</p>
<p>In the letter, lawmakers posed a number of questions about how Facebook will handle the private data for young users and if that data would be deleted when an account is terminated. They also asked the company to commit to not targeting kids with ads and not employing push alerts and behavior-shaping features designed to make apps more addictive.</p>
<p>During last month&#8217;s big tech hearing in the House, committee members from both political parties grilled Zuckerberg about how Facebook and Instagram adversely affect mental health in young users. Rep. Castor also pressed the chief executive about underage users who circumvent Instagram&#8217;s existing age guidelines to use a platform full of posts, videos and ads designed for adults.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, every parent knows there are kids under the age of 13 on Instagram, and the problem is that you know it,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the first quarter of 2021, American consumer cryptocurrency trading giant <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> grew sharply, generating strong profits at the same time.</p>
<p>For Coinbase, the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210406006015/en/">disclosure</a> of its preliminary Q1 2021 results <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/coinbase-to-direct-list-on-april-14th-provide-financial-update-on-april-6th/">comes a week ahead</a> of its direct listing, an event that will see the company begin to trade publicly. As it is both cash rich and well known, Coinbase is foregoing a traditional IPO in favor of the more exotic method of going public.</p>
<p>In its release, Coinbase disclosed the following metrics, which TechCrunch has compared to metrics from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm">its S-1 filing</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly transacting users (MTUs)</strong> of 6.1 million, up from 2.8 million at the end of 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Platform assets</strong> of $223 billion, up from $90.3 billion at the end of 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Trading volume</strong> of $335 billion, up from $193.1 billion at the end of 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> of $1.8 billion, up from $585.1 million in Q4 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Net income</strong> of &#8220;approximately $730 million to $800 million,&#8221; up from $178.8 million in Q4 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA</strong> of &#8220;approximately $1.1 billion,&#8221; up from $287.7 million in Q4 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>The growth of Coinbase from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 is so extreme that the company&#8217;s year-over-year comparisons are farcical. For example, in Q1 2020 Coinbase&#8217;s revenues were $190.6 million, or just under 11% of its Q1 2021 top line. The company&#8217;s adjusted profits alone in Q1 2021 were more than five times its year-ago revenues.</p>
<p>The new numbers may help solidify some valuation marks that the company has been discussed as approaching, like the $100 billion threshold, or even boost them.</p>
<p>The company did present some warnings in its public release, noting that cryptocurrency price &#8220;cycles can be highly volatile, and as a result, [Coinbase] measure[s] [its] performance over price cycles in lieu of quarterly results.&#8221; The company also stated that future declines in crypto trading activity will not slow its investment:</p>
<blockquote><p>MTUs, Trading Volume, and therefore transaction revenue currently fluctuate, potentially materially, with Bitcoin price and crypto asset volatility. This revenue unpredictability, in turn, impacts our profitability on a quarter-to-quarter basis. <strong>In terms of expenses, we intend to prioritize investment, including in periods where we may see a decrease in Bitcoin price.</strong> This is because we believe that scale is central to achieving our mission and it is still early in the development of this industry. <em><strong>[Emphasis: TechCrunch]</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Or more simply, it is willing to sacrifice future profitability if its revenues decline, as it is building for the future instead of hewing to more near-term investor expectations. At least Coinbase is being clear in its messaging to investors: Don&#8217;t buy Coinbase stock expecting the company to tune its results to quarterly expectations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XadpEXQcUo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/embed/#?secret=XadpEXQcUo" data-secret="XadpEXQcUo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Looking ahead, Coinbase did provide some guidance for its full-year results. For 2021, the company provided three scenarios. The first &#8220;assumes an increase in crypto market capitalization and moderate-to-high crypto asset price volatility,&#8221; leading to 7 million MTUs. The second &#8220;assumes flat crypto market capitalization and low-to-moderate crypto asset price volatility&#8221; and 5.5 million MTUs. The third &#8220;assumes a significant decrease in crypto market capitalization, similar to the decrease observed in 2018, and low levels of crypto asset price volatility thereafter&#8221; and 4 million MTUs for the year.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t think that Coinbase is anticipation stagnant growth, simply because its best scenario anticipates mere growth from 6.1 million MTUs to 7 million MTUs. The company wrote in its release under the headline &#8220;institutional revenue&#8221; that it expects &#8220;meaningful growth in 2021 driven by transaction and custody revenue given the increased institutional interest in the crypto asset class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s quarter was bonkers good. But so was the performance of cryptocurrencies themselves. A bet on the company&#8217;s shares, then, could easily be seen as a bet on the value of bitcoin and its ilk. April 14 is going to be a fun day to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based Rapid Robotics today <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/04/06/2204842/0/en/NEA-leads-12M-Series-A-in-Rapid-Robotics-amid-US-manufacturing-resurgence.html">announced a $12 million Series A</a>. The new round, led by NEA, brings the company’s total funding up to $17.5 million. It joins a recently closed seed round, announced way back in November of last year. Existing investors Greycroft, Bee Partners and 468 Capital also took part in the round.</p>
<p>We noted at that stage that COVID-19 had a sizable impact on robotics investment. At the very least, the pandemic has served to accelerate interest in automation, as many “non-essential” workers have been unable to travel to their jobs. At present, manufacturing jobs often lack the ability to perform remotely.</p>
<p>Rapid notes that the company’s tech has been involved with the production of some 50 million parts over the past year, over a wide variety of different manufacturing verticals. And, like his predecessor, President Biden has already begun talking up strategies to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. Of course, ambitious as it might be, any plan is going to have to be a balancing act between human jobs and automation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company notes the longstanding issue with human operators in these roles. “If we don’t solve this problem, U.S. manufacturers will never be able to compete in a global market,” CEO Jordan Kretchmer said in a release. “It’s really that simple.”</p>
<p>Rapid’s main value add here is ease of use. The company creates systems designed to get up and running quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major new project to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">survey</a> European founders and investors in cities outside the larger European capitals.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we will ask entrepreneurs in these cities to talk about their ecosystems, in their own words.</p>
<p><strong>This is your chance to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">put <strong>Belfast</strong> on the Techcrunch Map</a>!</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>If you are a tech startup founder or investor in the city please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out the survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-great-techcrunch-survey-of-europes-vcs-be-featured-in-our-survey/">huge survey of investors</a> (see also below) we’ve done over the last six or more months, largely in capital cities.</p>
<p>These formed part of a broader series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys">surveys we’re doing regularly for Extra Crunch</a>, our subscription service that unpacks key issues for startups and investors.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">first wave of surveys</a>, the cities we wrote about were largely capitals. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">see them listed here</a>.</p>
<p>This time, we will be surveying founders and investors in Europe’s other cities to capture how European hubs are growing, from the perspective of the people on the ground.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how your city’s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19 and generally how your city will evolve.</p>
<p>We leave submissions mostly unedited and are generally looking for at least one or two paragraphs in answers to the questions.</p>
<p><strong>So if you are a tech startup founder or investor in one of these cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out our survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email <a href="mailto:mike@techcrunch.com">mike@techcrunch.com</a> and/or reply on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">@mikebutcher</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has launched a new app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/find-my-certification-asst/id1532296125">Find My Certification Asst.</a>, designed for use by MFi (Made for iPhone) Licensees, who need to test their accessories&#8217; interoperability with Apple&#8217;s Find My network. The network helps users find lost Apple devices &#8212; like iPhones, AirPods and Mac computers, among other things &#8212; but is poised to add support for finding other compatible accessories manufactured by third parties.</p>
<p>The launch of the testing app signals that Apple may be ready to announce the launch of the third-party device program in the near future.</p>
<p>According to the app&#8217;s description, MFi Licensees can use Find My Certification Asst. to test the &#8220;discovery, connection and other key requirements&#8221; for their accessories that will incorporate Apple&#8217;s Find My network technology. It also points to information about the Find My network certification program on Apple&#8217;s MFi Portal at <a href="https://mfi.apple.com/">mfi.apple.com</a>, which currently references Find My network as a MFi program technology that&#8217;s &#8220;launching soon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new app&#8217;s screenshots indicate it allows device makers to run a wide variety of tests in areas like connectivity, sound (for example, if the item can make a noise when misplaced), firmware, key management, NFC, power and more.</p>

<p>The app became publicly available on Sunday, April 4 on the iOS App Store, according to Sensor Tower data. It&#8217;s brand new so is not yet ranking in any App Store categories, including its own, &#8220;Developer Tools,&#8221; or others. It also has no ratings and reviews at this time.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s launch is step toward the larger goal of opening up the Apple Find My network to third parties and Apple&#8217;s planned launch of its own new accessory, AirTags.</p>
<p>Apple at last year&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking">had first announced</a> it would open up Find My to third-party devices after facing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/sonos-popsockets-complain-to-congress-about-big-tech.html">pressure from regulators</a> in the U.S. and Europe who had been looking into, among other things, whether Apple had been planning to give itself an advantage with its forthcoming launch of AirTags, a competitor to Tile&#8217;s lost-item finder.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134629" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134629" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2134629" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134629" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of FMCA app</p></div></p>
<p>A prominent Apple critic, Tile had complained that AirTags would be able to connect with Apple&#8217;s U1 chips, which use UWB (ultra-wideband) technology for more precise finding capabilities, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/sonos-popsockets-complain-to-congress-about-big-tech.html">at a Congressional hearing noted</a> that AirTags would work with Apple&#8217;s own Find My app, which ships by default on Apple devices. This, Tile believed, would give Apple a first-party advantage in the lost-item finder market that Tile had successfully established and dominated for years.</p>
<p>Apple, in response, opened up <a href="https://www.imore.com/ios-14-developers-can-now-take-advantage-u1-chip-thanks-new-nearby-interaction-framework">third-party developer access</a> to its U1 chip via its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/nearbyinteraction">&#8220;NearbyInteraction&#8221;</a> framework last year. As a result, Tile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">in Jan. 2021 announced</a> its plan to launch a new tracker powered by UWB.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/02/ios-14-5-beta-3-enables-new-items-tab-in-find-my-to-track-airtags-and-third-party-accessories/">Apple updated its Find My app</a> to include a new tab called &#8220;Items&#8221; in preparation for the app&#8217;s expanded support for AirTags and other third-party accessories, like those from Tile and others. This &#8220;Items&#8221; tab is enabled in latest Apple&#8217;s iOS 14.5 beta release, where the app explains how the Find My app will now be able to help users keep track of their everyday items &#8212; including accessories and other items that are compatible with Find My.</p>
<p>However, Tile (and likely others) feel that Apple&#8217;s concessions still disadvantage their businesses because participation in Apple&#8217;s FindMy program means that the third-party device maker would have to abandon its existing app and instead require its customers to use Apple&#8217;s FindMy app &#8212; effectively turning over its customers and their data to Apple.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that, upon launch, the app features an icon that shows three items: headphones, a backpack and a suitcase. Not coincidentally, perhaps, Tile&#8217;s first integrations were with Bose headphones and luggage and bag makers, Away and Herschel.</p>
<p>Apple has not responded to a request for comment about the new app&#8217;s launch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Instead of sending batteries straight to recycling — and leaving unrealized value on the table — startups and automakers are finding ways to reuse batteries in a small and growing market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric cars and trucks seem to have everything going for them: They don&#8217;t produce tailpipe emissions, they&#8217;re quieter than their fossil-fuel-powered counterparts and the underlying architecture allows for roomier and often sleeker designs. But the humble lithium-ion battery powering these cars and trucks leads a difficult life. Irregular charging and discharge rates, intense temperatures and many partial charge cycles cause these batteries to degrade in the first five to eight years of use, and eventually, they end up in a recycling facility.</p>
<p>Instead of sending batteries straight to recycling for raw material recovery — and leaving unrealized value on the table — startups and automakers are finding ways to reuse batteries as part of a small and growing market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Low consumer uptake and the relatively recent introduction of EVs to the market has kept the supply of used batteries low, but automakers are already pursuing a number of second-life projects.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the average electric vehicle lithium-ion battery can retain up to 70% of its charging capacity after being removed. The business proposition for second-life batteries is therefore intuitive: Before sending the battery to a recycler, automakers can potentially generate additional revenue by putting it to use in another application or selling it to a third party.</p>
<p>Low consumer uptake and the relatively recent introduction of EVs to the market has kept the supply of used batteries low, but automakers are already pursuing a number of second-life projects.</p>
<p>To name only a few such projects that have popped up in recent years, Nissan is using old batteries to power small robots; French carmaker Groupe Renault, with partners, is launching stationary energy storage systems made with old EV batteries; and Audi Environmental Foundation, the daughter organization of Audi AG, worked with Indian startup Nunam to build solar nanogrids out of used e-tron battery modules.</p>
<p>Other OEMs, like Lucid Motors, BMW and Proterra, are incorporating reuse principles into their battery design. In fact, Lucid has built its batteries to work across its electric vehicle and energy storage products, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/">including in second-life uses</a>, Chief Engineer Eric Bach told TechCrunch. And BMW has used a &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; concept with the batteries in its i3 model so that they can be easily removed and inserted into second-life applications, BMW spokesperson Weiland Bruch said in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We believe that battery second-life will become its own self-standing business field,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>A new lease on battery life</h2>
<p>Automakers are increasingly bullish on second-life uses, though the size of their role in this budding market is still unclear. Matthew Lumsden, CEO of U.K.-based Connected Energy, told TechCrunch that he has noticed a shift in the past two years where some OEMs have begun viewing batteries as an asset rather than a liability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, in a twist, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has announced a proposal for a $10 million allocation in the state budget to create a seed fund for Black and Latinx startups, TechCrunch has learned exclusively. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black and Latinx Seed Fund will be administered by the New Economic Development Authority (NJEDA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NJEDA CEO Tim Sullivan said based on research conducted by the state, that New Jersey is the first state in the nation to develop this type of fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the move is a “direct response </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the systemic racial inequities in access to capital for Black and brown entrepreneurs” and aimed at addressing “the racial wealth gap.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think two of the centerpieces of Gov. Murphy&#8217;s strategy overall for the economy is to build a stronger and fairer New Jersey and a stronger and fairer economy,” Sullivan said, adding that the state is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also focused on “reclaiming New Jersey&#8217;s heritage of leadership, innovation and entrepreneurship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a known fact that the number of venture dollars flowing to Black and Latinx founders is dismally low.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one evidence of that, last year </span><a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/2020-diversity-spotlight-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that as of Aug. 31, Black and Latinx founders had raised $2.3 billion in funding, representing just 2.6% of the total $87.3 billion in funding that had gone to all founders up until that point in 2020.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Digitalundivided’s ProjectDiane 2020 report found that Black and Latinx women founders received just $1.7 billion of the total $276.7 billion venture dollars invested between 2018 and 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past several months &#8212; in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement &#8212; we’ve seen an increasing number of venture funds </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announce initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward funding a broader group of founders.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aEylX7Nexb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before there was a Silicon Valley, whether you&#8217;re talking about folks like Thomas Edison, Bell Labs or Sarnoff Labs, we were the place that perhaps more than any other place that fueled 20th century American entrepreneurial-led growth,” Sullivan told TechCrunch. “And the reality is that we lost a little bit of that. We&#8217;re still one of the top places for innovation and entrepreneurship, but other places &#8211;whether it&#8217;s out west or in places like Austin and Boston &#8212; have really upped their game and we want to recapture that unquestioned leadership position in innovation, entrepreneurship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that — under Gov. Murphy&#8217;s leadership — the state wants “to build the most diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem in America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a lot easier said than done, particularly because of not only centuries worth of systemic discrimination and racism, but some very specific manifestations of that systemic disenfranchisement and discrimination, particularly around venture capital funding and early-stage seed funding,” added Sullivan, who once worked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at Barclays Capital as chief of staff to the head of Global Investment Banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zakiya Smith Ellis, chief policy advisor to Gov. Murphy, said the initiative came after conversations with Black and Latinx business investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his was developed with the input of folks who might be direct beneficiaries of this program and that community was directly impactful in designing and developing this proposal,” Smith Ellis told TechCrunch. “We hear from them ‘we don&#8217;t have the family members, we don&#8217;t have the friends who are just going to write me a check at the very beginning, I think this is really instructive.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature is set to vote on the proposal by July 1.</span><b></b></p>
<p>While it was difficult to find examples of governments doing similar things, there are a number of organizations out there that are committed to funding diverse founders.</p>
<p>In February, several national and Chicago-based organizations banded together to support early-stage Black and Latinx tech entrepreneurs through a new program dubbed <a href="https://techrise.co/">TechRise</a>. The nonprofit P33 launched the program in partnership with Verizon and 1871, a private business incubator and technology hub, among others, with the goals &#8220;of narrowing the wealth gap in Chicago, generating thousands of tech-related jobs and giving $5 million in grant funding to Black and Latino entrepreneurs,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/2/25/22301698/techrise-initiative-support-chicago-black-latinx-latino-tech-founders">Chicago Sun Times</a>. (<em>Disclosure: Verizon is TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company</em>).</p>
<p>And, Detroit-based ID Ventures says it invests in minority and women-led companies &#8220;at 4x the national average.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By providing opportunities to underrepresented entrepreneurs, we can ensure representation, respect our state’s diversity, and create a startup community unlike any other,&#8221; the organization&#8217;s website says.</p>
<p>Also in Austin, <a href="https://divinc.org/">DivInc</a> is a nonprofit pre-accelerator that holds 12-week programs for underrepresented tech founders. Founded in 2016 by former Dell executive Preston James, the organization aims to &#8220;e<span class="lt-line-clamp__line">mpower people of color and women entrepreneurs and help them build successful </span><span class="lt-line-clamp__line">high-growth businesses by providing them with access to education, mentorship and vital networks.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The competition for note-taking is as fierce as it has ever been with plenty of highly-valued productivity startups fighting for an audience it can potentially serve endless productivity offshoots. In the past year, Notion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/">raised at</a> a $2 billion valuation, Coda <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/08/11/coda-startup-backed-by-kleiner-perkins-and-greylock-raises-80-million/?sh=47f5f8ab7825">raised at</a> $636 million, and Roam <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-200-million-seed-valuation-for-roam-shows-investor-frenzy-for-note-taking-apps">raised at</a> $200 million.</p>
<p>A new competitor in the space is emerging out of stealth with fresh funding from Andreessen Horowitz. The free app, called <a href="https://mem.ai/">Mem</a>, is an early access platform dedicated to pushing users to quickly jot down their thoughts without focusing too heavily on the underlying organization of them. The startup&#8217;s founders have vast ambitions for what their platform could become down the road, tapping into further advances in machine learning and even AR.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really the differentiation is [information] that is summonable ubiquitously wherever you are,&#8221; Mem co-founder Kevin Moody tells TechCrunch. &#8220;So, in the near term, through your desktop app with Mem Spotlight as a heads-up display for wherever you are, in the medium term through an assistive mobile application, and then in the long term, imagine contact lenses that are overlaying useful content to you in the world.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moody and his co-founder Dennis Xu tell TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $5.6 million in a seed round led by a16z with additional participation from their Cultural Leadership Fund, Will Smith&#8217;s dreamers.vc, Floodgate, Unusual Ventures and Shrug Capital. The round also was host to a handful of angel investors including Harry Stebbings, Julia Lipton, Tony Liu, Rahul Vohra and Todd Goldberg, among others.</p>
<p>In its current iteration, Mem push users towards &#8220;lightweight organization&#8221; rather than clicking through folders and links to find the perfect place to nestle their thoughts. Users can quickly tag users or dedicated topics in their notes. The user workflow relies pretty heavily on search and chronological organization, presenting users with their most recently accessed notes. Users can also set reminders for certain notes, bringing a popular email framework to note-taking.</p>
<p>For users of stock apps like Apple Notes, these interface quirks may not sound very jarring, though the design is still a departure from apps like Notion and Airtable which have heavily focused on structure over immediacy.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mem&#8217;s biggest shift is how users access the information they&#8217;ve dumped into the platform. The founders say they want to avoid their app being seen as a &#8220;destination,&#8221; instead hoping users rely heavily on a keyboard-shortcut-prompted overlay called Mem Spotlight that allows them to search out information that they may need for an email, presentation or text message. The broader hope of the founders and investors behind Mem is that the team can leverage the platform&#8217;s intelligence over time to better understand the data dump from your brain &#8212; and likely other information sources across your digital footprint &#8212; to know you better than any ad network or social media graph does.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would it mean to just capture passively your digital footprint and then make use of that as though it were structured,&#8221; Moody posits. &#8220;If we can actually have our own Mem modeling of all of these entities, whether it&#8217;s text, or maybe it&#8217;s contacts, the people that you know, or it&#8217;s the events that you&#8217;re going to and these different sources feed into Mem, what would it mean for Mem to be able to have a product that is the &#8216;you&#8217; API?&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the startup&#8217;s app isn&#8217;t quite as grandiose in scale as what the founders may see in its future, but as Mem continues to onboard early users from its waitlist and add to its desktop functionality, the company is driving towards a platform they hope feels more instrumental to how its users &#8220;remember&#8221; information.</p>
