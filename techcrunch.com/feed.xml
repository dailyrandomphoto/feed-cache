</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you want your homepage to convert, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure that there is minimal confusion and friction for the user.</p>
<p>Conversion can be thought of as a formula: Conversion = Desire &#8211; Labor &#8211; Confusion. Keep this formula in mind when building your website. Your goal is to increase desire while decreasing labor (friction) and confusion. People have short attention spans, so if your homepage is confusing, they&#8217;re going to leave.</p>
<p>This post is going to tear down the homepage of Ahrefs, an all-in-one search engine optimization platform that allows marketers to perform competitive analysis, audit their site&#8217;s search traffic and find keywords that will allow them to rank better on search engines.</p>
<p>This teardown covers all the key sections of a landing page so that you can apply their conversion tactics and copywriting strategies to your startup&#8217;s homepage.</p>
<h2>Capture attention with an objection handler</h2>
<p>The first section of your website that a visitor will see is your above-the-fold (ATF) section. This section is important, because this is your chance to make a good first impression on visitors when they visit your website. If your ATF section is confusing or uninteresting, you risk the visitors leaving and reading nothing else.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Ahrefs&#8217; ATF section has four pieces that we&#8217;ll dive into individually: the header, call to action, social proof and a subhead.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246578" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246578" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2246578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png" alt="Ahrefs' above the fold section has four pieces: header, call-to-action, social proof and a sub-header." width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246578" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve<strong><br /></strong></p></div></p>
<h2>A header that tackles the most common objection</h2>
<p>Your header must hook readers with your most compelling feature framed as a bold claim. When you handle your target audience&#8217;s biggest objection, it can serve as the bold claim that gets visitors to continue reading.</p>
<p>Ahrefs uses a common header template: Get [benefit] without [problem]. In this case, it&#8217;s flipped: With [product] you won&#8217;t have [problem] in order to get [benefit].</p>
<p>Ahrefs knows a lot of businesses need SEO but don&#8217;t have the time or resources to build expertise. So, Ahrefs tells their visitors you don&#8217;t have to be an SEO professional to use its product.</p>
<p>The underlying benefit here is that users will get more search traffic and rank higher on the web while not needing SEO expertise to do so.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246582" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246582" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2246582" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png" alt="Ahrefs tells their visitors you don't have to be an SEO pro to use their product." width="1024" height="792" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png 1218w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=768,594 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=680,526 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246582" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Make your call to action stand out</h2>
<p>Calls to action (CTAs) are the only way to move visitors down the relationship funnel. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to get someone to sign up without encouraging them to do so. Visitors instinctively don&#8217;t want to sign up.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed in 2021. Stories abound of pandemic-era crypto millionaires that have struck it rich in the sector.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency narrative is a private sector one by design. Bitcoin and other crypto projects began with the intent to create an immutable digital currency that is decentralized and could not be affected by government monetary policy.</p>
<p>That said, in recent years — as the marketplace crested $2 trillion in value — the public sector has increasingly taken a closer look, with nascent regulations emerging in some countries, outright bans in others and even wholesale adoption in a few.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249352" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The viewpoints of national governments — which print their own fiat currency — compared to some local governments can vary tremendously. Increasingly, there are a group of cities that see cryptocurrency as an opportunity to leverage the technology, financial and economic development potential of this new industry.</p>
<p>Certainly, bitcoin, blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are not terms one often hears around City Hall. But increasingly, they are in cities like Miami, Tampa, New York and Jackson, Tennessee, as the mayors of these cities laid down a marker for entering the cryptocurrency realm. As an example of their intention, mayors from all four cities recently agreed to take one or more of their paychecks in bitcoin.</p>
<p>As many stories on city innovation do, it starts with one local official leading on the topic and laying down a challenge to his fellow mayors. In this case, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1455562833006059528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted out</a> that he would take his next paycheck in bitcoin. Incoming New York City Mayor Eric Adams sought to one-up him, saying he would take <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/new-york-mayor-elect-eric-adams-to-take-first-3-paychecks-in-bitcoin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple paychecks</a> in bitcoin.</p>
<p>“Education is the best way to dispel the fear and misunderstanding surrounding crypto, and I believe that’s the root of what Mayor Adams and I are doing,&#8221; Suarez said. &#8220;If people see us dive in headfirst, perhaps it’ll give them the confidence to dip their toes in the water.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One mayor is certainly notable, and two mayors a pattern. But with more than three mayors on board the bitcoin bandwagon, it’s clearly a trend.</p>
<p>Mayor Scott Conger of Jackson, Tennessee — one of the youngest mayors the city of about 70,000 people has elected — joined the friendly challenge and said he would take a paycheck in bitcoin, too. Conger and Suarez went back and forth <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorConger/status/1456411229220708356" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter</a> about this — and Conger has been innovating in the crypto space in his small city.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, another Florida mayor jumped into the mix as well. Mayor Jane Castor of Tampa made the announcement that she would take a paycheck in bitcoin at a cryptocurrency conference in her city only a few days later. With Tampa recently crowned a <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/tampa-tops-forbes-list-of-emerging-tech-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top emerging tech city</a> and hosting 25% of tech jobs in the state, the alignment with this emerging field squares up.</p>
<p>Conger noted that what Suarez is doing doesn’t need to just be a big-city phenomenon &#8212; it can work in communities of all sizes. Seeing the interesting things happening on technology and cryptocurrency in larger cities, he thought about how that could translate in a place like Jackson — and like any good mayor, clearly had his eye toward the economic development potential for his city.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be in just Miami or a large city,” he said. “Jackson has the opportunity to do that. I mean, we were the first city in the state of Tennessee to have gig fiber internet to the home. Why can’t we be the first to adopt newer technology as it comes along?”</p>
<p>Jackson has <a href="https://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/local/2015/06/27/jackson-one-seven-tennessee-recognized-gig-city/29413037/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super-fast internet service</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> which allows it to compete broadly for companies in the tech sector. As a result, its mayor sees cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) companies as a natural outgrowth for the community.</p>
<p>“The space is wide open,” Conger noted. As the retail industry shrinks and the amount of physical space existing businesses use is reduced, the mayor sees an opportunity. “As DeFi, crypto and tech companies start popping up, they are going to need a place to go.”</p>
<p>Driving home the advantage he sees in his smaller community, Conger added, “Why go to a city with millions of people when you can come to a city with 70,000 people?”</p>
<p>This focus on economic development is one shared by all four of these mayors, as well as other local leaders dipping their toe in the waters of cryptocurrency, as they think about the future of jobs in their cities. In Miami, this feels core to the mayor’s effort within the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>“Miami is built on a common theme, the people who come here are sick and tired of being left behind — or worse — being persecuted by their governments, and they come here in search of a better life and in return, they make our city better,&#8221; Suarez said. &#8220;The Miami Movement is about bringing high-quality, high-paying jobs to our city — I want to prepare Miami for the future and to create the next generation of leaders right here at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>This focus on talent attraction and talent retention is big in Miami and in so many other cities throughout the country. Whether in tech or finance — and in this case, crypto as a blend of both — Miami is seeking to grow these sectors.</p>
<p>“The Miami Movement is a result of a perfect storm of conditions that resulted in people flocking to Miami, but the push for a growing finance and tech sector has been decades in the making,” Suarez said. “It wasn’t as ‘spur of the moment’ as many people think it was. Attracting innovation and growth to our city is a tremendous benefit to every single Miamian.”</p>
<p>We can only imagine what a place like New York City may be able to do within the cryptocurrency sector due to its long-standing supremacy in finance and the increasing strength of its tech sector. Likewise, Tampa has been on the rise for many years now, and with its rising ability to attract tech talent and economic potential, we may see some interesting differentiation start to present itself as the cryptocurrency sector matures.</p>
<p>Which will be the first city to truly make a strong play in the metaverse or perhaps even mint a municipal NFT? With this kind of leadership happening at ground level, we will know soon enough as mayors embrace the growth of this digital industry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tackle.io, a startup that helps software companies sell through cloud marketplaces such as AWS's, raised a $100 million Series C funding round co-led by Coatue and a16z at a $1.25 billion valuation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://tackle.io">Tackle.io</a>, an Idaho-based startup that helps software companies sell through cloud marketplaces such as AWS&#8217;s, announced today it has raised a $100 million Series C funding round. Co-led by<a href="https://www.coatue.com/"> Coatue</a> and <a href="https://a16z.com/">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, the round also saw participation from <a href="https://www.bvp.com/">Bessemer Venture Partners</a>.</p>
<p>Bringing Tackle&#8217;s total funding to $148 million, the Series C turned Tackle into a unicorn with a $1.25 billion valuation. A document sent to the press describes this figure as &#8220;a significant uplift&#8221; from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/tackle-nabs-35m-series-b-to-help-companies-navigate-cloud-marketplaces/">$35 million Series B</a>, whose valuation wasn&#8217;t disclosed when it took place a mere nine months ago.</p>
<p>Tackle says it plans to use its new funding to accelerate the execution of its product roadmap, scale its go-to-market (GTM) teams, expand its global reach, and continue to innovate. That&#8217;s quite a list; with $100 million it may be possible.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But since the list sounds a bit vague to us, let&#8217;s dive deeper into what Tackle is tackling.</p>
<p>As often, the company started with entrepreneurs scratching their own itch, my colleague Ron Miller reported last March. Tackle&#8217;s co-founder and CTO &#8220;Dillon Woods says that at previous jobs, he found that it took several months with a couple of engineers dedicated to the task to get a product onto the AWS marketplace, and he noticed that it was a similar set of tasks each time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tackle solved that by coming up with a solution for independent software vendors (ISVs) to list onto major cloud marketplaces: those of Amazon&#8217;s AWS, Microsoft&#8217;s Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM-owned Red Hat.</p>
<p>You might not have realized it yet, but &#8220;cloud marketplaces aren’t just one more channel for selling software – it’s becoming <em>the</em> channel,&#8221; a16z&#8217;s Martin Casado <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/03/09/investing-in-tackle/">wrote</a> last March. The investor joined Tackle&#8217;s board when his firm led the startup&#8217;s Series B round, and sees it as a category leader. &#8220;Tackle is the leading player for enabling companies to sell software through the cloud,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time, Casado referred to Tackle having more than 200 customers. That number has now grown to 350, according to the company. This includes companies such as AppDynamics, Auth0, CrowdStrike, Dell, Gitlab, HashiCorp, Looker, McAfee, NewRelic, Okta, PagerDuty, Talend, and VMware, it says.</p>
<p>The clients range from startups &#8212; most of them &#8212; to corporations, but they have one thing in common: They make software. So why would they use a &#8216;zero engineering&#8217; solution to build and maintain marketplace integrations? <a href="https://tackle.io/blog/tackle-series-b-funding/">According</a> to Tackle, it&#8217;s because &#8220;software companies shouldn’t have to build software in order to sell software&#8221; – their human resources are better used elsewhere.</p>
<p>Says Tackle customer Robson Grieve, CMO at low-code platform OutSystems: &#8220;The Tackle Platform makes leveraging Marketplaces a business decision versus a distraction to product and engineering teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>This business decision – selling via cloud marketplaces – is increasingly common.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-the-cloud-2021#Cloud-Marketplaces">State of the Cloud 2021 report</a>, Bessemer highlighted the adoption of cloud marketplaces as one of the top 3 best practices for companies to implement for GTM in the New Normal. The VC firm has backed Tackle since its seed round, and led its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tackleio-secures-a-7-25m-series-a-funding-led-by-bessemer-venture-partners-301074096.html">$7.25 million Series A round</a> in 2020, with partner Michael Droesch joining the startup&#8217;s board at that time.</p>
<p>Fellow VC firm Battery Ventures, which to our knowledge hasn&#8217;t invested in Tackle, also backs up that view. In its <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Battery_Ventures/state-of-the-opencloud-2020-238800487">State of the Open Cloud 2020 report</a>, it had listed &#8220;leverag[ing]&#8221; new cloud marketplaces to discover and reach customers as an operational best practice.</p>
<p>In its own <a href="https://tackle.io/resources/reports/state-of-cloud-marketplaces/">State of the Cloud Marketplaces Report</a>, Tackle heard from 67% of survey respondents that they planned to invest more in Marketplaces as a go-to-market avenue in 2022. The report also predicts that Cloud Marketplaces will exceed $10 billion in throughput by the end of 2023, and $50 billion by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>There are several drivers behind the rise of cloud marketplaces, but the gist is that B2B sales increasingly look like B2C sales – which is why investors are betting on Tackle. &#8220;We believe Tackle is well-positioned to help all sellers accelerate their shift toward Cloud Marketplaces and digital selling,&#8221; said Coatue general partner David Schneider, who will join Tackle’s board as an observer following the round.</p>
<p>Of course, we&#8217;d like to know more about Tackle&#8217;s revenue, but it is only saying that it doubled its ARR in 2021. &#8220;This has been a tremendous year for Tackle,&#8221; said CEO John Jahnke, as the company now &#8220;expects to see explosive growth&#8221; in 2022.</p>
<p>One thing that will grow for sure is its team: It increased from 56 to 160 employees this year, and the startup is planning to double its headcount in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the U.S., <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 13% of greenhouse gases</a> are spewed out of commercial and residential buildings. You&#8217;d be forgiven for scratching your head and asking why. If you tour a typical New York building, you&#8217;ll often find that the tech that runs deep in the underbellies of the brick-clad behemoths looks like the 1960s and smells even worse. <a href="https://www.runwise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runwise</a> is already in 4,000-ish buildings, and today announced it raised $11 million to put its tech into many thousand more. The company has a winning win/win combination of saving landlords money while giving planet earth a break in the process.</p>
<p>Runwise&#8217;s selling point is taking ancient tech that often operates on on/off switches or timers rather than sensors, and sprinkling enough technology on top to ensure that buildings aren&#8217;t heating more than they need to. The company has developed wireless sensors that operate on batteries with a 10-year battery life, and a controller computer that takes charge over the building&#8217;s boilers and heating. It claims that the average time to recuperate the cost of the install (in the form of reduced heating bills) is around nine months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five or six years ago nobody gave a shit about the environment, and we&#8217;d be like, &#8216;but it&#8217;ll have a huge impact!&#8217;. They&#8217;d ask us about the bottom line, and suddenly we&#8217;d have a conversation going,&#8221; Lee Hoffman, COO and co-founder of Runwise explains. &#8220;Our vision long term is if you run buildings better you can change the carbon profile and affordability of pretty much every city out there. That&#8217;s really our goal; there are 12 million buildings in the United States. We&#8217;re in 4,000 today, there&#8217;s really no reason we shouldn&#8217;t be in all of them.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company has been bootstrapping for a decade, with some impressive results: its tech is already available in buildings owned by some of the largest real estate operators in the country, including Related, Blackstone, Lefrak, Equity Residential, Douglas Elliman and Fairstead. Runwise claims more than 300,000 people live and work in the 4,000 or so buildings it operates. It <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">decided it&#8217;s time to kick the company into a phase of hyper growth. It raised $11 million from </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://initialized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initialized Capital</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://susaventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susa Ventures</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://notation.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notation Capital</a>,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> with participation from </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://nextview.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextView Ventures</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and several angels.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Most buildings in New York &#8212; and pretty much the entire country and the world &#8212; run on controls that were designed in the 1960s and 70s, made by a handful of companies. If you go into a brand-new Bank of America high-rise glass tower, it has a control box that has a fancy digital display, and it&#8217;s literally inside the same control from 1960s or 70s,&#8221; Hoffman explains, and gets a little animated in his incredulity. &#8220;It runs what&#8217;s called an outdoor reset, which is basically a static Excel table. If it&#8217;s heating this many minutes, turn on the heat. If this is the temperature outside, do this. It has no idea what&#8217;s going on inside the building. It&#8217;s all hardcoded. It&#8217;s completely bonkers. And this is controlling millions of dollars of energy spend in almost every building!&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Veho's technology matches package delivery demand with qualified driver partners and lets customers know the actual time of delivery and even communicates when the driver is headed their way.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://shipveho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veho</a>, a startup applying technology to next-day package delivery, aims to solve the last mile of delivery — how packages get from fulfillment centers to the customer’s door. It also wants to do it with a unique flair: providing transparency into deliveries that starts with the option of when, where and how customers want their packages delivered and then real-time communication throughout the whole process.</p>
<p>Since raising its seed round in the summer of 2020, New York-based Veho has grown 40 times in revenue, while also increasing its employee count from 15 to 400, Veho co-founder and CEO Itamar Zur told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It is already working in 14 U.S. markets, but plans to grow to 50 markets by the end of 2022. To do that, and invest in technology development, growing the team and introducing and scaling its doorstep returns program, the company announced $125 million in Series A funding that valued the company at $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249998" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>General Catalyst led the round and was joined by Construct Capital, led by Rachel Holt, Bling Capital, Industry Ventures, Fontinalis Partners and Origin Ventures. The latest funding round gives Veho a total of $130 million raised to date, Zur said.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="D09le0JrZf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/">Walmart announces GoLocal, a last-mile delivery service for other retailers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Walmart announces GoLocal, a last-mile delivery service for other retailers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/embed/#?secret=D09le0JrZf" data-secret="D09le0JrZf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You might be asking yourself why in the world a young company would take on so much capital up front like that, but Zur responded that Veho is “a substantial platform, not a small operation at this point, and we want to maintain fast growth.”</p>
<p>“We have an opportunity in the midst of the biggest e-commerce revolution, and after growing fast through the pandemic, that is not going away,” he added. “Customer experience is changing in front of our eyes, and other than speed and communication, what brands want to provide is visibility and data. We think it is the perfect time to take in more capital to continue to grow at a phenomenal rate.”</p>
<p>Sure, Amazon has a bear hug on about 50% of the last-mile market, and there is no debate that they are doing well here. Zur doesn’t deny it either, but he does see an opportunity to offer the same kind of delivery service for the 50% of e-commerce businesses that want to offer something faster than seven to 10 business days.</p>
<p>Veho&#8217;s technology matches package delivery demand with qualified driver partners and can then let customers know the actual time of day when they will receive their package and even when the driver is headed their way. It is also making it possible to reschedule a delivery in real time, change an address or provide personal delivery instructions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250030" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250030" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2250030" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg" alt="Veho" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250030" class="wp-caption-text">The Veho team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Veho</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea for the company stems from Zur’s own experience. While in business school, he bought a subscription for meal delivery, but his first package never arrived. Zur recalls trying to get in touch with the delivery company, and after waiting for 40 minutes, the call was disconnected. As a result, he canceled the subscription, which is not unlike what other consumers do as they become more intolerant of receiving packages late or not at all.</p>
<p>“In an increasingly competitive e-commerce space, there are tons of companies looking for similarly fast delivery as Amazon, but lack the scale to do it,” Zur said. “Veho levels the playing field for these brands. The biggest missed opportunities are connecting the dots between the pre-packaged experience and delivery to help brands build more loyalty and for people to stay with them longer, to buy more and buy more frequently.”</p>
<p>Veho is not alone in trying to solve the last-mile problem, and is among companies around the world also raising capital for their approaches. For example, in the past six months, we saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/e-bike-subscription-service-zoomo-raises-60m-series-b-to-disrupt-last-mile-delivery/">Zoomo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/last-mile-logistics-platform-cargamos-raises-11m-seed-round-to-expand-same-day-delivery/">Cargamos</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">Coco</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/deliverr-inventory-customers/">Deliverr</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/bringg-nabs-100m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-a-last-mile-delivery-platform-for-retailers/">Bringg</a> announce new rounds. Walmart also introduced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/">Walmart GoLocal program</a> in the summer for other retailers to tap into the retail giant’s delivery network.</p>
<p>Zur doesn’t see Veho competing against the likes of Deliverr or some of those others, but does see the company competing with the national shipping companies. He believes their technology was designed for “an older world” that didn’t include e-commerce, and that is what separates Veho from them — that it was built “entirely around the needs of e-commerce customers” with a vision of how that sector will grow over the next decade.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/at-9-29-cagr-last-mile-delivery-market-size-is-expected-to-reach-usd-200-42-bn-in-2027--says-brandessence-market-research-301387705.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global last-mile delivery market</a> was valued at around $108 billion in 2020 and is set to grow by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/last-mile-delivery-market-grow-143000535.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$146.96 billion in the next four years</a>, with North America contributing to 39% of that growth, according to technology and research company Technavio.</p>
<p>With purchases shifting to e-commerce, the logistics and parcel delivery sectors are racing to keep up with demands. They’ve also been met with major setbacks in the past few years. From the aptly dubbed “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/technology/holiday-shipageddon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shipaggedon</a>” during the holiday season in 2020, to manufacturing and shipping delays for everything from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/developers-and-designers-can-help-businesses-manage-the-semiconductor-shortage/">semiconductors</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/11/5/22764088/supply-chain-shipping-delays-logistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a ship into the port</a>.</p>
<p>Veho wants to make the delivery experience so awesome that it facilitates trust between the consumer and e-commerce company so that consumers return to order again. Zur notes this is already happening, citing that its customers, which range from selling apparel and accessories to food and packaged goods, saw a 20% increase in customer repurchase, 40% increase in customer lifetime value and an eight-point increase in net promoter score compared to customers who received their box from a traditional shipping company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kyle Doherty, managing director at General Catalyst, said there is room for more companies going after an <a href="https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2021/08/03/post-pandemic-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$800 billion e-commerce market</a>, of which <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272391/us-retail-e-commerce-sales-forecast/#:~:text=The%20eCommerce%20market%20encompasses%20the,such%20as%20smartphones%20and%20tablets." target="_blank" rel="noopener">half stems from the U.S</a>., and that is forecasted overall to grow around $100 billion each year.</p>
<p>Like Zur, Doherty had his own frustrations receiving packages at his home in San Francisco, which he said is notorious for <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/san-francisco-2nd-worst-u-s-city-for-package-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having problems with package thefts</a>.</p>
<p>“You feel helpless and that you’ve lost control of the situation,” he added. “We have had a front-row seat to the dramatic acceleration in the use of e-commerce and a stressed supply chain. We had a belief that computer technology would enable logistics providers to provide a better experience. When I was introduced to Ita, I got it instantly. He also has empathy for merchants and consumers about the consumer experience, and that stood out on many fronts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.liveflow.io/">LiveFlow</a> has raised a $3.5M Seed round which was led by Moonfire Ventures with backing from Y Combinator, Seedcamp and WndrCo.  Also participating was Victor Jacobsson, co-founder of Klarna; Bradley Horowitz, former VP Product at Google; Oliver Jung, former VP International Expansion at AirBnB, Phillip Chambers, Peakon founder &amp; CEO, and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some 55 billion parcels are shipped in bubble wrap every year. Plastic bubble wrap is reliant on fossil fuels and 98% of plastic packaging is single-use. You can imagine the adverse environmental impact of all this plastic.</p>
<p>The founders of <a href="http://woola.io">Woola</a> were running an online e-commerce store and saw the packaging problem first-hand. The lack of options in sustainable and scalable protective packaging led to them re-discovering wool — an unused resource that is elastic and regulates temperatures and humidity.</p>
<p>The result was their startup, which uses leftover sheep wool to replace bubble wrap. These wool-based packages can be reused, repurposed, or returned by the end-user, with the ultimate goal of making the solution ‘closed-loop’ so nothing goes to waste.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250179" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Woola opened a production facility in Estonia and launched its first product in December 2020. Wool envelopes were the first products to hit the market. It’s now expanding to the UK, France and Germany. The next product rolling out in January 2022 is targeted at beverage companies.</p>
<p>They’ve now a raised €2.5M Seed round led by Future Ventures. Future is joined by co-investors Kaarel Kotkas (CEO at Veriff), Janer Gorohhov (Co-founder at Veriff), Kristina Lilleõis (VP of People at Veriff), Zem Joaquin (founder of Near Future Summit), Bryan Meehan (executive chair of Blue Bottle Coffee). Woola’s previous investors include the co-founders of Pipedrive, Bolt and the angel fund Lemonade Stand.</p>
<p>“Bubble wrap has been dominating the packaging industry for ages – but its decline is inevitable,” said Woola’s CEO and co-founder Anna-Liisa Palatu. “The industry is broken for two reasons: fossil fuel reliance and single-use mindset. We need to get rid of both to make packaging more sustainable.” She is joined by co-founders Jevgeni Sirai and Katrin Kabun.</p>
<p>Steve Jurvetson from Future Ventures commented: “While e-commerce is booming, single-use plastic packaging is out of control. Woola can replace it all with beautiful envelopes made from scrap wool that would otherwise be burned or buried. The world needs sustainable alternatives to the petrochemical economy for a healthier future.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sheep wool is an unused resource – more than 200,000 tonnes of wool is thrown away in Europe yearly. Woola says this is enough to fulfill 120% of the global bubble wrap demand.</p>
<p>The startup will compete with whitelabel plastic bubble wrap and alternatives like Ranpak and S-Packaging.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment &#8212; which co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://za.linkedin.com/in/eerik&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjV-56z1_P0AhVF14UKHXxhDg8Qjjh6BAgDEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BvAbzxJKTZ_UKLgOTiCX1">Eerik Oja</a> called a bridge round &#8212; is a prequel to a larger Series A round next year. It comprises</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $6 million equity and $24 million in debt financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company raised $2.4 million in a seed round in June 2020 and followed it with $10 million in debt from emerging markets-focused <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/emerging-markets-lender-lendable-seeks-100m-to-fund-fintech-companies/amp/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi47a7L1_P0AhUkxIUKHWjwC3sQFnoECBgQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3MmURVyrRSRpMST5nAYFVz">venture debt fund Lendable</a> in December. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund doubled its participation in this recently raised debt round at $20 million, while other investors completed the rest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249946" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naspers, through its early-stage investment vehicle, <a href="https://www.naspers.com/foundry">Naspers Foundry</a>, led the equity round with $3.4 million. Existing investors include Change Ventures, the lead investor from Planet42’s seed round, as well as Startup Wise Guys, Martin and Markus Villig of Bolt, and Ragnar Sass of Pipedrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet42, though based in South Africa, has Estonian roots due to the founders’ heritage: Oja and CFO <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ee.linkedin.com/in/marten-orgna&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixy86k2PP0AhVBzRoKHc3aCrcQjjh6BAgIEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw1u7QGEe_NBaeXmQ_gVyHT_">Marten Orgna</a> founded the company in 2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In an interview, Oja mentioned that they created the car subscription model to cater to private individuals ignored by South African banks when they need vehicle financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our car subscription [model] is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">socially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inclusive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">differentiating factor is our customers would not have a car without us,” Oja said, adding that because the company is buying second-hand cars, the unit cost is lower compared to a subscription model that purchases new cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be challenging to get a personal car in most emerging markets, especially if one’s income isn’t stable. And without a good credit history, lenders tend to ignore people with bad credit or give them unfavorable interest rates for vehicle financing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet42 is one of the few upstarts focused on the African market tackling this inequality via a car subscription offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company claims to use proprietary scoring algorithms superior to traditional credit scores in assessing risk in underbanked customer segments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has over 700 dealerships. And with its algorithms, customers can find out what budget suits them and choose new or pre-owned cars from Planet42’s dealerships network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Planet42 buys the car and rents it out to the customer on a subscription basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet42 claims that of all the customers served so far, 89% would have had no other means of gaining access to a personal vehicle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve gotten so good with our scoring that we can now enable the customers who couldn’t get bank financing to get a brand new car</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have figured out a way how to do it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we can put entry-level brand new cars in the hands of the same target market and customers who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ignored by banks,” the chief executive said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years later and $50 million in equity and debt raised later, Planet42 has listed more than 7,000 cars to customers in South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This number was 3,000 when Oja spoke with TechCrunch in March, and he noted that the company grew 25% month on month in 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

While Moove focuses on financing ride-hailing cars, Planet42 and Autochek services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are targeted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at private individuals. Planet42 has a cohesive network of automobile industry stakeholders on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Moove and Autochek have made inroads into other African countries after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching from Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for Planet42, the next attractive market lies off the continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not doing it right now, but we’re not ruling it out for the future,” Oja answered on whether Planet42 would expand into other parts of Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the main reason is market size. South Africa has like 25% of all the passenger cars on the African continent; that means that whatever market we go next in Africa will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be smaller than South Africa. In South Africa, 1.1 million second-hand cars get sold and bought every year. In Mexico, that number is 7 million. So the Mexican market is six times larger than South Africa. So we want to go for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big markets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it has bought its first cars for clients in Mexico. Similar challenges stemming from transport inequality abound in the country, where 63% of the population deal with only cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mexico is one of the few countries Planet42 plans to expand to in the foreseeable future, said Oja, who also said that the company has set up an office and employed two staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the company hopes to have bought over 1 million cars for its customers across its present and future markets by 2025. Planet42 said it has also made strides in becoming a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/why-south-africa-based-car-subscription-company-planet42-is-going-carbon-neutral/amp/">carbon-neutral company</a> via a wind farm project in Northern Cape, South Africa. The car subscription company financed the farm for months with money from carbon offset credits.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapdeal filed for an initial public offering on Tuesday, joining a number of firms in India that have tapped the public market this year.</p>
<p>The New Delhi-based startup, which counts SoftBank among its backers, said in its draft prospectus that it will issue fresh shares worth $165 million. Some of its existing investors including SoftBank, Sequoia Capital India and Foxconn plan to sell as many as 30.7 million secondary shares in the IPO.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old firm, which once competed with Amazon and Flipkart in India, has lost considerable market share in recent years and shifted focus to serve consumers in smaller cities and towns.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250228" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Snapdeal, which has raised over $1.7 billion to date (according to Crunchbase and Tracxn) says more than 50 million unique customers have shopped at least once on its platform since April 2018. &#8220;75%+ of our business comes from repeat customers. More than 70% of our sales are from beyond Tier 2 towns and cities and 99% of our orders come via mobile phones. And we cover 96% of the pin codes in the country. Our users browse and connect with us in seven languages, beyond Hindi and English,&#8221; co-founder and chief executive Kunal Bahl (pictured above) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-buys-from-snapdeal-kunal-bahl/">wrote</a> in recent LinkedIn post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building Snapdeal 2.0 has meant creating all the required underlying capabilities to serve value-savvy users, staying within the guardrails of good economics and moving fast with bold and decisive steps,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The shift in focus came after months-long talks to merge the business with Flipkart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/flipkart-flipdeal-snapdeal-snapdead/">didn&#8217;t materialize in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>In its prospectus today, Snapdeal said it generated an operating revenue of $31.9 million in six months ending in September.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More than half a dozen consumer-focused Indian startups have filed for an IPO this year. While some including Zomato and Nykaa have made stellar debuts, others including Paytm, which filed for the nation&#8217;s largest IPO, has consistently performed below its issue share price. Insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar has also lost all its IPO gains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Morris Jr., founder and managing partner of the L.A.-based venture firm <a href="https://chapterone.com/en/">Chapter One</a>, just closed a $40 million early-stage fund to focus on web3 investments, and he&#8217;s in the process of raising a separate, $20 million opportunity fund.</p>
<p>Even in this go-go market, where digital assets are suddenly top of mind for everyone, the achievements are notable for someone who hasn&#8217;t been a VC for all that long and is a solo general partner.</p>
<p>To learn more about his path in building Chapter One &#8212; which is small but growing and counts new hires from both Facebook and Stripe &#8212; we talked recently with Morris Jr., who focused on product and revenue at Tinder for four years until leaving in late 2019. We wondered what there is to learn about how an operator transitions into a full-time investing role; he suggested that a lot of it comes down to hustle and luck and social media savvy, both to build an audience and, more than ever, to track down hot deals.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, like a lot of investors, Morris Jr. got his start by writing checks on the side of his full-time job. Specifically, in 2016, aided in part by the sheen of Tinder, he wound up putting together one of the larger syndicates on the AngelList platform, where he says he went on to raise 15 special purpose vehicles.</p>
<p>Some of those companies have broken out since, including Density, a startup developing people-counting, AI-powered sensors that last month announced <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/10/density-which-provides-occupancy-tracking-sensors-to-companies-raises-125m/">$125 million</a> in funding at a post-money valuation of  $1.05 billion.</p>
<p>Deals didn&#8217;t automatically find their way to Morris, Jr., he says. He built a network by digging into Twitter to build an online audience (he has nearly 106,000 followers); he also messaged a whole lot of people who he saw were backing other people&#8217;s syndicates on AngelList.</p>
<p>Along the way, he began seeing more and more crypto deals that he wanted to fund. There were so many of these, in fact, that at some point, he says, he began to run out of enough capital to invest. By his telling, a role with Index Ventures materialized around that same time and he became a scout for the powerhouse firm, investing in a handful of seed rounds, including Dapper Labs, a blockchain company behind the popular NFT game &#8220;NBA Top Shot&#8221; that&#8217;s currently valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">$7.6 billion</a>, and the centralized finance platform Compound Labs, whose <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/compound">native token</a> has already returned many millions of dollars to early investors in the outfit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Armed with those wins &#8212; he says that particular scout fund for Index wound up being marked up by more than 30x &#8212; Morris Jr. set out to raise his own fund. At first, he hopped back on AngelList, raising $1 million from the first related email he sent to prospective investors, he says. Feeling emboldened, he quit his job at Tinder and decided to invest full time.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it very much seems the right move. That debut fund went on to raise $10 million altogether, and the momentum has built from there. In perhaps the most critical development for Morris Jr., Chapter One&#8217;s newest fund has garnered commitments from some of the numerous multistage venture firms that now invest substantial dollars in emerging managers in order to get more exposure to founders they might miss otherwise.</p>
<p>In Chapter One&#8217;s case, the limited partners that are providing some of capital include Sequoia Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins, and Bain Capital. Acting in a personal capacity, Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of a16z are also investors in Chapter One&#8217;s new fund. (Asked why Index is not also an investor, he says they don&#8217;t invest directly in other managers&#8217; funds.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uYhUDrysi4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/variant-debuts-a-new-110m-fund-for-crypto-startups-announces-li-jin-has-joined-as-a-general-partner/">Variant debuts a new $110M fund for crypto startups, announces Li Jin has joined as a general partner</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Variant debuts a new $110M fund for crypto startups, announces Li Jin has joined as a general partner&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/variant-debuts-a-new-110m-fund-for-crypto-startups-announces-li-jin-has-joined-as-a-general-partner/embed/#?secret=uYhUDrysi4" data-secret="uYhUDrysi4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That kind of network certainly helps when Chapter One is in a competitive situation. What bigger boast can a seed-stage manager make than to explain he has inroads into the biggest venture firms in the world?</p>
<p>There is also the potential for conflict, presumably, which is maybe the point. Asked who among Chapter One&#8217;s venture backers gets to see its deals first, Morris Jr. says he has structured things in such a way that &#8220;everybody gets the same information at the same time.&#8221; He then adds that for some deals, he defers to founders who want him to &#8220;sequence those intros,&#8221; as well as advises them based on what he knows about each firm&#8217;s &#8220;taste.&#8221; It&#8217;s very &#8220;case by case,&#8221; and a &#8220;bit of a curation exercise.&#8221; he says, &#8220;where you know which partners at which funds will be attracted to specific types of companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for where Chapter One is shopping, because of Morris Jr.&#8217;s success to date with companies like Dapper and Compound Labs, the firm is pushing the pedal to the metal on web3 products and platforms, with five bets from the new fund already across DAO infrastructure, NFT experiences, and learn-to-earn games. (The most famous of these types of games is &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; but a growing number of them is emerging and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">capturing VC dollars</a>.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qkBUTge5WK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">Studio behind &#8216;early access&#8217; crypto game Blankos Block Party banks monster $1.25B valuation from a16z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On this front, Morris Jr. says there are numerous reasons founders who are moving into the space might want to talk with Chapter One. He says, for example, that Chapter One intends to spend much of 2022 building out support services, including a media arm focused on web3 education, and resources for developers who are looking to better understand token usability and governance and how to create digital assets that are equitable for the communities to which they cater.</p>
<p>When it comes to finding those founders in the first place, Morris Jr. points back to his use of social media, saying that large Twitter presence helps, but so does logging time elsewhere online.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a member, most importantly, of &#8220;hundreds of Discord groups,&#8221; noting that &#8220;the more you participate in the community, the more you meet interesting people. It&#8217;s like going to a great conference.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>For web3 investors, he adds, &#8220;It’s the new way of networking.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, when LinkedIn began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/linkedin-real-name-phone-number-verification-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking for Chinese users&#8217; phone numbers</a>, it was clear that the professional social network would have to follow a different set of rules in the country. But it realized simply setting up the real-name verification regime required by Chinese authorities wasn&#8217;t enough; it faced a mounting task of balancing censorship demand and upholding its &#8220;Western value&#8221; that extols freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The solution was to retreat. This past October, Microsoft announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring an end to LinkedIn&#8217;s Chinese version</a> &#8212; which still functioned largely the same as the &#8220;global&#8221; one barring, extra requirements like cell number verification. On December 13, Microsoft <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/december/linkedin-s-new-app-to-help-professionals-in-china-find-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a LinkedIn alternative called InCareer </a>on China&#8217;s App Store and third-party Android stores. Focusing on jobs, the new app bears the facade of LinkedIn but lacks its social feed and content posting option, which would otherwise require content monitoring efforts by Microsoft&#8217;s team in China. InCareer still keeps the messaging feature.</p>
<p>In a blog <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/october/14/china-sunset-of-localized-version-of-linkedin-and-launch-of-new-injobs-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>, LinkedIn explained its move:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249702" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>While we’ve found success in helping Chinese members find jobs and economic opportunity, we have not found that same level of success in the more social aspects of sharing and staying informed. We’re also facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.</p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is not the only foreign tech giant that has pulled its service from China. In recent years, China has introduced a slew of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new cyber regulations</a> to rein in everything from how much data internet firms can collect to how they move data across borders. Yahoo, TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/as-yahoo-leaves-china-an-accelerating-stream-of-exits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exited China</a> citing an &#8220;increasingly challenging business and legal environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>China-based users with the LinkedIn app are now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a544167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompted to download InCareer</a>, though they can still access the full version of the social network via a web browser and VPN. But these extra fences are set to drive users away from a platform that already had limited reach in the country.</p>
<p>LinkedIn was popular mostly among expats and Chinese users working at multinationals or cross-border businesses, while its local competitor Maimai has more prominence. In April, Maimai accounted for 91% of the time Chinese users spent on professional social networking apps, according to <a href="https://www.iresearch.com.cn/m/Detail/report?id=3825&amp;isfree=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market research firm iResearch</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s other surviving service in China, Bing, also ran into a hitch recently. The search engine became inaccessible in China on December 18, according to user reports and <a href="https://en.greatfire.org/bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greatfire.org</a>, though it appeared to have come back online as of December 20. TechCrunch has reached out to Microsoft regarding the situation.</p>
<p>The incident also coincided with Bing&#8217;s suspension of its search autofill feature in China for 30 days &#8220;under PRC laws,&#8221; according to a <a href="https://cn.bing.com/cnlegal?mkt=zh-CN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notice</a> posted by the search engine provider. It&#8217;s unclear what laws the site was referring to.</p>
<p>Bing was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/microsoft-confirms-bing-is-down-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> briefly down in China in 2019</a> when its indigenous rival Baidu&#8217;s reputation took a hit. At the time, speculation was rife that Baidu users migrating to Bing in droves might have crashed the American site.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to see foreign tech companies playing catch-up with Chinese laws after being left alone for years. Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/china-roundup-apple-closes-app-store-loophole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initiated a wave of crackdown</a> on unlicensed mobile games from its Chinese App Store years after the relevant regulation took effect. The Bing suspension might well be a similar case where the search engine, which had long been under the radar in China because few people used it, was finally ordered to close the loophole &#8212; autofill suggestions that could get on the censors&#8217; nerves.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Monday, December 20! Now deep into the second half of December, you’d think that we’d be down to spare news pickings. Not a bit of it! We had a 10-figure deal today, an IPO filing and startup news galore. So strap in &#8212; no taking breaks quite yet! To work! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/"><strong>Oracle buys Cerner in $28B deal:</strong></a> This is a big darn deal. Oracle everyone is familiar with, but what is Cerner? Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Miller</a>, Cerner is an electronic healthcare records company. Naturally, a major tech company buying something in the health data space may have your hackles up, but analysts that TechCrunch spoke to generally liked the deal, so what’s worry about?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/justworks-files-to-take-its-smb-focused-hr-themed-saas-business-public/"><strong>Inside Justworks’ IPO filing:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Late last week, SMB-focused HR software provider Justworks filed to go public. Today, TechCrunch took a deeper look into its filing, curious about its economics and overall business performance. The company raised extensive capital during its life as a private company, so this is a big venture-backed exit to keep tabs on in early 2022. (Along with Reddit!)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/rocket-companies-buys-truebill-for-1-275b/"><strong>Rocket buys TrueBill for $1.275B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And because one billion-dollar-plus deal wasn’t enough to keep us busy today, Rocket Companies announced its huge buy of consumer fintech TrueBill in an all-cash deal. TechCrunch noted that with TrueBill set to reach around $100 million ARR this year, per its acquirer, the transaction felt somewhat inexpensive. For investors that got a quick double on their most recent investment, it’s a nice win.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>There were a number of huge pieces of startup news today, and a plethora of smaller, yet still critical, updates. So, largest first, and then as many of the smaller notes as we can fit into this newsletter!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250091" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/rec-room-raises-145m-at-a-3-5b-valuation-for-its-user-generated-immersive-gaming-platform/"><strong>Rec Room raises $145M at a $3.5B valuation:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Why is a social gaming platform raising that kind of money? Well, Roblox. That’s the answer. How so? Because Roblox showed that user-created games atop a centralized platform can generate simply huge incomes, and investors are betting that Rec Room’s twist on the concept is going to be a cash cow in time. The company was worth $1.25 billion earlier this year, so its new valuation may be frothy, but investors are willing to pay up in part thanks to Roblox being worth north of $58 billion as of this afternoon, no doubt.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/zerofox-public-spac/"><strong>ZeroFox is going public via a SPAC:</strong></a> This is a fun one. Per TechCrunch, ZeroFox is an “enterprise threat intelligence cybersecurity startup that helps companies detect risks found on social media.” So, it’s a software company going public via a blank-check company. The deal values ZeroFox at around $1.4 billion. You can read the deck <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823575/000114036121042363/brhc10031871_ex99-2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, if that’s your jam. But the deal shows that the SPAC boom is not over — yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-in-india-raises-100-million/"><strong>$100M for fast groceries in India:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Zepto is a fast grocery delivery service, the sort of business that wants to bring you items in 10 minutes or less. The model is proving popular in Europe and North America, with companies like Zapp and Gopuff putting up big numbers. Zepto is a notable round because the deal is a big one, and because it more than doubles the company’s valuation “to $570 million from $225 million less than two months ago as [the company] expands into newer cities.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/turing-books-87m-at-a-1-1b-valuation-to-help-source-hire-and-manage-engineers-remotely/">Remote hiring is big business:</a> </strong>That’s what Turing’s new round tells us. The company just raised an $87 million Series D for its “talent cloud,” a service that “uses AI to source, evaluate, hire, onboard and then manage engineers remotely,” TechCrunch reports. The new capital pushes Turing’s valuation to $1.1 billion.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/ai-chip-kneron-25-million-funding/">Kneron raises $25M for AI chips:</a> </strong>Given the global chip shortage/fiasco, I am in favor of more capital flowing into chip companies, startups included. What Kneron is building won’t help Ford build more trucks, but its AI chips are “semiconductors designed to accelerate machine learning” we wrote, which still sounds pretty important.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/ameelios-free-video-calling-for-inmates-2022-launch/">Nonprofit startup works to lessen predatory inmate pricing:</a></strong> Not every startup that is built is designed to either save a pension fund or allow a venture capitalist to finally stop flying business class. In the case of Ameelio, the company is building free calls for inmates. If you aren’t familiar with the U.S. carceral state, know that my nation has found it palatable, somehow, to <em>profit</em> off the incarcerated through both private prisons and exorbitant costs for the locked-up to access phone calls and other services. Ameelio could shake that up with no-cost video calling services. Let’s hope.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/interactive-streaming-platform-adventr-raises-5-in-seed-funding/">Adventr rminds m of th Wb 2.0 glry dys:</a> </strong>Remember when startups would just drop letters from a word and call it a name? It was a good time. Adventr is bringing the trend back with its name and the fact that it is working to make video more interactive. Very Web 2.0, once again in a way that I don’t mind. The company just raised $5 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/overjet-sinks-its-teeth-into-another-round-of-capital-for-its-dental-ai-tech/">The AI dentist will see you now:</a> </strong>Overjet is a company I’ve covered before, so it’s nice to see it crop up again on our pages. The company is now worth north of $400 million thanks to a new $42.5 million Series B. Overjet uses AI to help dentists make decisions about teeth, which I dig thanks to the fact that I ate too much candy as a child and didn’t floss during much of my 20s.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/real-time-soil-testing-agtech-startup-stenon-raises-20m-series-a-funding-round/">Stenon is working on dirt data:</a> </strong>Agtech is a fun part of the technology world because it involves the application of new methods to what is just about the oldest human endeavor there is, namely trying to coax food out of the ground. Stenon is directly involved with that work, providing farmers with what TechCrunch described as a “real-time soil-sensing solution.” That means data from the dirt. Why does that matter? Well, soil water content can greatly impact harvest timing, for example. Stenon just closed a $20 million Series A.</li>

<p>The pandemic ushered in &#8220;the digital healthcare revolution,&#8221; and patients and providers alike are unlikely to turn back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Healthcare deals were hot in the first nine months in 2021,&#8221; GHI Fund President Bill Taranto writes in a guest post. &#8220;They brought in a total of $21.3 billion in venture funding across 541 deals, dwarfing the previous record of $14.6 billion set in 2020, according to Rock Health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taranto <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/the-growing-power-of-digital-healthcare-6-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">rounds up six trends to watch</a> in the New Year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telemedicine changing how chronic conditions are treated.</li>
<li>Digital therapeutics rewriting the future of healthcare.</li>
<li>Social determinants of health resulting in greater health equity.</li>
<li>Remote health monitoring improving outcomes and lowering costs.</li>
<li>Real-world data delivering real-world results.</li>
<li>Healthcare becoming truly patient-centric.</li>

And even Alphabet’s YouTube TV is not immune. After a spat with Disney over money — what else, with the mouse company — a deal has been reached that will see Disney channels stay on YouTube TV. Customers of the latter service will get a $15 credit for the disruption.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European e-scooter market is currently the main battleground for companies playing in the micromobility space, taking advantage as they are of Europe’s relatively compact cities and the desire of populations to move to more sustainable transportation. In 2021, players like Tier, Voi and Dott continued to raise VC backing.</p>
<p>But the war for funding is ultimately about who will win in this coveted market &#8212; either through market domination via raising the most capital, putting pressure on competitors or by acquiring said competitors.</p>
<p>Thus, the latest chapter in this saga is about to play out, with the news that <a href="https://www.voiscooters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voi</a> Technology &#8212; a major European micromobility operator &#8212; has raised a $115 million Series D funding round in what it describes as an oversubscribed financing round that, says the company, will power its expansion into new markets. Voi already has scooters in 70 cities across the U.K. and Europe. This round comes after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/micromobility-startup-voi-raises-45-million-to-end-sidewalk-riding-improve-safety/">raised</a> $45 million in only August this year. Total capital raised in 2021 amounts to $160 million, and $500 million since Voi launched.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As well as expanding, this raise is also about a future IPO. A spokesperson said: “Following this fundraise, Voi is going to start preparing for an IPO. Voi will begin preparations but the timetable cannot be set in stone at this stage.”</p>
<p>Fredrik Hjelm, co-founder and CEO of Voi Technology, said in a statement: “There is no doubting that micromobility is here to stay and Voi intends to be the go-to mobility platform in Europe for cities that want to give their residents and visitors an integrated, smart mode way to travel. Working closely with cities we are seeing a new vision of urban transport taking shape that is highly complementary to public transport. We are building the future of transport and we are committed to making every Voi city a better place to live.”</p>
<p>With cities starting to adopt regulations and grant licenses, the way that micromobility operators are scaling is by getting approvals from city officials, thus securing their access to consumers. So this war chest is partly about being able to scale to meet those licenses.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added: “The demand for micro mobility has never been higher and as a result, we want to ensure we are delivering the service people need. With this funding, we’re going to invest in solutions for our rides and cities, including fixing parking, pavement riding and twin riding, rolling out a better model of e-scooter and investing in R&amp;D.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round was led by Raine Group and VNV Global (which led the last funding round), and included Inbox Capital, Nordic Ninja, Stena Sessan, Kreos Capital and new investors Ilmarinen, Nineyards Equity and ICT Capital and others. Entrepreneurs and operators from King, Avito, BCG and more also participated.</p>
<p>Voi claims it has achieved a 140% year on year revenue growth in 2021, while increasing margins and profitability. Voi also won a lot of city tenders this year, putting pressure on competitors.</p>
<p>Of course, microbilitlity companies are also pushing at an open door, taking advantage of the news trend among cities to reduce the reliance on private cars, relieve congestion, lower carbon emission and cut pollution, as well as the individual desire to avoid crowds on public transport because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Voi is also planning to launch the &#8220;Voiager 5&#8221;, which it claims will be the safest e-scooter model to date. Its arrival will be timely.</p>
<p>The potential for fires started by e-scooter battery packs was highlighted in the U.K. recently when Vio was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-59664406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced to withdraw</a> part of its fleet from rental after one its machines began burning in a user&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>Commenting, Jack Samler, general manager at Voi U.K., told TechCrunch: “We had an instance of smoke being emitted from one of our Long Term Rental e-scooters in Bristol earlier this month. This was an isolated, one-off, incident with one of our Long Term Rental scooters. As an extreme precautionary measure, we asked users to keep the scooters outside whilst we assessed the situation &#8212; all users have been refunded for the inconvenience for the month of December.”</p>
<p>He said the service was only temporarily stopped as a result of this smoking scooter, but following an investigation, the service quickly resumed: “The vast majority of users are already using the service again, and we expect all riders to continue enjoying our Long Term Rental service to move around in a sustainable manner very soon.”</p>
<p>Assuming all those batteries get safer, Voi is also committing to use only battery cells produced in Europe, with a resulting 50% lower carbon footprint given they wouldn’t be imported from China, by early 2023. It already sources its e-bikes from Europe.</p>
<p>Jason Schretter, partner and head of EMEA at Raine Group, said: “We are excited to continue our support of Voi in its efforts to bring safe and sustainable micro mobility solutions to markets across Europe. Since we first invested a year ago, Voi’s commitment to product innovation, operational efficiency and local partnerships have helped the company extend its leadership position in the region.”</p>
<p>Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global said: “We are reaching a tipping point with micromobility where cities, led by their residents, are waking up to the full potential of this new mode of transport.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European e-scooter race continues apace. Tier, a Berlin-based e-scooter company that’s quickly expanding throughout Europe, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/e-scooter-company-tier-acquires-wind-mobilitys-italian-subsidiary/">acquired</a> Vento Mobility, the Italian subsidiary of Wind Mobility.</p>
<p>But scooter companies continue to battle the bad publicity from the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/escooters-accidents-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grisly accidents and crashes</a> currently blighting the image of this, admittedly hot, sector.</p>

<h2>SpaceX breaks a reusability record and records its first two-launch day</h2>
<p>SpaceX launched another batch of its Starling satellites from its launch facility at Vandenberg Space Force Base on Saturday morning, then followed that up with a launch of a Turkish communications satellite from Cape Canaveral Florida late that night. This marks the first time that SpaceX has launched twice in one day, and the Starlink mission also included the eleventh flight and landing for its Falcon 9 booster, besting a re-use record for SpaceX&#8217;s launch system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249829" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That would be impressive enough on its own, but now SpaceX is set to deliver another load of supplies and experiment materials to the International Space Station for its latest Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission. That&#8217;s currently scheduled for tomorrow morning, taking off from Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249893" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249893" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2249893" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="473" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg 2600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg?resize=768,354 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg?resize=1536,709 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg?resize=2048,945 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/spacex-launch.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2249893" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpaceX</p></div></p>
<h2>A look back at 2021 from the perspective of space investors</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, we just wrapped our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Space 2021 event</a>, and one of the more interesting discussions for the startup community was definitely our chat with a panel of early-stage investors looking at the sector. Some, like Space Capital founder Chad Anderson, have seen the space industry evolve considerably over many years of placing early bets on startups, and could speak to the major shifts going on in the industry.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise software companies are suddenly focused firmly on healthcare. If you want proof, look at how Oracle and Microsoft both backed up trucks loaded with money to buy health tech companies this year.</p>
<p>At the moment, I&#8217;m compiling the top 10 M&amp;A deals of the year, and the top two transactions are today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">$28.3 billion agreement</a> by Oracle to buy Cerner and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">Microsoft&#8217;s $19.7 billion deal</a> to buy Nuance Communications in April. That comes to just under $50 billion for two health-related companies.</p>
<p>Other majors are circling the health market. Amazon has been quieter about it, but over the last year, it too has <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/amazon-shakes-up-healthcare-strategy-in-2021-a-timeline-of-key-developments.html">been looking at healthcare,</a> with partnerships, hirings and programs galore focused on the lucrative vertical. Google&#8217;s approach was less certain, as its healthcare vertical leader, David Feinberg, <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cerner-names-dr-david-feinberg-president-and-ceo">jumped in October to Cerner</a>, the company Oracle bought this morning.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of interest because healthcare is a simply huge market. In its announcement, Oracle quoted a popular figure that the U.S. healthcare business alone is worth $3.8 trillion annually. When you extrapolate that figure to the entire world, it&#8217;s no wonder big companies are willing to make enormous bets to get a piece of it.</p>
<p>But beyond the obvious market potential, what is Oracle getting for its money? We spoke to some industry experts to get their take.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with some numbers. In its most recent earnings report, Cerner produced revenue of $1.47 billion in the third quarter, a rather modest 7% growth on a year-on-year basis. So the company wasn&#8217;t exactly growing in leaps and bounds, making it a good takeover target. If you figure Cerner was on a $6 billion run rate, that makes the deal worth just under 5x revenue, which is kind of the middle of the road these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta, formerly known as Facebook, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-legal-action-against-phishing-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that it has filed a federal lawsuit in California court to take action to uncover individuals running a phishing scam. The company says the legal action aims to disrupt phishing attacks that are designed to trick people into sharing their login credentials on fake login pages for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>For context, phishing attacks lure unsuspecting victims to websites that appear legitimate but are actually deceptively fake. The websites then persuade victims to enter their sensitive information, such as passwords and email addresses. Meta says it found more than 39,000 websites that are impersonating the login pages of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp as part of the phishing scheme. It also notes that reports of phishing attacks have been on the rise and that it is filing this lawsuit to take legal action against these attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;On these websites, people were prompted to enter their usernames and passwords, which Defendants collected,&#8221; Jessica Romero, Meta&#8217;s director of platform enforcement and litigation, wrote in a blog post. &#8220;As part of the attacks, Defendants used a relay service to redirect internet traffic to the phishing websites in a way that obscured their attack infrastructure. This enabled them to conceal the true location of the phishing websites, and the identities of their online hosting providers and the defendants.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249978" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Romero says that in March, Meta started working with the relay service to suspend thousands of URLs that hosted the phishing websites. Meta plans to continue to collaborate with online service providers to disrupt phishing attacks. It notes that it works to proactively block instances of abuse to the security community, domain name registrars and others. The company says it also shares phishing URLs so other platforms can block them as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;This lawsuit is one more step in our ongoing efforts to protect people’s safety and privacy, send a clear message to those trying to abuse our platform, and increase accountability of those who abuse technology.&#8221; Romero wrote in the blog post.</p>
<p>Meta&#8217;s latest lawsuit isn&#8217;t the first time that the company has cracked down on phishing scams on its platforms. Last month, Meta revealed that it <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/taking-action-against-hackers-in-pakistan-and-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took action against</a> four several groups of hackers from Syria and Pakistan. The groups used phishing links to manipulate users into giving up their Facebook credentials. Earlier this year in March, the company also <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/taking-action-against-hackers-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took action against</a> a group of hackers in China known as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye. Meta, which was known as Facebook at the time, said it disrupted the hackers&#8217; ability to use their infrastructure to abuse its platform. The company also <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/taking-action-against-hackers-in-bangladesh-and-vietnam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took similar action</a> against hackers in Bangledesh and Vietnam in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zepto, a Mumbai-based startup that operates a 10-minute instant grocery delivery service, has more than doubled its valuation to $570 million from $225 million less than two months ago as it expands into newer cities.</p>
<p>Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund led the $100 million Series C round in Zepto, the two said Monday. Glade Brook, Nexus, Breyer Capital, Lachy Groom, Global Founders Capital and Contrary Capital also participated in the round, which brings its to-date raise to $160 million.</p>
<p>The startup, founded by two 19-year-old entrepreneurs who left Stanford last year, came out of stealth mode in November. But long before it began talking about the business, Zepto had captured immense interest from the local startup community as people began voicing their opinion about the business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249966" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="http://zeptonow.com">Zepto</a>, whose name playfully uses a <a href="https://twitter.com/pacificleo/status/1452554053603450884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mathematical term</a> to describe the business, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, a category that has become red hot in several parts of the world in recent quarters. Heavily-backed players Swiggy and BlinkIt (formerly known as Grofers) have also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/swiggy-to-invest-700-million-in-express-delivery-service-instamart/">entered the instant grocery delivery business</a>.</p>
<p>Zepto’s arrival in the scene, too, was serendipitous. Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra had returned to India for a break shortly before the pandemic engulfed the nation.</p>
<p>The teenagers, who previously collaborated on a number of projects, including a ride-hailing commute app for school kids, suddenly found themselves locked in their houses in Mumbai. As the pandemic raged, the two struggled to get their grocery supplies even as grocery deliveries, categorized as essential by the local government, was still permitted in much of the nation.</p>
<p>“We felt that the online play of the Indian grocery delivery space, which is one of the world’s largest, was grappling with some gross execution errors,” Palicha claimed in an earlier interview without elaborating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an interview last week, Palicha said the startup is overwhelmed with the support and excitement it is seeing from the customers, but it doesn’t want to “become complacent.”</p>
<p>“We are somewhat overly critical of ourselves and hold ourselves to very high standards. People are happy that they are getting their deliveries in 10 minutes or less, but can we continue to focus on scaling our SKUs and improving our unit economics?” he said. (But at the same time, Zepto is cautious about keeping its employees and delivery partners happy, he said, pointing to the retention and internal feedback.)</p>
<p>Vohra said that its month-on-month buyer retention is 65% and has built a network of micro-warehouses, each of which has a capacity to do over 2,500 orders a day.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s e-grocery market that is estimated to be worth $25 billion by 2025, according to a note from Sanford C. Bernstein. “Online grocery penetration is expected to reach ~3-5%, by 2025 from less than 1% today. Long-term structural drivers remain strong: rising income and affluence, lower tier consumption, e- commerce penetration (~30% CAGR) and a young population (~50% below 25). Grocery spend as a proportion of income remains high at ~ 30%,” its analysts wrote.</p>

(<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zepto)</p></div></p>
<p>Zepto today operates in Bangalore, Delhi, Gurgaon, Chennai and Hyderabad, and plans to soon expand to Pune and Kolkata. To ensure instant deliveries, it has set up a maze of over 100 dark stores across these cities that it says are optimized for fast deliveries.</p>
<p>“We are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,” he said. “In the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,” said Palicha.</p>
<p>Another thing moving in the right direction for Zepto is the talent it has been able to attract in recent months. Several high-profile executives from Flipkart, Amazon Uber, Dream 11 and Pharmeasy have joined the startup.</p>
<p>Palicha said one of the reasons why so many executives have joined Zepto is that it has enabled many who had moved from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their home city. But the startup’s aggressive growth, disciplined execution, and ambitions have made it attractive for people with similar taste, he said. “We have been able to walk the walk,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are excited to double down and lead this round in Zepto (YC W21). Since Aadit and Kaivalya went through Y Combinator, we have observed that they&#8217;re exceptional founders who bring relentless focus and &#8220;Doordash-like&#8221; execution to the quick commerce model,” said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.</p>
<p>“They originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we&#8217;re confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI chips, which are semiconductors designed to accelerate machine learning, have many applications. One of the promising use cases, according to Albert Liu, is using AI chips in autonomous driving vehicles.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Liu&#8217;s AI chipmaking startup Kneron has been quietly racking up investments to march into smart transportation. It recently closed a new round of $25 million funding with Lite-On Technology, a Taiwanese optoelectronic pioneer, as a strategic investor. Other investors included Alltek, PalPilot, Sand Hill Angels and Gaingels.</p>
<p>The new proceeds lifted Kneron&#8217;s total funding to over $125 million since its inception in 2015. The San Diego- and Taipei-based company has assembled a list of renowned investors, including Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing&#8217;s Horizon Ventures, Alibaba, Qualcomm, Sequoia and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foxconn</a>, the world&#8217;s largest electronics manufacturer and Apple&#8217;s supplier.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249154" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Liu previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> TechCrunch that the company was expected to turn profitable in 2023, which would be a &#8220;good time&#8221; to go public. When asked more recently, the founder was more tight-lipped about the firm&#8217;s IPO prospects, though he said the listing would likely be in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of L4 or L5 autonomous driving lies not only in the vehicle but also roadside AI,&#8221; Liu, who worked on computer vision at Qualcomm, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Kneron&#8217;s latest investment followed the release of its first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/kneron-releases-its-first-automotive-grade-chip-for-adas-and-av-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auto-grade semiconductors</a> for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>With roadside perception units that can communicate with nearby vehicles, an ambulance would not have to stop at intersections, Liu explained. Such infrastructure is particularly useful in Asian countries where traffic conditions are more complicated than those in the U.S., he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through the strategic investment, Kneron and Lite-On will jointly develop roadside AI boxes that will be powered by Kneron&#8217;s edge AI chips.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s chips are &#8220;reconfigurable&#8221;, meaning they combine the flexibility of software and the high speed of the hardware. In the case of AV, its silicon can be used for both the large AI engine inside a vehicle and powering the small sensors layered on the exterior of the car, explained Liu and as shown in this demo video:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLdt3wgnuDs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kneron is currently pulling in $3-4 million in monthly revenue from its pool of 30 enterprise customers; 30-40% of its revenues come from the U.S. at the moment.</span></p>
<p>The company has been forming deep alliances with industry partners. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In May, Kneron agreed to</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.deltaww.com/en-us/news/7531" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> buy image signal processor Vatics</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from Vivotek, a subsidiary of Delta Electronics. Kneron counts Foxconn as a strategic investor, which has been using the startup&#8217;s chips in its &#8220;MIH&#8221; manufacturing platform for electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><em>The article was updated to reflect that Lite-On was a strategic investor and did not lead the round. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new forecast has dubbed TikTok as the world&#8217;s third-largest social network, just behind Facebook and Instagram. In its <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/tiktok-is-the-third-largest-worldwide-social-network-behind-instagram-and-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaugural forecast</a> on TikTok&#8217;s global install base, Insider Intelligence &#8212; the firm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/business-insider-intelligence-emarketer-merger-details-2019-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously known as eMarketer</a> &#8212; predicts that TikTok will reach 755.0 million monthly users in 2022, after seeing 59.8% growth in 2020, followed by 40.8% growth in 2021.</p>
<p>Facebook, as of its most recent <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/FB-09.30.2021-Exhibit-99.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings</a>, reported 2.91 billion monthly active users after seeing 6% year-over-year growth. And recently, Instagram employees leaked its network had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/instagram-surpasses-2-billion-monthly-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed 2 billion</a> monthly users, up from the 1 billion monthly user milestone reported in June 2018.</p>
<p>However, Insider Intelligence&#8217;s forecast is referencing its own 2022 predictions, which uses a slightly different set of calculations. The firm has its own definition of a monthly active user that may differ from those of each company it analyzes. For example, it only counts users who log in at least once a month consistently over a calendar year period, and it attempts to weed out the fake accounts from its estimates. This is meant to provide clients with a more consistent &#8220;apples to apples&#8221; comparison across all platforms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249920" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to the firm&#8217;s estimates, Facebook will reach 2.1 billion monthly users in 2022, followed by Instagram with 1.28 billion users. TikTok will follow with its 755 million monthly users, ahead of Snap and Twitter.</p>

<p>TikTok, over the past couple of years, has been growing quickly.</p>
<p>App intelligence firm Sensor Tower reported the short-form video app <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-2-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crossed 2 billion downloads</a> across the App Store and Google Play in the first quarter of 2020. A separate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">report by App Annie</a> later found TikTok saw 325% growth in 2020, and the monthly time spent per user also grew faster than any other app &#8212; including by 65% in the U.S., surpassing Facebook.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In July 2021, Sensor Tower noted TikTok (including sister app Douyin in China) had become the first non-Facebook mobile app (outside of games) <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to reach 3 billion downloads globally</a> across the App Store and Google Play, while TikTok consumer spending surpassed $2.5 billion globally. This put the app in the company of only a handful of others that had reached that milestone, including Tinder, Netflix, YouTube and Tencent Video.</p>
<p>While other firms had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">predicted</a> TikTok&#8217;s monthly active user base would top 1 billion in 2021, Insider Intelligence&#8217;s forecast is a bit more conservative due to its methodology. But it does expect the app to continue to grow, if at a slower rate of 15.1% in 2022.</p>
<p>As a result of its growth, TikTok&#8217;s share of overall social networking users is also climbing upwards. Insider Intelligence&#8217;s forecast believes TikTok will surpass a 20% share for the first time and will approach a one-quarter share by 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rise of TikTok is especially challenging for Snapchat, with which it competes head-to-head for the youth audience,&#8221; remarked Insider Intelligence principal analyst, Debra Aho Williamson. &#8220;Although TikTok does not share much similarity to Twitter, its massive size relative to the more-established platform is a clear reflection of the addictive nature of TikTok’s content,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still plenty of room for TikTok&#8217;s future growth, the firm also pointed out, as next year, 3.57 billion people will use a social networking app at least once per month.</p>
