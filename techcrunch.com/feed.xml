										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket fuel technology startup Firehawk Aerospace has added $1.2 million to its existing seed financing, bringing the full amount invested in the round to $2.5 million. The new tranche comes from Harlow Capital Management, a Dallas-based firm run by Colby Harlow, who will join Firehawk&#8217;s board of directors as part of the deal.</p>
<p>Firewhawk, which was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/firehawk-aerospace-aims-to-revolutionize-rocketry-with-safe-cost-effective-hybrid-engines/">finalist in our first-ever all-virtual Startup Battlefield at TC Disrupt last September,</a> has developed a new kind of hybrid rocket fuel that greatly enhances rocket launch safety, cost and transportation using additive manufacturing (basically, the grown-up version of 3D printing). Hybrid rocket fuel (which combines aspects of both liquid and solid propellants used previously) isn&#8217;t new, but past technology has been unable to compete on cost and efficacy relative to existing nonhybrid alternatives.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Chief Scientist Ron Jones was able to get around these limitations with two new approaches: Using a fuel with a hard polymer structure and producing it using additive manufacturing instead of casting via molds with a liquid that hardens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Firehawk now intends to use its seed funding to test its technology in operational conditions and at the kind of scale required for commercialization, and to build out its partnerships and client list. The startup also intends to grow its R&amp;D and manufacturing operations in both Texas and Oklahoma.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Each year <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> processes millions of SaaS logons via its authentication system. It kindly aggregates that data to find the most popular apps and publishes <a href="https://www.okta.com/businesses-at-work/2021">an annual report</a>. This year it found that the most popular tool by far was Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that while app usage popularity varied by region, Office 365 was number one with a bullet across the board, whether globally or when the report broke it down by geographic area. That wasn&#8217;t true of any other product in this report, so Office 365 has extensive usage across the world (at least among companies that use Okta).</p>
<p>But as with everything cloud, it&#8217;s not a simple matter to say that because lots of people signed onto Office 365, Microsoft is the clear winner in a broader sense. In reality, the cloud is a complex marketplace, and just because people use one tool doesn&#8217;t preclude them from using tools that compete directly with it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a case in point, consider that the report found that 36% of Microsoft 365 customers were also using Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite), which offers a similar set of office productivity tools. Further, Okta found that 42% of Office 365 customers were using Zoom and 32% were using Slack.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZXzyDOLKpe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/how-should-saas-companies-deliver-and-price-professional-services/">How should SaaS companies deliver and price professional services?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How should SaaS companies deliver and price professional services?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/how-should-saas-companies-deliver-and-price-professional-services/embed/#?secret=ZXzyDOLKpe" data-secret="ZXzyDOLKpe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This is pretty remarkable when you consider that Office 365 bundles Teams with similar functionality for free. What&#8217;s more, so does Google with Google Hangouts, so people use the tool they want when they want, and sometimes it seems they use competing versions of the same tool. The report also found that of those Office 365 users, 44% are using Salesforce, 41% AWS, 15% Smartsheet and 14% Tableau (which is owned by Salesforce). Microsoft has products in all those categories.</p>
<p>Microsoft is clearly a big company with a lot of products, but the report blows a hole in the idea that because people like Office 365, they are going to be big fans of other Microsoft products, or that they can count on any kind of brand loyalty across the range of products or even exclusivity within the same product category.</p>
<p>All of this, and much of the other data in this report makes tremendously interesting reading as far as it goes. It&#8217;s not a definitive window on the state of SaaS. It&#8217;s a definitive reading on the state of Okta customers&#8217; use of SaaS, on the Okta Integration Network (OIN), a point the company readily acknowledges in the report&#8217;s methodology section.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you read this report, keep in mind that this data is representative of Okta’s customers, the applications and integrations we connect to through the OIN, and the ways in which users access these tools through our service,&#8221; the report stated.</p>
<p>But it is a way to look at the state of SaaS taking advantage of the 9400 Okta customers using the network and the 6,500 integrations to the world&#8217;s most popular SaaS tools. That gives the company a unique view into the world of SaaS. What you can conclude is that the cloud is complicated, and it&#8217;s not a zero-sum game by any means. In fact, being a winner in one area is not a guarantee of winning across the board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a turbulent week in the capital world, we&#8217;re taking a look at something a bit slower moving: venture capital trends in Africa during 2020.</p>
<p>The Exchange has long explored quarterly and yearly data regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">the North American</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-vcs-invested-in-asia-and-europe-in-2020/">European and Asian venture capital markets</a>, along with data on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/fintech-startups-and-unicorns-had-a-stellar-q4-2020/">particular startup categories</a>. From today, we&#8217;ll also provide regular examinations of what&#8217;s happening in Africa.</p>
<p><em>As an aside, we&#8217;re sorry The Exchange didn&#8217;t come out yesterday. The world went mad and we had to tend to breaking news. We&#8217;re back! </em></p>
<p>To dig into African venture capital results, we&#8217;re looking at a report concerning 2020 data from <a href="https://briterbridges.com/">Briter Bridges</a>, a research group that focuses on the continent&#8217;s private capital market. The Exchange also interviewed report author and Briter director Dario Giuliani about the collected data.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>What emerges is a generally growing venture capital scene, but one that had mixed results in 2020 compared to 2019. However, if we control for an outsized investment or two, things smooth out rather nicely.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s check the top-line figures, get insight from Giuliani concerning where the capital is flowing most rapidly, and wrap with a look at which startup categories are seeing the most investment in Africa today.</p>
<h2>Africa&#8217;s 2020 venture capital results</h2>
<p>During my time at Crunchbase News, I helped lead a team that generated acre-feet of reporting on the global and domestic venture capital markets. It&#8217;s difficult work that involves making decisions on what counts, what doesn&#8217;t and how to handle rounds that have not been disclosed publicly.</p>
<p>Over time, I&#8217;ve also become comfortable with venture data from PitchBook and CB Insights as well, and am now adding the Briter dataset to the trusted cohort.</p>
<p>During my chat with Giuliani, it became clear that his team is doing the hard and valuable work of carefully collating and sorting information. I say all of that simply to let you know that we now have a regular source for trustworthy information (compiled in concert with seventy different investing groups) on Africa that we&#8217;ll use regularly to keep tabs on the continent. This is a win.</p>
<p>So, what does the data say? We have to parse it some, as historically Briter has collated megadeals &#8212; which it counts as investments of $90 million or more &#8212; and M&amp;A in the same bucket. So, tracking just the dollar volume of African deals smaller than $90 million gives us the following set of results:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In recent years we&#8217;ve seen a whole bunch of visual/style fashion-focused search engines cropping up, tailored to helping people find the perfect threads to buy online by applying computer vision and other AI technologies to perform smarter-than-keywords visual search which can easily match and surface specific shapes and styles. Startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/donde-search-picks-up-6-million-to-help-fashion-retailers-with-visual-search/">Donde Search</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/glisten-uses-computer-vision-to-break-down-fashion-photos-to-their-styles-and-parts/">Glisten</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/syte/">Stye.ai</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>Early-stage London-based <a href="https://cadeera.com">Cadeera</a>, which is in the midst of raising a seed round, wants to apply a similar AI visual search approach, but for interior décor. All through the pandemic it&#8217;s been working on a prototype with the aim of making e-commerce discovery of taste-driven items like sofas, armchairs and coffee tables a whole lot more inspirational.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Founder and CEO Sebastian Spiegler, an early (former) </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/03/microsoft-confirms-swiftkey-acquisition-for-250m-in-cash/">SwiftKey</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> employee with a PhD in machine learning and natural language processing, walked TechCrunch through a demo of the current prototype.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The software offers a multi-step UX geared toward first identifying a person&#8217;s décor style preferences &#8212; which it does by getting them to give a verdict on a number of look-book images of rooms staged in different interior décor styles (via a Tinder-style swipe left or right).</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mjaQrBSIXP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/glisten-uses-computer-vision-to-break-down-fashion-photos-to-their-styles-and-parts/">Glisten uses computer vision to break down product photos to their most important parts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Glisten uses computer vision to break down product photos to their most important parts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/glisten-uses-computer-vision-to-break-down-fashion-photos-to-their-styles-and-parts/embed/#?secret=mjaQrBSIXP" data-secret="mjaQrBSIXP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It then uses these taste signals to start suggesting specific items to buy (e.g. armchairs, sofas etc.) that fit the styles they&#8217;ve liked. The user can continue to influence selections by asking to see other similar items (&#8220;more like this&#8221;), or see less similar items to broaden the range of stuff they&#8217;re shown &#8212; injecting a little serendipity into their search. </span></p>
<p>The platform also lets users search by uploading an image &#8212; with Cadeera then parsing its database to surface similar-looking items which are available for sale.</p>
<p>It has an AR component on its product map, too &#8212; which will eventually also let users visualize a potential purchase in situ in their home. Voice search will also be supported.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Keyword search is fundamentally broken,&#8221; argues Spiegler. &#8220;Imagine you&#8217;re refurbishing or renovating your home and you say I&#8217;m looking for something, I&#8217;ve seen it somewhere, I only know when I see it, and I don&#8217;t really know what I want yet &#8212; so the [challenge we&#8217;re addressing is this] whole process of figuring out what you want.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The mission is understanding personal preferences. If you don&#8217;t know yourself what you&#8217;re looking for we&#8217;re basically helping you with visual clues and with personalization and with inspiration pieces &#8212; which can be content, images and then at some point community as well &#8212; to figure out what you want. And for the retailer it helps them to understand what their clients want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It increases trust, you&#8217;re more sure about your purchases, you&#8217;re less likely to return something &#8212; which is a huge cost to retailers. And, at the same time, you may also buy more because you more easily find things you can buy,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>E-commerce has had a massive boost from the pandemic, which continues to drive shopping online. But the flip side of that is bricks-and-mortar retailers have been hit hard.</p>

<p>The situation may be especially difficult for furniture retailers that may well have been operating showrooms before COVID-19 &#8212; relying upon customers being able to browse in-person to drive discovery and sales &#8212; so they are likely to be looking for smart tools that can help them transition to and/or increase online sales.</p>
<p>And sector-specific visual search engines do seem likely to see uplift as part of the wider pandemic-driven e-commerce shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why I want to start with interior design/home décor and furniture is that it&#8217;s a clearly underserved market. There&#8217;s no-one out there, in my view, that has cracked the way to search and find things more easily,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spiegler tells TechCrunch. &#8220;In fashion there are quite a few companies out there. And I feel like we can master furniture and home décor and then move into other sectors. But for me the opportunity is here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can take a lot of the ideas from the fashion sector and apply it to furniture,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;I feel like there&#8217;s a huge gap &#8212; and no-one has looked at it sufficiently.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The size of the opportunity Cadeera is targeting is a $10-$20 billion market globally, per Spiegler. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup&#8217;s initial business model is B2B &#8212; with the plan being to start selling its SaaS to e-commerce retailers to integrate the visual search tools directly into their own websites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spiegler says they&#8217;re working with a &#8220;big&#8221; U.K.-based vintage platform &#8212; and aiming to get something launched to the market within the next six to nine months with one to two customers. </span></p>
<p>They will also &#8212; as a next order of business &#8212; offer apps for e-commerce platforms such as WooCommerce, BigCommerce and Shopify to integrate a set of their search tools. (Larger retailers will get more customization of the platform, though.)</p>
<p>On the question of whether Cadeera might develop a B2C offer by launching a direct consumer app itself, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spiegler admits that is an &#8220;end goal&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is the million-dollar question &#8212; my end-goal, my target is building a consumer app. Building a central place where all your shopping preferences are stored &#8212; kind of a mix of Instagram where you see inspiration and Pinterest where you can keep what you looked at and then get relevant recommendations,&#8221; he says<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is basically the idea of a product search engine we want to build. But what I&#8217;m showing you are the steps to get there&#8230; and we hopefully end in the place where we have a community, we have a B2C app. But the way I look at it is we start through B2Bb and then at some point switch the direction and open it up by providing a single entry point for the consumer.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But, for now, the B2B route means Cadeera can work closely with retailers in the meanwhile &#8212; increasing its understanding of retail market dynamics and getting access to key data needed to power its platform, such as style look-books and item databases.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What we end up with is a large inventory data set/database, a design knowledge base and imagery and style meta information. And on top of that we do object detection, object recognition, recommendation, so the whole shebang in AI &#8212; for the purpose of personalization, exploration, search and suggestion/recommendation,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he goes on, sketching the various tech components involved. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;On the other side we provide an API so you can integrate into use as well. And if you need we can also provide with a responsive UX/UI.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyond all of that we are creating an interesting data asset where we understand what the user wants &#8212; so we have user profiles, and in the future those user profiles can be cross-platform. So if you purchase something at one e-commerce site or one retailer you can then go to another retailer and we can make relevant recommendations based on what you purchased somewhere else,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;So your whole purchasing history, your style preferences and interaction data will allow you to get the most relevant recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While the usual tech giant suspects still dominate general markets for search (Google) and e-commerce (Amazon), Cadeera isn&#8217;t concerned about competition from the biggest global platforms &#8212; given they are not focused on tailoring tools for a specific furniture/home décor niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He also </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">points out that Amazon continues to do a very poor job on recommendations on its own site, despite having heaps of data. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been asking &#8212; and I&#8217;ve been asked as well &#8212; so many times why is Amazon doing such a poor job on recommendations and in search. The true answer is I don&#8217;t know! They have probably the best data set&#8230; but the recommendations are poor,&#8221; he says. &#8220;What we&#8217;re doing here is trying to reinvent a whole product. Search should work&#8230; and the inspiration part, for things that are more opaque, is something important that is missing with anything I&#8217;ve seen so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Facebook did acquire a home décor-focused visual search service (called GrokStyle) back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/facebook-picks-up-retail-computer-vision-outfit-grokstyle/">2019</a>, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spiegler suggests it&#8217;s most likely to integrate their tech (which included AR for visualization) into its own marketplace &#8212; whereas he&#8217;s convinced most retailers will want to be able to remain independent of the Facebook walled garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;GrokStyle will become part of Facebook marketplace, but if you&#8217;re a retailer the big question is how much do you want to integrate into Facebook, how much do you want to be dependent on Facebook? And I think that&#8217;s a big question for a lot of retailers. Do you want to be dependent on Google? Do you want to be dependent on Amazon? Do you want to be dependent on Facebook?&#8221; he says. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;My guess is no. Because you basically want to stay as far away as possible because they&#8217;re going to eat up your lunch.&#8221;   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-market-volatility-2021-01-29">official statement</a> on the tumult of the past week in the public stock market. It&#8217;s a relatively brief statement and doesn&#8217;t mention any of the key players by name (aka GameStop, Reddit, Robinhood and others), but it does acknowledge that &#8220;extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses&#8221; that could &#8220;undermine market confidence,&#8221; and basically says the commission is watching closely to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The SEC statement does specify that it believes the &#8220;core market infrastructure&#8221; remains intact despite the heavy trading volumes of the past week, which were prompted primarily by activity organized by retail investors acting in concert through organization on r/WallStreetBets, a subreddit dedicated to day trading. These retail investors resolved to collectively purchase and hold GME stocks (and subsequently, shares in other companies like movie theater chain AMC) in a bid to sweat out hedge funds with significant short positions in the same.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robinhood raises $1B after trading halts to keep its platform running&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-raises-1b-after-trading-halts-to-keep-its-platform-running/embed/#?secret=hr0hgh2VML" data-secret="hr0hgh2VML" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The ensuing high volume of trading activity from individual retail investors led to various actions from platforms that provide free trading to these individuals, including Robinhood, Webull, Public and M1. Robinhood initially cited &#8220;protecting&#8221; its users as the reason for limits imposed, but later revealed that a lack of funding to cover trade clearances likely caused the temporary measures, since it tapped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-raises-1b-after-trading-halts-to-keep-its-platform-running/">$500 million to $600 million in credit facility and raised $1 billion in funding overnight</a>.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s statement includes a callout that seems specifically directed at entities like Robinhood, and it&#8217;s fair to interpret it as a warning:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition, we will act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity that is prohibited by the federal securities laws. Market participants should be careful to avoid such activity. Likewise, issuers must ensure compliance with the federal securities laws for any contemplated offers or sales of their own securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robinhood has already had run-ins with the financial regulator for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">unrelated business practices</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/gamestop-hearings-congress-waters-robinhood/">lawmakers from both the House and the Senate, as well as NY AG Letitia James</a> have all expressed their intent to review the event and all surrounding activities, which likely involves the role trading platforms like Robinhood played in the week&#8217;s events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a turbulent week for the stock market and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">halts to the trading of certain speculative securities</a> including GameStop (GME) and AMC, consumer investing app Robinhood has raised new capital. The new funds total more than $1 billion, with the company telling TechCrunch that they were raised from its existing investor base.</p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html">reports that</a> the company raised the new equity capital after tapping its credit lines for $500 to $600 million; the company did not answer a question from TechCrunch regarding its credit lines.</p>
<p>The reported drawdown matches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">reporting from yesterday</a> indicating that Robinhood had accessed nine-figures of capital to ensure it had enough funds on hand to meet regulatory minimums and other requirements related to its users&#8217; trading activity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Individual retail investors, along with institutional capital, have attacked short positions in some stocks in recent weeks, leading to a tug-of-war between bullish investors and bearish wagers; the resulting tumult led to surging volume for volatile stocks, leading to Robinhood needing more capital to keep its gears turning.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility">post</a> discussing its decision yesterday to restrict trading on select securities, Robinhood wrote that it has &#8220;many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits,&#8221; adding that &#8220;some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unicorn consumer fintech company halted trading in stocks like GameStop that had become the center of the trading storm yesterday, leading to frenetic accusations from incensed users that something nefarious was afoot. Later in the day the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/webull-and-public-remove-restrictions-on-memestocks-after-citing-trade-settlement-firm-as-the-cause/">clearing house entity powering trading for other consumer trading services</a> also halted service for a similar set of stocks.</p>
<p>Robinhood told users that it would allow trading to begin in some fashion today in shares it had previously restricted.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the current trading scrap will abate soon. Shares of GameStop, the most famous so-called &#8220;meme stock&#8221; in the current trading war, is up just under 94% this morning in pre-market trading, implying that many investors are willing to continue pushing its value higher in hopes of breaking short bets laid by other investors.</p>
<p>One result of the current climate is a boom in demand for trading apps. Today on the U.S. iOS App Store, Robinhood is ranked first; Webull, a rival service is second; Reddit, a hub for trading gossip mostly via r/WallStreetBets is third; Coinbase a popular crypto trading service is fourth in line. Square&#8217;s Cash App, which allows for share purchases is ranked seventh, Fidelity&#8217;s iOS app comes in tenth place, and TD Ameritrade is 16th. Finally, E*Trade&#8217;s own app is ranked 18th. That&#8217;s a good showing for fintech, both startup and incumbent alike.</p>
<p>No one knows what comes next, how the trades play out or if the present-day retail investing surge in stock trading will persist. What does seem clear, however, is that today is going to be very silly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another COVID-19 vaccine is almost ready to begin being distributed &#8212; a single-shot inoculation made by Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Janssen Pharmaceuticals subsidiary. The company just released an<a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial"> efficacy report based on data from its Phase 3 trial</a>, which found that the new vaccine is 66% effective overall in preventing moderate to severe incarnations of COVID-19 in those who received the jab, and 85% effective in preventing severe disease.</p>
<p>Those numbers aren&#8217;t as impressive as the reported figures for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines that are already being distributed via emergency FDA approval, both of which reported 90+% efficacy. But Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s vaccine is a single shot rather than a two-course treatment, which should make it much easier to distribute much more quickly. The vaccine also showed 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization or death among participants in the trial, 28 days after vaccination, which is a key measure when considering the broader impact of COVID-19 on healthcare resources. Efficacy varied by region, with the jab proving 72% effective in the U.S. across moderate and severe cases versus 66% globally.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Phase 3 trial is happening amid the emergence of new strains of the virus, including much more contagious versions like the U.K. and South African variants. At the time that both Moderna and BioNTech released their trial data, these variants hadn&#8217;t yet emerged or been confirmed by pandemic researchers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s vaccine uses a modified version of a common cold virus to deliver DNA that provides a person&#8217;s body with instructions on building a replica of the spike protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to attach to cells. The modified adenovirus can&#8217;t replicate in human cells, however, meaning it won&#8217;t lead to illness &#8212; only an immune response that can later be employed to combat contracting the virus that leads to COVID-19. This adenovirus method is much more proven in terms of use in human patients versus the mRNA method that the other vaccines currently in use employ.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, despite headline numbers that appear to fall short relative to the data we&#8217;ve seen from Moderna and Pfizer, this Johnson &amp; Johnson report is actually very encouraging. The company says it expects to file a request for an Emergency Use Approval (EUA) from the FDA in February, which could see it begin to be distributed next month, adding yet another weapon in the arsenal to combat the global pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber&#8217;s plan to acquire Autocab, a maker of SaaS for booking and dispatch software for the taxi and private-hire vehicle industry, which also operates a global trip marketplace for taxis and PHVs (<a href="https://www.autocab.com/our-solutions/igo/">iGo</a>), is being looked at by the U.K.&#8217;s competition watchdog &#8212; which <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/600fe20fd3bf7f05be4d1e22/Uber_Autocab_Notice_commencement_initial_period_.pdf">announced</a> the launch of an inquiry today.</p>
<p>The deadline for a decision by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on whether to refer the merger for an in-depth investigation is March 26.</p>
<p>Uber announced its intention to acquire U.K.-based Autocab last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/uber-picks-up-autocab-to-push-into-places-its-own-app-doesnt-go/">August</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Competition considerations could arise if Uber, a provider of ride-hailing services that competes with traditional taxis and private-hire vehicle firms for customers, were to shutter Autocab&#8217;s alternative trip-booking marketplace or close it in selective markets where its own ride-hailing service operates, for example.</p>
<p>Although, at the time it announced the acquisition, Uber said it planned to support Autocab’s expansion of SaaS and iGo internationally. The <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">move also looks intended to create more opportunities for Uber drivers to pick up jobs from outside its own platform, including delivery work, as ride-hailing has faced a demand squeeze during the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the overlap between Autocab&#8217;s iGo marketplace and Uber&#8217;s core rides service certainly merits questions being asked about risks to competition.</p>
<p>The CMA has opened an invitation for comment on the merger &#8212; with a February 12 deadline for submissions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments on the transaction from any interested party.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the inquiry in a statement, an Uber spokeswoman said: “We are cooperating fully with the UK Competition and Market Authority’s inquiry to ensure it can conclude its review as quickly as possible. We are confident that this acquisition is positive for consumers, will help local operators grow and provide drivers with genuine earning opportunities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sirenum.com/">Sirenum</a>, a platform for remotely managing a shift-based workforce across industries such as railway, aviation, construction and the gig economy, has raised a $2.7 million Series A funding round from new investors, including former Tesco CEO Sir Terry Leahy, alongside the William Currie Group.</p>
<p>Sirenum says its subscription model platform simplifies the process of managing shift workers, including rostering and managing schedules, monitoring and engaging staff, and processing key financial processes, including payroll. Its clients include Randstad, Impellam, Manpower and GI Group, as well as specialist agencies like TES.</p>
<p>The issue with shift workers is that they need to be in the right place at the right time and paid the right amount. Obviously. Sirenum says it allows staff to manage their own time by accepting or rejecting shifts and check their payroll at any time through a mobile app. The platform handles shift management, payroll, compliance and scheduling. The app also tracks the fatigue of workers based on the U.K.’s Health and Safety guidelines, meaning employers can track the wellness of employees and adhere to compliance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product came about when Sirenum founder Benjamin Rubin ran a staffing agency in London. He was on honeymoon with his wife when he received a call that one of his employees had been hit by a train.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the employee was fine, but Rubin realized that to avoid being in that same situation again, he needed a tool to be able to manage his staff safely at multiple locations. He developed the Sirenum product as a solution for his agency and in 2012 won the contract to staff the Olympic Stadium. In 2014 Sirenum became a standalone product. It now claims to have nearly 400,000 workers on the platform.</p>
<p>Its competitors include TempBuddy (owned by Bullhorn), Shiftboard and WorkN. Shiftboard has raised $16.9 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.chefclub.tv/en-us//">Chefclub</a> announced earlier this week that it has raised a $17 million funding round led by First Bridge Ventures. SEB Alliance, the venture arm of kitchen appliance maker Groupe SEB, Korelya Capital and Algaé Ventures are also participating.</p>
<p>Chefclub has been building a major media brand on social media platforms. It has attracted a huge audience that doesn’t look bad next to well-funded media brands Tastemade and Tasty.</p>
<p>I already covered the company at length, so I encourage you to read my previous profile of the company:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9TCyt6cAiK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/how-food-media-brand-chefclub-reached-1-billion-organic-views-per-month/">How food media brand Chefclub reached 1 billion organic views per month</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How food media brand Chefclub reached 1 billion organic views per month&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/how-food-media-brand-chefclub-reached-1-billion-organic-views-per-month/embed/#?secret=9TCyt6cAiK" data-secret="9TCyt6cAiK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Chefclub is an interesting lesson in sales funnel. It has a huge top of the funnel with 100 million followers on YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok. Overall, they generate more than 1 billion views per month.</p>
<p>The company leverages that audience to create new products. It starts with cooking books, obviously. Chefclub has sold 700,000 books so far. As those books are self-published, the company gets to keep a good chunk of the revenue.</p>
<p>More recently, the startup has launched cooking kits for kids, with colorful measuring cups, cooking accessories and easy-to-understand recipes; 150,000 people have bought a product for children.</p>
<p>Chefclub now wants to display its brands in stores thanks to partnerships. That’s why having Groupe SEB as an investor makes sense. You can imagine co-branded items boosted by promotion on Chefclub’s accounts.</p>
<p>Finally, the startup plans to enter a new market — consumer-packaged goods. That’s the same thinking behind it, except that we’re talking about food. It’s interesting to see that Chefclub doesn’t think online ads represent the future of the company. And it seems like a smart decision during the current economic crisis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Xiaomi, the world&#8217;s third-largest smartphone maker, today unveiled “<a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/01/29/forget-about-cables-and-charging-stands-with-revolutionary-mi-air-charge-technology/">Mi Air Charge Technology</a>,” which it says can deliver 5W power to multiple devices “within a radius of several metres” as the Chinese giant invited customers to a “true wireless charging era.”</p>
<p>The company said it has self-developed an isolated charging pile that has five phase interference antennas built-in, which can “accurately detect the location of the smartphone.”</p>
<p>A phase control array composed of 144 antennas transmits millimeter-wide waves directly to the phone through beamforming, the company said, adding that “in the near future” the system will also be able to work with smart watches, bracelets and other wearable devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A company spokesperson said Xiaomi, which has previously introduced <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-80w-wireless-charging-fills-4000mah-battery-19-minutes/">80W</a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-first-phone-qualcomm-quick-charge-5/">120W</a> wireless charging tech, won’t be deploying this new system to consumer products this year.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xsFHKCcV2rg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the company has described the mechanics of its new tech:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the smartphone side, Xiaomi has also developed a miniaturized antenna array with built-in “beacon antenna” and “receiving antenna array”. Beacon antenna broadcasts position information with low power consumption. The receiving antenna array composed of 14 antennas converts the millimeter wave signal emitted by the charging pile into electric energy through the rectifier circuit, to turn the sci-fi charging experience into reality.</p>
<p>Currently, Xiaomi remote charging technology is capable of 5-watt remote charging for a single device within a radius of several meters. Apart from that, multiple devices can also be charged at the same time (each device supports 5 watts), and even physical obstacles do not reduce the charging efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p>News site XDA-Developers <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-no-contact-wireless-charging/">reported</a> on Friday that a Motorola executive also demonstrated a prototype remote charging system that appears to deliver power over the air. No word on when its tech will hit consumer devices either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://traderepublic.com">Trade Republic</a> is rolling out its app and service in France this week. This is a significant expansion move as Trade Republic has only been available in Germany and Austria so far.</p>
<p>Trade Republic lets you buy and sell shares or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from your phone with low, transparent fees. The company charges €1 ($1.21) in fees per order, whether you’re buying a single share worth €100 or allocating €10,000 of your savings on an ETF. The company promises that it doesn’t add any commission on top of that €1.</p>
<p>The startup lets you buy European shares as well as stock in Asian or American companies. Overall, there are 7,500 shares and ETFs available in the app. While the service is relatively new, Trade Republic has been working on its infrastructure for several years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Behind the scenes, the company has partnered with <a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/en/">Solarisbank</a>, a German banking-as-a-service platform regulated by German authorities. It means that your deposits are covered up to €100,000 ($121,000) in case of bankruptcy. When you’re submitting an order, Trade Republic works with LS Exchange and HSBC Transaction Services to handle those shares.</p>
<p>Trade Republic wants to position itself differently from Robinhood. The company thinks there are currently two options when it comes to trading.</p>
<p>You can open a trading account with your bank or a legacy broker, but they’ll charge a lot of money. Or you can use a mobile-first broker, but they’ll push you toward risky assets and day trading. And as we’ve seen this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">with the GameStop saga</a>, the second option can lead to some backlash.</p>
<p>Trade Republic is promoting a third way — low fees and low risk. The company wants to promote savings plans, for instance. Those plans let you buy shares progressively, which should protect users against volatility.</p>
<p>The company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/trade-republic-a-german-robinhood-raises-67m-led-by-accel-and-founders-fund/">€62 million funding round</a> ($75.22 million at today’s rate) last year. The Series B round was co-led by Accel and Founders Fund.</p>
<p>As for French users, don’t forget that you have to declare that you have a <a href="https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/international-particulier/questions/comment-declarer-mes-comptes-et-mes-contrats-dassurance-vie">foreign bank account</a> when you file your taxes. Foreign brokers also don’t necessarily send information to tax authorities to pre-fill your tax reports. But if you’re fine with that, Trade Republic is most likely cheaper than your bank.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The impact of United States government sanctions on Huawei is continuing to hurt the company and dampen overall smartphone shipments in China, where it is the largest smartphone vendor, according to a <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-declines-11-in-2020">new report by Canalys</a>. But Huawei’s decline also opens new opportunities for its main rivals, including Apple.</p>
<p>Canalys says Apple’s performance in China during the fourth quarter of 2020 was its best in years, thanks to the iPhone 11 and 12. Its full-year shipments returned to its 2018 levels, and it reached its highest quarterly shipments in China since the end of 2015, when the iPhone 6s was launched.</p>
<p>Overall, smartphone shipments in China fell 11% to about 330 million units in 2020, with market recovery hindered by Huawei’s inability to ship new units. Even though demand in China for Huawei devices remains high, the company has struggled to cope with sanctions imposed by the U.S. government under the Trump administration that banned it from doing business with American companies and drastically curtailed its ability to procure new chips.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In May 2020, Huawei rotating chairman Guo Ping said even though the firm can design some semiconductor components, like integrated circuits, it is &#8220;incapable of doing a lot of other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>This left Huawei unable to meet demand for its devices, but gives its main rivals new opportunities, wrote Canalys vice president of mobility Nicole Peng. &#8220;Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi are fighting to win over Huawei’s offline channel partners across the country, including small rural ones, backed by huge investments in store expansion and marketing support. These commitments brought immediate results, and market share improved within mere months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple benefited from Huawei’s decline because the company’s Mate series is the iPhone’s main rival in the high-end category, and only 4 million Mate units were shipped in the fourth quarter. &#8220;However, Apple has not relaxed its market promotions for iPhone 12,” wrote Canalys research analyst Amber Liu. “Aggressive online promotions across e-commerce players, coupled with widely available trade-in plans and interest-free installments with major banks, drove Apple to its stellar performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter of 2020, smartphone shipments in mainland China fell 4% year over year to a total of 84 million units. Even though it held onto its number one position in terms of shipments, Huawei’s total market share plummeted to 22% from 41% a year earlier, and it shipped just 18.8 million smartphones, including units from budget brand Honor, which it agreed to sell in November.</p>

<p>Huawei’s main competitors, on the other hand, all increased their shipments at the end of 2020. Oppo took second place, shipping 17.2 million smartphones, a 23% increase year over year. Oppo’s closest competitor Vivo increased its quarterly shipment to 15.7 million units. Apple shipped more than 15.3 million units, putting its market share at 18%, up from 15% a year ago. Xiaomi rounded out the top five vendors, shipping 12.2 million units, a 52% year-over-year increase.</p>
<p>Huawei’s decision to sell Honor means the brand may rapidly gain market share in 2021, since it already has consumer recognition, wrote Peng. 5G is also expected to help smartphone shipments in China, especially for premium models.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For American importers, finding suppliers these days can be challenging not only due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. The U.S. government&#8217;s entity list designations, human-rights-related sanctions, among other trade blacklists targeting Chinese firms have also rattled U.S. supply chains.</p>
<p>One young company called <a href="https://www.icw.io/">International Compliance Workshop</a>, or ICW, is determined to make sourcing easier for companies around the world as it completed a fresh round of funding. The Hong Kong-based startup has just raised $5.75 million as part of its Series A round, boosting its total funding to around $10 million, co-founder and CEO Garry Lam told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>ICW works like a matchmaker for suppliers and buyers, but unlike existing options like Alibaba&#8217;s B2B platform or international trade shows, ICW also vets suppliers over compliance, product quality and accreditation. It gathers all that information into its growing database of over 40,000 suppliers &#8212; 80% of which are currently in China &#8212; and recommends them to customers based on individual needs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2016, ICW&#8217;s current client base includes some of the world&#8217;s largest retailers, including Ralph Lauren, Prenatal Retail Group, Blokker, Kmart and a major American pharmacy chain that declined to be named.</p>
<p>ICW&#8217;s latest funding round was led by Infinity Ventures Partners with participation from Integrated Capital and existing investors MindWorks Capital and the Hong Kong government&#8217;s $2 billion<a href="https://www.itf.gov.hk/l-eng/ITVF.asp"> Innovation and Technology Venture Fund</a>.</p>
<h2>Supply chain shift</h2>
<p>In line with the ongoing shift of sourcing outside China, in part due to the U.S.-China trade war and China&#8217;s growing labor costs, ICW has seen more customers diversifying their supply chains. But the transition has limitations in the short run.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still very difficult to find suppliers of certain product categories, for example, Bluetooth devices and power banks, in other countries,&#8221; observed Lam. &#8220;But for garment and textile, the transition already began to happen a decade ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, which has been replacing a great deal of Chinese manufacturing activity, each country has its slight specialization. Whereas Vietnam abounds with wooden furniture suppliers, Thailand is known for plastic goods and Malaysia is a good source for medical supplies, said Lam.</p>
<p>When it comes to trickier compliance burdens, such as human rights sanctions, ICW relies on third-party certification institutes to screen and verify suppliers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a [type of] qualification standard that verifies whether a supplier has fulfilled its corporate social responsibility … like whether the factory fulfills the labor law, the minimum labor rights or the payroll, everything,&#8221; Lam explained.</p>
<p>ICW plans to use the fresh proceeds to further develop its products, including its compliance management system, product testing platform and B2B-sourcing site.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a taste of what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/qualtrics-prices-ipo-at-30-per-share-above-its-upgraded-target-range/"><strong> Qualtrics</strong> IPO pricing</a>, and the future of major acquisition pricing schemes.

Even more, the Fast story fits into a broader narrative of online checkout startups raising a zillion dollars in recent weeks.</li>
<li> A boom in food delivery and restaurant startups, and why Danny is bearish on a plastic-free play. Natasha is in favor. Alex gets a company&#8217;s model mixed up with Spoon Rocket.</li>
<li> Natasha explains how <strong>Clubhouse</strong> isn&#8217;t the first company to raise millions off of millions of users with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">no known near-term monetization plan</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Miami, an emerging startup hub, has a new check-writer in town: SoftBank. The Japanese multinational conglomerate announced plans today to invest $100 million, drawn from across its funds, into Miami-based startups. Notably, SoftBank’s $5 billion Latin America fund is headquartered in Miami, as well.</p>
<p>The initiative is led by SoftBank CEO Marcelo Claure. The fund will back companies who are in Miami or plan to move there.</p>
<p>A SoftBank check is somewhat of a Silicon Valley rite-of-passage, so the firm’s involvement in the scene will likely signal to others that the growth of Miami is something to be taken seriously. The tax-free haven is attracting swathes of investors and founders from around the country looking to join the growing scene. Relocators include Keith Rabois of Founders Fund, David Blumberg of Blumberg Capital, Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz and David Sacks of Craft Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who has been on a <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1335037068108554241">Twitter tear</a> asking techies to move to Miami, has spearheaded much of the efforts to turn the city into a startup epicenter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big Win for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiTech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MiamiTech</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/marceloclaure?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@marceloclaure</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SoftBank?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SoftBank</a>’s latest investment initiative: The $100M Miami Tech Fund will directly fund and support Miami-based businesses, creating Miami unicorns right here at home. <a href="https://t.co/b15skzokhN">pic.twitter.com/b15skzokhN</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mayor Francis Suarez (@FrancisSuarez) <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1354912470238961666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Ruben Harris, founder of Career Karma, has been working with Suarez <a href="https://twitter.com/rubenharris/status/988430185484685313">since 2018</a> to help people break into tech.</p>
<p>“Now that Softbank has made this move, we will see more funds follow their example and this is a huge win for diversity not just from a race perspective, but also from a socioeconomic perspective, and from a gender perspective,” Harris said, who is thinking about moving to the city. Career Karma is currently working with VC funds to get old laptops into its Reskill America program, to help train an emerging workforce <a href="https://careerkarma.com/reskill-america/apply/">in Miami. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/monicasblack">Monica Black</a>, who is behind Function, a Miami-based non-profit investor syndicate, hopes that SoftBank&#8217;s entrance &#8220;will not only increase the amount of capital going to local startups and help them grow to the Series A stage and beyond, but also attract other institutional VCs as co-investors.&#8221; Historically, she said, it&#8217;s been tough for local startups to raise capital from Silicon Valley or New York funds. The exception to this was Papa, which raised $18 million in September to connect older adults with virtual companions from Sound Ventures and Canaan.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nicberardi">Nico Berardi</a>, the founder of Miami-based fund ANIMO Ventures, connected the new SoftBank initiative to the recent announcement by San Francisco’s Founders Fund to open an office in Miami.</p>
<p>“Both are symbolic and I think symbols matter,” Berardi said. “[They] are planting a flag here and saying look this is a viable scene.” Of his 16 portfolio companies, Berardi says only one startup is based in Miami. With more and more investors moving to the city, Berardi is optimistic that it can magnetize more talent to move, too.</p>
<p>“I’m hopeful that this can attract tens or hundreds of founders to build their next thing in Miami,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amidst the sturm und drang of l'affaire GameStop, the cloud software vendor received a warm welcome from public investors.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amidst all of the the <em>sturm und drang</em> of <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/">l&#8217;affaire GameStop</a>,</em> Qualtrics went public today.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/qualtrics-prices-ipo-at-30-per-share-above-its-upgraded-target-range/">pricing its stock</a> above its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/qualtrics-raises-ipo-pricing-ahead-of-debut/">raised IPO range</a>, the company received a warm welcome from public investors. After starting its trading life worth $41.85, Qualtrics closed the day worth $45.50, up some 51.67%.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Qualtrics did everything that it said it was going to.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The software company&#8217;s debut comes after a lengthy path to the public markets; Qualtrics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">sold to SAP</a> on the eve of its first run at a public listing back in 2018. Now, SAP has completed spinning the company out, though the software giant remains the Utah unicorn&#8217;s largest shareholder.</p>
<p>That Qualtrics&#8217; IPO might perform well was presaged in its pricing run, having prices far above its initial valuation estimates; there was evidence of strong demand even before its shares started to trade.</p>
<p>But did Qualtrics misprice, given its strong first-day performance? TechCrunch spoke with Qualtrics CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zigserafin/">Zig Serafin</a>, and its founder and current executive chairman <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanQualtrics">Ryan Smith</a> about its public offering, hoping to learn a bit about what is next for the company.</p>
<h2>Pricing, plans</h2>
<p>Having spoken to myriad folks on IPO days, I&#8217;ve learned the best way to kick off is to ask about emotions. Most CEOs and other execs are tied up in what they can (and cannot) say. And they are well-trained by communications experts regarding what to repeat and emphasize. You can sometimes loosen them up a little, however, by asking them how they feel.</p>
<p>In response to that question, Serafin described a feeling of gratitude and Smith brought up the long game. Qualtrics, he said, had been told that it couldn&#8217;t bootstrap, that it couldn&#8217;t build in Utah, that SAP had overpaid, that SAP had messed up and so forth.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After enduring a day&#8217;s worth of taking a beating <a href="https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1354886106001649679">across social media</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1354917642507866114">government</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1354814429511131138">various app stores</a> of the mobile world, Robinhood <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility">took to its own blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vladtenev/status/1354900958942175233">CEO&#8217;s Twitter account</a> to explain why it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">halted trading</a> of some stocks earlier today.</p>
<p>That Robinhood had restricted trading in a number of securities was bombshell news after the consumer trading platform had become synonymous with not only a rise in retail investing, but also a risky wager by some individual investors to push shares of heavily-shorted companies, including GameStop, AMC and others higher. Speculation that Robinhood was limiting the trading ability of those users at the behest of, pick your poison, Citadel, the US government, hedge funds, Janet Yellen, or others, ran rampant.</p>
<p>But none of it was true – at least according to Robinhood&#8217;s telling. In its post, Robinhood wrote that (emphasis TechCrunch):</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1611870043839_198" class="">[a]mid this week’s extraordinary circumstances in the market, we made a tough decision today to temporarily limit buying for certain securities. <strong>As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment.</strong> These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That reads like Robinhood ran low on capital and had to make some hard decisions, quickly. The securities its users wanted to trade likely generated the highest capital obligations given how volatile they proved and how long it takes for trades to settle, so Robinhood had to shut off some trades to stay on the right side of its capital needs. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg5HOnq7zD0">Not great, not terrible?</a>)</p>
<p>Reporting <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=gni836kR">from Bloomberg indicates</a> that Robinhood &#8220;tapped at least several hundred million dollars&#8221; from credit lines today makes sense in this context. As does the unicorn&#8217;s decision to allow for some trading of the afore-limited securities in the near future (&#8220;starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities,&#8221; the company wrote); now reloaded with more capital, Robinhood can afford to let its users get back, somewhat, to business.</p>
<p>Of course Robinhood could have been more clear about all of this earlier in the day. Instead, unfairly or not, it became the face of theoretical corruption and other nefarious forces. (Here&#8217;s a tip, if your theory sounds like it could fit inside the Qanon orbit, try again?)</p>
<p>Nothing is settled. Congress has its hackles up. Other trading platforms had to suspend trading in GameStop and other stocks for a spell as well. Social media is pissed. Some Robinhood users were forced to liquidate positions. And somehow GameStop closed the day worth more than $196 per share. And after-hours it is up $72.40, or 37.40% to $266 per share.</p>
<p>Who knows what comes next. But grains of salt, please, as we continue this bizarre adventure.</p>

<p>Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), chairwoman of the House Committee on Financial Services, announced plans for an investigation into the situation, pointing to a history of &#8220;predatory conduct&#8221; from hedge funds.</p>
<p>Waters didn&#8217;t call out Robinhood or any other trading services by name, but did note that a future hearing would focus on the systemic financial impact of short selling, &#8220;gamification&#8221; and online trading platforms. The hearing date is not yet set.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Addressing that predatory and manipulative conduct is the responsibility of lawmakers and securities regulators who are charged with protecting investors and ensuring that our capital markets are fair, orderly, and efficient,&#8221; Waters said.</p>

<p>In the Senate, incoming Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSherrodBrown/status/1354881250922819585">announced his own plans for a hearing on the &#8220;current state of the stock market&#8221;</a> in light of recent events. &#8220;People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they&#8217;re the ones getting hurt,&#8221; Brown said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Democratic Reps. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ro Khanna <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/gamestop-robinhood-aoc-ted-cruz-tlaib-khanna-robinhood/">all condemned the startup Robinhood</a> for halting some trades in the midst of the Reddit retail investor-led volatility. Morgan Stanley-owned E-Trade followed suit.</p>
<p>Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz echoed Democrats&#8217; concerns over Robinhood&#8217;s actions, signaling that even in the midst of pandemic relief negotiations and an impeachment trial that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle still have an appetite for dragging tech in for questioning.</p>
<p>And apparently it&#8217;s not just Congress. New York Attorney General Letitia James also issued a short statement Thursday noting that her office is &#8220;aware of concerns raised regarding activity on the Robinhood app&#8221; and would be reviewing the situation.</p>
