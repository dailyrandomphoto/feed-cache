										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/d46570d1b23448a6c8d2251e26f99102bc1d47bf?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bento.africa%2F&amp;userId=1725294&amp;signature=bc5b84af3f271644">Bento</a>, Nigeria’s digital payroll and human resource management platform is expanding to Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda with plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa over the next one year.</p>
<p>In its next phase of expansion, Bento is eyeing Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola and Ethiopia by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Bento is tapping the payroll and HR management market in Africa that has traditionally relied on laborious analog processes to disburse pay. The startup, founded in 2019, is helping businesses to automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances including taxes and pension.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244703" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Seeing so many companies using analogue methods to manage their workforce is both frustrating and exciting for us. Employers don’t have access to locally customized, world-class payroll and HRM tools, and employees can’t easily access third-party services to help make life easier. When you think about it, your salary powers your life, so we’re building the operating system that will have a profound impact on the African continent for generations to come,” said Bento co-founder and CEO, Ebun Okubanjo.</p>
<p>Bento said that its platform is leveraging data to extend credit solutions to third parties (employees) and other services like unemployment insurance, savings and investments.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s proprietary credit engine, built in partnership with Israel’s Tarya, ensures the disbursement of instant loans.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, Bento currently serves over 900 businesses including healthcare and financial service companies such as Hygeia and Tangerine Africa, and Y Combinator-backed startups Paystack, Kobo360, Branch and LORI Systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re starting with payroll and HRM, but moving rapidly towards Salary 2.0, where we redefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent,” said Bento’s other co-founder and COO, Chidozie David Okonkwo.</p>
<p>“Having successfully established product-market fit in Nigeria, one of the most difficult markets to penetrate in Africa, we’re excited to roll out across the continent and solve the real problems we know millions of employers and employees face on a daily basis,” said Okonkwo.</p>
<p>Bento’s expansion comes about a month after Workpay, a Nairobi-based payroll and HR management startup, expanded to Nigeria to tap small medium sized businesses in the West African region. Workpay, a Y Combinator startup, is among the 50 enterprises in Africa that received equity-free funding and support from Google. Workpay said its platform makes it possible for companies to pay in 15 currencies across Africa and to hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity. Its platform currently supports 400 businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cinetpay.com/">CinetPay</a>, a payment gateway that allows e-merchants and merchants to accept mobile money and other forms of payments in Francophone Africa, has secured $2.4 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African venture capital fund 4DX Ventures and unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> are the investors in the round, and it signifies two particular markers for the pair. CinetPay is their first investment in the Francophone region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CinetPay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ci.linkedin.com/in/idrissmarcialmonthe&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiot9647tP0AhVTiP0HHVYLBzsQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Pq3P2OHcp2ZVjPdDspjZi"> Idriss Monthe</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ci.linkedin.com/in/daniel-dindji-7a1418122&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjurMG-7tP0AhWpgv0HHZRkCwMQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3b8c27f9Pi3ghM6LAnXa-a">Daniel Dindji </a></span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in 2016 after CEO Monthe experienced issues collecting payments at his previous startup, CinetCore, a site specializing in the sale of online domain names.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243788" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we launched our website to sell domain names online, we faced difficulty in collecting online payment after creating many PayPal accounts which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were blocked by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PayPal because we were in Africa,&#8221; the CEO told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But the cost that we make is that in Francophone Africa 80% of the population have a mobile money account. And between 10 and 20% of people have a bank account and credit cards. We decided to explore the tract of mobile money and create a payment gateway, where we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all mobile money available in Francophone Africa to enable merchants to accept online payments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ivorian startup acts as an online and point-of-sale payment solution for merchants to process payment from more than 130 different payment operators &#8212; mobile-money, bank cards, wallets &#8212; in nine French-speaking African countries: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Congo, Guinea and Benin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, merchants have to open an account and then upload their KYC, integrate Cinet&#8217;s APIs and start collecting payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each merchant pays an annual subscription fee of $20 a year and Cinet collects 1-1.5% commission on every transaction made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244715" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244715" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244715" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244715" class="wp-caption-text">CinetPay team</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants on the platform range from e-commerce platforms and digital public services to insurance companies and schools. Since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over 12,000 merchants have registered on the platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Monthe admits that only 400 of them are active. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked why the company had a poor retention rate, he said most active merchants have opened several accounts in the past before sticking with one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also possible that CinetPay&#8217;s numbers are a reflection of the presence of bigger payments gateways such as MFS Africa and PawaPay that target sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s 562 million registered mobile money accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company has done fine in its own right. So far, it has processed more than 30 million transactions for these 400 active merchants, processing about $12.5 million in transactions monthly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been tracking the Francophone Africa market for some time now, and have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been impressed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CinetPay’s ambitious goal to digitize payments across the region,” said Walter Baddoo, co-founder and general partner at 4DX Ventures. “We look forward to partnering with the CinetPay team alongside our long-time portfolio company, Flutterwave, to help usher in the next phase of digital payments across the Francophone region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave&#8217;s involvement in the round is a continuation of the unicorn&#8217;s partnership with CinetPay that started in 2019, said both companies in a statement. It is also a diversification from the mobile money moves Flutterwave has made recently where it signed a partnership with MTN to allow businesses in select countries to receive MTN mobile money (MoMo) via the gateway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga &#8220;GB&#8221; Agboola said the investment in CinetPay is an example of the duo&#8217;s shared vision to &#8220;simplify payments on the continent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CinetPay said the seed investment gives it the opportunity to boost its sales and marketing efforts across the markets in West and Central Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monthe maintained that despite the company&#8217;s size being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> smaller to that of its competitors, its geographical presence, technology and mission to &#8220;simplify payment and make it accessible via all channels&#8221; makes it different from other players. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the plan is to be the foremost payment gateway in the next four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our vision is to be the first payment aggregator in Francophone Africa by 2025. First </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our geographical presence in 15 countries in Francophone Africa. First </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> innovation, first </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market share,&#8221; he remarked in a grandiose manner.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s has acquired Austria-headquartered GeoGebra, the latest in a series of purchases by the Indian edtech giant this year as it scales its online learning platform across the globe.</p>
<p>Neither of the firms disclosed the purchase price, but a source familiar with the matter said the deal size is about $100 million and includes both cash and stock. Byju’s declined to comment.</p>
<p>Eight-year-old <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/?lang=en">GeoGebra</a> operates an interactive and collaborative mathematics learning tool and reaches over 100 million students across more than 195 countries and territories. The platform offers its service to both enterprises as well as philanthropic non-profit organisation, the latter of which accesses GeoGebra at no charge. Byju&#8217;s said GeoGebra&#8217;s current apps and web services will continue to be available for free post the acquisition.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244707" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;GeoGebra was born out of a passion to help students learn math in a visually appealing and engaging manner. Our shared passion for learning and teaching resonates with BYJU’S, making them a perfect partner for our onward journey. I am confident that this partnership will help millions of students learn mathematics in an interactive way, in turn making them overcome their fear of math and learn to master it,&#8221; said Markus Hohenwarter, co-founder of GeoGebra, in a statement.</p>
<p>Byju’s said the GeoGebra acquisition “complements” its product strategy. The most valuable Indian startup will integrate GeoGebra’s offerings with its products to make “math more engaging” for its students.</p>
<p>&#8220;The GeoGebra team has built a powerful and stimulating platform that complements BYJU’S mission of providing impactful learning for students. Designed to improve mathematical understanding, it offers significant features that provide interactive resources that adapt to every child’s style and pace of learning,” said Anita Kishore, Chief Strategy Officer of Byju’s, in a statement.</p>
<p>“At Byju&#8217;s, with the help of innovative teaching and technology, we have been making Math fun, visual, and engaging. And with GeoGebra on board, we will continue to further enhance, reimagine and transform the way Math is taught and learned. Together with our combined strengths, we will have a wider reach and the best resources to build innovative and exciting next-generation learning formats,” she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GeoGebra is the latest in a series of purchases Byju&#8217;s has made this year as it looks to fill the whitespaces in its offerings. The Bangalore-headquartered startup has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/byjus-acquires-coding-platform-tynker-for-200-million-in-us-expansion-push/">acquired Tynker</a>, Scholr, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">Aakash Institute</a>, Hashlearn, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/byjus-acquires-reading-platform-epic-for-500-million-in-us-expansion-push/">Epic</a>, Great Learning, and Gradeup for over $2 billion in cash and equity deals.</p>
<p>Byju Raveendran, founder and chief executive of Byju’s, told TechCrunch in an earlier interview that the firm is still looking for more merger and acquisition opportunities. In the meantime, Byju&#8217;s is also exploring an initial public offering as soon as next year. TechCrunch first reported that some bankers including Morgan Stanley have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/">pitched a $50 billion valuation to Byju&#8217;s</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few years ago, at the start of the fintech services boom in Africa, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oblantern/?originalSubdomain=uk">Oliver Blantern</a> got an opportunity to work in the continent offering advisory services to high-growth startups. For slightly over three years his company, Riverhouse Technology, helped the emerging tech firms in talent sourcing and acquisition.</p>
<p>The trained lawyer did all this while running the Africa Payments Club, a platform that brought together a pool of founders, experts and investors in the tech space to connect and address common business challenges as well as to scout for opportunities in Africa.</p>
<p>The platform, born out of his experiences at Riverhouse, provided a light-bulb moment to Blantern, who in March this year launched <a href="https://impactrooms.com/">Impact Rooms</a> to provide solutions to some of the obstacles that founders, investors and executives regularly face.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244685" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Impact Rooms offers well-rounded solutions for startup problems, from ensuring that they are investor-ready and are matched with the right investors, to raising capital. To be investor-ready means that the startups have strong financial models, are sourcing the right kind of human capital, and comply with regulations.</p>
<p>Blantern said the Impact Rooms is also using data to help investors make decisions on which countries, industries or startups to invest in – giving an equal opportunity to startups across all markets in Africa.</p>
<p>“We want to encourage a high percentage of capital into regions outside the four main markets (South Africa, Kenya, Egypt and Nigeria) as much as we can. We want to encourage capital into African women-led businesses, and to support a high number of existing local and global investors to invest more capital in this market,” Impact Room CEO and founder Blantern told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On Impact Rooms, startups also get access to a diverse range of services, including legal and marketing support, from the platform’s other partners. Impact Rooms is backed by US-based investment group Global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/world-mobile-group-bringing-zanzibaris-online-through-mobile-network-built-on-blockchain/">Blockchain</a> Ventures (GBV).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our job is to support startups and help them all the way to maturity. We conduct company evaluations through investor-readiness support and offer introductions to relevant service partners, and then support with capital raising.”</p>
<p>The Impact Rooms team is currently spread across the world with some of its experts in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/kenyas-president-signs-new-law-to-police-digital-lenders-apps-have-six-months-to-apply-for-licenses/">Kenya</a>, Zambia, Ghana, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Australia, US, UK and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Blantern said that the startup has also built a database to provide insights on how investors are making investment decisions.</p>
<p>“It is the most comprehensive and intelligent investor database for Africa, and it allows us to understand why some companies raise capital and others don’t, as well as to improve their chances in the future,” he said.</p>
<p>Impact Rooms uses its proprietary algorithm, Cortex, to conduct company evaluations and in valuation benchmarking to understand trends.</p>
<p>The startup is planning to establish Smart Fund, an investor-matching program that uses algorithms to pick the best opportunities for funders. The fund will bring together investors with shared interests from across the world to expand their investment prospects in Africa.</p>
<p>“We work and partner with investors, incubators, companies, and all kinds of ecosystem players, including financial service providers &#8211;we are not a competitor. We are here to work with everyone in this ecosystem,” he said.</p>
<p>Impact Rooms is currently working with 14 startups from six countries across Africa, spanning different specialties from e-commerce to blockchain-based communications. The supported startups include Ghana’s Wala Digital Health, a SaaS Software connecting hospitals and donors for critical blood transfusions.</p>
<p>The startup has so far evaluated 85 companies and by the end of next year, it hopes to work with 5,000 companies across the continent and to directly, or indirectly create an additional 10,000 jobs. This in addition to helping 1,000 startups raise funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jin Stedge studied aerospace engineering at MIT, but after she found herself at Scotty Labs, an SRI International spin-out focused on autonomous driving, she says she came to appreciate how far away the tech is from large-scale adoption.</p>
<p>Indeed, when Scotty was acquired by DoorDash in the summer of 2019, she teamed up with Sanjaya Wijeratnebut, a colleague and senior software engineer at Scotty Labs, and they got to work on a more ruthlessly practical challenge: empowering truck drivers to run their current businesses more efficiently.</p>
<p>For Stedge, it was largely personal. Her  grandparents were owner operators who acquired up to six trucks in the 1980s; her uncles and cousins later entered the business, too, she says. Armed with their insights, she knew the daily difficulties that independent truckers endure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244679" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>She also knew that predictions by AI experts who said truck drivers would be out of work <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-experts-predict-the-future-truck-drivers-out-of-jobs-by-2027-surgeons-by-2053/">by 2027</a> were flat wrong. &#8220;If you think about what long-haul truckers do,&#8221; says Stedge, &#8220;they go over the Rockies, they have to tarp freight to the back of their trucks, they&#8217;re often without cell service for hours at a time &#8212; that kind of environment is just really hard to automate.&#8221;</p>
<p>It helped, of course, that the market they&#8217;d be chasing is enormous. It&#8217;s no coincidence that so many startups have flocked to address different aspects of the trucking industry, from brokers and load marketplaces to outfits that help with cash flow, make equipment, provide insurance or make compliance products.</p>
<p>In fact, the opportunity that Stedge and Wijeratnebut spied with their startup, <a href="https://www.truenorthfleet.com/">TrueNorth</a>, was to create a single, easy-to-use platform to help truckers manage their customers; find, book, and coordinate loads; optimize their routes; invoice their customers; and collect payment. It would also pay them upon the completion of a job, so drivers wouldn&#8217;t be forced to wait a month or more to be paid, as has long been customary.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bfCQsWOw9s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/softbank-backed-flock-freight-is-the-freight-industrys-newest-unicorn/">SoftBank-backed Flock Freight is the freight industry&#8217;s newest unicorn</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SoftBank-backed Flock Freight is the freight industry&#8217;s newest unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/softbank-backed-flock-freight-is-the-freight-industrys-newest-unicorn/embed/#?secret=bfCQsWOw9s" data-secret="bfCQsWOw9s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The idea, broadly speaking, was for TrueNorth to give the independent truckers who make up somewhere between 10% and 20% of the industry the resources of a larger fleet &#8212; and better economics.</p>
<p>Y Combinator liked the pitch enough to welcome Stedge and Wijeratnebut into its winter 2020 batch. A seed check from Sam Altman quickly followed, then an $8.5 million Series A round led by former Stripe exec Lachy Groom.</p>
<p>Now, Stedge says, the company has just closed on $50 million in Series B funding co-led Groom and Altman (along with brothers Max and Jack). Many others have joined the ride, too, including  Flexport Fund, Tribe Capital, Original Capital, K5 Global, 137 Ventures, and Fifth Down Capital.</p>
<p>TrueNorth has so far raised $61.8 million altogether.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2244694 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg" alt="" width="5998" height="3999" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg 5998w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5998px) 100vw, 5998px" /></p>
<p>The question begged is whether TrueNorth, which already employs 50 people &#8212; half of them women, notably &#8212;  can deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>Certainly, the $50 million should help, along with $10 million in working capital that TrueNorth has separately secured from a debt provider. It&#8217;s already using that money to ensure its customers get paid promptly after each job.</p>
<p>The company is also already lowering costs for the roughly 200 truckers already using its software, insists Stedge. She says that just one way it&#8217;s doing this is pooling its customers together and securing lower-cost insurance for the group. (&#8220;An independent trucker who&#8217;s truly on their own will pay $20,000 to $30,000 a year in insurance, which is crazy,&#8221; says Stedge. &#8220;With us, they pay $10,000 a year.&#8221;)</p>
<p>TrueNorth says, too, that it increases drivers&#8217; revenue by helping them find the highest-paying trucking jobs and making it simple to book them.</p>
<p>Still, one outstanding question is how effectively TrueNorth is able to reach its customers, given that it is targeting a very fragmented market. Stedge notes that the company has &#8220;never done outbound sales&#8221; because all of its customers have found the company on their own, and she says that 90% have additionally referred friends. With deeper pocketed rivals, it could need to spin up a more aggressive marketing strategy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One rival in particular would seem to be a threat, and that&#8217;s CloudTrucks, which just two weeks ago closed on </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/">$115 million</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in Series B funding and whose founder, Tobenna Arodiogbu, previously cofounded Scotty Labs, where he was CEO.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qRO7qlnXOF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/">CloudTrucks raised $115M Series B to help truck entrepreneurs manage their business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CloudTrucks raised $115M Series B to help truck entrepreneurs manage their business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/embed/#?secret=qRO7qlnXOF" data-secret="qRO7qlnXOF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like TrueNorth, Arodiogbu&#8217;s vision is to help trucking entrepreneurs operate their businesses. As he told TechCrunch in late November, &#8220;Lots of tools are being built for brokers and shippers, but not nearly enough is being done for the truck driver who’s actually doing the really hard work.”</p>
<p>For her part, Stedge sees CloudTruck&#8217;s momentum as a strong signal to truckers and investors alike. &#8220;We serve the same customer, which is independent truckers, [but] I think it&#8217;s good, to be honest,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a humongous market. It&#8217;s a $100 billion market, just in these independent truckers and small fleets. So the more people who are helping owner operations and who are doing that marketing and brand awareness, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Stedge is hiring fast, and revenue is starting to add up for the young company, which charges customers between 15% and 18% of all goods they move. (If that seems high, Stedge observes that big fleets often take closer to 40%.) Right now, those drivers are delivering between $30,000 and $50,000 per year per trucker, which puts TrueNorth&#8217;s gross revenue at between $6 million and $10 million. But that&#8217;s up 3.4 times over the last six months alone, and the company is still mostly operating in its first market Dallas, and more newly in Atlanta, says Stedge.</p>
<p>As important, she says: the company has been significantly improving its contribution margin, which is basically the portion of sales that helps to offset its fixed costs. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re growing really fast if there&#8217;s a leaky bucket,&#8221; says Stedge, who could just as well be talking about one of her trucking customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to know that you&#8217;re building a business that lasts, and we have been very efficient with our money.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a few weeks after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/21/lydia-adds-stock-and-crypto-trading-to-its-payment-app/">stock and crypto trading</a>, French fintech startup <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> is announcing that it has raised a $100 million Series C round. With this funding round, the startup has reached a unicorn valuation, which means that it is currently valued at more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Dragoneer and Echo Street are investing in the startup for the first time, and many of Lydia’s existing investors are putting more money on the table, such as Tencent, Accel and Founders Future.</p>
<p>“What’s really impressive with this round is that it is primarily financed by existing investors,” Lydia co-founder and CEO Cyril Chiche told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243430" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Times are changing. A few years ago, when a startup chose to raise from its existing investors, it usually meant that the team couldn’t find new investors. So existing investors would accept to put more money in the company in exchange for a lower valuation.</p>
<p>But now, many VC firms have raised huge funds. Hedge funds are now investing in venture rounds. Investing in the most competitive startups have become harder. If a portfolio company is doing well, VC firms now usually want to double down on their previous investment.</p>
<p>And Chiche confirmed that Lydia’s valuation has increased starkly compared to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/lydia-raises-another-86-million-to-build-european-financial-super-app/">last year’s round</a>.</p>
<p>At first, Lydia was a peer-to-peer payment app. After adding your debit card and your bank details, you could send and receive mobile payments with other Lydia users. It progressively became the dominant mobile payment app in France.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, the app has evolved quite a lot to become a financial super app with a wide range of features and financial products. Users can get a virtual or physical debit card that works on the Visa network. They can also manage their money more easily by creating sub-accounts that they can share with other Lydia users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243434" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243434" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2243434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243434" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lydia</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to daily payments, Lydia also offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/05/lydia-expands-credit-offering-in-partnership-with-younited-credit/">small loans</a> from €100 to €3,000, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/lydia-partners-with-cashbee-to-add-savings-accounts/" title="Lydia partners with Cashbee to add savings accounts">savings accounts</a>, and now trading. In particular, the new crypto and stock trading partnership with Bitpanda makes it much easier to invest small amounts of money whenever you want.</p>
<p>Lydia and Bitpanda are offering fractional shares so that you can buy, for example, €10 worth of Apple share 24/7 — it’s something quite new for the French market. And given the success of trading in Robinhood and Cash App in the U.S., the new trading feature could represent a big opportunity for the future of the French startup.</p>
<p>By adding more products on top of peer-to-peer payments, Lydia wants to drive engagement. The business model is quite clear. When you’re sending and receiving a handful of payments with the app, everything is free. If you want to go further, the company offers premium subscriptions.</p>
<p>Lydia has attracted 5.5 million users so far. Even more important, a third of French people who are 18 to 35 years old have a Lydia account. In other words, things are going well in France. And the startup now wants to go down the same road in other European countries.</p>
<p>Lydia plans to hire 800 people over the coming three years, including 160 people in 2022 alone. By 2025, the company hopes that 10 million customers in Europe will use Lydia as their primary account.</p>
<p>“What we’re experiencing is the reinvention of the banking industry,” Cyril Chiche told me. According to him, people are not going to manage money the same way in a few years. Some companies will get it while others won’t change.</p>
<p>He doesn’t think it’s a duel between neobanks and incumbents. Some legacy players may have what it takes to stay relevant in the future. But, of course, he truly belies that Lydia can simplify retail banking so that it becomes more accessible to more users.</p>

Flip hopes to change that by helping individuals and businesses to eliminate complexity and execute their money transfer at a low cost. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip, which intends to be the most customer-centric financial technology company in the world, enables users to do fair financial transactions from anywhere to anyone. The startup obtained a license from Bank Indonesia (BI) in 2016 to provide financial services, including interbank transfers to more than 100 domestic banks, international remittances, e-wallet top-ups, salary transfers and business solution products.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company said the annual volume of money transfer in Indonesia was recorded at a nominal value of more than </span>$2.2 trillion<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in 2020, citing </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.bi.go.id/id/statistik/ekonomi-keuangan/spip/Default.aspx">Bank Indonesia&#8217;s data</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Interbank transfer is the most dominant payment method in Indonesia’s fast-growing digital economy. Flip has a massive user base and is growing rapidly with outstanding retention metrics, all of which point to the delightful and seamless product that the company has built… Sequoia Capital India believes that Flip is the most exciting consumer fintech company in Indonesia. The firm is thrilled to be leading the third consecutive round, testament of its high conviction in the company,” said Aakash Kapoor, vice president of Sequoia India. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip serves more than seven million users for various kinds of financial transactions from and to different regions in Indonesia and overseas money transfers. More than 340 Indonesian companies and SMEs in travel, hospitality, e-commerce, transportation, education, outsourcing, crowdfunding, business management sectors use Flip’s employee payroll, customer refunds, invoice/ supplier payments, and international transfers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its users have increased 10x compared to before the pandemic following the increase of technology adoption and mobility restrictions in Indonesia, Arriyan said. During the pandemic, the protocol around mobility restriction in Indonesia resulted in most bank offices closing, requiring people to use technology-based solutions for their financial transactions, he continued. The shift in consumer behavior from visiting bank branches to using digital products increased users, Arriyan added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Flip is disrupting the existing interbank transfer market and has established itself as a clear leader in the category, with its superior product that allows for seamless payment movement between bank partners,” said Deven Parekh, managing director at Insight Partners.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As the first institutional investor in Flip, we have witnessed the incredible growth of the product and the execution of the team over the past two years. Flip is now the dominant player in its space, with millions of Indonesians trusting the platform for their day-to-day financial needs,” said Samir Chaibi, principal at Insignia Ventures Partners.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip has added over 250 team members to build its financial services for millions of Indonesian people. The company has increased its team size by 140 % over the past months. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s largest card company just doubled down on its bid to capture the crypto market. Visa announced today that it has launched a crypto advisory practice for its clients and partners under its Visa Consulting and Analytics (VCA) arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes just a few months after Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/a-whole-new-class-of-consumers-is-entering-crypto-space-visa-exec.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared the asset class had become “cool”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a fintech conference last month. The payments behemoth made waves when it bought a CryptoPunk NFT in August this year, but its move to launch a dedicated crypto consultancy shows its attempts to capture crypto market share in a crowded field extend beyond marketing stunts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa’s partnerships with crypto platforms have doubled in the past 18 months, Sheffield told TechCrunch in an interview. Consumers have also spent about $3.5 million dollars using Visa’s crypto-linked card programs, Sheffield said, </span><a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/crypto-creeps-checkout-line-marqeta-visa-mastercard-bitpay/609409/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up from $1 million in July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244574" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It also announced the results of a new global survey it conducted on consumer attitudes about crypto, which found that 40% of its 6,000+ respondents would be likely to switch primary banks to one that offers crypto products.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa has seen “an incredible amount of inbound calls from hundreds of clients and partners and traditional financial institutions” who are looking to integrate crypto into their offerings, Sheffield said. Visa’s consulting arm has around 700 employees, though the company did not share how many would be affiliated with the crypto practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see Visa well-positioned as a global neutral brand, with deep expertise in crypto, that can help to abstract away some of the complexity of these new technologies and help banks bring it into their core products,” Sheffield said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, Visa invested in blockchain compliance firm TRM Analytics by participating in its $60 million Series B, <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/07/trm-labs-raises-60m-as-visa-amex-play-catchup-on-crypto-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/07/trm-labs-raises-60m-as-visa-amex-play-catchup-on-crypto-tracking/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">announced yesterday</a>. American Express and Citi also participated in the fundraise. Visa is just one of many card incumbents scrambling to make inroads into crypto, which is threatening their fee-dependent business model by replacing them as the new underlying infrastructure for payments.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastercard, for its part, </span><a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/crypto-creeps-checkout-line-marqeta-visa-mastercard-bitpay/609409/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched a crypto rewards program in October this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, using Bakkt as its custodian for digital assets. Visa does not hold crypto in custody directly either, but partners with Anchorage Digital to provide this capability – a company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/anchorage-cryptocurrency-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it first invested in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019. Visa is building out its crypto API platform on top of Anchorage, enabling other banks to access their custodial services, Sheffield said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheffield anticipates growth in Visa’s crypto-linked debit card programs as well as use cases like central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Although just seven countries have launched CBDCs to date, 87 more are considering them, </span><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to The Atlantic Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa is hoping to capitalize on this interest by helping banks develop CBDC-related products, Sheffield said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time on research on what infrastructure CBDCs would use for consumer experiences, and how consumers would interact with them. We are taking that expertise and the engagements that we&#8217;re having with central banks and helping banks start to think about their role in preparing, as we think there&#8217;ll be a number of countries that end up going down this route,” Sheffield said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deeproute.ai, an autonomous vehicle startup with offices in Shenzhen and Fremont, California, unveiled an ambitious self-driving solution on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The package, named DeepRoute-Driver 2.0, is a production-ready Level 4 system that costs approximately $10,000. The price tag is incredible given the hardware used: five solid-state lidar sensors, eight cameras, a proprietary computing system, and an optional millimeter-wave radar.</p>
<p>Lidar accounts for roughly half of the total cost, a Deeproute spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;As the whole supply chain is getting more developed and scale[s] up, we can expect the cost can go further down.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244658" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two-year-old startup is unabashed about going up against its more mature counterparts. As it said in its Wednesday release, &#8220;DeepRoute-Driver 2.0 offers differentiation from existing L4 pioneers like Waymo and Cruise, which boast sophisticated and efficient L4 algorithms but with a hefty price tag, and from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) such as Tesla, that are affordable but have limited capabilities in terms of fully automated driving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sensor makers in China have been working to reduce the once exorbitant prices of lidar to make them fit for mass production.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> DJI-spawned Livox</a> is one, and so is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/innovusion-64-millions-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temasek-backed Innovusion</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244664" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244664" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244664" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="551" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=1536,827 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244664" class="wp-caption-text">Lidar on the car roof. Photo: Deeproute.ai</p></div></p>
<p>Deeproute&#8217;s L4 solution uses two pieces of lidar from Robosense, which is based in Shenzhen, as its main lidar on the car roof. Three other lidar sensors from Beijing-based Z Vision are located at the front, left and right around the rear wheel, covering the vehicle&#8217;s blind spot. Both Z Vision and Deeproute are backed by Fosun RZ Capital, an affiliate fund of Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The low price of Deeproute&#8217;s L4 tech could mean thin profits for the startup, or, it&#8217;s squeezing the margins of its suppliers, a founder of an autonomous vehicle startup suggested to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A test drive shows that Deeproute&#8217;s L4 system is able to navigate rush-hour traffic in downtown Shenzhen, performing tasks like flexible lane change, yielding to pedestrians and auto on or off-ramp merging.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QMm8wqDXZW8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Though merely two years old, the team behind Deeproute includes pioneers in China&#8217;s self-driving industry. In 2019, Zhou Guang founded Deeproute after he was forced out of his last company Roadstar.ai amid infighting. At the time, Roadstar had raised at least $140 million from investors and was widely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered a promising player in the autonomous vehicle space</a>.</p>
<p>Investors have been rooting for Zhou&#8217;s new venture. In September, the startup announced a <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300 million Series B round</a> from Alibaba, Jeneration Capital, Chinese automaker Geely, among others. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to see OEMs and carmakers pouring money into AV startups in exchange for future production partnerships. Momenta, for instance, has landed multiple strategic investments from titans like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bosch, Toyota and Daimler</a>.</p>
<p>While Deeproute hasn&#8217;t officially secured a customer for its L4 solution, the startup&#8217;s spokesperson said a few &#8220;major automakers&#8221; have taken rides in the cars integrated with the tech and &#8220;they were impressed by the functionality as well as the pricing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very positive on the prospect of signing the contract soon,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com CEO Vishal Garg apparently realizes he’s done wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(As if the barrage of negative publicity wasn’t enough evidence of that.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, a letter to current employees was </span><a href="https://nyl.as/t1/306/czkxvedfahuokld7tkw8n3lc9/0/d89395136ee9fee037b10c12db6bd059370499b25335d4397dc6e1e72a7614f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaked on Blind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a verified Better employee. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the letter, Garg apologized for the way he (mis)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">handled the layoff news last week, writing: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected and for their contributions to Better. I own the decision to do the layoffs, but in communicating it I blundered the execution. In doing so, I embarrassed you.”</span></i></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244583" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might argue that he also embarrassed himself. Among the affected employees was the company&#8217;s diversity &amp; inclusion team, according to multiple sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier today, s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ources familiar with internal happenings within the company told TechCrunch the company’s VP of communications, Patrick Lenihan; head of public relations, Tanya Gillogley; and head of marketing, Melanie Hahn, have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-coms-pr-comms-marketing-heads-submit-resignations-in-wake-of-layoffs-fiasco/">all submitted their resignations</a>.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fallout from the way CEO and co-founder Vishal Garg handled the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">layoffs of about 900 people, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as first reported by TechCrunch, has been widespread, including criticisms of it being handled over Zoom, to charges of insincerity on Garg’s part.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move last week came after the digital mortgage lender announced it had received a cash infusion of about $750 million as</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an amendment of its SPAC agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with blank check company Aurora Acquisition Corp., and SoftBank, and then promptly laid off about 9% of its 10,000 workforce.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch has reached out to Better.com for comment but has not yet heard back at the time of writing. The employees said to have resigned also have not responded to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com is not the only SoftBank-backed proptech that has seen top executives leave in advance of its public debut. In 2019, Insider also reported more than a dozen of WeWork’s top officials </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-executive-exodus-everyone-who-left-resigned-2019-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had left the company </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">amid reports of internal complaints and uncertainty surrounding its IPO plans.</span></p>
<p>The question on all of our minds at this point is will investors and board members tolerate this sort of behavior from Garg, or will he be forced out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/report-weworks-adam-neumann-to-step-down-as-ceo/">Adam Neumann-style</a>?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garg’s reputation as a not very nice person goes back to last year, when </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/?sh=57eee6f710f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed the contents of an email to employees from Garg: “HELLO — WAKE UP BETTER TEAM. You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS and…DUMB DOLPHINS get caught in nets and eaten by sharks. SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same Forbes article revealed that Garg was the subject of a number of lawsuits from the likes of PIMCO and Goldman Sachs for things like “improper and even fraudulent activity at two prior business ventures, and of misappropriating “tens of millions of dollars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent dip in refinancings is believed to be a factor in Better.com’s decision to lay off some of its employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2020, Better.com said it was “hiring aggressively” as more people were seeking to refinance their homes in the face of historically low mortgage rates. At that time, I had reported for Crunchbase News that an internal memo to employees from Garg revealed that the mortgage lending startup was </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/digital-lending-startup-better-com-hiring-aggressively-as-more-people-refinance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking to hire about 1,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 as a whole “as more and more homeowners come online for their needs.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been five years since the founding of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&#8217;s Science program (not CZI itself, which is a year older), which has proven to be quite a generous patron of cutting-edge biotech science and research, and far from winding down, the organization is stepping on the gas as good outcomes from its grants and internal work pile up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working as partners with scientists, patients, and open source communities, we’ve learned so much during these first five years of our science journey about where we can have the best impact in accelerating biomedicine. Now we’re ready to begin our next chapter,&#8221; said Priscilla Chan, co-founder and co-CEO of CZI (with husband Mark Zuckerberg, of course), <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-announces-10-year-effort-to-develop-science-and-technologies-to-measure-human-biology-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a press release</a>.</p>
<p>The organization has funded hundreds of experiments, projects, trials and other essential basic research. While we don&#8217;t always <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-gives-68m-to-fund-human-cell-atlas/">cover the</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-drops-3-8m-on-23-biomedical-open-source-projects/">projects themselves</a>, being rather technical in nature, the value of this focused and highly curated giving is pretty clear. (Though it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-faces-racial-discrimination-allegations-from-former-employee/">not without its critics</a>.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244553" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been astonished by the fact that methods in single-cell biology, microscopy, and artificial intelligence that were considered impossible just five years ago are now routine,&#8221; said CZI&#8217;s head of science, Cori Bargmann. &#8220;This work has yielded great insight and laid the foundation for what we plan to do going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Initiative has several major announcements to coincide with its anniversary celebrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biomedical Imaging will push forward in one of CZI&#8217;s favored areas of research. Imaging at a cellular or even molecular level is a constant source of insight for researchers, but it&#8217;s often phenomenally complex and expensive. Much work has been funded by CZI over the years to lower the cost and increase the efficacy of these approaches — and the new Institute will centralize and further accelerate these efforts.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/bay-area-coronavirus-testing-chan-zuckerberg-initiative-cz-biohub-ucsf-gavin-newsom/">The CZ Biohub</a> was started as a cross-institutional, cross-discipline platform focused on understanding and modeling the mechanisms behind every disease, with the goal of preventing, curing or managing all of them by the end of the century. Hard to aim higher than that! But it&#8217;s clearly a lot of work, so they&#8217;re extending the current Biohub&#8217;s operations through 2031, and establishing a network of new ones to scale up operations.</li>
<li>A new research institute at Harvard, the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence, will focus on understanding and replicating the human mind. The next generation of AI will likely require insights from how our own brains work — and the truth is we&#8217;re kind of in the dark on that part. Maybe they&#8217;ll figure it out here.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t catch the big fifth anniversary symposium summarizing and discussing the last few years of work by CZI and partners, you should be able to catch up when they <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/anniversary-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post the video here</a> later.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Whether you call it sustainability, ESG or climate tech, there is no doubt that doing good while making money has taken the world by storm.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-18/-35-trillion-in-sustainability-funds-does-it-do-any-good?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, global sustainable investment assets grew to $35.3 trillion just last year. That pencils out to about $1 of every $3 managed globally seeking to profit out of “making the world a better place.”</p>
<p>As these dollars flow into venture capital, the world seeks to solve some of the hardest climate-related problems to keep the globe within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. Investors seem to sense the urgency: Climate tech investment grew at a faster rate than overall VC between 2013 and 2019, according to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/new-report-finds-vc-investment-into-climatetech-growing-five-times-faster-than-overall-vc/">PwC report</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244262" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To clarify, the term “impact investing” is being used here loosely and synonymously with other terms, such as socially responsible investing (SRI) and environmental, social and governance (ESG). In essence, impact is “making the world a better place.”</p>
<p>But therein lies the problem with impact investing: If better is in the eye of the beholder (and it is), then what exactly <em>is</em> better?</p>
<p>After all, Philip Morris <a href="https://www.pmi.com/investor-relations/overview/how-cigarettes-are-made#:~:text=We%20operate%2038%20production%20facilities,700%20billion%20cigarettes%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes</a> 700 billion cigarettes a year, but it’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/philip-morris-eyes-sustainable-debt-in-move-away-from-smoking?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">striving for ESG goals</a> to lure investors. The logic of how escapes me, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Hans Taparia <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_world_may_be_better_off_without_esg_investing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> this beautifully:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Contrary to what many investors think, most ratings don&#8217;t have anything to do with actual corporate responsibility as it relates to ESG factors. Instead, what they measure is the degree to which a company’s economic value is at risk due to ESG factors. For example, a company could be a significant source of emissions but still get a decent ESG score, if the ratings firm sees the pollutive behavior as being managed well or as non-threatening to the company’s financial value.</p></blockquote>
<p>You get what you measure, and in the world of public equity, measurement can be grossly misleading. Still, retail investors will buy into the fund because of successful “ESG factor” marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Now, there are genuine investment managers out there who are giving their best effort to make the most impact.</p>
<p>To demonstrate impact, these managers adopt a standard measurement framework, such as <a href="https://iris.thegiin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRIS</a>. But impact measurements are notoriously difficult to apply. They are also extremely difficult to measure, and many are also inherently subjective and more costly to measure compared to the solutions trying to improve them.</p>
<p>Moreover, there may be multiple factors generating a positive outcome, and it is often impossible to discern the specific cause and effect in improving those outcomes. As a result, the manager resorts to the next best thing: They measure actions and implementations. But it is very easy to mistake leading indicators for change.</p>
<p>PlayPumps, a merry-go-round apparatus that pumped underground water the more it spun around from children playing on it, is an <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2010/07/01/the-playpump-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent example</a> of this. The number of installations, percentage of children using the PlayPumps, or liters of water pumped did not necessarily demonstrate whether a community has better access to clean water as a result of the pumps.</p>
<p>Let’s also not forget that these are fund managers and corporate executives who <em>still</em> have to deliver financial performance.</p>
<p>Unlike dollar values, impact measurements are vague and lack true standards, making it more difficult for investors to compare the social impact of an investment portfolio or evaluate relative performance. This also makes tying performance-based pay to impact measurements nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Impact takes time to materialize and is often outside of the fund’s or company’s influence. In the financial world that lives quarter to quarter, maximizing the dollar is always the easier choice to make when a choice must be made.</p>
<p>There is a special place for impact to exist. One where incentives between the managers and companies are aligned, the specific measurements do not matter much, and the time horizon is long enough to make a real difference.</p>
<p>That special place? The early-stage venture asset class.</p>
<p>At Creative Ventures, we use impact as an opportunity lens. We understand that the bigger the impact, the bigger the problem — and likely the bigger the market opportunity and financial return.</p>
<p>Impact is where the problems are. In a world plagued by sophisticated impact measures, our approach imagines a world where an EV costs 20% less and can go 40% farther. A world where we could cure cancer. Where energy consumption is halved in all data centers.</p>
<p>And do we not all agree the world would be a significantly better place if just one of these companies were to succeed?</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 7, 2021! It’s nearly time to reflect on the year, a period in which so very much changed for the global startup world. One of the most interesting themes? Rising venture investment for African startups. Long ignored by the global investing set, startups from the African continent are having a barnstorming year. Sure, we have data to back up that claim, but with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/#:~:text=Equinix%20announced%20today%20that%20it,Ivory%20Coast%2C%20for%20%24320%20million.">even more nine-figure deals landing in Africa</a> it’s a market that any technologist now must keep an eye on. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/#:~:text=Equinix%20announced%20today%20that%20it,Ivory%20Coast%2C%20for%20%24320%20million.">More on the MainOne-Equinix deal here</a>. —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-acquires-quill-a-would-be-slack-rival-team-will-work-on-dms-as-quill-shuts-down/"><strong>Twitter buys Quill, will work on DMs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Let’s be clear, Twitter is a fun place to hang out, but its private-messaging service is pretty <em>basic</em>. But there’s good news on the horizon with the social media company buying the business messaging service’s team to work on DMs. Quill will not survive, but it’s hard to compete against Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Facebook’s parent company is busy generating headlines this week, with the head of its Messenger service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/metas-messenger-boss-is-leaving-the-company/">leaving the company</a>, adding to a roster of exits in recent months (more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/facebooks-cto-to-step-down-after-13-years-at-the-company/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/facebook-vr-exec-hugo-barra-is-leaving/">here</a>). And ahead of a congressional hearing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/instagram-announces-plans-for-parental-controls-and-other-safety-features-ahead-of-congressional-hearing/">Instagram is rolling out parental controls</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/discord-premium-memberships/"><strong>Discord working on paid memberships:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In the larger creator economy, chat service Discord has found an interesting niche. And it’s working to take advantage of the communities that have been built atop its platform, working on a “new way for creators to make money by offering community members access to paid, subscriber-only content,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>While the year is coming to a close, the IPO cycle is not yet done. We have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">HashiCorp’s debut on the way</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">Nubank in the wings</a>. But don’t forget about IoT shop Samsara, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">which could become a decacorn in its upcoming IPO</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244378" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/therify-hopes-to-build-a-more-diverse-and-inclusive-therapist-network-with-1-3m-seed-round/"><strong>Therify wants to make therapy more accessible:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Finding a therapist is not easy if you’re a cishet man. I can attest to this. But if you are a “person of color or someone with disabilities, there are few or no people sharing your experience available,” TechCrunch notes. Therify just raised $1.3 million to work on the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Jupe is </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/jupe-series-a/"><strong>&#8220;not making … glamping tents for bros at Coachella:&#8221;</strong></a><strong> </strong>So what is the startup building? Housing for the roughly 1.5 billion people — by its count — that lack sufficient shelter. The company just raised $9.5 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/torq-raises-50m-series-b-for-its-no-code-security-automation-platform/"><strong>Torq puts points on the board for the Portland, Oregon, tech scene:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The startup formerly known as StackPulse is building a no-code tool for security workflows. And that effort helped it raise a simply massive $50 million Series B. Yes, the pre-IPO rounds of old are today’s early-stage investments. Get used to it. Regardless, we don’t hear that much from my home state, so it’s nice to see Torq doing well. SentinelOne led the round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/sendowl-a-platform-for-selling-digital-goods-raises-4-5m-from-defy-vc-and-stripe/"><strong>SendOwl raises to help creators sell digital goods:</strong></a><strong> </strong>No, we’re not talking about NFTs. Instead, SendOwl wants to help “creators and businesses sell digital goods such as e-books, podcasts and online courses.” There is a big market for such content, even if SendOwl is not the only startup that we can name that is working in the space. Defy.vc and Stripe put up the capital for SendOwl’s $4.5 million seed round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/majority-raises-27m-series-a-six-months-after-its-seed-round-to-expand-mobile-banking-for-migrants/"><strong>Today’s neobank funding round is MAJORITY:</strong></a><strong> </strong>We recently discussed a neobank aimed at SMBs. Today, immigrants. MAJORITY has raised a $27 million Series A for its work, bringing its total capital raised to some $46 million, per TechCrunch reporting. The company now allows folks to sign up sans a Social Security number, which feels notable.</li>
<li><strong>I thought Circle was </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/02/dave-eggers-denies-reading-the-boy-kings/"><strong>a book?</strong></a><strong> Or the </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/circle-is-a-good-example-of-why-spacs-can-be-useful/"><strong>crypto company going public via a SPAC?</strong></a> Turns out it’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/circle-comes-around-again-with-fresh-capital-led-by-tiger-global-for-200m-valuation/"><em>also</em> a startup helping creators build and manage their community</a>. Which seems cool, but we’d politely ask the company to rebrand to avoid us talking in circles on Slack. Regardless, Circle just raised at a $200 million valuation.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/agentsync-raises-75m-for-its-insurance-focused-api-business/"><strong>AgentSync is today’s new unicorn:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Fundraising rocket ship AgentSync announced a $75 million funding round today, pushing its valuation up to the $1.2 billion mark. Working in the insurtech API <em>infra</em> space, AgentSync is proof that there is big money in connecting disparate informational elements of antiquated industries.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/the-every-co-grabs-175m-as-it-cracks-code-on-animal-free-protein-products/"><strong>Honey, you’ve barely touched your brewed protein!</strong></a><strong> </strong>We kid, but if The EVERY Co. has its way, we’ll be eating fermented animal protein equivalents in due time. The company just landed a huge $175 million round to help it bring the future it envisions to life. The startup was previously known as Clara Foods, for reference.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/londons-pento-raises-35m/"><strong>Pento raises pile of capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s main Tiger round is Pento, a U.K.-based payment automation startup that just raised $35 million. Running payroll is a pain, and even more so for small companies. Pento of course has lots of competition, but certainly doesn’t lack for TAM.</li>

<h2>AWS re:Invent 2021 was more incremental than innovative</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re used to Amazon making news: It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s third-largest company, and its founder is planning to build his own private space station.</p>
<p>But at last week&#8217;s re:Invent, the annual conference for AWS customers, &#8220;it felt more like Amazon was checking boxes and filling in holes in the product road map,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>After going virtual in 2020, this year&#8217;s in-person return to Las Vegas saw updates from incoming CEO Adam Selipsky, CTO Werner Vogels and others, but &#8220;nothing came out of the 2021 re:Invent that felt really cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few highlights: AWS unveiled the Gravitron 3, its latest Arm-based processor, along with re:Post, a managed Q&amp;A service that replaces AWS forums, and Amplify Study, a no-code/low-code service for devs building cloud-connected applications.</p>
<p>But notably, &#8220;this is the first re:Invent in a long time where AWS did not announce a new database,&#8221; said Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research.</p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/aws-reinvent-2021-was-more-incremental-than-innovative/">recap of the week&#8217;s announcements</a> — and the lack thereof — points to a company in transition: &#8220;Perhaps Amazon is becoming a bit more like Apple.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/microsoft-seizes-control-of-websites-used-by-china-backed-hackers/">Microsoft takes on Chinese hacking ring:</a> </strong>TechCrunch reports that Redmond-based software giant Microsoft has “seized control of a number of websites that were being used by a Chinese government-backed hacking group to target organizations in 29 countries, including the U.S.” Good news that the company did that, but bad news that it had to.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/google-disrupts-russian-botnet-that-infected-1-million-windows-machines/">Google disrupts Russian botnet:</a> </strong>At some point we’ll get a handle on rampant cybercrime, but today is not that day. Not yet. Progress is being made, however, with U.S. software giant Google taking on a Russian botnet of “technical sophistication,” to quote the firm. Again, good to have this happen, bad that it was a required action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Twitter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Twitter-Quill news was only one headline from the social service, with Big Tweet also rolling out the ability for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-now-lets-all-ios-android-and-web-users-listen-to-recorded-spaces/">all iOS and Android users to listen to recorded Spaces</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-reported-tweets-analysis/">executing work regarding reported tweets</a> that will not force users to “specify which of Twitter’s policies they believe a tweet is violating.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The rest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/"><strong>App stores big:</strong></a> You knew that, but the data is actually somewhat staggering even given our expectations. Per Sarah Perez, first-time app installs are expected to reach 143.6 billion this year, with consumer app spending reaching some $133 billion. No wonder Apple is loath to loosen its grip on its own app-related incomes. They are huge.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-three-more-titles-globally-on-ios-and-android/"><strong>Netflix gaming is really, actually a thing:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I keep expecting this story to go away, but it’s doing the opposite. Again. TechCrunch noted today that video-streaming service Netflix has added three gaming titles to its larger portfolio. Instead of doing this, frankly, I’d hazard that Netflix would be better served just sponsoring its own League of Legends team, but, hey, that’s just me.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/at-lens-fest-snap-debuts-creations-tools-for-more-sophisticated-augmented-reality-experiences/"><strong>Something something Snap metaverse something something:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, held something called Lens Fest. Yes, this was AR and Spectacles and the like. Our own Lucas Matney has the information you need.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The same day in February 2020 that Credit Karma planned to announce that it had been acquired by Intuit for more than $7 billion, the stock market tanked, spooked by news that a novel virus had the potential to start a pandemic.</p>
<p>“I’m up at 5 o’clock in the morning, the Dow is flashing red … and we’re all like, ‘Are we going to do this?’” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/how-credit-karma-acquired-amid-covid-chaos-fared-in-its-first-year-under-intuit/">said Credit Karma CEO Ken Lin</a>.</p>
<p>That deal eventually closed in December 2020, but in the intervening months, the U.S. Department of Justice forced the company to divest its tax business, and credit markets tightened considerably.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244219" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Fintech reporter Ryan Lawler interviewed Lin, Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, Credit Karma’s chief people officer Colleen McCreary and other executives to learn about how they weathered COVID-19 and divestment while simultaneously crafting a new management structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;What had been a very profitable business for a very long time is all of a sudden very unprofitable, because you can’t pivot on a dime,&#8221; said Lin. &#8220;We had a lot of decisions to make.”</p>

<p>Initially founded to create wireless sensors, IoT platform company Samsara reached a $3.6 billion valuation in 2018, but its latest S-1/A filing could boost that &#8220;from $10.1 billion to $11.6 billion,&#8221; reports Alex Wilhelm in today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, he delved into the company&#8217;s inner workings, but &#8220;today, we’re more interested in the resulting numbers, not how they were achieved.&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;re used to Amazon making news: it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s third-largest company, and its founder is planning to build his own private space station.</p>
<p>But at last week&#8217;s re:Invent, the annual conference for AWS customers, &#8220;it felt more like Amazon was checking boxes and filling in holes in the product road map,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>After going virtual in 2020, this year&#8217;s in-person return to Las Vegas saw updates from incoming CEO Adam Selipsky, CTO Werner Vogels and others, but &#8220;nothing came out of the 2021 re:Invent that felt really cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few highlights: AWS unveiled the Gravitron 3, its latest Arm-based processor, along with re:Post, a managed Q&amp;A service that replaces AWS forums, and Amplify Study, a no-code/low-code service for devs building cloud-connected applications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But notably, &#8220;this is the first re:Invent in a long time where AWS did not announce a new database,&#8221; said Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research.</p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s recap of the week&#8217;s announcements — and the lack thereof — points to a company in transition: &#8220;Perhaps Amazon is becoming a bit more like Apple.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a founder, raising seed money can be the hardest part of the puzzle, and depending on the sector, can take dozens of weeks to accomplish.</p>
<p>A data-driven approach to the process, however, can help founders tackle fundraising efficiently while minimizing headaches, writes Russ Heddleston, CEO of DocSend.</p>
<p>“Having very clear data on where VCs focus their time on pitch decks or in meetings will guide you to deliver a finely tuned pitch to the right investor.”</p>

<p>Last week&#8217;s announcement by LinkedIn that it would start offering its services in Hindi highlights a problem facing startups trying to recruit software developers — many of them don&#8217;t use the platform.</p>
<p>Potential hires who live in emerging markets are less likely to use LinkedIn, but a lot of devs just don&#8217;t take a strong interest in building their brands on social media.</p>
<p>Making an effort to meet developers where they are will help your company as an attractive place to work, writes Sergiu Matei, founder of Index.</p>
<p>In a TechCrunch+ post, he shares three tips you can use to attract engineers in an increasingly competitive market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up your content, chats and code</li>
<li>Make EQ, not IQ, your hiring criteria</li>
<li>Say “yes” to more candidates</li>
</ul>

<p>The market is ripe for AI companies to go public, but for SenseTime’s Hong Kong IPO, demand may be less than that of the wider market, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new IPO target of up to HK$5.99 billion (US$768 million) is a far cry from its previous $2 billion IPO, possibly reflecting the fact that investors aren’t excited about its steadily increasing losses, Alex writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Amazon&#8217;s cloud arm, AWS, announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-second-aws-top-secret-region-extending-support-us-government-classified-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new &#8216;top secret&#8217; region</a> this week, designed specifically for the U.S. government. It is Amazon&#8217;s second such region. The company now boasts &#8220;top secret&#8221; regions on the east and west coasts of the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;AWS Top Secret-West is accredited to operate workloads at the Top Secret U.S. security classification level. The new Region adds multiple Availability Zones geographically separated from AWS Top Secret-East,&#8221; Amazon&#8217;s Max Peterson wrote in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-second-aws-top-secret-region-extending-support-us-government-classified-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a company blog post</a> announcing the new region.</p>
<p>The company, which is experiencing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/amazon-web-services-went-down-and-took-a-bunch-of-the-internet-with-it/">an outage today in its East Coast region</a>, recognizes that government clients have different needs. You can&#8217;t put them in a multi-tenant server farm with the rest of humanity. They need isolation and security, and that&#8217;s what the top secret regions have been designed to give them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;AWS is committed to helping our customers and partners in the defense, intelligence and national security communities deliver their most critical missions,&#8221; Peterson wrote.</p>
<p>Last year when the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">fighting with Microsoft</a> over the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pentagon-jedi-contract/"> decade-long JEDI cloud contract</a>, it could point to this top secret region as evidence of its capabilities in managing these special requirements. That contract <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">was eventually scrapped</a>, lost in litigation, and perhaps this is another way to show just how prepared Amazon is to deal with sensitive material like the kind from the DoD in the future.</p>
<p>The new site gives government clients a way to spread out their workloads across geographies, and then within that, choose different availability zones. The zone has been certified by a number of government entities to provide the level of security required by the target customers, including Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Intelligence Community Directive (ICD 503) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, sources familiar with internal happenings within the company told TechCrunch the company’s VP of communications, Patrick Lenihan; head of public relations, Tanya Gillogley; and head of marketing, Melanie Hahn, have all submitted their resignations. Insider also reported the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/better-marketing-communications-pr-executives-resign-after-layoffs-2021-12">news</a> earlier today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fallout from the way CEO and co-founder Vishal Garg handled the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">layoffs of about 900 people, </a>as first reported by TechCrunch, has been widespread, including criticisms of it being handled over Zoom, to charges of insincerity on Garg’s part. Memes about the video have even landed</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@remotevarun/video/7038608341731691823?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8yOfHzjiRpjJv3hz4WmAHudHvVpzYbF51Zj097QoArWW%2BccVDk1cZOkInZt1coACIWB86CNG0htixwjFLGgA%3D&amp;checksum=200c4cfabc0d4cb7b8e458346a1cb0455b2fff0e4da72143d77efd86ad6976b6&amp;clips_cover_ab=v0&amp;enable_clips=1&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAlWIlQBz17XCQiWoJlnkgC7YoGLcjJPr6xc462GGAGx9glsPA_nDUbvrvwIQi-jAc&amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;share_item_id=7038608341731691823&amp;share_link_id=E7BAAF33-F16E-4EB0-A2EC-3D4772BF4DEB&amp;source=h5_m&amp;timestamp=1638819494&amp;tt_from=sms&amp;u_code=d58dgc109e38ma&amp;user_id=6670236611684384774&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=sms&amp;_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on TikTok</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as people all over the world trashed Garg’s actions.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244436" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move last week came after the digital mortgage lender announced it had received a cash infusion of about $750 million as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> an amendment of its SPAC agreement</a> with blank check company Aurora Acquisition Corp., and SoftBank, and then promptly laid off about 9% of its 10,000 workforce. The company is expected to go public at a $6.9 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garg also confirmed to </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/12/03/better-com-ceo-attacks-laid-off-employees-blind-message-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the company accused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “at least 250&#8243; terminated staffers of stealing from the company and customers by working just two hours a day. Not long after Garg announced the layoffs, he addressed the company in a livestreamed town hall. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/better-ceo-vishal-garg-explains-layoffs-in-leaked-video-meeting-2021-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-uri="73d8081c47c7a1554179a4413e829a93">He laid out a vision of what he called &#8220;Better 2.0,&#8221;</a> with a &#8220;leaner, meaner, hungrier workforce,&#8221; according to a leaked recording of the meeting shared with Insider. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch has reached out to Better.com for comment but has not yet heard back at the time of writing. The employees said to have resigned also have not responded to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p>Garg&#8217;s reputation as a not very nice person goes back to last year, when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/?sh=57eee6f710f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a> revealed the contents of an email to employees from Garg: “HELLO — WAKE UP BETTER TEAM. You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS and…DUMB DOLPHINS get caught in nets and eaten by sharks. SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That same Forbes article revealed that Garg was the subject of a number of lawsuits from the likes of PIMCO and Goldman Sachs for things like &#8220;improper and even fraudulent activity at two prior business ventures, and of misappropriating &#8220;tens of millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent dip in refinancings is believed to be a factor in Better.com’s decision to lay off some of its employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2020, Better.com said it was “hiring aggressively” as more people were seeking to refinance their homes in the face of historically low mortgage rates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, I had reported for Crunchbase News that an internal memo to employees from Garg revealed that the mortgage lending startup was <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/digital-lending-startup-better-com-hiring-aggressively-as-more-people-refinance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking to hire about 1,000 people</a> in 2020 as a whole “as more and more homeowners come online for their needs.”</span></p>
<p>Better.com is not the only SoftBank-backed proptech that has seen top executives leave in advance of its public debut. In 2019, Insider also reported more than a dozen of WeWork&#8217;s top officials <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-executive-exodus-everyone-who-left-resigned-2019-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had left the company </a>amid reports of internal complaints and uncertainty surrounding its IPO plans.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter&#8217;s note:</strong> After we published this story, we learned that Garg had issued an apology to current employees, and that the SPAC will likely be delayed.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta (formerly Facebook) has found a new way to avoid the app stores&#8217; commissions on in-app purchases with the launch of a new website where people can buy &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/stars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stars</a>&#8221; &#8212; the virtual items that allow fans to express their support for favorite creators during Facebook videos and livestreams. Typically, Stars are bought as in-app purchases on mobile devices where they&#8217;re subject to a revenue share with the app store platform provider &#8212; meaning, Apple or Google. But when fans purchase Stars via the new Facebook website, they&#8217;ll use Facebook Pay, not Apple or Google&#8217;s payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>This will allow fans to &#8220;get more Star for their money at lower rates,&#8221; notes <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/stars-fest-is-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Facebook announcement</a>. That appears to be true for the time being at least, as Facebook is offering &#8220;bonus&#8221; Stars with every purchase. That means, for example, when you spend $9.99 on 530 Stars, you&#8217;ll now get another 420 Stars as a bonus when purchased through the website. Via the Facebook mobile app and in-app purchases, however, you would only get the 530 Stars. (Note: I am referencing the website bonus amounts that appeared when the site is loaded today. The Facebook blog post features a screenshot that shows different bonus amounts. We understand rates are even lower during the month of December for the “Stars Fest” event. Regardless, these bonuses mean you get more Stars for your money via the web.)</p>

<p>There are Bonus Stars available at a variety of increments, with the number of extra Stars increasing alongside your purchase amount. You can purchase as few as 45 Stars (with a bonus of 35 Stars) for $0.99 or as many as 6,400 Stars (with a bonus of 3,600 Stars) for $99.99, according to the website as it appears now. (See above.)</p>
<p>But if the bonuses are removed, there&#8217;s no advantage to using a website over in-app purchases, as the rates appear to otherwise be the same as you&#8217;d otherwise pay.</p>
<p>Once purchased through the Stars Store website, the Stars are deposited into people&#8217;s virtual wallets so they can be distributed to eligible creators during their Facebook Live or on-demand videos. Creators can reward their fans who use Stars however they want &#8212; they may give them a shoutout on the video or some other perk in line with their style and content.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244479" style="width: 418px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244479" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2244479" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264108882_439708281046369_1735616068564879691_n.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="408" height="768" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244479" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Facebook has found a way to work around the app stores&#8217; revenue share requirements. Last month, Facebook introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">custom subscription links for creators</a> on iOS that allow them to accept direct payments, avoiding Apple&#8217;s controversial 30% cut. This system was possible because &#8212; for the time being at least &#8212; Facebook isn&#8217;t taking its own cut of these transactions. That allows Facebook to leverage a currently acceptable means of avoiding commissions as detailed in Apple&#8217;s App Store Guidelines. (Specifically,<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#acceptable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> rule 3.2.1</a>, which says individuals may make monetary gifts to other individuals if 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift. <a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/introducing-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clubhouse</a> took advantage of this carve-out as well for its in-app tipping system.)</p>
<p>The ability to buy Stars via the web is another interesting move &#8212; and one that could shift a number of transactions off Facebook&#8217;s mobile app and in-app purchases once fans realize there&#8217;s a way to buy more stars for less money. Apple is supposed to soon allow app developers to point to other means of making purchases outside the app as a result of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">Epic Games ruling</a>, but Apple is currently asking the court to delay when that injunction goes into effect after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/technology/apple-epic-games-suit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its first attempt was denied</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook&#8217;s announcement of the Stars Store website was one of many updates it&#8217;s making during its <a href="https://starsfest2021.fnvirtual.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">month-long &#8220;Stars Fest&#8221; taking place in December</a>. The company says it&#8217;s also testing using Stars in more places &#8212; like videos on the News Feed, the Facebook Watch feed, the Gaming tab, and starting next year, Facebook Reels.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also launching something called &#8220;Stars Party,&#8221; which is a new way for fans to send Stars together during livestreams. A countdown timer will appear giving the community five minutes to come together and hit a Stars goal. Creators who complete a Stars Party will receive a $50 bonus for each one from Dec. 22, 2021 through Jan. 3, 2022, Facebook says.</p>
<p>As part of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/creators/investing-one-billion-in-the-creator-community&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638992019927000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1N1NcGnH1jBL6PAaDmY0BP">$1 billion creator fund</a>, it&#8217;s also investing in a Stars &#8220;Double bonus,&#8221; which runs through March 31. During this time, Meta will match some creators’ Stars earnings, up to $750 a month. This could allow creators to earn up to $3,750 in bonus payments. However, the program is invite-only. Facebook will also give $3 million in free Stars to people so they can try out the feature during live videos.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during Stars Fest, the company is offering limited-time virtual gifts and badges, special live programming from a variety of creators, financial incentives for creators to go live and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The African tech scene woke up today to exciting news about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/">landmark acquisition</a> of MainOne, one of the region’s most important and pivotal tech companies in the past decade, by Equinix, a U.S. multinational specializing in internet connection data centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of MainOne starts with founder and CEO Funke Opeke moving back to Nigeria after working as an executive at Verizon. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she noticed how poor internet connectivity was in Nigeria, she started Mainstreet Technologies, the company behind the development of the MainOne Cable, to provide network solutions to businesses in Nigeria and West Africa in 2008</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainOne went live in 2010 as West Africa’s first </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">privately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> owned, open access, undersea high-capacity 7,000-km cable stretching from Portugal to West Africa with landings along Accra, Dakar, Abidjan and Lagos.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244251" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which services businesses in more than 10 African countries, is now an Equinix subsidiary and the acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is pegged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at $320 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When completed, it will become the largest acquisition of a tech company in Nigeria and the first landmark deal made by an African woman tech CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch had a chat with Opeke and Judith Gardiner, VP Growth and Emerging Markets at Equinix, to discuss the deal and address reports that MainOne </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was bought</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for cheap</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: If you’ve been following the reactions to the news this morning, there are two camps with opinions on the deal. Some think Equinix acquired MainOne at a good price after you ran the company profitably, while others think MainOne was underpriced. There are reports that MainOne has invested up to $400 million in the course of building internet and data infrastructure in West Africa. Do you see why a part of the public is conflicted about MainOne is selling at $320 million?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Funke Opeke:</strong> Interesting question. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Equinix is gaining a competitive, informed price for the shares in MainOne and the shareholders retained a leading investment bank to run a competitive process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we’re very satisfied and pleased with the offer made by Equinix and the value they represented to the shareholders and to the business going forward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But they were not the only interested party.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, of course, we’ve raised capital through the years, but not all the capital we’ve raised is equity. In fact, MainOne has not raised equity since the initial founding of the company. We have raised debt, we have refinanced debt, we have extended that debt to grow the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when you look at the sale of shares in MainOne and the value, one, you shouldn’t say &#8220;OK, because MainOne has raised this much capital over the years, then we have to multiply that by a certain amount to achieve the value of the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other thing, of course, is you have to look at the revenue and profits generated [by] the business, earnings multiples of the business, and I can assure you that the shareholders of MainOne who are selling their shares </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are seasoned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are pleased</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the levels of returns that they are achieving.</span></p>
<p><strong>Would you like to highlight the share of equity and debt you’ve raised throughout the years just for clarification&#8217;s sake?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> I don’t have those numbers in front of me, and we have raised several rounds of debt or rolled over several rounds of debt. The company to the public domain was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capitalized with $120 million in equity and $120 million in debt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also note that the investors in MainOne started investing in 2008, and, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there have been partial distributions to these investors through the tenor of the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>OK. So you’re saying this wasn’t any forced or distressed sale?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> Not at all. I mean, we’re doing well, we’re having one of our best years ever. Our businesses growing, responding to the challenges faced in our region. We opened a new data center in Ghana in June of this year, we are expanding our data center facility in Lekki and that will be open in Q1 2022.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are critical to the digital infrastructure of West Africa, no doubt, and we expect that we will continue to grow that as part of the global platform that Equinix brings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a fantastic story that we can grow as part of that global platform and have access to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment capability, the technology and the solutions they have to offer the global customers who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wanting to do business in our region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is no kind of distress sale. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our shareholders who are financial investors have been in the company from the initial investors almost 13 years around 2008 to all the other institutional investors who came in in 2009</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And you would agree with me, but that is an extensive period. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these are also infrastructure investors who realize that it takes time for the infrastructure to mature and become productive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have seen their investment become productive for them in recent years and this was a good time to exit and they couldn’t hand it off to a better company than Equinix</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our strategies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the culture </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s an exit that the shareholders of MainOne are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Judith Gardiner:</strong> And I would add to Funke’s point that when we are looking at potential targets to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> put an awful lot of effort into the assessment of the management team, the assets, the strategy that the company has to make sure that it’s going to fit with ours and also plug into our platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for us, MainOne was without a doubt, the best match for us on the market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other thing is that we see the connectivity, the cable Funke started many years ago from Lagos to Portugal, as a key differentiator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we’re also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encouraged by the amount of land that MainOne has for expansion, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crucial to be able to expand in the market and extend our platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Talking about Equinix and your plans for Africa, we see other global players such as recently Facebook and Google doing stuff with their 2Africa and Equiano subsea cables. Do you see any threat to the work you’ve done at MainOne?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> Not at all. One of the studies Google did on the impact of their submarine cables that they had built in other parts of the world is actually when they start building in a region, they actually buy more than they’re able to provide themselves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we see the entrance of global platforms and other players with their own direct investments into our market not a sign of competition but as a sign of the growing size and significance of our market and the need for greater participation by these players</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the inside of the business, these companies are not building enough infrastructure for them not to need to buy from others, not to need to extend the services to different locations, and not need diversity from their networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So yes, there is more interest in our market because our market has become more significant. Yes, some of the interests and the investments will compete with us. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the growth of our market. That means a bigger business opportunity or addressable market for MainOne.</span></p>
<p><strong>How does Equinix see competition playing out with large data centers, such as Amazon in South Africa and Africa Data Centres?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>JG:</strong> Amazon is one of our largest customers. Amazon builds its own data centers, which tend to be for its own use. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Amazon also takes very large space with Equinix around the world for cloud on-ramps for their compute, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any data that needs to flow around the world, they will tend to use an Equinix or a colocation company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So, yes, they have their own data centers in South Africa. But, I would expect that we’re going to see the global players coming into MainOne now that we are extending our Equinix platform.</span></p>
<p><strong>How does this acquisition bring more business into Nigeria and Africa markets?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an extension of what Judith said, global players are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interested in Africa because we’re on the digital map. Now we have more users on the internet, their consumption of digital services and applications is growing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how much of that value chain is being provided from within Africa, and Equinix is coming into Africa to help us deepen the investments to host cloud service providers and enterprises here who want to be a part of this global fabric to enable global business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in and of itself is a growth strategy that enables us to capture more market share and provide services as companies continue to digitize, as more users continue to get access to broadband services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It enables us to provide more of what they need, which is a growth strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it also enables the global service providers as they seek to reach more of the African population to leverage the platforms we have within the region, which we will be growing, including building out the data center in Sagamu, which is more investment, more business, more jobs in Africa to serve the needs of the African digital population and for the rest of the world that wants to engage with Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>JG:</strong> Our acquisitions tend to be demand-driven by our customers, our international customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is very much one of those where our customers have been saying to us for quite some time, ‘When do you want to go to West Africa, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need you to go there because we want to extend our own businesses there and we want to do that on your platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that is the reason that this is one of the highest value tech IT industry acquisitions this year in West Africa, because it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an essential part of our new market strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>I wouldn’t say just West Africa, it’s probably the whole of Africa. I’m not sure there’s any bigger acquisition made this year. In fact, it’s one of the rare exits to have happened on the continent and the first major one from a female founder. How does it feel to be in both exclusive clubs of founders that have exited their companies in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> Well, I am delighted. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a Herculean effort, but not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of myself, but the whole team, my shareholders, the investors who wrote the check, who provided the governance, the environment, the market, the consumers who have embraced the services we have and have walked with us through the years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I’m also gratified that our exit is coming in form of access to a global leader strategic in our space that is coming to the continent for the first time to invest and help us grow the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we’ll ensure that there’s good alignment so that the company, the team, the investments, the customer base, the product sets can all continue to grow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as a female founder, I hope that to other female founders and to young women who are considering careers in tech or starting a business, this demonstrates to them that [making an exit] </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is indeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> achievable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a good example for them and it’s a good motivator. So to that extent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being a female founder has significance. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the business, you know, it’s not gender-specific. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a great exit of a great company that a lot of people have worked at to make successful. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to the credit of Equinix that they have identified by and they’ve chosen to take the bold step and come into the continent with us. And we look forward to the continued growth of digital infrastructure in Africa as a result.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, the U.S. Agency for International Development developed the “<a href="https://www.usaid.gov/npi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Partnerships Initiative</a>” (NPI) to build a “safer, healthier and more prosperous” world for people everywhere. NPI simplifies access to USAID resources and makes it easier for partners to bring forward their ideas and innovation.</p>
<p>In simple terms, NPI helps USAID collaborate with local nonprofits on humanitarian work by identifying new partners and sources of funding, streamlining access to resources, promoting local leadership and providing training.</p>
<p>However, the NPI legislation, as it stands, has its limitations. For-profit entities are excluded from receiving NPI funding, and many of the small business set-asides created by Congress have been co-opted by industry insiders and ex-contractors. Additionally, many of the breakthrough innovations that we need in global development have been spearheaded by for-profit entities, including those located in low- and middle-income countries.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244192" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In 2016, Premise had its first opportunity to work with USAID, and it was a proud moment. That year, USAID — through a <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/grandchallenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Challenge</a> grant — asked us to design tasks for our <a href="https://www.premise.com/contributors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contributors</a> as a way to identify and destroy mosquito breeding sites. More than 7,000 citizens participated in three cities, showing Colombian authorities through mapping where the most high-impact areas were located.</p>
<p>Since then, our platform has been used by over 20 USAID-funded projects to get data-driven answers to their questions about activity design and evaluation. And with the introduction of Unlock Aid — a coalition of innovative organizations uniting to drive structural change in global development, of which <a href="https://www.premise.com/premise-joins-other-innovators-to-form-unlock-aid-disrupting-an-antiquated-international-development-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we are a founding member</a> — we continue to work with USAID to push for legislation like the NPI.</p>
<h2>New Partnerships Initiative legislation</h2>
<p>With the hope of changing the way USAID does business, Senators Tim Kaine and Marco Rubio <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/565271-senators-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-expand-foreign-aid-partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the New Partners Initiative (NPI) legislation in July 2021. The bill would authorize $250 million over the course of four years to make it easier for new entities to receive foreign aid funds and implement programs.</p>
<p>The NPI legislation would result in several positive changes. Although NPI was founded in 2019, the 2021 legislation codifies significant funding for new and underutilized partners. It also directs USAID to use solicitations that lower barriers to entry. The legislation also directs USAID to simplify reporting and requires USAID to submit an annual report to Congress detailing how it implemented the NPI program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlock Aid and Premise support this legislation with the caveat that it should also allow for-profit entities to be “new partners” &#8212; not just nonprofits.</p>
<p>In November, Administrator Samantha Power gave a <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/speeches/nov-4-2021-administrator-samantha-power-new-vision-global-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speech</a> at Georgetown University regarding a new vision for global development that includes for-profit companies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Inclusive of this country&#8217;s diverse talent and dynamic private sector; inclusive of the voices of those whom we are privileged to serve alongside; tackling problems abroad in a way that is responsive to our partners, that will save lives, and that will advance American interests and values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Disruption in the industry</h2>
<p>It is difficult for tech companies to work with USAID because commercial business models do not fit how USAID operates. The biggest hurdle is that USAID frequently does not consider whether its objectives can be achieved with existing commercial products and services. Each project is custom-built for its objective by an implementing partner that is paid for implementing it, not for results. USAID could increase the scale of its impact if it were to rely more on products and services that have a use outside of just the international development space.</p>
<p>There is precedent for this in other parts of the U.S. government. Palantir and SpaceX went to federal court (and won) over being unlawfully excluded from competing in their respective fields in the government sector.</p>
<p>Both companies made the same argument: The government must consider whether commercially available products can meet their needs before building new custom products and programs.</p>
<p>When SpaceX filed its suit back in 2014, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/elon-musks-spacex-sues-government-protest-military-launch-monopoly-n89926" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>, “Musk emphasized that the suit wasn’t asking the federal government to award the launches to SpaceX rather than ULA. ‘We’re just protesting as saying that they should be competed,’ he said.”</p>
<p>Similarly, when Palantir won its lawsuit against the Army, Palantir’s attorney, Hamish Hume, said a judge in the Court of Federal Claims issued an injunction on the procurement, forcing the Army to consider commercial offerings such as the one Palantir would like to offer. The court confirmed the injunction but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>“This is a victory not just for Palantir but for taxpayers and our whole procurement system,” Hume <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/peter-thiels-palantir-scores-a-win-in-fight-for-lucrative-army-contract/2016/10/31/7e0682fa-9f8a-11e6-a44d-cc2898cfab06_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. He said the decision would have a far-reaching impact that would “make it more appealing for innovators like Palantir to come to Washington and compete for government business.”</p>
<p>Innovators working to advance a free, peaceful and prosperous world are seeking a similar opportunity in the international development space &#8212; a shot at leveraging commercial products and services to increase development impact.</p>
<h2>Thinking beyond the system</h2>
<p>The New Partnerships Initiative can be an innovative avenue for USAID to increase its impact around the world. But the initiative can’t ignore the many opportunities presented by for-profit institutions, not just non-governmental organizations, that are able to bring significant investment to the table. There are far too many innovative solutions that can be scaled for the NPI to keep for-profit companies out of the loop, and we hope that the USAID sees the many possibilities removing this stipulation could allow for.</p>
<p>It rapidly became clear that the only way to change an entire industry, the way SpaceX and Palantir did, is to involve a much more comprehensive range of “stakeholders” in the effort, including governments, NGOs and members of civil society.</p>
<p>If NPI expands to work with tech companies, they can provide USAID with existing tools and solutions. Opening up NPI to for-profit businesses is the first step in doing so.</p>
