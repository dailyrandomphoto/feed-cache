										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung is set to introduce a whole bunch of new products, starting today at <strong>7 AM PT/10 AM ET.</strong> I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/what-to-expect-from-samsungs-next-unpacked/">wrote a whole bunch of words about what to expect</a> from the company’s latest Unpacked event. It’s a long list and a kind of return to the pre-pandemic days, back before companies started taking liberties by holding separate events for all their new products.</p>
<p>You can stream the proceedings here:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7ixp-XwqGI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Here’s the short bulleted version, based on a deluge of leaks over the past several weeks and months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Galaxy Z Fold 3</li>
<li>Galaxy Z Flip 3</li>
<li>Galaxy Watch 4</li>
<li>Galaxy Buds 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Samsung has more or less confirmed the first three already. The company gave some substantial details on its forthcoming foldables. We’ve also heard a good deal about the new smartwatch &#8212; from a software standpoint, at least. Both Samsung and Google have been discussing their upcoming joint software platform.</p>
<p>More info on all of the above, soon. And perhaps even a surprise or two? Perhaps. We’ll be following along with the latest.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trust wants to give smaller businesses the same advantages that large enterprises have when marketing on digital and social media platforms.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.trust.co/">Trust</a> wants to give smaller businesses the same advantages that large enterprises have when marketing on digital and social media platforms. It came out of beta with $9 million in seed funding from Lerer Hippeau, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Upfront Ventures and Upper90.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company was started in 2019 by a group of five Snap alums working in various roles within Snap’s revenue product strategy business. They were building tools for businesses to fund success with digital marketing, but kept hearing from customers about the advantage big advertisers had over smaller ones — the ability to receive good payment terms, credit lines, as well as data and advice.</p>
<p>Aiming to flip the script on that, the group created Trust, which is a card and business community to help digital businesses navigate the ever-changing pricing models to market online, receive the same incentives larger advertisers get and make the best decision of where their marketing dollars will reach the furthest.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188301" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188301" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188301" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png" alt="" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Trust-images-for-use.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188301" class="wp-caption-text">Trust dashboard</p></div></p>
<p>Trust does this in a few ways: Its card, built in partnership with Stripe, enables businesses to increase their buying power by up to 20 times and have 45 days to make payments on their marketing investments, CEO James Borow told TechCrunch. Then as part of its community, companies share knowledge of marketing buys and data insights typically reserved for larger advertisers. Users even receive news via their dashboard around their specific marketing strategy, he added.</p>
<p>“The ad platforms are a wall of gardens, and most people don’t know what is going on inside, so our customers work together to see what is going on,” Borow said.</p>
<p>The growth of e-commerce is pushing more digital marketing investments, providing opportunity for Trust to be a huge business, Borow said. <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/quarterly-online-sales/">E-commerce sales in the U.S.</a> grew by 39% in the first quarter, while <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-ad-opportunities-and-capital-spur-investor-interest-in-ad-tech-11625220000">digital advertising spend</a> is forecasted to increase 25% this year to $191 billion. Meanwhile, Google, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter all recently reported rapid growth in their year-over-year advertising revenues, Borow said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will go toward increasing the company’s headcount.</p>
<p>“We have active customers on the platform, so we wanted to ramp up hiring as soon as we went into general release,” he added. “We are leaving beta with 25 businesses and a few hundred on our waitlist.”</p>
<p>That list will soon grow. In addition to the funding round, Trust announced a strategic partnership with social shopping e-commerce platform Verishop. The company’s 3,500 merchants will receive priority access to the Trust card and community, Borow said.</p>
<p>Andrea Hippeau, partner at Lerer Hippeau, said she knew Borow from being an investor in his previous advertising company Shift, which was acquired by Brand Networks in 2015.</p>
<p>When Borow contacted Lerer about Trust, Hippeau said this was the kind of offering that would be applicable to the firm’s portfolio, which has many direct-to-consumer brands, and knew marketing was a huge pain point for them.</p>
<p>“Digital marketing is important to all brands, but it is also a black box that you put marketing dollars into, but don’t know what you get,” she said. “We hear this across our portfolio — they spend a lot of money on ad platforms, yet are treated like mom-and-pop companies in terms of credit. When in reality Casper is outspending other companies by five times. Trust understands how important marketing dollars are and gives them terms that are financially better.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Impossible sent me a tube of its plant-based sausage to try ahead of today’s news. As an aside, the big box with several frozen packs inside was maybe not the most efficient way to send it, but I don’t know, maybe there’s no great way to send frozen foodstuffs. Someone feel free to disrupt that industry at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>That said, I’ve got no complaints about the contents. I’ve tossed the sausage (Notsage? Fauxsage?) into a couple of pasta dishes and am currently defrosting what’s left for dinner tonight. As someone who hasn’t eaten pork or beef for probably a decade and a half, I’m probably not the best judge of how close they’ve come to the actual thing, but I dunno, it tasted pretty much what I remember sausage tasting like.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188358" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188358" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188358" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ImpossibleSausage_Retail.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188358" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Impossible</p></div></p>
<p>The product is Impossible’s follow-up to its popular Burger, introduced earlier at a number of diners across the U.S. It’s also gone on sale at around 200 coffee shops around Hong Kong. Today, the company is announcing retail availability for the product, as it arrives in a number of major supermarket chains. The list includes, Kroger, Ralphs, King Soopers, Fred Meyer, Safeway, Albertsons, Wegmans, Stop &amp; Shop, Hannaford, Giant Martin’s, Giant Food, Sprouts Farmers Market and Heinen’s.</p>
<p>The product is entirely plant-based and contains no cholesterol or trans fats, with nine grams of fat, including four grams of saturated fat per a 56 gram serving. That also includes seven grams of protein and zero grams of pigs. Impossible lists the number of pigs killed for food each year in the U.S., but I’ll save you that and just say…it’s a lot of pigs. Americans eat a lot of pigs.</p>

<p>The product also uses 79% less water, 41% less land and emits significantly less greenhouse gas than pork production. I can also attest to the fact that it cooks quite well in a skillet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[The company provides software, services and infrastructure to small businesses so they can scale online.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cart.com/">Cart.com</a>, a Houston-based company providing end-to-end e-commerce services, brought in its third funding round this year, this time a $98 million Series B round to bring its total funding to $143 million.</p>
<p>Oak HC/FT led the new round of funding and was joined by PayPal Ventures, Clearco, G9 Ventures, Mercury Fund, Valedor Partners and Arsenal Growth. Strategic investors in the Series B include HeyDay CEO Sebastian Rymarz and Casper CEO Philip Krim. This new round follows a <a href="https://houston.innovationmap.com/2021-q2-houston-startup-funding-2653704803.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1">$25 million Series A round</a>, led by Mercury and Arsenal in July, and a $20 million seed round from Bearing Ventures.</p>
<p>Cart.com CEO Omair Tariq, who was previously an executive at Home Depot and COO of Blinds.com, co-founded the company in September 2020 with Jim Jacobson, former CEO of RTIC Outdoors.</p>
<p>Tariq told TechCrunch that the company provides software, services and infrastructure to small businesses so they can scale online. Cart.com is taking the best parts of selling direct-to-consumer on marketplaces like Amazon and Shopify to create value for brands. Tariq said he is pioneering the term “e-commerce-as-a-service” to bring together under one platform a suite of business tools like store software, marketing, fulfillment, payments and customer service.</p>
<p>“We see the power of having an interconnected platform,” Tariq said. “There also needs to be a hybrid between selling direct-to-consumer on Amazon and Shopify for companies that don’t have the money to pay for a percentage of their sales and receive no access to customers or data, and needing 20 different plug-ins that are not connected.”</p>
<p>Cart.com went after the new funding after seeing validation of its idea: brands coming to them wanting more products and services, which led to acquisitions. The company has acquired seven companies so far, including — AmeriCommerce, SpaceCraft Brands and, more recently, Dumont Project and Sauceda Industries. Tariq is planning for another three or four by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In addition, it received inbound interest from strategic investors, like Oak and PayPal, which Tariq said was going to enable the company “to be more successful faster.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Allen Miller, principal at Oak HC/FT, said after spending time with Tariq to understand his vision about Cart.com’s software, payments and services, he felt that the company was doing something that didn’t exist in today’s commerce infrastructure.</p>
<p>He said that Cart.com is well positioned to help companies, like those with $1 million in sales, stay focused on growing the business while Cart.com stitches together all of the tools for them to operate in the background.</p>
<p>“It’s a unique offering to merchants that has a high value proposition,” Miller said. “The vision and drive that Omair and Jim have, along with an inspiring mission they want to achieve — to be brand-centric and help the next generation of merchants. These guys also have a good playbook on finding companies and teams to acquire, as well as handling the post M&amp;A to have everyone on one platform.”</p>
<p>The new financing will enable Cart.com to further invest in technology development and to increase headcount by at least 15 times, with plans to go from fewer than two dozen employees to more than 300 team members by the end of the year. The company has nearly 70 jobs posted on its website for positions in engineering, technology, digital marketing and e-commerce. Tariq also expects half of the funds to go toward more acquisitions.</p>
<p>Cart.com currently serves over 2,000 e-commerce brands, including GNC, Haymaker Coffee, KeHE and Gravatiq, and processes more than $700 million in gross merchandise value per year. The company saw revenue increase 400% since the platform’s launch in November.</p>
<p>In addition, the company has nine fulfillment centers across the country, and is increasing its access to reach 80% of the U.S. population with two-day shipping, Tariq added.</p>
<p>“We are giving the power back to brands by giving them what they need to operate e-commerce,” he said. “There are still a few pieces to fill in so brands have a unified experience, but with us, they can add fulfilment, marketing or customer conversion tools with the click of a couple of buttons.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's remote hiring technology enable restaurants to fill last-minute drive-thru or cashier shifts.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Will Clem knows all too well about restaurant workers not showing up for a shift. At least one person would have car trouble or need to stay home with sick children, and it became a common occurrence on the weekends for the co-founder of Memphis Meats and owner of Baby Jacks BBQ in Memphis.</p>
<p>Needing to fill a shift one Friday night, Clem decided to prop his laptop in the drive-thru lane of one of his restaurants and took orders from home by remoting into the system. No one noticed that he wasn’t actually taking orders from the kitchen itself. Thus came the idea for <a href="https://www.biteninja.com/">Bite Ninja</a>, a remote hiring technology platform for restaurants.</p>
<p>Clem connected with Orin Wilson to start the company in 2020 and worked for a year on the technology before launching it in March. Today, the company announced $675,000 in pre-seed funding led by Y Combinator, AgFunder and Manta Ray.</p>
<p>With many restaurants unable to find workers as a result of the global pandemic, Clem and Wilson wanted to build a technology that would enable restaurants to go back to normal operating hours, or even reopen their stores. At the same time, the workers, or “Ninjas” as they are referred to, can work the drive-thru or counter for a lunch or dinner rush shift from home, but appear on-screen to customers via menu boards, Wilson said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188449" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188449" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188449" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png" alt="" width="1000" height="749" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image13.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188449" class="wp-caption-text">Bite Ninja drive-thru. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bite Ninja</p></div></p>
<p>“When a restaurant is slammed, you need an army of people to work the rush, but it is not reasonable to ask them to get in their uniform and get in their cars, last-minute, to clock in for just an hour or two,” he added. “They have control of their schedule and can pick the right shift for them. It is so popular that we typically have five to 10 people bidding on each shift.”</p>
<p>Bite Ninja is providing a better experience and reaches potential workers that would not necessarily have an interest in performing fast food work. Many of the 3,000 Ninjas already working with the company are stay-at-home moms and retirees with customer service experience, but who can’t physically come into a store, Clem said. In addition, the company is working with the Nurse-Family Partnership to help women get back into the workforce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company initially ran three pilot programs and has expanded services to curbside and front cashier stations. The funding will enable Bite Ninja to scale initiatives, hire additional software engineers and prepare for a rollout at national food chains.</p>
<p>Since launching earlier this year, Bite Ninja is already being used in a few thousand stores.</p>
<p>Manuel Gonzalez, partner at AgFunder, said restaurants are a big part of entrepreneurship, but the pandemic forced more than <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/26/restaurants-bars-closed-2020-jobs-lost-how-many-have-closed-us-covid-pandemic-stimulus-unemployment/">110,000 of them out of business</a>.</p>
<p>“Bite Ninja’s solution is one that decreases costs to restaurant owners, but increases the income of the worker,” he said. “It also helps entrepreneurs and the community because restaurants are important for economic, cultural, community and social points of view.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most people probably don&#8217;t realize just how much our devices are time driven, whether it&#8217;s your phone, your laptop or a network server. For the most part, time keeping has been an esoteric chore, taken care of by a limited number of hardware manufacturers. While these devices served their purpose, a couple of Facebook engineers decided there had to be a better way. So they built a new more accurate time keeping device that fits on a PCI Express (PCIe) card, and contributed it to the Open Compute Project <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/projects/time-appliances-project-tap-incubation">as an open source project</a>.</p>
<p>At a basic level, says Olag Obleukhov, a production engineer at Facebook, it&#8217;s simply pinging this time-keeping server to make sure each device is reporting the same time. &#8220;Almost every single electronic device today uses NTP &#8212; Network Time Synchronization Protocol &#8212; which you have on your phone, on your watch, on your laptop, everywhere, and they all connect to these NTP servers where they just go and say, &#8216;what time is it&#8217; and the NTP server provides the time,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Before Facebook developed a new way of doing this, there were basically two ways to check the time. If you were a developer, you probably used something like Facebook.com as a time checking mechanism, but a company like Facebook, working at massive scale, needed something that worked even when there wasn&#8217;t an internet connection. Companies running data centers have a hardware device called Stratum One, which is a big box that sits in the data center, and has no other job than acting as the time keeper.</p>
<p>Because these time-keeping boxes were built by a handful of companies over years, they were solid and worked, but it was hard to get new features. What&#8217;s more, companies like Facebook couldn&#8217;t control the boxes because of their proprietary nature. Obleukhov and his colleague research scientist, Ahmad Byagowi began to attack the problem by looking for a way to create these devices by building a PCIe card with off-the-shelf parts that you could stick into any PC with an open slot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188442" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188442" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188442" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?w=680" alt="Facebook time keeping PCI card" width="680" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg 1921w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=768,572 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=680,506 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=1536,1143 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CD21_391-Eng-Blog-Facebook-Time-Appliances-diagram-11-v2.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188442" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>They literally drew the first design on an iPad and began to build that vision into a prototype. A time appliance relies on a couple of key components: a GNSS receiver and what&#8217;s called a high stability oscillator. <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/08/11/open-source/time-appliance/">In a blog post describing the project</a>, Obleukhov and Byagowi explained the role of these two parts:</p>
<p>&#8220;It all starts from a GNSS receiver that provides the time of day (ToD) as well as the 1 pulse per second (PPS). When the receiver is backed by a high-stability oscillator (e.g., an atomic clock or an oven-controlled crystal oscillator), it can provide time that is nanosecond-accurate. The time is delivered across the network via an off-the-shelf network card,&#8221; the two engineers wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It all sounds pretty basic when described like this, but it&#8217;s actually quite complex and perhaps that&#8217;s why nobody had ever thought to attack the problem in this way, simply accepting that the current methods of determining time worked fine. But these two Facebook engineers were annoyed by the limitations of these approaches and decided to build something better themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of it came from frustration. We were frustrated with whatever exists in the market, and we needed certain features like security features to maintain different things and monitor what&#8217;s going on. And we had to always ask the vendors [for these new features] and every time a request would take like six months to one year, and [it wouldn&#8217;t be exactly what we wanted] and we had to change things all the time, so that&#8217;s why we had to basically make this from scratch in this way,&#8221; Obleukhov said.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8YVZ0ZhXi7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/24/when-it-comes-to-facebook-scale-you-can-throw-out-the-rulebook/">When It Comes To Facebook Scale, You Can Throw Out The Rulebook</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;When It Comes To Facebook Scale, You Can Throw Out The Rulebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/24/when-it-comes-to-facebook-scale-you-can-throw-out-the-rulebook/embed/#?secret=8YVZ0ZhXi7" data-secret="8YVZ0ZhXi7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One thing that made it possible to put a time keeping device on a PCIe card was the advances in miniaturization of the atomic clock/oscillator. So when you combine the timing of their frustration with the current capabilities of the technologies, they realized they could do this themselves if they dedicated themselves to the task.</p>
<p>As the design began coming together, the engineers decided to make it flexible to enable engineers to play off the basic design and drop in whatever components met their needs. Some might need highly sophisticated expensive parts, but others could get away with much cheaper parts, depending on their requirements.</p>
<p>They also decided early on to open source the design process, and to involve the Open Compute Project so that other companies and engineers could contribute to the design. &#8220;It was actually going to be open source from the get-go, and the reason for that is we needed to have community support. I didn&#8217;t want it to be just one in-house project and let&#8217;s say if I lost interest or the businesses lost interest [it could go away]. I wanted this to [keep going] regardless [of what happened],&#8221; Obleukhov said.</p>
<p>Today there are a dozen vendors involved in the project and a number of cards out there including the one designed by these engineers, as well as a commercial offering from <a href="https://www.orolia.com/about-the-atomic-reference-time-card-art-card/">Orilia</a>, but the goal is to continue improving the design, and by making it open source, the community of companies and engineers involved will continue to improve it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">US cybersecurity firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nortonlifelock/">NortonLifeLock</a> has confirmed it is acquiring British rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/avast/">Avast</a> in order to create a global consumer security powerhouse.</p>
<p>The agreement, which comes just weeks after both companies confirmed they were in advanced discussions regarding a possible combination of the two brands, will see Avast stockholders receive cash and shares that value the deal at $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion. That makes this merger the third-largest cybersecurity acquisition of all time, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">Thoma Bravo‘s $12.3 billion takeover of Proofpoint</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/14/why-broadcom-is-looking-to-aging-enterprise-software-in-a-softening-chip-market/">Broadcom’s $10.7 billion acquisition of Symantec’s enterprise business</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>NortonLifeLock, formed in 2019 as a spin-off from Symantec following the latter, says the deal will create an industry-leading consumer cyber safety business, unlock approximately $280 million of annual gross cost synergies, and dramatically expand its user numbers thanks to Avast&#8217;s 435 million-strong customer base.</p>
<p>“With this combination, we can strengthen our cyber safety platform and make it available to more than 500 million users,” NortonLifeLock CEO Vincent Pilette said in a statement. “This transaction is a huge step forward for consumer cyber safety and will ultimately enable us to achieve our vision to protect and empower people to live their digital lives safely.”</p>
<p>Avast, founded in 1988, focuses on cybersecurity software for consumers and small and medium-sized businesses and describes itself as one of the largest security companies. However, the company has not been without controversy during its near-25-year history; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/avast-shuts-down-marketing-analytics-subsidiary-jumpshot-amid-controversy-over-selling-user-data/">Avast was forced to shut down its marketing technology subsidiary Jumpshot</a> last year after it was found to be peddling web browsing data that could be linked to individual users.</p>
<p>Once NortonLifeLock&#8217;s acquisition of the company is complete, Pilette will remain CEO of the new business, while Avast CEO Ondrej Vlcek will become president and join the board, the companies said.</p>
<p>“Our talented teams will have better opportunities to innovate and develop enhanced solutions and services, with improved capabilities from access to superior data insights,&#8221; Vlcek said. &#8220;Through our well-established brands, greater geographic diversification and access to a larger global user base, the combined businesses will be poised to access the significant growth opportunity that exists worldwide.”</p>
<p>The final name of the merged company has yet to be determined, but NortonLifeLock has confirmed it will be dual headquartered in the Czech Republic and Tempe, Arizona, and will seek to cut its number of employees from 5,000 workers to around 4,000 over the next two years. The combined company will be listed on the Nasdaq, rather than Avast&#8217;s current London Stock Exchange home.</p>
<p>The deal, which has been confirmed just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/nortonlifelock-acquires-avira-in-360m-all-cash-deal-8-months-after-avira-was-acquired-for-180m/">NortonLifeLock bought free antivirus provider Avira for £360 million</a>, is expected to close in mid-2022.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Students around the country are about to return to school after the summer holiday, and they’re doing so at a time when both coronavirus transmission and the effects of climate change are mounting. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/hopskipdrive-raises-22-million-to-focus-on-school-transportation-70-percent-of-revenue-is-enterprise/">HopSkipDrive</a>, a rideshare platform for kids, had to let go much of its staff amid school lockdowns. Now, the company is betting that demand for its rideshare service will increase as parents send their kids back to school. To help fund that growth and expand into 30 new markets over the next year and a half, HopSkipRide raised $25 million in a Series C.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are also continuing to invest in our route optimization software, which just helps districts get more efficient and greener,” Joanna McFarland, CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. “By reducing overall fleet size, we play a significant role in the overall acceleration of the electrification of the entire yellow bus network.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McFarland also said HopSkipDrive plans to use the new cash injection, which came from Energy Impact Partners, Keyframe Capital, FirstMark Capital and 1776 Ventures, to invest in electrification initiatives that will spur the company’s goal of helping its CareDrivers transition to electric vehicles affordably via partnerships with OEMs. Currently, hybrid or electric vehicles make up 19% of the startup&#8217;s CareDriver network vehicles, which are owned by gig economy workers similar to Uber or Lyft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike those rideshare giants, however, HopSkipDrive&#8217;s drivers have over five years of caregiving experience, and as a result, are predominantly women who enjoy flexible work schedules and the ability to contribute to the ridesharing economy without driving sketchy drunk people around at night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HopSkipDrive is among a small handful of emerging startups dedicated to modernizing the public school bus system. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/zum-wins-150m-from-san-francisco-schools-to-modernize-and-electrify-student-transport/">Zūm</a>, another student transportation service, has a similar mission statement with a different path to market. Whereas Zūm takes over the entire transportation system and even has lofty goals of acquiring 10,000 electric buses by 2025, HopSkipDrive focuses more on meeting the transportation needs that don’t neatly fit on a school bus or on a school route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think prior to Covid, we were really seen as an alternative transportation solution for districts, so helping with individualized transport solutions for students with special needs, for students experiencing homelessness or in foster care, and that’s the core service we offer today,” said McFarland. “But as we’ve seen during Covid, all of these trends have only been accelerated and districts have had to deal with a lot more of that than they ever have in the past, but they’re also suffering from a severe bus driver shortage that is reaching a critical point. So anytime you have less than 12 kids on a school bus, we are a cost effective solution, and we are also a much cleaner solution.”</span></p>
<p>HopSkipDrive&#8217;s more complementary approach has helped the company acquire contracts with over 300 districts in nine states plus Washington, D.C. During the pandemic, the startup signed on about 150 new contracts, and this year has renewed 100% of its existing contracts, many of them with price increases, according to McFarland.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as Delta variant cases continue to rise to record levels, schools are planning to reopen, which means services like HopSkipDrive’s will be essential. McFarland says the company has Covid SafeRide standards, which include policies around sanitization and mask-wearing, as well as anonymous exposure tracing via the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see school closures again like we did in 2020,” said McFarland. “I think the tide has turned where everybody realizes that the cost of keeping kids out of school was far greater than the risk of them attending school in person.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ChargePoint has made its second acquisition since going public in March, purchasing European electric fleet management company ViriCiti for €75 million ($88 million) in cash. The news comes just a few weeks after the EV charging network operator announced the purchase of European charging software company has·to·be.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/chargepoint-to-buy-european-charging-software-startup-for-295m/">the has·to·be buy</a>, this newer deal will beef up ChargePoint’s portfolio of hardware and vehicle management software for electric fleet customers, as well as add another 2,500 networked ports and 3,500 connected vehicles to its growing portfolio. ViriCiti customers include Chicago Transit Authority, San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority, British public transportation company Arriva and Berlin’s main public transport service Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe.</p>

<p>Beyond this customer base, ChargePoint CEO Pasquale Romano told TechCrunch the acquisition of ViriCiti will give the company access to a much larger software feature set for customers beyond ChargePoint’s core offerings of charger management and vehicle charger scheduling, like battery health monitoring, vehicle operations data and greater vehicle telematics capabilities.</p>
<p>“It’s really important for us here to make it easy for fleets to electrify and this [acquisition] is all about making us continually having the most complete offering for fleets,” Romano said.</p>
<p>ChargePoint operates the largest vehicle charging network in North America, with more than 115,000 charging points globally. The company also offers customers access to another 113,000 public charging spots through network roaming agreements. While the company might be best known for this extensive branded network, it also has a cloud subscription platform, as well as a considerable commercial and fleet division. The company went public in March after merging with blank-check company Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation.</p>

<p>Some of ViriCiti’s services, like battery health monitoring, could be applicable for residential customers, or even simply for fleet customers that let employees take home or use a company vehicle full-time. “If you have vehicles that go home with the driver […] it would stand to reason that what you need to do in the take-home scenario is, your infrastructure needs to look like a logical extension of the infrastructure that you would have in your depots. So we&#8217;re pleasantly surprised at how much commercial and residential relevance there is.”</p>
<p>Crucially, ChargePoint will also be absorbing ViriCiti’s more than 50-person workforce, a whole team of mostly software engineers that will transfer their expertise to the new company. “If you just want to see evidence of where our mindset is, look at how many software engineers [are] in the sum total of those two acquisitions,” Romano said. “It&#8217;s the majority of both of those companies’ staffs are engineers, and they&#8217;re all software in general […] You can see where our focus is in terms of in terms of investment.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvine, California-based Acorns announced in May its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/acorns-spac-listing-depicts-a-consumer-fintech-business-with-a-saasy-revenue-mix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intent to go public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by merging with publicly traded special purpose acquisition company Pioneer Merger Corp. The SPAC values the fintech company at $2.2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan joins Acorns from Twitter, where he led corporate finance and FP&amp;A. Prior to Twitter, he held executive positions at STX Entertainment and DreamWorks Animation, where he served as the company’s Deputy CFO. Sullivan has also held various roles at AT&amp;T.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acorns CEO Noah Kerner told TechCrunch that he was drawn to the executive&#8217;s experience in subscriptions, family and in “high-growth” technology as he thought about the consumer fintech’s long-term roadmap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those are obviously all really relevant to what we&#8217;re doing at Acorns,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2012 inception, the company has evolved its offering to also include investment services, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/acorns-scoops-up-pillar-a-fintech-backed-by-kleiner-perkins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debt management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a product aimed at children, Acorns Kids. It has more than 4 million subscribers that have invested nearly $10 billion through its app. The company touts nearly 99% monthly retention, and has the ambitious goal of reaching 10 million subscribers by 2025, according to Kerner. This year, he is projecting 60% to 70% CAGR growth.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Sullivan believes that his experience of more than two decades of working for several public companies in various roles will be valuable to Acorns in the process of going public.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told TechCrunch he was drawn to the company’s “mission-driven approach to put responsible tools of wealth in everyone&#8217;s hands by making investing easy and accessible to a large portion of the market that basically is underserved from the financial services industry, at least in the traditional sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it&#8217;s uniquely positioned as a high-growth business and also an interesting space that sits at the cross-section of fintech services and social responsibility,” Sullivan added. “As an industry leader with over 4 million subscribers with a really large addressable market, I think Acorns has an opportunity to be one of the most impactful companies in the space.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along that vein, Acorns launched </span><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/financial-professionals/investment-strategies/sustainable?cid=ppc%3AQ221Sustainable%3AMULTI%3ABrand%3APMS%3AUS%3ANA&amp;gclid=69a83feaee6b1690f74c5ef83de5cff8&amp;gclsrc=3p.ds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESG portfolios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also known as sustainable portfolios, that are powered by Blackrock shares. (ESG stands for E</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nvironmental, Social, &amp; Governance)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kerner said the move was in part driven by customer demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategy there is really to allow our customers to not just invest in themselves, but also in a better planet,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The role is not a newly created one for the popular saving and investing app. Jasmine Lee has served a dual role as chief operating officer and CFO, and helped prep Acorns for the public market. She will now focus on executing Acorn’s strategic plan and overseeing the day to day operations as COO, the company said.</span></p>

<p class="p3">For sales representatives, commissions are source of motivation—and frustration, too. Commission structures are often complex, and become even more labyrinthine as companies grow. “There is a standard fee, then there’s an implementation fee, there could be a multiplier bonus, there could be accelerators when you reach your quota and get higher quota numbers,” explained Siva Rajamani, the co-founder and chief executive officer of no-code sales commission automation platform <a href="https://www.everstage.com/">Everstage</a>.

They can also use Everstage to forecast the potential commissions form their deals pipeline, giving them incentive to close more sales. The platform uses a modular system, so as companies grow, they can add more automated commission calculations without having to code anything.</p>
<p class="p3">Founded in 2020, the platform’s early customers include notable SaaS companies like Chargebee, Postman and Lamdatest. Everstage announced today that it has raised a $1.7 million seed round led by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/3one4-capital-launches-100m-fund-to-back-early-stage-startups-in-india/"> 3One4 Capital</a>. Angel investors included Rippling co-founder Prasanna Sankar; Chargebee co-founders Krish Subramanian and Rajaraman Santhanam; Freshworks chief revenue officer Sidharth Malik; Conga chief technology officer Koti Reddy; <a href="http://Ally.io"><span class="s1">Ally.io</span></a> CEO Vetri Vellore; and RFPIO CEO Ganesh Shankar. The company is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, with an office in Chennai, India.</p>
<p class="p3">Before starting Everstage with Vivek Suriyamoorthy, the startup’s chief technology officer, Rajamani served as the head of business SaaS provider Freshworks’ global revenue operations team, working closely with sales representatives. During his tenure, Freshworks’ annual recurring revenue grew from $30 million a year to $300 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Rajamani told TechCrunch that a lot of early-stage startups put more than 10% of their budget toward commissions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">“Commissions obviously motivate and drive performance from these teams, but what started as a way to motivate gradually became a point of distrust because none of these folks had visibility into how they’re getting paid,” he said. “Plans got complex, and pretty much any salesperson you speak to at these companies will say they have their own shadow accounting.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Shadow accounting” means salespeople keep their own records of the deals they close and calculate commissions by themselves. But the process can be tedious, especially if their calculations don’t match financial teams. This problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, because salespeople can’t walk over to the finance department and ask about the status of their commissions.</p>
<p class="p3">Sometimes this results in high turnover as frustrated salespeople leave for companies that offer them more clarity about their earnings potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“People want to chose companies that are very transparent about their commissions process and how their quotas are set, because that’s the only way they can assure themselves they can make money,” Rajamani said. “Otherwise promises made on paper are just on paper.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188518" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188518" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?w=150" alt="A screenshot of Everstage's dashboard for sales representatives, with data about their commissions" width="600" height="386" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png 3168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=1536,989 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=2048,1319 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188518" class="wp-caption-text">Everstage&#8217;s dashboard for sales representatives</p></div></p>
<p class="p3">Having visibility also motivates people. Everstage’s gamification features allows salespeople to look at their current quotas and deals pipeline, and forecast how much they can potentially earn, broken down by their commission plans, including deal attainment, implementation fees and multiplier bonuses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“At the end of the day, incentives and particular criteria, like multiplier bonuses, drive salespeople to close more contracts, or multi-year contracts,” Rajamani said. “If they can see how much more commission they can make if they close a deal as a multi-year contract, then it’s an added incentive.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Everstage is currently works primarily with SaaS companies, but also sees inbound interest from insurance, real estate, pharmaceuticals and biotech. The platform is sector-agnostic and can be customized for different types of commission plans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Rajamani notes that sales commissions management software is not a new area. For example, players like SAP CallidusCloud and Xactly have been around for years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Over the last year, newer sales commissions platforms have also raised, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/captivateiq-raises-46m-for-its-no-code-sales-commissions-platform/CaptivateIQ">CaptivateIQ</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/automating-payments-for-the-corporate-sales-force-leads-to-a-10-million-windfall-for-spiff/">Spiff</a>. This is in part because many high-growth companies have adjusted incentives for their sales team as they work remotely during the pandemic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">There is some overlap between Everstage’s features and its competitors, but its main differentiators are its modular approach and emphasis on gamification. “We want to move away from automating busywork for revenue operations and finance, and move towards the gamification aspect, so the gamification is an additional module,” he said. “Other indicators—quota setting, target setting and overall company targets broken down by percentage, managers, regions—all those are also there.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">In a statement about the funding, 3One4 Capital Anurag Ramdasan said, “As customer acquisition and retention have increased in complexity with more roles and workflows than ever, Rev Ops teams have become mandatory to align incentives and drive revenue. With their considerable experience, the Everstage founding team is well-positioned to help Rev Ops teams succeed, starting with real-time commission planning and visibility, and we’re excited to partner with them.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Baby Boomers (aged 57-75 at this point) and Gen X (aged 41-56) head into their dotage, they are no longer the “senior citizens” of yore, being still active and, often, healthy. But leaving work means they lose about half of their social network,  which has a negative impact on wellbeing. Plus, the pandemic <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/coronavirus/2021/07/19/the-silent-covid-nightmare-loneliness/">increased loneliness</a> levels with COVID lockdowns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mirthy.co.uk/">Mirthy’s</a> platform allows over 60s to host or participate in free or ’affordable’ activities, socialising online and eventually offline as well. It’s aiming to become the “go-to platform for all over 60s’ social, physical and financial needs” thus capturing an increasingly large and wealthy market.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $1.1M pre-Seed funding led by Ascension’s &#8216;Fair By Design&#8217; fund, with participation from Ada Ventures, Redrice Ventures and True.</p>
<p>Co-Founders Alex Ramamurthy and Dhruv Haria were inspired by the negative impact of social isolation and loneliness on their parents&#8217; mental and social wellbeing. Ramamurthy has been Chairman of the Care Innovation Hub incubator. Haria is a Cambridge Grad (Maths), qualified Actuary, and Data Scientist with a background in the Finance and Technology domains.</p>
<p>Ramamurthy said: “Both Dhruv and I witnessed the effects retirement was having on our parents. We noticed how their wellbeing was being affected by their decreasing social circles and the increasing inactive free time they had alone.”</p>
<p>Users for Mirthy can get access to fitness classes to belly dancing workshops, and history lectures to piano concerts at home, delivered by hosts, most of them over 60. The startup now claims over 35,000 users since launch in April-2020.</p>
<p>Its competitors include The Joy Club, Hello Revel, GetSetUp and several others. What Mirthy says, however, is that its content is created and curated “by over 60s for 60s” while “most of the other companies offer intergenerational events” and hosts are amateurs, passionate about a particular interest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium-sized construction businesses in Europe and the US tend not to be run on digital platforms, leaving a $1.6 trillion industry relatively untouched. publicly-listed Procore (NYSE: PCOR) is the go-to platform for large general contractors, but newer startups are going for this SMB construction market such as Sitemax, Sitemate, Fieldlens and Fieldwire.</p>
<p>Now, the <a href="https://remato.com/">Remato</a> construction management platform is joining them with a $1.7 million seed investment round, led by London-based Passion Capital.<br />
 <br />
Additional investors in the financing round include founders and early team members of Pipedrive along with venture funds Superangel, Lemonade Stand, Spring Capital, and Kaamos Group – a long-standing property developer and general contractor. The new investment brings Remato’s total funding up to $2.5 million. Remato currently has customers in the Nordics and Baltics.<br />
 <br />
Founded in 2018, Remato says its platform allows field contractors to plan and manage budgets, labor, materials, and equipment on one app. The company says it is growing steadily at 10-15% MoM with a mobile-first user experience and now has 1,700 daily active users.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Madis Lehtmets said: “The construction industry needs simplicity and modern design to achieve the mass adoption of software. We believe that user experience should be much more of a priority, as frontline adoption depends on it. It helps the traditionally low-tech industry to go fully digital.”  </p>
<p>Eileen Burbidge, Partner at Passion Capital, said: “We’re very excited to be working with Remato. Their traction to date clearly validates the need for digital user experiences and platforms for the massive construction sector, which comprises 10% of the global economy. We look forward to supporting the team’s ambitions in the UK, across the rest of Europe, and North America.”<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-headquartered Parcel Perform, which connects merchants with e-commerce carriers and provides shipment tracking features, said on Wednesday it has raised $20 million in a new financing round as it scales its business in several parts of the world.</p>
<p>Cambridge Capital led the logistics tech startup’s Series A financing round, while SoftBank Ventures Asia and existing investors including Wavemaker Partners and Investible participated in it.</p>
<p>The SaaS startup helps improve the experience of e-commerce merchants and their customers when engaging with carriers, explained Dr. Arne Jeroschewski, co-founder and chief executive of Parcel Perform, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Nespresso, which sells home coffee machines, capsules and accessories, relies on Parcel Perform to gain access to logistics data, for instance. Based on this data, said Jeroschewski, tracking experience &#8212; such as a web page for tracking, a system for authentication &#8212; is charted for the firm and the startup also provides tools for customer support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.parcelperform.com">Parcel Perform</a> also provides these merchants with tools to create additional touchpoints after the checkout to create higher brand loyalty with customers, opportunities to move more inventories, and it has also developed a system to support more than 30 languages to offer the most personalized experience to customers. It says businesses on its platform <span style="font-weight: 400;">have increased their customer lifetime value by up to 40%. </span></p>
<p>The startup &#8212; which is already profitable and has grown its revenue by 5x since the onset of the pandemic &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">also uses its AI stack to make predictions on things such as when a customer will get their parcel. Parcel Perform, which integrates with over 700 carriers, has courted clients globally and executes more than 100 million parcel updates each day.</span></p>
<p>“Visibility is a vital market in this age of e-commerce. After evaluating many companies worldwide, we believe that Parcel Perform simply offers the best visibility and experience solution. They have built a unique value proposition for brands, marketplaces and carriers, with the most complete solution for end-to-end shipment tracking,” said Benjamin Gordon, Managing Partner of Cambridge Capital, in a statement. Cambridge focuses exclusively on global logistics and supply chain technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jeroschewski founded the startup with Dana von der Heide. Jeroschewski previously co-founded e-tail unicorn Zalora, and held senior roles in Singapore Post and DHL, where he worked together with Dana. Dana is also an advisory member of the German Logistics Association and part of the distinguished eFounder Fellowship program by Alibaba.</p>
<p>Parcel Perform will deploy the fresh funds to scale further in Asia and Europe and also set up a regional office in North America, said Jeroschewski. The startup is also looking to increase its headcount.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When adding text code from a 3rd party source into a platform, the process is an unavoidable and time-consuming chore. Developers currently spend a large part of their day reviewing things like “NPM” packages, and such. There are developer libraries and text code platforms like JetBrains and Visual Studio, but these don’t entirely solve the problem. A UK startup thinks it might have the answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://cranq.io/">CRANQ</a> is a Low-Code IDE (integrated dev environment, like Visual Studio)  which provides component authoring, with, it says, a lot of re-usability. Its focus on standardized datatypes and ports means that intent can be easily checked, says the company. It’s now raised a Pre-Seed £1m funding from Venrex and Profounders.</p>
<p>Developers build their code in the IDE visually, using a drag-and-drop interface. So far it’s been used to built a version of the Educai.io back-end, and Alpha trials will begin this summer.</p>
<p>The cofounders are Toby Rowland and Dan Stocker. Rowland, CEO, is a serial entrepreneur, best-known for co-founding King.com in 2003. His most recent digital startup &#8211; Mangahigh.com &#8211; was acquired by Westermann Publishing in 2018, and subsequently, Rowland launched RyzeHydrogen.comfor the hydrogen-for-transport market. Stocker, CTO, is an experienced developer, software architect, and inventor. Among other projects, Dan conceived and created Giant, a React competitor, in 2012.</p>
<p>CRANQ’s initial focus on testing will also bring it into competition with Postman.com. The Workflow space (Zapier, N8N etc.) also overlaps with CRANQ.</p>
<p>But CRANQ is addressing a sizeable market. The microservices market is estimated to be worth $32bn in 2023, growing at 16% you, according to some estimates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today is rolling out a set of new features aimed at helping people protect their accounts from abuse, including offensive and unwanted comments and messages. The company will <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/protecting-our-community-from-abuse-on-instagram/">introduce</a> tools for filtering abusive direct message (DM) requests as well as a way for users to limit other people from posting comments or sending DMs during spikes of increased attention &#8212; like when going viral. In addition, those who attempt to harass others on the service will also see stronger warnings against doing so, which detail the potential consequences.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/instagram-confirms-test-of-new-anti-harassment-tool-limits-designed-for-moments-of-crisis/">recently confirmed</a> it was testing the new anti-harassment tool, Limits, which Instagram head Adam Mosseri referenced in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRot2ucpUoA/">a video update</a> shared with the Instagram community last month. The feature aims to give Instagram users an easy way to temporarily lock down their accounts when they&#8217;re targeted with a flood of harassment.</p>
<p>Such an addition could have been useful to combat the recent racist attacks that took place on Instagram following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020_Final">Euro 2020 final</a>, which saw several England footballers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/12/england-players-racism-euros-defeat/">viciously harassed</a> by angry fans after the team’s defeat. The incidents, which had included racist comments and emoji, raised awareness of how little Instagram users could do to protect themselves when they&#8217;ve gone viral in a negative way.</p>

<p>During these sudden spikes of attention, Instagram users see an influx of unwanted comments and DM requests from people they don&#8217;t know. The Limits feature allows users to choose who can interact with you during these busy times.</p>
<p>From Instagram&#8217;s privacy settings, you&#8217;ll be able to toggle on limits that restrict accounts that are not following you as well as those belonging to recent followers. When limits are enabled, these accounts can&#8217;t post comments or send DM requests for a period of time of your choosing, like a certain number of days or even weeks.</p>
<p>Twitter had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/">eyeing a similar set of tools</a> for users who go viral, but has yet to put them into action.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s Limits feature had already been in testing, but is now becoming globally available.</p>

<p>The company says it&#8217;s currently experimenting with using machine learning to detect a spike in comments and DMs in order to prompt people to turn on Limits with a notification in the Instagram app.</p>
<p>Another feature, <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-tools-to-protect-our-community-from-abuse">Hidden Words</a>, is also being expanded.</p>
<p>Designed to protect users from abusive DM requests, Hidden Words automatically filters requests that contain offensive words, phrases and emojis and places them into a Hidden Folder, which you can choose to never view. It also filters out requests that are likely spam or are otherwise low-quality. Instagram doesn&#8217;t provide a list of which words it blocks to prevent people from gaming the system, but it has now updated that database with new types of offensive language, including strings of emoji &#8212; like those that were used to abuse the footballers &#8212; and included them in the filter.</p>
<p>Hidden Words had already been rolled out to a handful of countries earlier this year, but will reach all Instagram users globally by the end of the month. Instagram will push accounts with a larger following to use it, with messages both in their DM inbox and in their Stories tray.</p>

<p>The feature was also expanded with a new option to &#8220;Hide More Comments,&#8221; which would allow users to easily hide comments that are potentially harmful, but don&#8217;t go against Instagram&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p>Another change will involve the warnings that are displayed when someone posts a potentially abusive comment. Already, Instagram would warn users when they first try to post a comment, and it would later display an even stronger warning when they tried to post potentially offensive comments multiple times. Now, the company says users will see the stronger message the first time around.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188259" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188259" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2188259 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?w=391" alt="" width="391" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?resize=172,300 172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?resize=391,680 391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188259" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>The message clearly states the comment may &#8220;contain racist language&#8221; or other content that goes against its guidelines, and reminds users that the comment may be hidden when it&#8217;s posted as a result. It also warns the user if they continue to break the community guidelines, their account &#8220;may be deleted.&#8221;</p>
<p>While systems to counteract online abuse are necessary and underdeveloped, there&#8217;s also the potential for such tools to be misused to silence dissent. For example, if a creator was spreading misinformation or conspiracies, or had people calling them out in the comments, they could turn to anti-abuse tools to hide the negative interactions. This would allow the creator to paint an inaccurate picture of their account as one that was popular and well-liked. And that, in turn, can be leveraged into marketing power and brand deals.</p>
<p>As Instagram puts more power into creators&#8217; hands to handle online abuse, it has to weigh the potential impacts those tools have on the overall creator economy, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope these new features will better protect people from seeing abusive content, whether it’s racist, sexist, homophobic or any other type of abuse,&#8221; noted Mosseri, in an announcement about the changes. &#8220;We know there’s more to do, including improving our systems to find and remove abusive content more quickly, and holding those who post it accountable.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/july-2021-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-report/">new report</a> about &#8220;coordinated inauthentic behavior&#8221; on its platform, Facebook states that it last month removed hundreds of accounts across its Facebook and Instagram platforms that were tied to anti-vaccination disinformation campaigns operated from Russia. In one campaign, says the company, a newly banned network &#8220;posted memes and comments claiming that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine would turn people into chimpanzees.&#8221; More recently, in May, the same network &#8220;questioned the safety of the Pfizer vaccine by posting an allegedly hacked and leaked<br />
AstraZeneca document,&#8221; says Facebook.</p>
<p>The company publishes such reports as a reminder to the public that it is focused on &#8220;finding and removing deceptive campaigns around the world.&#8221; Still, a new New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/technology/facebook-vaccine-misinformation.html">investigation</a> into Facebook&#8217;s relationship with the Biden administration suggests that the company continues to fall short when it comes to tackling misinformation, including, currently, around vaccine misinformation.</p>
<p>We talked about that reported disconnect earlier today with Sheera Frenkel, a cybersecurity correspondent for the New York Times and recent co-author, with New York Times national correspondent Cecelia Kang, of &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Untitled-Sheera-Frenkel/dp/0062960679">An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook&#8217;s Battle for Domination</a>,&#8221; which was published in June. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This big story right now about Facebook centers on it shutting down the accounts of NYU researchers whose tools for studying advertising on the network violated its rules, according to the company. A lot of people think those objections don&#8217;t hold water. In the meantime, several Democratic senators have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/facebook-pressed-by-us-lawmakers-disabling-nyu-research-accounts-2021-08-09/">sent the company a letter</a>, grilling it about its decision to ban these scholars.  How does this particular situation fit into your understanding of how Facebook operates? </strong></p>
<p>SF: I was struck by how it fit a pattern that we really showed in [our] book of Facebook taking what seems like a very ad hoc and piecemeal approach to many of its problems. This action they took against NYU was surprising because there are so many others that are using data in the way that NYU is, including, private companies and commercial firms that are using it in ways that we don&#8217;t fully understand.</p>
<p>With NYU, the academics there were actually quite transparent and how they were collecting data. They didn&#8217;t hide what they were doing. They told journalists about it, and they told Facebook about it. So for Facebook to take action against just them, just as they were about to publish some research that may have been critical of Facebook and may have been damaging to Facebook, seems like a one off thing and really gets to the root of Facebook&#8217;s problems about what data the company holds about its own users.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have any sense that investigators in the Senate or in Congress may demand more accountability for more recent industry indiscretions, such as the events of January 6? Typically, there comes a point where Facebook apologizes over a public flap . . . then nothing changes. </strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SF: After the book came out, I spoke to one lawmaker who read our book and said, &#8216;It&#8217;s one thing if they apologized once, and we saw a substantial change happen at the company. But what these apologies are showing us is that they think they can get away with just an apology and then changing really surface level things but not getting to the root of the problem.&#8217;</p>
<p>So you brought up January 6, which is something that we know Congress is looking at, and I think that what lawmakers are doing is going a step beyond what they usually do . . . they&#8217;re taking a step back and saying, &#8216;How did Facebook allow groups to foment on the platform for months ahead of January 6? How did its algorithms drive people toward these groups? And how did its piecemeal approach to removing some groups but not others allow this movement known as stop-the-steal really take off. That&#8217;s fascinating because, until now, they haven&#8217;t taken that step back to understand the whole machinery behind Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Still, if Facebook is not willing to share its data in a more granular way, I wonder how fruitful these investigations will really be.</strong></p>
<p>SF: We reported in the New York Times that Facebook, when asked by the White House for this prevalence data on COVID &#8212; the idea being how prevalent is COVID misinformation &#8212; couldn&#8217;t give it to the White House because they didn&#8217;t have it. And the reason they didn&#8217;t have it is that when their own data scientists wanted to start tracking that over a year ago at the start of the pandemic, Facebook did not give them the resources or the mandate to start tracking the prevalence of COVID misinformation. One thing lawmakers can do is pressure Facebook to do that in the future and to give the company firm deadlines for when they want to see that data.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Based on your reporting, do you think there&#8217;s a reporting issue within Facebook or that these unclosed information loops are by design? In the book, for example, you talk about Russian activity on the platform leading up to the 2016 elections. You say that the company&#8217;s then chief security officer, Alex Stamos, had come up with a special team to look at Russian election interference relatively early in 2016, but that after Donald Trump won the election, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg said they were clueless and frustrated and they didn&#8217;t know why they weren&#8217;t presented with Stamos&#8217;s findings earlier.  </strong></p>
<p>SF: As we were doing reporting for this book, we really wanted to get to the bottom of that. Did Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg avoid knowing what there was to know about Russia, or were they just kept out of the loop? Ultimately, I think only Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg can answer that question.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ll say is that early on, about a week or two after the 2016 elections, Alex Stamos goes to them and says, &#8216;There <em>was</em> Russian election interference. We don&#8217;t know how much; we don&#8217;t know the extent. But there definitely was something here and we want to investigate it. And even after being told that startling news, Mark Zuckerberg [and other to brass] didn&#8217;t ask for daily or even weekly meetings to be updated on the progress of the security team. I know this is the chief executive of a company and as the CEO [he has] a lot on [his] plate. But you would think if your security team said to you, &#8216;Hey, there was an unprecedented thing that happened on our platform. Democracy was potentially harmed in a way that we didn&#8217;t foresee or expect,&#8217; you would think that as the head of the company, you&#8217;d say, &#8216;This is a really huge priority for me, and I&#8217;m going to ask for regular updates and meetings on this.&#8217; We don&#8217;t see that happen. And that let&#8217;s them monthly to be able to say, &#8216;Well, we didn&#8217;t know. We weren&#8217;t totally up to date with things.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: In the meantime, industry participants remain very interested in where regulation goes. What are you watching most closely?</strong></p>
<p>SF: In the next six months to a year, there are two things that are fascinating to me. One is COVID misinformation. It&#8217;s the worst problem for Facebook, because it&#8217;s been growing on the platform for close to a decade. It&#8217;s got deep roots across all parts of Facebook. And it&#8217;s homegrown. It&#8217;s Americans who are spreading this misinformation to other Americans. So it challenges all Facebook&#8217;s tenets on free speech and what it means to be a platform that welcomes free speech but also hasn&#8217;t drawn a clear line between what free speech is and what harmful speech is, especially during the time of the pandemic. So I&#8217;m really curious to see how they handle the fact that their own algorithms are still pushing people into anti vaccine groups and are still promoting people that definitely off the platform spread incorrect information about about COVID.</p>
<p>The second thing for me is that we&#8217;re going into a year where there are a lot of really important elections to be held in other countries with populist leaders, some of whom are modeling their use of Facebook after Donald Trump. After banning Donald Trump. I&#8217;m very curious to see how Facebook deals with some of these leaders in other countries who are testing the waters much in the same way that he did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pave.com/">Pave,</a> a San Francisco-based startup that helps companies benchmark, plan and communicate compensation to their employees, has raised a $46 million Series B. YC Continuity led the round, which also saw participation from Andreessen Horowitz and Bessemer Venture Partners. The round comes eight months after Pave closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/pave-trove-a16z-series-a/">a $16 million Series A round</a>. Today’s financing puts Pave’s valuation at $400 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/ycs-most-anticipated-startup-raised-16m-from-a16z-before-demo-day">up from $75 million one year ago. </a></p>
<p>Pave launched with an ambitious goal: Can it measure pay across venture-backed tech companies in real time, and help startups move their comp table off of spreadsheets? AngelList and Glassdoor have already tried to build a similar benchmark-worthy data set, but Pave may have a built-in advantage over the companies that tried to fix the same problem before. Y Combinator, which helped incubate Pave and is now leading its most recent round through its later-stage capital vehicle, is one of the largest startup accelerators in the world. Of Pave’s 900 customers to date, one-third come from Y Combinator, and CEO Matthew Schulman only sees that number growing.</p>
<p>“Having YC’s deep support of Pave as the YC-stamped leader in the burgeoning [compensation technology] industry is and will continue to be game changing for our distribution and ability to have ample data coverage in our benchmarking product,” Schulman said. He compared Pave’s distribution trajectory as similar to what fintech company Brex, also backed by Y Combinator Continuity, managed. The founder estimates that 60% of YC companies are active Brex customers.</p>
<p>The reliance on YC could engender platform risk, considering how often the accelerator invests in competitors &#8212; often within the same batch. That said, an investment from Y Combinator Continuity, which does <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/continuity/">Series B rounds and higher,</a> may be a signal that YC has found the comptech player it wants to back. Ali Rowghani, the managing director of the fund and former COO of Twitter, is joining Pave’s board.</p>
<p>Data is everything for the startup, supporting each of Pave&#8217;s three main services that it offers to companies. First, Pave uses market and partner data to help companies benchmark salaries for their employees. Second, the startup integrates with HR tools such as Workday, Carta and Greenhouse to give its customers a holistic picture on how employees are currently being compensated, and what makes sense for promotion cycles and salary bumps. And third, the data work culminates into formal offers and compensation packages that employers can then offer to new and old employees.</p>
<p>Pave&#8217;s current customers account for data on over 65,000 employee records. The first product serves as a free top of funnel service, while the last two are paid services offered up like any ol&#8217; enterprise software contract.</p>
<p>The world of compensation is rife with inequity, leading to the gender wage gap, and the gaps we can see in the market regarding minority pay disparity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Schulman views one of Pave’s goals as getting companies to go from doing their D&amp;I analysis from once a year, to doing it consistently.<strong> </strong>The company plans to build diversity and inclusion-specific dashboards that allow companies to see inequities and access ways or suggestions to improve their breakdown.</p>
<p>“What gets measured, gets improved,” Schulman said. Pave has begun to track its own compensation and diversity metrics, in an effort to be more transparent with its employees and maybe inspire some companies to do the same. About 33% of Pave&#8217;s workforce identify as women, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/it-could-take-12-years-to-reach-equal-representation-of-women-in-tech.html">compared to an industry average of 28.8%.</a> Half of Pave&#8217;s executives, and half of Pave&#8217;s board members, identify as women. The company has committed to having 50% of its client-facing roles, which include customer success managers and sales members, &#8220;to be female or persons from underrepresented groups.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Pave is starting to disclose its own internal benchmarks, transparency around diversity isn&#8217;t yet a standard within tech companies &#8212; it&#8217;s far easier to get valuations than to get specifics around the makeup of historically overlooked individuals within organizations. Pave recently launched the<a href="https://www.pave.com/pdl"> Pave Data Lab,</a> which uses its data set to showcase compensation trends and inequities within how tech workers are paid. That said, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pave doesn’t currently require the companies it works with to upload gender and race information into their benchmarking tool, and didn&#8217;t disclose what specific percentage of companies on its platform share that data.</span></p>
<p>It is hoping noise will make a difference. Pave&#8217;s compensation benchmarking data is now free for all companies to use, which will bring more data underneath its umbrella, and more standards to the confusing world of compensation.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 10, 2021. Today we have all sorts of goodies for you: Apple’s privacy stance, cannabis tech, even some crypto-focused items. Please enjoy.</p>
<p>Also note that Salesforce’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/salesforces-kathy-baxter-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-to-talk-ai/">Kathy Baxter is coming to TC Sessions: SaaS</a> to talk AI, which is going to be a hoot. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features/">Apple makes its privacy case:</a> </strong>In a TechCrunch interview with Apple’s privacy chief Erik Neuenschwander, our own Matthew Panzarino got to ask questions about Cupertino’s impending software rollout of a method to detect certain abusive material. The decision by Apple has caused an uproar among privacy-minded groups.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/following-the-ipccs-report-we-need-more-technology-to-respond-to-more-disasters/">We need more disaster tech:</a> </strong>That’s Danny Crichton’s thesis after reading the latest IPCC report on climate change and considering his time reporting on startups building tech to better respond to increasingly common fires, floods and other forms of natural mischief. If you were hunting for a market where you might be able to build a company <em>and</em> make a difference, this could be your jam.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/salesforce-wants-salesforce-to-be-the-netflix-of-biz-content/"><strong>Salesforce announces Salesforce+:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And yes, it is a streaming network of sorts. For context, Salesfoce used to host a yearly in-person event called Dreamforce. Then the pandemic hit. Now Salesforce is looking to build a home for Dreamforce online and extend its general video-and-content remit by producing more stuff, more often. The streaming service, which will focus on business topics, will be free when it launches later this year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/44-01-secures-5m-to-turn-billions-of-tons-of-carbon-dioxide-to-stone/"><strong>Speaking of climate change:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A startup called 44.01 just closed a $5 million round. What’s the money for? The company’s tech that turns carbon dioxide into stones. The process, called mineralizing, is known but not on a commercial scale. If 44.01 has its way, that could change.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/kiwibot-partners-with-hospitality-giant-sodexo-to-bring-food-delivery-robots-to-college-campuses/"><strong>In case you thought college kids had too much to do:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Kiwibot, makers of a cute little robot that can deliver food, has “announced a partnership with food services and facilities management giant Sodexo to bring its robots to U.S. college campuses.” Now college students can ingest substances <em>and</em> not have to go pick up said vittles themselves. This makes me at once jealous and somewhat cranky about being old.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/jerry-raises-75m-at-a-450m-valuation/"><strong>Auto insurance comparison app raises again:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Jerry, which raised a $28 million Series B just a few months ago, is back with a new, larger round. This time it’s a $75 million Series C. Jerry, which has built an app that lets users compare insurance options, is in competitive territory. But given its new round, we presume that it has found an angle on its market that is proving lucrative thus far.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/"><strong>The Hyundai self-driving car program is coming to LA:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Motional, a joint effort from Aptiv and Hyundai, is bringing its autonomous cars to Los Angeles via a new facility to do testing. What’s fun about this particular bit of news is that there are so many self-driving companies that I cannot keep them straight. Which means that perhaps one of them will nail the problem and I never have to drive again.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/surfside-a-marketing-technology-for-the-cannabis-space-inhales-4-million/"><strong>Surfside raises $4M for cannabis marketing tech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I suppose I didn’t know that cannabis needed marketing help, as it seems to sell itself rather well. But all the same, with myriad smaller cannabis brands getting started as the U.S. and other markets work in decriminalizing the drug, Surfside is building tech that may help them get to market.</li>
<li>In case you need just a little bit more, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/">took a look</a> at just how many crypto exchanges are raising money. Call it the Coinbase effect.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s driving the global surge in retail media spending?</h2>
<p>As the pandemic changed consumer behavior and regulations began to reshape digital marketing tools, advertisers are turning to retail media.</p>
<p>Using the reams of data collected at the individual and aggregate level, retail media produce high-margin revenue streams. &#8220;And like most things, there is a bad, a good and a much better way of doing things,&#8221; advises Cynthia Luo, head of Marketing at e-commerce marketing stack Epsilo.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/openai-upgrades-its-natural-language-ai-coder-codex-and-kicks-off-private-beta/">OpenAI’s coding tool gets upgrades:</a> </strong>The team behind GPT3 built something called Codex, which was designed to turn text into code. Now, with some improvements, it could be a service that even non-developers could use. It’s going into a private beta. Honestly, I can’t wait to try this out and see what I can build.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/amazon-says-it-will-now-compensate-consumers-for-defective-products-sold-on-its-marketplace/">Amazon will comp users for defective products sold by third parties:</a></strong> For purchases of less than $1,000, if a third party sells a defective good on Amazon, the megacorp will directly reimburse customers. This is a big upgrade. And will provide a natural incentive for Amazon to clean up its marketplace of substandard goods.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/robinhood-buys-say-technologies-for-140m-to-improve-shareholder-company-relations/">Robinhood buys Say Technologies:</a> </strong>Today in a $140 million all-cash deal, Robinhood announced that it will buy Say Technologies, which provides software that connects investors and public companies that they have backed. You can see how the model could fit into Robinhood neatly, perhaps making its service stand out from a pack of similar companies offering low- and zero-cost trading services.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/venmo-to-allow-credit-cardholders-to-automatically-buy-cryptocurrency-with-their-cash-back/"><strong>Venmo users can now get crypto back instead of cash:</strong></a> If you use a Venmo credit card, you will be able to get cash back in the form of cryptocurrency instead of cash. You know, if you wanted to boost your portfolio risk slightly. Jokes aside, it’s a neat feature and shows how the major C2C payment platforms can keep elbowing their way into the crypto market.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Before you hire a marketing consultant who doesn't understand your products or commit to a CMO who has several years of experience — but none in your sector — consider influencer marketing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before you hire a marketing consultant who doesn&#8217;t understand your products or commit to a CMO who has several years of experience — but none in your sector — consider influencer marketing.</p>
<p>If the phrase evokes images of celebrities hawking hard seltzer, think again: An influencer can be as humble as an enthusiastic Reddit user who manages your Telegram channel.</p>
<p>According to Uber growth marketing manager Jonathan Martinez:</p>
<blockquote><p>“ … You don’t need to find influencers with millions of followers. Instead, lean toward microinfluencers for testing, which will bring cost efficiency and the ability to sponsor a diverse range of people.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If your startup has a clear brand pitch, &#8220;an enticing offer&#8221; and &#8220;clear next steps,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/early-stage-brands-should-also-unlock-the-power-of-influencers/">you&#8217;re ready to reach out to influencers</a>, he says.</p>
<p>In a guest post, Martinez explains how to structure offers that will maximize conversions and keep your representatives motivated to promote your products and services.</p>

<p>This morning, we published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/the-art-of-startup-storytelling-with-julian-shapiro/">an interview with growth expert Julian Shapiro</a>, a founder and angel investor who also advises startups on the best way to present themselves.</p>
<p>Marketing is data-driven, but good storytelling is an art, says Shapiro.</p>
<p>To connect with consumers on an emotional level, &#8220;you need a mix of goodwill, what-we-stand-for ideology, social prestige and customer delight — among other affinity-building ingredients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch this week!</p>

<p>Rolling up his sleeves, he dug into numbers from Coinbase, FalconX and FTX to give readers some perspective on the state of cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>Companies that have reached $5 million to $10 million in annual revenue are more likely to assemble growth teams; it&#8217;s a smart investment for any startup that&#8217;s achieved product-market fit.</p>
<p>It can also be potentially disruptive: Early marketing and product managers may feel sidelined by new cross-functional teams that suddenly take a leadership role.</p>
<p>In a detailed walkthrough, senior director of growth at OpenView Sam Richard explains the core players needed to build a growth team and how to integrate them into the organization smoothly, and shares some useful experiments to run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t expect a single hire to scratch the growth itch for you,&#8221; Richard warns.</p>
<p>&#8220;A brilliant hire is going to come up with ideas, but will absolutely need a team to support them, turn them into experiments and then make them a reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an interview with Brian Heater, Indiegogo CEO Andy Yang spoke about how the pandemic has impacted the crowdfunding platform, the challenges of stepping into the role after the previous CEO departed, and how the company reached profitability.</p>
<p><strong>The company wasn’t profitable when you joined?</strong></p>
<p>We weren’t profitable. I joined and then we cut to profitability, or at least kind of a neutral state, and with any kind of change in leadership, some tenured folks opted out, and we basically became a new team overnight to kind of re-found the company, and we’ve been slowly adding people over the last couple years, but always with that eye on profitability and controlling our own destiny.</p>

<p>Last week, Kickstarter announced that people have backed more than 200,000 projects with $6 billion in pledges since the company launched in 2009. Just 15 months ago, it crossed the $5 billion threshold.</p>
<p>Brian Heater spoke to CEO Aziz Hasan, who took over in 2019, about last year&#8217;s substantial of layoffs, the pandemic&#8217;s long-term impact on crowdfunding, and how he&#8217;s working to build a more resilient company:</p>
<p>I think for us some of the most important things are to really just understand how we’re operating the business, making sure that we are sufficient in the buffer that we have for the business to make sure that we’re operating in a way that we can feel confident that the team is going to have some stability, that they’re going to have this resilience.</p>

<p>We frequently run articles with advice for founders who are working on pitch decks. It&#8217;s a fundamental step in every startup&#8217;s journey, and there are myriad ways to approach the task.</p>
<p>Michelle Davey of telehealth staffing and services company Wheel and Jordan Nof of Tusk Venture Partners appeared on Extra Crunch Live recently to analyze Wheel&#8217;s Series A pitch.</p>
<p>Nof said entrepreneurs should candidly explain to potential investors what they&#8217;ll need to believe to back their startup.</p>
<p>&#8221; … It takes a lot of guesswork out of the equation for the investor and it reorients them to focus on the right problem set that you’re solving,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get this one shot to kind of influence what they think they need to believe to get an investment here … if you don’t do that … we could get pretty off base.&#8221;</p>

<p>Going up against global e-commerce behemoth Amazon might seem futile, but smaller players can leverage value adds that give them a leg up when it comes to ensuring a loyal customer base, says Kenny Small, vice president SAP and Enterprise at Qualitest Group.</p>
<p>“The reality is that Amazon’s true unique selling proposition is its distribution network,” he writes in a guest post. “Online retailers will not be able to compete on this point because Amazon’s distribution network is so fast.</p>
<p>“Instead, it’s important to focus on areas where they can excel — without having to become a third-party seller on Amazon’s platform.”</p>

<p>Edtech and fintech have been in the Chinese Communist Party crosshairs in recent weeks &#8212; now, chat apps and gaming are among the targets.</p>
<p>Beijing filed a civil suit against Tencent over claims that its WeChat Youth Mode flouts laws protecting minors, and state media criticized the gaming industry as the digital equivalent of passing out drugs to kids, Alex Wilhelm writes in The Exchange.</p>
<p>He writes that the “news appears to indicate that we should expect more of the same as we’ve seen in recent months from the Chinese government: More complaints about the impact of ‘excessive’ capital in its industries, more tumbling share prices and more held IPOs.”</p>
