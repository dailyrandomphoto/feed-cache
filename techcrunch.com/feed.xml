										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://genflow.com/">Genflow</a>, a London and L.A.-based brand building agency that offers an e-commerce and mobile tech platform to let influencers start companies, has raised $11 million in funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is U.K. investor BGF. The injection of capital will be used by Genflow to further scale its offering and for international expansion.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by entrepreneur Shan Hanif to help social media influencers develop their brands and extract revenue revenue from their audiences, Genflow combines aspects of a traditional branding agency &#8212; such as strategy, design and planning &#8212; and a tech company with its own software stack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This sees Genflow position itself as a Brand-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform, which helps influencers develop their own digital and physical products instead of promoting other brands, and enables them to launch their own membership club, gated community, mobile app or direct to consumer brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Genflow offers the complete infrastructure from design, development, manufacturing and logistics through to strategy, marketing and content creation to drive revenue and profit,&#8221; explains the company.</p>
<p>Genflow says its client base are established influencers who typically have large followings on Instagram and Youtube.</p>
<p>“Genflow allows an influencer to start their own business instead of the traditional brand deals so if someone with an audience wants truly their own audience and business Genflow does that for them,” says Hanif. “We provide them the complete infrastructure to launch a business: design, manufacturing, development, content, strategy and marketing all in one place. This gives us the unique ability to execute to a very high level that drives revenue”.</p>
<p>Hanif says influencers typically approach Genflow either with an idea or when they need help figuring out what brand they can launch. “We use ‘Genlytics,’ our inhouse built software, to see what the best brand they can release by checking their analytics, breakdown of their followers, what brands they have worked with in the past and to see how much they can potentially sell,” he explains.</p>
<p>Next, Genflow onboards the client and begins the brand building process, offering broadly two options: Gated content, membership clubs, community and mobile apps, or developing direct to consumer brand with physical products.</p>
<p>The first is akin to having your own Onlyfans, Patreon or social media platform. The second is a classic D2C e-commerce play and includes designing the products, and working with factories to create samples, manufacture the products and then handle all logistics etc.</p>
<p>“In both cases then we plan the launch of the brand, the marketing strategy and then work with the influencer to launch the brand itself,” adds Hanif.</p>
<p>“What’s interesting is that traditionally in startups you find a problem, get a team, some funding then try to find customers. What we have invented is the ‘audience first approach’ where we already have the audience and now just need the right products and it&#8217;s instantly a success. The metrics that I see for our brands are not normal: conversion rates that are 5-30%, 20% repeat purchase buys and around 6:1 return on facebook ads.</p>
<p>“We are proud that every brand we have launched to date is profitable and growing year on year so we know our approach works.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.curtsyapp.com/">Curtsy</a>, a clothing resale app and competitor to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-ipo-posh-starts-trading-on-nasdaq.html">recently IPO&#8217;d</a> Poshmark, announced today it has raised $11 million in Series A funding for its startup focused on the Gen Z market. The app, which evolved out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/peer-to-peer-dress-rental-startup-curtsy-lets-you-rent-the-wardrobes-of-fashionistas-near-you/">an earlier effort for renting dresses</a>, now allows women to list their clothes, shoes and accessories for resale, while also reducing many of the frictions involved with the typical resale process.</p>
<p>The new round was led by Index Ventures, and included participation from Y Combinator, prior investors FJ Labs and 1984 Ventures, and angel investor Josh Breinlinger (who left Jackson Square Ventures to start his own fund).</p>
<p>To date, Curtsy has raised $14.5 million, including over two prior rounds, which also included investors CRV, SV Angel, Kevin Durant, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscillascala/">Priscilla Scala</a> and other angels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like other online clothing resale businesses, Curtsy aims to address the needs of a younger generation of consumers who are looking for a more sustainable alternative when shopping for clothing. Instead of constantly buying new, many Gen Z consumers will rotate their wardrobes over time, often by leveraging resale apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098693" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098693" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2098693" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="554" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png 2727w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=300,245 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=768,626 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=680,554 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=1536,1252 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=2048,1669 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Curtsy</p></div></p>
<p>However, the current process for listing your own clothes on resale apps can be time-consuming. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/get-rich-selling-used-fashion-online-or-cry-trying/">recent report by Wired</a>, for example, detailed how many women were spinning their wheels engaging with Poshmark in the hopes of making money from their closets, to little avail. The Poshmark sellers complained they had to do more than just list, sell, package and ship their items &#8212; they also had to participate in the community in order to have their items discovered.</p>
<p>Curtsy has an entirely different take. It wants to make it easier and faster for casual sellers to list items by reducing the amount of work involved to sell. It also doesn&#8217;t matter how many followers a seller has, which makes its marketplace more welcoming to first-time sellers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big gap in the market is really for casual sellers &#8212; people who are not interested in selling professionally,&#8221; explains Curtsy CEO David Oates. &#8220;In pretty much every other app that you&#8217;ve heard about, pro sellers really crowd out everyday women. Part of that is the friction of the whole process,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Peer-to-peer dress rental startup Curtsy lets you rent out your wardrobe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/peer-to-peer-dress-rental-startup-curtsy-lets-you-rent-the-wardrobes-of-fashionistas-near-you/embed/#?secret=heLAAhWCKV" data-secret="heLAAhWCKV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On Curtsy, the listing process is far more streamlined.</p>
<p>The app uses a combination of machine learning and human review to help the sellers merchandise their items, which increase their chances of selling. When sellers first list their item in the app, Curtsy will recommend a price, then fill in details like the brand, category, subcategory, shipping weight and the suggested selling price, using machine learning systems training on the previous items sold on its marketplace. Human review fixes any errors in that process.</p>
<p>Also before items are posted, Curtsy improves and crops the images, as well as fixes any other issues with the listing, and moderates listings for spam. This process helps to standardize the listings on the app across all sellers, giving everyone a fair shot at having their items discovered and purchased.</p>
<p>Another unique feature is how Curtsy caters to the Gen Z to young Millennial user base (ages 15-30), who are often without shipping supplies or even a printer for producing a shipping label.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098694" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098694" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2098694 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="602" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=300,266 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=768,680 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=680,602 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=1536,1361 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=2048,1814 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098694" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Curtsy / Photo credit: Brooke Ray</p></div></p>
<p>First-time sellers receive <a href="https://curtsyapp.com/item/imB1yQBUSE">a free starter kit</a> with Curtsy-branded supplies for packaging their items at home, like poly mailers in multiple sizes. As they need more supplies, the cost of those is built into the selling flow, so you don&#8217;t have to explicitly pay for it &#8212; it&#8217;s just deducted from your earnings. Curtsy also helps sellers to schedule a free USPS pickup to save a trip to the post office, and it will even send sellers a shipping label, if need be.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we realized quickly is Gen Z does not really have printers. So we actually have a label service and we&#8217;ll send you the label in the mail for free from centers across the country,&#8221; says Oates.</p>
<p>Later, when a buyer of an item purchased from Curtsy is ready to resell it, they can do so with one tap &#8212; they don&#8217;t have to photograph it and describe it again. This also speeds up the selling process.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KTacIdGaWn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/poshmark-is-pushing-into-the-public-market-at-a-high-end-valuation-as-the-resale-market-sizzles/">Poshmark is pushing into the public market at a high-end valuation as the resale market sizzles</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Poshmark is pushing into the public market at a high-end valuation as the resale market sizzles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/poshmark-is-pushing-into-the-public-market-at-a-high-end-valuation-as-the-resale-market-sizzles/embed/#?secret=KTacIdGaWn" data-secret="KTacIdGaWn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Overall, the use of technology, outsourced teams who improve listings and extra features like supplies and labels can be expensive. But Curtsy believes the end result is that they can bring more casual sellers to the resale market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever costs we have, they should be in service of increased liquidity, so we can grow faster and add more people,&#8221; Oates says. &#8220;In case of the label service, those are people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be able to participate in selling online. There&#8217;s no other app that would allow them to sell without a printer.&#8221;</p>

<p>This system, so far, appears to be working. Curtsy now has several hundred thousand people who buy and sell on its iOS-only app, with an average transaction rates of three items bought or sold per month. When the new round closed late in 2020, the company was reporting a $25 million GMV revenue run rate, and average monthly growth of around 30%. Today, Curtsy generates revenue by taking a 20% <a href="https://curtsyapp.com/faq">commission</a> on sales (or $3 for items under $15).</p>
<p>The team, until recently, was only five people &#8212; including co-founders David Oates, William Ault, Clara Agnes Ault and Eli Allen, plus a contract workforce. With the Series A, Curtsy will be expanding, specifically by investing in new roles within product and marketing to help it scale. It will also be focused on developing an Android version of its app in the first quarter of 2021 and further building out its web presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never before have we seen such a strong overlap between buyers and sellers on a consumer-to-consumer marketplace,&#8221; said Damir Becirovic of Index Ventures, about the firm&#8217;s investment. &#8220;We believe the incredible love for Curtsy is indicative of a large marketplace in the making,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ulesson.com/">ULesson</a>, an edtech startup based in Nigeria that sells digital curriculum to students through SD cards, has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding. The round is led by Owl Ventures, which closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/owl-ventures-new-pair-of-funds-gives-edtech-a-585-million-boost/">over half a billion in new fund money</a> just months ago. Other participants include LocalGlobe and existing investors, including TLcom Capital and Founder Collective.</p>
<p>The financing comes a little over a year since uLesson closed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/sim-shagayas-ulesson-african-edtech-startup-raises-3-1m/">$3.1 million seed round</a> in November 2019. The startup’s biggest difference between now and then isn’t simply the millions it has in the bank, it’s the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its entire value proposition.</p>
<p>ULesson launched into the market just weeks before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic. The startup, which uses SD cards as a low-bandwidth way to deliver content, saw a wave of smart devices enter homes across Africa as students adapted to remote education.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The ground became wet in a way we didn’t see before,” founder and CEO Sim Shagaya said. “It opens up the world for us to do all kinds of really amazing things we&#8217;ve wanted to do in the world of edtech that you can&#8217;t do in a strictly offline sense,” the founder added.</p>
<p>Similar to many edtech startups, uLesson has benefited from the overnight adoption of remote education. Its positioning as a supplementary education tool helped it surface 70% month over month growth, said Shagaya. The founder says that the digital infrastructure gains will allow them to “go online entirely by Q2 this year.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sim Shagaya’s uLesson African edtech startup raises $3.1M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/sim-shagayas-ulesson-african-edtech-startup-raises-3-1m/embed/#?secret=5Ve0TW8R0P" data-secret="5Ve0TW8R0P" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It costs an annual fee of $50, and the app has been downloaded more than 1 million times.</p>
<p>With fresh demand, Shagaya sees uLesson evolving into a live, online platform instead of an offline, asynchronous content play. The startup is already experimenting with live tutoring: it tested a feature that allowed students to ask questions while going through pre-recorded material. The startup got more than 3,000 questions each day, with demand so high they had to pause the test feature.</p>
<p>“We want you to be able to push a button and get immediate support from a college student sitting somewhere in the continent who is basically a master in what you’re studying,” he said. The trend of content-focused startups adding on a live tutoring layer continues when you look at Chegg, Quizlet, Brainly and others.</p>
<h2>The broader landscape</h2>
<p>E-learning startups have been booming in the wake of the coronavirus. It’s led to an influx of tutoring marketplaces and content that promises to serve students. One of the most valuable startups in edtech is Byju’s, which offers online learning services and prepares students for tests.</p>
<p>But Shagaya doesn’t think any competitors, even Byju’s, have cracked the nut on how to do so in a digital way for African markets. There are placement agencies in South Africa and Kenya and offline tutoring marketplaces that send people to student homes, but no clear leader from a digital curriculum perspective.</p>

<p>“Everybody sees that Africa is a big opportunity,” Shagaya said. “But everybody also sees that you need a local team to execute on this.”</p>
<p>Shagaya thinks the opportunity in African edtech is huge because of two reasons: a young population, and a deep penetration of private school-going students. Combined, those facts could create troves of students who have the cash and are willing to pay for supplementary education.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle ahead for uLesson, and any edtech startup that benefitted from pandemic gains, is distribution and outcomes. ULesson didn’t share any data on effectiveness and outcomes, but says it&#8217;s in the process of conducting a study with the University of Georgia to track mastery.</p>
<p>“Content efforts and products [will] live or die at the altar of distribution,” Shagaya said. The founder noted that in India, for example, pre-recorded videos do well due to social nuances and culture. ULesson is trying to find the perfect sauce for videos in markets around Africa and embed that into the product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following Joseph Biden’s swearing in as the 46th president of the United States, Amazon is offering help in the administration’s stated goals for rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine. In a letter provided to TechCrunch, Worldwide Consumer CEO Dave Clark congratulates Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, while promising, “to assist you in reaching your goal of vaccinating 100 million Americans in the first 100 days of your administration.”</p>
<p>The note references a pledge set by Biden while introducing members of the pandemic team during a press conference in December of last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first 100 days won&#8217;t end the COVID-19 virus. I can&#8217;t promise that,&#8221; the then-president-elect said. &#8220;But we did not get in this mess quickly, we&#8217;re not going to get out of it quickly, it&#8217;s going to take some time. But I&#8217;m absolutely convinced that in 100 days we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More recently, COVID-19 task force member epidemiologist Michael Osterholm called the goal “aspirational […] but doable,” adding that it would take time to ramp up.</p>
<p>In his letter, Clark details Amazon’s response to the virus, as many warehouse and other workers were employed throughout as essential workers. Included in the resources on offer are deals with healthcare providers who can administer vaccines on-site.</p>
<p>“We have an agreement in place with a licensed third-party occupational health care provider to administer vaccines on-site at our Amazon facilities,” Clark writes. “We are prepared to move quickly once vaccines are available. Additionally, we are prepared to leverage our operations, information technology, and communications capabilities and expertise to assist your administration&#8217;s vaccination efforts. Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact immediately in the fight against COVID-19, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I work in HR for a tech firm. I understand that Biden is rolling out a new immigration plan today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your sense as to how the new administration will change business, corporate and startup founder immigration to the U.S.?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Free in Fremont</strong></p>
<p>Dear Free:</p>
<p>Today is a historic day. The pace of change is accelerating now, especially in Washington. At the time of this writing, Biden is expected to imminently launch a new legislative proposal for comprehensive immigration reform. As the world sits back and watches, we are focusing great collective attention on upgrading our political, sociological and technological structures so that each human has the chance to succeed.</p>
<p>One of the things I adore about my practice of supporting international professionals with U.S. immigration is bearing witness to the process of individual transformation; it is an honor to support people in their personal journey from living in a world of effects to becoming the cause.</p>
<p>The immediate focus of the proposed legislation is centered around a solution for Dreamers (who are in the U.S. without documentation) as well as supporting the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers and children. For more of my recent thoughts on this topic, check out my recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/053-looking-ahead-to-the-biden-administration/">podcast</a> explaining many of the changes. The draft bill is expected to span hundreds of pages, so please follow this Dear Sophie column for more updates as I track and explore the details, especially related to tech immigration.</p>
<p>Innovation will be supported by many new immigration opportunities coming into greater focus. Biden’s campaign platform celebrated how “Immigrants are essential to the strength of our country and the U.S. economy.” The Biden team has prioritized immigration as a key focus within COVID, with an immediate goal of rewriting most Trump-era rules. For context, Trump issued more than 400 immigration-related executive orders and proclamations during his term.</p>
<p><strong>H-1Bs: </strong>Although H-1Bs have been in the news a lot regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/dear-sophie-whats-up-with-h-1b-pay-to-play/">new wage rules changing the order of the lottery</a> and litigation, the lottery is still happening this spring, and if you want to sponsor candidates, the time to act is now, regardless of what is happening in Washington. If your company is planning on sponsoring individuals for an H-1B visa — whether they’re already living in the U.S. or are living abroad — I suggest that you continue to prepare for the upcoming H-1B registration period.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is testing a new video Q&amp;A feature that allows creators to more directly respond to their audience&#8217;s questions with either text or video answers, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. The feature works across both video and livestreams (TikTok LIVE), but is currently only available to select creators who have opted into the test, we understand.</p>
<p>Q&amp;As have become a top way creators engage fans on social media, and have proven to be particularly popular in places like Instagram Stories and in other social apps<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/download-yolo-app/"> like Snapchat-integrated YOLO</a>, or even in smaller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/f3-a-stories-style-qa-app-targeting-gen-z-teens-raises-3-9m/">startups</a>.</p>
<p>On TikTok, however, Q&amp;As are now a big part of the commenting experience, as many creators respond to individual comments by publishing a new video that explains their answer in more detail than a short, text comment could. Sometimes these answers are meant to clarify or add context, while other times creators will take on their bullies and trolls with their video responses. As a result, the TikTok comment section has grown to play a larger role in shaping TikTok trends and culture.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Q&amp;As are also a key means for creators to engage with fans when livestreaming. But it can be difficult for creators to keep up with a flood of questions and comments through the current live chat interface.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;F3, a Stories-style Q&#038;A app for Gen Z teens, raises $3.9M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/f3-a-stories-style-qa-app-targeting-gen-z-teens-raises-3-9m/embed/#?secret=71ZidAA5Pg" data-secret="71ZidAA5Pg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Seeing how creators were already using Q&amp;As with their fans is how the idea for the new feature came about. Much like the existing &#8220;reply to comments with video&#8221; feature, the Q&amp;A option lets creators directly respond to their audience questions. Where available, users will be able to designate their comments as questions by tapping the Q&amp;A button in a video&#8217;s comment field, or they can submit questions directly through the Q&amp;A link on the creator&#8217;s profile page.</p>
<p>For creators, the feature simplifies the process of responding to questions, as it lets them view all their fans&#8217; questions in one place.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no limit to the number of questions that a creator can receive, though they don&#8217;t have to reply to each one.</p>
<p>The feature was first spotted by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/">Matt Navarra</a>, who posted screenshots of what the feature looks like in action, including how it appears on users&#8217; profiles.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>During the test, the new Q&amp;A feature is only being made available to creators with public Creator Accounts that have more than 10,000 followers and who have opted into the feature within their Settings, TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch. Participants in the test today include some safe-listed creators from TikTok&#8217;s Creative Learning Fund program, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">announced last year</a>, among others.</p>
<p>TikTok says the Q&amp;A feature is currently in testing globally, and it aims to roll out it to more users with Creator Accounts in the weeks ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The massive shift to remote work due to COVID-19 has resulted in a huge reduction in emissions from vehicles and other sources, but it comes with costs of its own. A new study puts tentative carbon costs on the connectivity and data infrastructure that make working from home possible — and gives you an excuse to leave the camera off.</p>
<p>The researchers, from Perdue, Yale and MIT, attempted to analyze the carbon, land and water costs of internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to build a sustainable digital world, it is imperative to carefully assess the environmental footprints of the Internet and identify the individual and collective actions that most affect its growth,&#8221; they write in the paper&#8217;s introduction.</p>
<p>Using a single metric is too reductive, they argue: Carbon emissions are a useful metric, but it&#8217;s also important to track the sources of the power, the water cost (derived from what&#8217;s needed to cool and operate data centers) and the theoretical &#8220;land cost&#8221; needed to produce the product. If it sounds a little hand-wavy, that&#8217;s because any estimate along these lines is.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hDoTMvShcU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/work-from-home-is-dead-long-live-work-from-anywhere/">Work From Home is dead, long live Work From Anywhere</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Work From Home is dead, long live Work From Anywhere&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/work-from-home-is-dead-long-live-work-from-anywhere/embed/#?secret=hDoTMvShcU" data-secret="hDoTMvShcU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In any calculation of this type at this global scale, you need to make a lot of assumptions and a lot of the data that you need are missing,&#8221; said lead study author, Yale&#8217;s Kaveh Madani, in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;But it is a good start and best we could do using the available data.&#8221; (Madani noted that a lack of transparency in the industry, rather than a lack of statistical and scientific rigor, is the greater hindrance to the study&#8217;s accuracy.)</p>
<p>An example of their findings is that an hour of HD video streaming produces up to 440 grams of Carbon Dioxide emissions — up to 1,000g for YouTube or 160g for Zoom and video conferencing due to differing video quality. For comparison, the EPA says a modern car produces 8,887 grams per gallon of gas. If you&#8217;re taking an hour of video meetings a day instead of commuting 20 miles to work, you&#8217;re definitely in the green, as it were, by an order of magnitude or more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098642" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098642" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2098642" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg" alt="Chart showing costs of digital services in carbon emissions" width="1024" height="388" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg 2833w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg?resize=300,114 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg?resize=768,291 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg?resize=680,258 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg?resize=1536,582 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg?resize=2048,776 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/madani-fig.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2098642" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Madani et al</p></div></p>
<p>But no one is arguing that the work from home shift or increase in digital consumption is a bad thing. &#8220;Of course, a virtual meeting is better for the environment than driving to a meeting location, but we can still do better,&#8221; said Madani.</p>
<p>The issue is more that we think of moving bits around as having marginal environmental cost — after all, it&#8217;s bits being flipped or sent along fiber, right? Yes, but it&#8217;s also powered by enormous data centers, transmission infrastructure and, of course, the wasteful eternal cycle of replacing our devices — though that last one doesn&#8217;t figure into the paper&#8217;s estimates.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t know the costs of our choices, we can&#8217;t make them in an informed way, the researchers warn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banking systems tell you the positive environmental impact of going paperless, but no one tells you the benefit of turning off your camera or reducing your streaming quality. So without your consent, these platforms are increasing your environmental footprint,&#8221; Madani said <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q1/turn-off-that-camera-during-virtual-meetings,-environmental-study-says.html">in a Perdue news release</a>.</p>
<p>Leaving your camera off for a call you don&#8217;t need to be visible for makes for a small — but not trivial — savings in carbon emissions. Similarly, lowering the quality on your streaming show from HD to SD could save almost 90% of the energy used to transmit it (though of course your TV and speakers won&#8217;t draw any less power).</p>
<p>That doomscrolling habit, already a problem, seems even worse when you think that every flick of the thumb indirectly leads to a puff of hot, gross air out of a data center somewhere and a slight uptick in the air conditioning bill. Social media in general doesn&#8217;t use as much data as HD streaming, but the rise of video-focused networks like TikTok means they could soon catch up.</p>
<p>Madani explained that, puff pieces writing misleading summaries of their research aside, the study does not prescribe any simple remedies like turning off your camera. Sure, you can and should, he argues, but the change we should be looking for is systemic, not individual. What are the chances millions of people will independently and regularly decide to turn off their cameras or lower the streaming quality from 4K to 720p? Pretty low.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, if the costs of these services are made clear, as Madani and his team attempt to do in a preliminary way, perhaps pressure can be applied to the companies in question to make changes on the infrastructure side that save more energy in a day with an improved algorithm than 50 million people would with conscious decisions that they faintly resent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers deserve to know more about what is happening. People currently don&#8217;t know what is going on when they press the Enter button on their computers. When they don&#8217;t know, we can&#8217;t expect them to change behavior,&#8221; Madani said. &#8220;[Policy makers] should step in, raise concerns about this sector, try to regulate it, force increased transparency, impose pollution taxes and develop incentive mechanisms if they do not want to see another unsustainable, uncontrollable sector in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The change to digital has created some amazing efficiencies and reduced or eliminated many wasteful practices, but in the process it has introduced new ones. That&#8217;s just how progress works — you hope the new problems are better than the old ones.</p>
<p>The study was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344920307072?dgcid=author">published in the journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ironhack.com/en">Ironhack</a>, a company offering programming bootcamps across Europe and North and South America, has raised $20 million in its latest round of funding.</p>
<p>The Miami-based company (with locations in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Lisbon, Madrid, Mexico City, Miami, Paris and São Paulo) said it will use the money to build out more virtual offerings to complement the company&#8217;s campuses.</p>
<p>Over the next five years, 13 million jobs will be added to the tech industry in the U.S., according to Ironhack co-founder Ariel Quiñones. That&#8217;s in addition to another 20 million jobs that Quiñones expects to come from the growth of the technology sector in the EU.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ironhack isn&#8217;t the only bootcamp to benefit from this growth. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/lambda-school-raises-74m-for-its-virtual-coding-school-where-you-pay-tuition-only-after-you-get-a-job/">Lambda School raised $74 million</a> for its coding education program.</p>

<p>Ironhack raised its latest round from <a href="https://endeavor.org/">Endeavor Catalyst</a>, a fund that<a href="https://endeavorglobal.medium.com/announcing-the-closing-of-endeavor-catalyst-iii-dd17a0e1cd18"> invests in entrepreneurs from emerging and underserved markets</a>; Lumos Capital, which was formed by investors with a long history in education technology; Creas Capital, a Spanish impact investment firm; and Brighteye, a European edtech investor.</p>
<p>Prices for the company&#8217;s classes vary by country. In the U.S. an Ironhack bootcamp costs $12,000, while that figure is more like $3,000 for classes in Mexico City.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company offers classes in subjects ranging from web development to UX/UI design, and data analytics to cybersecurity, according to a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that practical skills training, a supportive global community and career development programs can give everyone, regardless of their education or employment history, the ability to write their stories through technology,” said Quiñones.</span></p>
<p>Since its launch in 2013, the company has graduated more than 8,000 students, with a job placement rate of 89%, according to data collected as of July 2020. Companies who have employed Ironhack graduates include Capgemini, Siemens and Santander, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">First and foremost, thank you for subscribing to Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>I hope you feel like you’ve been getting value from the content our writers and guest contributors are creating, the events we’re producing and the podcasts we’re … podding. You truly are a member of our team.</p>
<h2>It’s time to kick it up a notch</h2>
<p>I began my career as an avid TechCrunch reader and remained one even when I joined as a writer, when I left to work on other things and now that I’ve returned to focus on better serving our community.</p>
<p>I know what it’s like to write, read and share the news of the day but my favorite part has always been spending time hanging out with some of you at events and gatherings. Unfortunately, the global predicament we’re in now with COVID-19 means we haven’t been able to connect in the ways that we’re used to.</p>
<h2>We’re adapting</h2>
<p>We’re going to be trying out some new things around here with the Extra Crunch staff front and center, as well as turning your feedback into action more than ever. We quite literally work for you, the subscriber, and want to make sure you’re getting your money’s worth, as it were.</p>
<p>I’ve been chatting with some of the folks in our community and <strong>I’d love to talk to you, too.</strong> Nothing fancy, <a href="https://elxde0ik7j1.typeform.com/to/Y1yIXgrH">just 5-10 minutes of your time</a> to hear more about what you want to see from us and get some feedback on what we’ve been doing so far.</p>
<p>These are just some of the things we’re discussing behind the scenes to bring all of you even more value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discord server</li>
<li>Virtual meetups</li>
<li>Monthly workshops</li>
<li>Chats with writers</li>
<li>New perks</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would be so kind as to take a minute or two to <a href="https://elxde0ik7j1.typeform.com/to/Y1yIXgrH">fill out this form</a>, I’ll drop you a note and hopefully we can have a chat about the future of the Extra Crunch community before we formally roll out some of the ideas we’re cooking up.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your support. We’re looking forward to hanging out with you more, even if it’s just online for a little while longer.</p>

<p>The look isn&#8217;t so very different from the previous administration&#8217;s site — they&#8217;re both fairly modern and minimal experiences, with big photos up front and tidy lists of priorities and announcements once you drill down into a category.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098617" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/biden-darkmode-gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098617" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2098617" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/biden-darkmode-gif.gif" alt="Animation showing dark and light modes on whitehouse.gov" width="400" height="567" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2098617" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> White House</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But one big design change implemented by the new administration that many will appreciate is the inclusion of a dark mode, or high contrast mode, and a large type toggle.</p>
<p>Dark modes have been around forever, but became <em>de rigeur</em> when Apple implemented its own system-wide versions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/apples-ios-13-will-include-a-system-wide-dark-mode/">on iOS</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/02/macos-dark-mode/">and macOS</a> a while back. It&#8217;s just easier on the eyes in many ways, and at any rate it&#8217;s nice to give users options.</p>
<p>The WhiteHouse.gov dark mode changes the headline type from a patriotic blue to an eye-friendly off-white, with links a calming Dijon. Even the White House logo itself goes from a dark blue background to full black with a white border. It&#8217;s all very tasteful, and if anything seems like a <em>low-</em>contrast mode, not high.</p>
<p>The large type mode does what it says, making everything considerably bigger and easier to tap or click. The toggles, it must be said, are a bit over-prominent, but they&#8217;ll probably tweak that soon.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/es/">Spanish-language option</a>, no doubt welcome by the millions of Americans whose first language that is. This was not present on the previous White House/Casa Blanca page.</p>
<p>More forward-looking is the pledge in the accessibility section:</p>
<blockquote><p>This commitment to accessibility for all begins with this site and our efforts to ensure all functionality and all content is accessible to all Americans.</p>
<p>Our ongoing accessibility effort works towards conforming to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1, level AA criteria.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">The WCAG guidelines</a> are a set of best practices for designing a website so that its content can be easily accessed by people who use screen readers, need captions for audio or can&#8217;t use a mouse or touchscreen easily. The guidelines aren&#8217;t particularly hard to meet, but as many have pointed out, it&#8217;s harder to retrofit a website to be accessible than to design it for accessibility from the start. Government sites are required to be accessible, but have varying levels of conformity.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed was that many of the photos on the White House website have alt text or visible captions attached — these help visually impaired visitors understand what&#8217;s in an image. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098612" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098612" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2098612" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing the alt text of a photo of VP Kamala Harris and her family" width="1024" height="582" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2098612" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> White House</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally that alt text would be read out by a screen reader when it got to the image, but it&#8217;s generally not made visible.</p>
<p>Unless the metadata was stripped from the previous administration&#8217;s site (it&#8217;s archived <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/">here</a>), none of the photos I checked had text descriptions there, so this is a big improvement. Unfortunately some photos (like the big header photo on the front page) don&#8217;t have descriptions, something that should probably be remedied.</p>

<p>Accessibility in other places will mean prompt inclusion of plaintext versions of governance items and announcements (versus PDFs or other documents), captions on official videos and other media, and as the team notes, lots of little improvements that make the site better for everyone who visits.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small thing in a way, compared with the changes expected to accompany the new administration, but small things tend to pile up and become big things.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monzo founder Tom Blomfield is departing the U.K. challenger bank entirely at the end of the month, staff were informed earlier today.</p>
<p>Blomfield held the role of CEO until May last year when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/monzo-co-founder-tom-blomfield-moves-from-uk-ceo-role-to-president/">he assumed the newly created title of president</a> and resigned from the Monzo board. However, having been given the time and space to consider his long-term future at the bank he helped create six years ago, and with a refreshed executive team now in place, he says it is time to &#8220;hand over the baton&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a brief but candid telephone interview, Blomfield also revealed that, as well as being unhappy during the last couple of years as CEO when the company scaled well beyond a &#8220;scrappy startup&#8221;, the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns exacerbated pressures placed on his own mental well-being. “I’m very happy to talk about what’s gone on with me, because I don’t think people do it enough”, he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I stopped enjoying my role probably about two years ago… as we grew from a scrappy startup that was iterating and building stuff people really love, into a really important U.K. bank. I’m not saying that one is better than the other, just that the things I enjoy in life is working with small groups of passionate people to start and grow stuff from scratch, and create something customers love. And I think that’s a really valuable skill but also taking on a bank that’s three, four, five million customers and turning it into a 10 or 20 million customer bank and getting to profitability and IPOing it, I think those are huge exciting challenges, just honestly not ones that I found that I was interested in or particularly good at”.</p>
<p>In early 2019 after realising he was “doing too much and not enjoying it,” Blomfield began talking to Monzo investor Eileen Burbidge of Passion Capital, and Monzo Chair Gary Hoffman, about changing roles and how he needed more help. Then, he says, “COVID just exacerbated things,” a period when Monzo also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/monzo-lay-offs/">had to cut staff</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/monzo-to-shutter-las-vegas/">shutter its Las Vegas office</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/monzo-confirms-60m-down-round/">raise bridge funding</a> in a highly publicised down round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Monzo confirms £60M down round, with a new pre-money valuation of £1.24B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/monzo-confirms-60m-down-round/embed/#?secret=npwMTo4k9Z" data-secret="npwMTo4k9Z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“I think [for] a lot of people in the world &#8212; and you and I have spoken about this &#8212; going through a pandemic, going through lockdown and the isolation involved in that has an impact on people’s mental health,” says Blomfield. “I don’t think I was any different, so I was really struggling. I had a really, really supportive exec team around me and a really supportive set of investors on board and I was really grateful that when I put my hand up and said, ‘I need help,’ they were super receptive to that”.</p>
<p>Blomfield also comes clean about his role as president, a title that was intended as a way to provide the time and space for him to get well and figure out if he would return longer-term to Monzo or depart entirely. Contrary to rumours, Blomfield says he wasn’t pushed out by investors. Instead, the Monzo board actually put pressure on him to remain as CEO longer than he wanted or perhaps should have (a version of events corroborated by my own sources). “When I took that president role, it was not certain one way or another what would happen,” Blomfield says, apologising in case I felt I was misled when I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/monzo-co-founder-tom-blomfield-moves-from-uk-ceo-role-to-president/">reported</a> the news.</p>
<p>(The truth is, within weeks of running that news piece, I knew it was far from certain Blomfield would ever return, with multiple sources, including people close to and worried about Blomfield, confiding in me how burned out the Monzo founder was. As weeks turned into months and following additional sourcing, I had enough information to write a follow-up story much earlier but chose to wait until a formal decision was taken.)</p>

Image Credits: Startup Grind</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Blomfield describes his resignation as a Monzo employee as &#8220;bitter-sweet,&#8221; and is keen to praise what the Monzo team has already achieved, including since his much-reduced involvement. &#8220;I think the team has done phenomenally well over the last year or so in really difficult circumstances,&#8221; he says. In particular, he cites Monzo&#8217;s new CEO TS Anil as doing a &#8220;phenomenal&#8221; job, while describing Sujata Bhatia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/monzo-coo/">who joined as COO last year</a>, as &#8220;an absolute machine, a real operator&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bQo1pswsC2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/monzo-coo/">Monzo recruits former Amex exec Sujata Bhatia as its new COO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Monzo recruits former Amex exec Sujata Bhatia as its new COO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/monzo-coo/embed/#?secret=bQo1pswsC2" data-secret="bQo1pswsC2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To that end, Monzo now has almost 5 million customers, up from 1.3 million in 2019. Monzo’s total weekly revenue is now 30% higher than pre-pandemic, helped no doubt by over 100,000 paid subscribers across Monzo Plus and Premium in the last five months (sources tell me the company surpassed £2 million in weekly revenue in December for the first time in its history). Albeit at a lower valuation, the challenger bank also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/monzo-the-u-k-challenger-bank-picks-up-additional-60m-in-funding/">raised £125 million from new and existing investors</a> during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Blomfield also says that Anil and Bhatia and other members of the Monzo executive team have specific skills &#8212; that he simply doesn&#8217;t have &#8212; related to scaling and managing a bank approaching 5 million customers. And even if he did, he has learned the hard way that there are aspects of running a large company that not everyone enjoys.</p>
<p>“Going from a CEO where you’re front and centre dealing with all of the different pressures every day to a much lighter role is a huge huge weight off my shoulders and has given me the time and space to recover”, he adds. “I’m now feeling pretty great. I’m enjoying life again”.</p>
<p>As for what&#8217;s next for Blomfield, he says he wants to &#8220;chill out&#8221; for a bit and perhaps take a holiday. He&#8217;s also finishing his vaccination training so that he can volunteer to help deliver the U.K.&#8217;s national COVID-19 vaccination rollout. A recent tweet by Blomfield about a side project also led to speculation that he has begun a new venture. Not true, says Blomfield, telling me it was a five-day project designed to get back into coding and play with a robotic 2D printer. And while he&#8217;s very much left Monzo, he says he&#8217;ll continue cheering on the company from the outside.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_167">speech</a> to the European Parliament today marking the inauguration of U.S. president Joe Biden, the president of the European Commission has called for Europe and the U.S. to join forces on regulating tech giants, warning of the risks of &#8220;unfiltered&#8221; hate speech and disinformation being weaponized to attack and undermine democracies.</p>
<p>Ursula von der Leyen pointed to the shock storming of the U.S. capital earlier this month by supporters of outgoing president Donald Trump as an example of how wild claims being spread and amplified online can have tangible real-world consequences, including for democratic institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a few days ago, several hundred [Trump supporters] stormed the Capitol in Washington, the heart of American democracy. The television images of that event shocked us all. That is what happens when words incite action,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That is what happens when hate speech and fake news spread like wildfire through digital media. They become a danger to democracy.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DWZ8tov8eU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/">Europe seizes on social media&#8217;s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe seizes on social media&#8217;s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/embed/#?secret=DWZ8tov8eU" data-secret="DWZ8tov8eU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>European institutions are also being targeted with &#8220;hate and contempt for our democracy spreading unfiltered through social media to millions of people&#8221;, she warned, pointing to similarly disturbing attacks that have taken place in the region in recent years. Such as an attempt by right-wing extremists in Germany to storm the Reichstag building last summer and the 2016 murder of U.K. politician Jo Cox by a fascist extremist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, the storming of the [U.S.] Capitol was different. But in Europe, too, there are people who feel disadvantaged and are very angry,&#8221; she said, suggesting feelings of exclusion and injustice can make <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">people vulnerable to believing the &#8220;rampant&#8221; conspiracy theories that platforms have allowed to circulate freely online, and which she characterized as &#8220;often a confused mixture of completely absurd fantasies&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We must make sure that messages of hate and fake news can no longer be spread unchecked,&#8221; she added, reiterating the case for regulating social media by pressing the case for imposing &#8220;democratic limits on the untrammelled and uncontrolled political power of the internet giants&#8221;.</p>
<p>The European Commission has already set out its blueprint for overhauling the region&#8217;s digital rulebook when it unveiled the draft Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act last month. Although it won&#8217;t be including hard legal limits on disinformation in the package &#8212; preferring to continue with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">a voluntary, but beefed up code of conduct</a> for content that falls into a grey area where it may be harmful but isn&#8217;t actually illegal.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen said the aim for the regulations is to ensure &#8220;if something is illegal offline it must also be illegal online&#8221;. The Commission has also said the tech policy package is about forcing platforms to take more responsibility for the content they spread and monetize.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not yet clear how the proposed laws will ultimately tackle the tricky issue of how assessments are made to remove (or reinstate) speech; and whether platforms will continue to make those judgements (under a regulator&#8217;s guidance and watchful eye), or whether they end up entirely independent of platform control.</p>
<p>What the Commission has suggested is closer to the former but the proposal has to go through the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process &#8212; so such details are likely to be debated and could be amended prior to adoption into law.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want the platforms to be transparent about how their algorithms work. We cannot accept a situation where decisions that have a wide-ranging impact on our democracy are being made by computer programs without any human supervision,&#8221; von der Leyen went on. &#8220;And we want it laid down clearly that internet companies take responsibility for the content they disseminate.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> reiterated the concern expressed in recent days about the unilateral actions taken by tech giants to close down Trump&#8217;s megaphone &#8212; echoing comments by political leaders across Europe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/">earlier this month</a> who dubbed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">display of raw platform power</a>, from companies like Twitter, as &#8220;problematic&#8221;; and said it must result in regulatory consequences for tech giants.  </span></p>
<p>&#8220;No matter how right it may have been for Twitter to switch off Donald Trump&#8217;s account five minutes after midnight, such serious interference with freedom of expression should be based on laws and not on company rules,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;It should be based on decisions of politicians and parliaments and not of Silicon Valley managers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the speech, the EU president also expressed hope that the Biden administration will be inclined to arc toward Europe&#8217;s agenda on digital regulation &#8212; as part of the anticipated post-Trump reboot of EU-U.S. relations.</p>
<p>The Commission recently adopted a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/europe-will-push-to-work-with-the-us-on-tech-governance-post-trump/">transatlantic agenda</a> in which it laid out a number of policy areas it hopes for joint-working with the U.S. &#8212; with tech governance key among the areas of hoped for policy cooperation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe will push to work with the US on tech governance, post-Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/europe-will-push-to-work-with-the-us-on-tech-governance-post-trump/embed/#?secret=6kaaKGu7DP" data-secret="6kaaKGu7DP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Von der Leyen reiterated the idea that a joint Trade and Technology Council could be &#8220;a first step&#8221; toward the EU and US fashioning a &#8220;digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in this digital field that Europe has so much to offer the new government in Washington&#8221;, she suggested. &#8220;The path we have taken in Europe can be an example for approaches at international level. As has long been the case with the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together we could create a digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide: From data protection and privacy to the security of technical infrastructure. A body of rules based on our values: human rights and pluralism, inclusion and protection of privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s evidently a keen appetite in the EU to reset U.S. relations post-Trump, it remains to be seen how much of a policy reboot the Biden administration will usher in, vis-à-vis big tech.</p>
<p>He has not been as vocal a critic of platform giants as other Democratic challengers for the presidency. And the Obama administration, which he of course served in, had very cosy ties to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Concerns have also been raised <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/biden-big-tech-antitrust-renata-hesse/?utm_campaign=theintercept&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">in recent days</a> about Biden&#8217;s potential picks for a key appointment at the justice office &#8212; in light of antitrust probes of big tech versus the prospective appointees&#8217; deep links to tech giants and/or promotion of historical mergers. So it hardly looks like a model for a full and clean reset.</p>
<p>While the tricky issue of pro-privacy reform of U.S. surveillance laws &#8212; which EU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">commissioners have warned</a> will be needed to resolve the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">legal uncertainty clouding data transfers from the region to the U.S.</a> (and which tech giants themselves have largely avoided in their own lobbying) &#8212; seems likely to need legislation from Congress, rather than being a change that could be driven solely by the Biden administration.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The chances of the incoming president being inclined to champion such a relatively wonky tech-policy issue when he has so much else in his &#8220;needs urgent attention&#8221; in-tray also seem relatively slim. But even slender odds can look promising after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/eu-us-privacy-shield-remains-precariously-placed/">the Trump era</a>.  </span></p>

		Jim Messina is a political and corporate advisor and CEO of <a href="https://themessinagroup.com/">The Messina Group</a>. He previously served as the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and as the campaign manager for Obama's successful 2012 reelection campaign.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">After serving as Obama-Biden campaign manager and White House deputy chief of staff and now living in San Francisco and working with the tech sector, I am hopeful about the Biden-Harris administration&#8217;s ability to put in place smart policies and regulatory stability to further unleash the industry’s vast potential &#8212; not to mention the effect their calm and measured leadership could have on our greater economy.</p>
<p>However, with new leadership comes new perspectives on many of the most critical issues facing Silicon Valley. While the bonds between the innovation economy and the Obama-Biden administration resulted in national prosperity, the tech sector is now intertwined in nearly every facet of American life.</p>
<p>The resulting tension means the new administration will take its role as regulator seriously and investors and businesses alike should not overlook how quickly President Biden will move on policy — especially as it relates to the future of work and getting the U.S. economy back on track.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There’s no question the gig companies had a banner year in 2020. Even with ride-hailing usage down dramatically, the strength of meal, grocery and just about everything else delivered combined with the victory in California of Proposition 22 has driven up market caps and positioned many startups for going public. Yet, while the West Coast may be feeling emboldened, the Beltway has another trajectory in mind.</p>
<p>Congress has been working on gig worker classification legislation named the PRO Act for months. The bill closely mirrors the maligned California Assembly Bill 5 that Proposition 22 mostly reversed. It’s broadly supported by labor and could see some traction this year. Labor is already working hard to line up support from the various congressional coalitions, and at the same time gig economy companies are gearing up to fight it with their unlimited resources.</p>
<p>The question is — what will President Biden do? Long ago he voiced his support for AB 5 and laid out plans to solve worker misclassification during the campaign, but he’s also hiring and appointing staff to the administration deeply experienced in tech. President Biden has been governing longer than most startup founders have been alive, he’s a master at understanding forces in Washington and how to reach a compromise. He knows that what’s rarely discussed during legislative debate is how the law will actually be implemented.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We shouldn’t be surprised if the Biden administration convenes the Department of Labor and the industry to determine how companies actually enact worker protections.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite most bills being thousands of pages, they’re rarely prescriptive. Those details are left up to agencies. President Biden has oversight of the Department of Labor, which, if the PRO Act is passed, will be responsible for its implementation.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t be surprised if the Biden administration convenes the Department of Labor and the industry to determine how companies actually enact worker protections. President Biden’s nominee for Labor Secretary, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, while a staunch supporter of labor, is also well-regarded by the business sector as someone they can work with and reach a compromise.</p>
<p>We just have to look to the states to understand why this outcome is so plausible. The gig companies already have Proposition 22-type campaigns underway in six states and are running legislation in a half dozen more. By the end of 2021 there will be law on the books codifying worker protections in nearly a third of the country, modeled on Proposition 22.</p>
<p>This kind of momentum is hard to ignore and labor knows it. Although labor is aligned in its support of the PRO Act, the alignment becomes blurry when considering state action. For example, many northeastern states have had a thriving black car and taxi industry for decades.</p>
<p>This means labor&#8217;s position on gig laws in New York and New Jersey are quite different than places like Washington state or Illinois where gig workers are still relatively new and the ink is drying on regulations supported by Uber and Lyft just a few years ago. Labor is aligned as much as they can be and enough to support the PRO Act, but there isn’t a national movement and that leaves room for compromise.</p>
<p>This is all good news for the tech sector. It’s a fantasy to think that regulation wouldn’t eventually come to protect the very workers who power the gig economy. And that’s a good thing — tech has a moral responsibility to do right by its workers. However, those regulations shouldn’t and won’t be imposed on tech. Rather it will take weeks and months of campaigns and bills winding their way through the states and Congress, culminating with negotiations and compromises.</p>
<p>Or maybe even years of renewed regulatory processes. All of which will be overseen by a new president who has witnessed firsthand over his career how innovation can help the nation grow and recover.</p>
<p>After four years of Trump’s stubborn denialism, magic thinking and economic harm, Biden will promote policy rigor, public spiritedness and private sector ingenuity to work together for innovative solutions. It will be hard work and I promise you it won’t be pretty, but we should expect the dawn of a new era of U.S. tech-driven dynamism.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This morning, as America itself resets, let's take a moment to understand last year just a little bit better as we get into this new one.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fourth quarter of 2020 was as busy as you imagined, with super-late-stage startups reaching new valuation thresholds at a record pace, and total venture capital funding in the United States recording its second-best result of all time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s according to data <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-capital-q4-2020/">released recently</a> by CB Insights, which complements <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">our look back at 2020&#8217;s venture capital year in America</a> from yesterday.</p>
<p>At the time, we noted that American startups raised an average of $428 million each day last year, a sum that helps illustrate how rapid the private markets moved during the odd period.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But a peek at aggregate results for the world&#8217;s largest VC market provides only part of the picture. We need to narrow our lens and peer more deeply into standout categories to understand <em>how</em> the U.S. venture capital market managed to post its biggest year ever in terms of dollars invested, despite seeing deal volume slip for a second consecutive year.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>This morning, we&#8217;re scraping data together to better understand.</p>
<p>First, we want to see how unicorns performed in Q4 2020. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/as-2020-ends-new-unicorn-formation-continues-to-impress/">column noted in late December</a> that it felt like unicorn creation was rapid in the quarter; how did that hold up?</p>
<p>Then we&#8217;ll dig into PitchBook data concerning the fintech sector, a huge recipient of venture capital time, attention and money.</p>
<p>Fintech&#8217;s 2020 is a good perspective to view both the year and its wild final quarter. So this morning, as America itself resets, let&#8217;s take a moment to understand last year just a little bit better as we get into this new one.</p>
<h2>Unicorns</h2>
<p>One of the most curious things about the unicorn era is the rising bet it represents. I&#8217;ve <a href="https://mattermark.com/the-ipo-traffic-jam/">written about this before</a> so I will be brief: Nearly every quarter, the number of unicorns — private companies worth $1 billion or more — goes up.</p>
<p>The private market is able to create more unicorns than it has been historically able to exit them.</p>
<p>Some of these companies exit, sometimes in group fashion. But, quarter after quarter, the number of unexited unicorns rises. This means that the <em>bet</em> on expected future liquidity from venture capitalists and other private investors keeps ratcheting higher.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers at<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/lab-grown-plant-tissue-0120"> MIT have developed a new method for growing plant tissues in a lab</a> &#8212; sort of like how companies and researchers are approaching lab-grown meat. The process would be able to produce wood and fibre in a lab environment, and researchers have already demonstrated how it works in concept by growing simple structures using cells harvested from zinnia leaves.</p>
<p>This work is still in its very early stages, but the potential applications of lab-grown plant material are significant, and include possibilities in both agriculture and in construction materials. While traditional agricultural is much less ecologically damaging when compared to animal farming, it can still have a significant impact and cost, and it takes a lot of resources to maintain. Not to mention that even small environmental changes can have a significant effect on crop yield.</p>
<p>Forestry, meanwhile, has much more obvious negative environmental impacts. If the work of these researchers can eventually be used to create a way to produce lab-grown wood for use in construction and fabrication in a way that&#8217;s scalable and efficient, then there&#8217;s tremendous potential in terms of reducing the impact on forestry globally. Eventually, the team even theorizes you could coax the growth of plant-based materials into specific target shapes, so you could also do some of the manufacturing in the lab, by growing a wood table directly for instance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s still a long way to go from what the researchers have achieved. They&#8217;ve only grown materials on a very small scale, and will look to figure out ways to grow plant-based materials with different final properties as one challenge. They&#8217;ll also need to overcome significant barriers when it comes to scaling efficiencies, but they are working on solutions that could address some of these difficulties.</p>
<p>Lab-grown meat is still in its infancy, and lab-grown plant material is even more nascent. But it has tremendous potential, even if it takes a long time to get there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hellofyllo.com">Fyllo</a> has acquired <a href="https://www.dataowl.com">DataOwl</a>, a company offering marketing and loyalty tools for cannabis retailers.</p>
<p>Fyllo said it already works with 320 cannabis retailers across 25 states (plus Puerto Rico and Jamaica). According to Chief Marketing Officer Conrad Lisco, this acquisition allows the company to offer the industry&#8217;s &#8220;first end-to-end marketing solution,&#8221; combining consumer data, digital advertising, regulatory compliance (thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/fyllo-acquires-cannregs/">Fyllo&#8217;s acquisition of CannaRegs</a> last year) and, through DataOwl, CRM and loyalty tied into a business&#8217; point-of-sale system.</p>
<p>As an example, founder and CEO Chad Bronstein (previously the chief revenue officer at digital marketing company Amobee) said that retailers will be able to use the Fyllo platform to send promotional texts to regular customers while, crucially, ensuring those campaigns are fully in compliance with state and local regulations. He added that eventually, the platform could be used beyond cannabis, in other regulated industries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Beauty, gambling, etc. — the same things need to happen in every regulated industry, they would all benefit from loyalty and compliance automation,&#8221; Bronstein said.</p>
<p>In addition, he argued that mainstream brands are increasingly interested in using data around cannabis and CBD consumers, as borne out in <a href="https://go.hellofyllo.com/forrester-opportunity-snapshot-cannabis-cbd-consumer-data">a Forrester study commissioned by Fyllo</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cannabis marketing company Fyllo acquires CannaRegs for $10M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/fyllo-acquires-cannregs/embed/#?secret=A00AqbQqDG" data-secret="A00AqbQqDG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lisco said this acquisition comes at a crucial time for the cannabis industry, with dispensaries classified as <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pot-shops-are-considered-essential-businesses-in-most-states-where-its-legal-but-the-rules-are-shifting-2020-04-08">essential businesses in many states</a>, as well as <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/2020_marijuana_legalization_and_marijuana-related_ballot_measures">continuing momentum behind marijuana legalization</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2020, cannabis came of age,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We would say it went from illicit to essential in 10 months &#8230; 2021 is really about watching endemic [marijuana] brands try to scale, so that they can capitalize on the explosive growth. They&#8217;ve historically been excluded from the kinds of integrated marketing capabilities that other non-endemic [mainstream] brands get to use when they go to market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bronstein said Fyllo aims to bring those capabilities to marijuana brands, first by bringing its compliance capabilities into the DataOwl product. The company also aims to create a national cannabis loyalty platform, allowing a marijuana retailer in one state to easily expand its marketing capabilities into other states in a compliant fashion.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. DataOwl co-founders Dan Hirsch and Vartan Arabyan are joining Fyllo, as is the rest of their team, bringing the company&#8217;s total headcount to 110.</p>
<p>“By integrating with Fyllo, DataOwl’s solutions will reach the widest possible audience via the industry’s most innovative marketing platform,&#8221; Hirsch said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched its seventeenth batch of Starlink satellites during its first mission of 2021, using a Falcon 9 rocket that was flying for the eighth time, and that landed again, recording a record for its reusability program. This puts the total Starlink constellation size at almost 1,000, as the company has expanded its beta access program for the service to the U.K. and Canada, with a first deployment in the latter country serving a rural First Nations community in a remote part of the province of Ontario.</p>
<p>The launch took off from Florida at 8:02 AM EST (5:02 AM PST), with delivery of the satellites following as planned at around an hour after lift-off. The booster on this launch flew seven times previously, as mentioned &#8212; including just in December when it was used to deliver a SiriusXM satellite to orbit to support that company&#8217;s satellite radio network.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s launch was also notable because it included a landing attempt in so-called &#8220;envelope expansion&#8221; conditions, which means that the winds in the landing zone where SpaceX&#8217;s drone recovery ship was stationed at sea actually exceeded the company&#8217;s previously defined safety window for making a landing attempt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result of today&#8217;s success, SpaceX will likely now have higher tolerances for wind speeds in order to attempt recovery, which should translate to fewer cancellations of launches based on weather conditions in the landing zone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lengthy antitrust investigation into PC games geo-blocking in the European Union by distribution platform Valve and five games publishers has led to fines totalling €7.8 million (~$9.4 million) after the Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_170">confirmed today</a> that the bloc&#8217;s rules had been breached.</p>
<p>The geo-blocking practices investigated since before 2017 concerned around 100 PC video games of different genres, including sports, simulation and action games.</p>
<p>In addition to Valve &#8212; which has been fined just over €1.6 million &#8212; the five sanctioned games publishers are: Bandai Namco (fined €340,000), Capcom (€396,000), Focus Home (€2.8 million), Koch Media (€977,000) and ZeniMax (€1.6 million).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission said the fines were reduced by between 10% and 15% owing to cooperation from the companies, with the exception of Valve, which it said chose not to cooperate (a &#8220;prohibition Decision&#8221; rather than a fine reduction was applied in its case).</p>
<p>Valve has been contacted for comment. <strong>Update:</strong> A company spokesman said: &#8220;During the seven year investigation <span class="il">Valve</span> has cooperated fully, providing all requested evidence and information to the Commission. We disagree with these findings, and plan to appeal the decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>An in-depth antitrust investigation was announced publicly by the Commission in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/europe-opens-antitrust-geo-blocking-probe-into-valve-others/">February 2017</a>, with a formal statement of objections issued just over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/eu-goes-after-valve-for-geo-blocking-steam-activation-codes/">two years later</a> &#8212; when it accused the companies of &#8220;entering into bilateral agreements to prevent consumers from purchasing and using PC video games acquired elsewhere than in their country of residence&#8221; in contravention of EU rules.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JvHGT3Bpna"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/eu-goes-after-valve-for-geo-blocking-steam-activation-codes/">EU goes after Valve for &#8216;geo-blocking&#8217; Steam activation codes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU goes after Valve for &#8216;geo-blocking&#8217; Steam activation codes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/eu-goes-after-valve-for-geo-blocking-steam-activation-codes/embed/#?secret=JvHGT3Bpna" data-secret="JvHGT3Bpna" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The mechanisms used by the companies to prevent certain cross-border sales of certain PC games were geo-blocked Steam activation keys and bilateral licensing and distribution agreements to restrict certain cross-border sales.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers has now found that these business practices partitioned certain European markets according to national borders &#8212; denying regional consumers the benefits of the EU&#8217;s Digital Single Market to shop around for the best offer.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up competition policy for the bloc, said: “Today&#8217;s sanctions against the &#8216;geo-blocking&#8217; practices of Valve and five PC video game publishers serve as a reminder that under EU competition law, companies are prohibited from contractually restricting cross-border sales. Such practices deprive European consumers of the benefits of the EU Digital Single Market and of the opportunity to shop around for the most suitable offer in the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Commission&#8217;s investigation, geo-blocking of Steam activation keys prevented activation of certain of the five games&#8217; publishers titles outside of Czechia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>
<p>It said agreements between the companies to geo-block activation keys had lasted between one and five years and were found to have been implemented at various times between September 2010 and October 2015.</p>
<p>While four of the games publishers (not Capcom) were found to have entered into licensing and distribution agreements with various PC games distributors (not Valve) in the European Economic Area (EEA) which contained clauses which restricted cross-border sales of the affected titles within the EEA, including the aforementioned Central and Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>The Commission said these agreements lasted generally longer (&#8220;between three and 11 years&#8221;), and were implemented at different times between March 2007 and November 2018.</p>
<p>Since the investigation started, EU lawmakers have passed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/at-last-an-end-to-geoblocking-in-europe-nope-not-by-a-long-chalk/">regulation against unjustified geo-blocking</a>. Although the legislation only applies to PC video games distributed on CDs or DVDs, not to downloads. So games are only partially covered.</p>
<p>A Commission review of how the geo-blocking regulation is operating, published <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-publishes-its-short-term-review-geo-blocking-regulation">last November</a>, discussed a possible extension of its scope in a range of areas, including for games. However it did not make a strong case for that change. (It also found d<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">emand for cross-border access to games, and software generally, relatively low versus </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">other content services.)</span></p>
<p>But while games distributed via digital downloads look set to remain outside the scope of the EU&#8217;s unjustified geo-blocking regulation, the fines against Valve et al. show that geo-blocking can still be a legal minefield as contractual agreements to restrict cross-border sales run counter to the bloc&#8217;s antitrust rules.</p>
<p>The specific breaches are of <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E101">Article 101</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area which prohibit agreements between companies that prevent, restrict or distort competition within the EU&#8217;s Single Market, per the Commission.</span></p>
<p><strong>Update 2: </strong>Valve has now sent additional details of its disagreement with the Commission&#8217;s findings, and denied that it did not cooperate with the investigation. It also warned the elimination of region locks could result in games publishers raising prices in some &#8220;less affluent&#8221; regions to avoid price arbitrage.</p>
<p>Its spokesman told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the seven year investigation, Valve cooperated extensively with the European Commission (“EC”), providing evidence and information as requested.  However, Valve declined to admit that it broke the law, as the EC demanded.  Valve disagrees with the EC findings and the fine levied against Valve.</p>
<p>The EC’s charges do not relate to the sale of PC games on Steam – Valve’s PC gaming service. Instead the EC alleges that Valve enabled geo-blocking by providing Steam activation keys and – upon the publishers’ request – locking those keys to particular territories (“region locks”) within the EEA.  Such keys allow a customer to activate and play a game on Steam when the user has purchased it from a third-party reseller. Valve provides Steam activation keys free of charge and does not receive any share of the purchase price when a game is sold by third-party resellers (such as a retailer or other online store).</p>
<p>The region locks only applied to a small number of game titles.  Approximately just 3% of all games using Steam (and none of Valve’s own games) at the time were subject to the contested region locks in the EEA.</p>
<p>Valve believes that the EC’s extension of liability to a platform provider in these circumstances is not supported by applicable law. Nonetheless, because of the EC’s concerns, Valve actually turned off region locks within the EEA starting in 2015, unless those region locks were necessary for local legal requirements (such as German content laws) or geographic limits on where the Steam partner is licensed to distribute a game.  The elimination of region locks may also cause publishers to raise prices in less affluent regions to avoid price arbitrage. There are no costs involved in sending activation keys from one country to another, and the activation key is all a user needs to activate and play a PC game.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>This report was updated with comment from Valve. We also made a correction after initially stating that the EU&#8217;s investigation had taken four years, starting in 2017. That was the date the Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_201">announced</a> it was launching an in-depth investigation. But, per Valve, the probe took longer &#8212; spanning seven years.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab has launched its 18th mission, and the first of 2021, as of 8:26 PM NZT (2:30 AM EST). The &#8220;Another One Leaves The Crust&#8221; mission took off from Rocket Lab&#8217;s Launch Complex 1 on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand, and flew a single communications microsatellite on behalf of client OHB Group, a satellite manufacturer based in Europe with facilities in Germany, Sweden and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab&#8217;s launches often feature payloads from more than one customer on the same Electron launch vehicle, but this dedicated payload launch is an example of how the flexibility of its smaller rocket can serve customers even for single small satellite missions. The rocket successfully delivered its payload as intended shortly following take-off.</p>
<p>While Rocket Lab has been developing and testing a booster stage recovery process to help it re-use part of its launch vehicles on subsequent flights, this particular mission did not include a recovery attempt. The company has had significant success with that development process however, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/rocket-lab-makes-its-first-booster-recovery-after-successful-launch/">recovered its first booster last year</a>. Sometime this year, it&#8217;s expected to attempt a recovery that includes a mid-air catch of the returning first stage via helicopter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
