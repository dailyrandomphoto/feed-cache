					<description><![CDATA[Klarity replaces humans for tasks that require large-scale document review, including accounting order forms, purchase orders and agreements.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reviewing repetitive documents is, well, repetitive, but <a href="https://www.tryklarity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klarity</a> believes people don’t have to do all of that and is building an artificial intelligence tool, targeting finance and accounting departments, that turns documents into structured data.</p>
<p>Document automation is not a new concept. There was an original wave of companies working on partial document automation, which still needs a human review, but Ondrej Antos, Klarity’s co-founder and CEO, explained that the full document automation market is still very nascent.</p>
<p>“Partial document automation companies did not achieve much scale due to the limited value of their product,” he said via email. “Full automation has the ability to replace human review for a vast majority of documents — over 85% in Klarity’s case — and with a higher accuracy. This generates a lot of value, not only for large enterprises, but also mid-market companies that have a few hundred documents every month and the market is therefore much larger.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260899" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Antos founded Klarity in 2017 with Nischal Nadhamuni whom he met at MIT. They bonded over Antos’ experience of having to review large amounts of data when he was a corporate lawyer. Nadhamuni was studying Natural Language Processing and thought it could be applied to  understand documents better than humans. In August 2020, the product was launched.</p>
<p>Klarity replaces humans for tasks that require large-scale document review, including accounting order forms, purchase orders and agreements. Instead of having many accountants reading thousands of almost identical documents every month to find non-standard language, Klarity does that, helping the accountants save time and avoid mistakes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260904" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260904" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2260904" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png" alt="Klarity" width="1024" height="612" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png 1590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=1536,918 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260904" class="wp-caption-text">An example of Klarity&#8217;s document automation. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Klarity</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the last nine months, the company saw its annual recurring revenue grow nine times and over 24 times year over year, prompting Klarity to raise new capital to invest in sales and marketing to scale and continue investing in R&amp;D. It is also currently working with more than 40 enterprise and mid-market customers, including Coupa, Optimizely and 8&#215;8.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $18 million in a Series A funding round led by Tola Capital. As part of the investment, Sheila Gulati, founder and managing director of Tola Capital, joins Klarity’s board of directors. To date, Klarity has raised just over $20 million.</p>
<p>New investors also participating in the round are Invus Opportunities and a group of individual investors, including executives from its customers 8&#215;8 and Coupa. Existing investors following on include Elad Gil, Daniel Gross, Nat Friedman and Picus Capital.</p>
<p>The company is focused on hiring sales, marketing and engineering. It has 34 employees, up from 14 a year ago. It is also poised to launch new document review automation use cases for deal desk, renewals and procurement teams in late 2022.</p>
<p>“Today, the vast majority of enterprises don’t even realize there is a technological solution to this omnipresent problem,” Antos said. “We will help to educate the market that there is a technical solution to the age-old problem of document review by accounting teams and to continue building a market-leading product.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peloton ended 2020 on top. Its own supply chain issues had presented a hurdle &#8212; but if anything, these were side effects of the company’s own stratospheric successes. It simply <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/peloton-will-pump-100m-into-delivery-logistics-to-ease-supply-concerns/">couldn’t keep up with demand</a>, one of the better problems to have as a business on the rise. Always leave them wanting more, as P.T. Barnum may or may not have once said.</p>
<p>The connected fitness firm had already developed a kind of cultish following in various upscale circles, well before most of us had an inkling of knowledge about novel coronaviruses. But the pandemic accelerated Peloton’s success beyond what most could have reasonably predicted. Gyms across the world began to shut down, and with everyone stuck inside, home fitness provided a solution. Peloton, offering some extra connectedness in a socially distanced world, was a hit.</p>
<p>Investors bought in, sending Peloton&#8217;s share from around $30 at the start of 2020 to above $160 in the closing days of the year. In 2021, however, things hit the skids, with Peloton falling to around $36 by the end of last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Those declines have continued. Last week, things truly hit the wall at Peloton. A continued erosion in demand as gyms began to reopen has seemingly put the company on red alert. With hundreds of millions spent on manufacturing to meet a spike in demand, Peloton’s top brass appear to have seen the pandemic as less of a one-in-a-100-year-event and more the beginnings of something larger.</p>
<p>Following reports that the company had employed consulting firm McKinsey to facilitate restructuring and layoffs, Peloton lost ground. Further reports &#8212; partially denied by CEO John Foley &#8212; suggested the company was halting production across its line of treadmills and stationary bikes, and were more bad news for the value of the company.</p>
<p>And this morning, Jason Aintabi, the chief investment officer of activist investor Blackwells Capital, issued a letter to Peloton’s directors, calling for Foley’s immediate termination and imploring the board to consider selling Peloton.</p>
<p>Writes Aintabi:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the pandemic offered Peloton a tremendous and unexpected opportunity to accelerate consumer adoption of its category-defining products and drive performance of the business and value for shareholders. With the stock now trading below the IPO price, and down more than 80% from its high, it is clear that the Company, the executives and the Board have squandered this opportunity.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the Company is on worse footing today than it was prior to the pandemic, with high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders. And no wonder, the latter, given that Peloton underperformed every other company in the Nasdaq 100 over the last twelve months.</p></blockquote>
<p>The letter concludes, “The ride for Mr. Foley is over. This Board must now independently chart a new path for Peloton.”</p>
<p>Blackwells, which acquired a significant stake of less than 5% of the company, per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-investor-to-call-on-peloton-to-fire-its-ceo-11642982211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, cites a laundry list of “leadership failures,” outlining what has been an undeniable roller coaster for Peloton since the pandemic began. Included are: Committing to a 20-year lease on a massive office space in New York City, Foley’s handling of a massive product recall after the death of a young child, promoting his wife to an executive position inside the company and large investments in increased manufacturing capacity, which were ultimately shuttered over decreased demand.</p>
<p>Last week, Foley broke from a pre-earnings “quiet period” to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/peloton-ceo-acknowledges-corrective-actions-denies-halting-all-production-of-bikes-and-treadmills/">address some of the reports</a> that have swirled around the company, calling news that it was halting all production false. He did, however, confirm that adjustments to production and headcount were seemingly inevitable.</p>
<p>“In the past, we’ve said layoffs would be the absolute last lever we would ever hope to pull,” the executive wrote. “However, we now need to evaluate our organization structure and size of our team, with the utmost care and compassion. And we are still in the process of considering all options as part of our efforts to make our business more flexible.”</p>
<p>Foley chided press coverage derived from a series of leaks, calling it, “incomplete, out of context, and not reflective of Peloton’s strategy,” and promised to offer more information on the company’s strategy during its February earnings call.</p>
<p>Blackwells, for its part, doesn’t pull any punches in the letter.</p>
<p>“We recognize that Mr. Foley undoubtedly regards Peloton as ‘his’ company and you, the Company’s directors, as ‘his’ Board,” Aintabi writes. “He has outsized influence and outsized voting power by virtue of his status as founder. Perhaps some of you – friends with Mr. Foley for many years – feel obligated to do as he wishes. But the law and equity markets expect more. You are not here to preserve Mr. Foley’s dignity or his pride. Your role, as directors, is not to protect him from embarrassment or to shield him from blame.”</p>
<p>The situation that Peloton finds iteself in is not entirely unique. Other companies that enjoyed huge pandemic-era gains have seen their values fall back to prior levels. Zoom, the video chat service that became ubiquitous during COVID, has given back nearly all of its recent gains. By late March of 2020, Zoom was worth as much as $150 per share, up from the high $60s per share at the start of the year. It rose to around $560 before falling back to $144 or so as of today.</p>
<p>Not all the news is bad. Peloton bottomed-out at $23.25 per share per <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PTON/">Yahoo Finance</a>, but has since recovered to more than $27 (at the time of writing). That the company intends to cut costs is welcome news from a financial perspective. And its huge hardware bonanza of the last few years has certainly led to more bikes in the market. Perhaps those new users will hold onto their subscriptions, continuing to pump high-margin software revenues into the company&#8217;s accounts as it looks to trim headcount and other expenses.</p>
<p>But cutting to profitability is not where Peloton likely anticipated to find itself just a few quarters ago.</p>
<p>The company is worth just under $9 billion today. A price at which it is far more acquirable than it was a year ago. The number of companies that could afford to buy Peloton at a single-digit billions price tag is modest; the number of firms that could afford to pay dozens of billions for Peloton was vanishingly slim.</p>
<p>Who is on the list? Apple, perhaps, though today Peloton is an Android hardware shop. Google then? Probably not. Microsoft is out, Amazon won&#8217;t do it, and our list is getting thin. It&#8217;s not a metaverse company, so Meta is a no, and what gym group has the cash to make a buy of Peloton&#8217;s scale? Private equity might be able to juice the company for upside if costs can come down enough, but that feels like a stretch.</p>
<p>Sitting where we are today, it doesn&#8217;t seem like a sale is imminent, given the value retained by Peloton even after its sharp selloff. That means that the company likely has to tune its own engine. Keeping its CEO during that process could prove impossible if investors continue to demand restitution in the form of executive blood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industrial drones &#8212; the enterprise complement to the unmanned aerial vehicles that consumers own for leisurely use &#8212; are taking off in the market, fueled by a <a href="https://t.co/vp0SOMiCEp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new wave</a> of software and hardware technology that improves their battery life, reach and performance, and a growing number of organizations investing in these services to raise their data operations games. Today, a company focused specifically on developing AI for drones for maritime deployments is announcing a round of funding after seeing strong demand for its devices and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tekever.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tekever</a>, which builds drones with integrated AI specifically tailored for monitoring and detecting activity on water, has raised €20 million (just under $23 million at today&#8217;s rates). Ventura Capital led the round with participation from Iberis Capital and a number of unnamed strategic investors from the maritime industry. It will be using the funding to hire more people, and to continue building out its technology.</p>
<p>Tekever &#8212; based, fittingly, in historic maritime superpower Lisbon, Portugal &#8212; was founded back in 2001 and has only been offering commercial services since 2018. But it has been profitable for some time now and expects to grow at a CAGR of 60% over the next three years. And indeed, this is the company&#8217;s first outside funding, made to double down on expanding its technology and selling to a wider set of organizations as the business opportunity grows.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261093" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tekever&#8217;s customers include governments and their agencies, which use the company&#8217;s services to monitor waters for illegal activity; and private shipping and other seafaring companies, which use the drones to track weather patterns, traffic on the water, and other physical activity that might impact their businesses.</p>
<p>Tekever was started by a team of intelligence and AI specialists, and co-founder and CEO Ricardo Mendes describes it as a vertically-integrated business, where it designs and makes both its drones and the technology that is loaded onto them to monitor and &#8220;read&#8221; what is going on in the water below, and even predict what might happen next.</p>
<p>A vertically-integrated drone company is not such a rare thing, but what is a little more unusual is the order in which way Tekever built its stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started from the opposite direction of every other company working in the drone sector,&#8221; Mendes joked. The company first set out to build the technology to read its terrain &#8212; in its case, bodies of water &#8212; and then built drones fit for the purpose of making its software work. That included specific antennae, sensors and power integrated into the body of the aircraft themselves. (This also makes it essentially, at this point, impossible for the software to work on other aircraft.) The software, meanwhile, is architected to work using a mix of edge AI, satellite communications and cloud computing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Building your own very specialized drone hardware is hard (and expensive). But that was intentional, it turns out. Tekever sells both components but most commonly operates its own fleet and sells drone-based surveillance services to users, branded Atlas, which Mendes described to me as &#8220;intelligence as a service.&#8221; He said that approach was specifically taken to make its products as widely accessible as possible, since its drones &#8212; with wingspans that start at two meters and can be as wide as eight meters, with flying times as long as 20 hours &#8212; are too cost-prohibitive for anyone but the very biggest customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question we set out to answer was, &#8216;what do you need to do to make this simple and available all over the world, not just to the richest nations?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The drones are just one part of the chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an example of how Tekever is used, both the European Maritime Security Agency (EMSA) and the United Kingdom’s Home Office customers, but so are smaller African republics. They variously use the technology to monitor their waters for vessels involved in piracy, drugs, human trafficking, migrant smuggling, pollution, illegal fishing, or infrastructure security threats.</p>
<p>A recent report in the Guardian laid bare how European government agencies are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/06/fortress-europe-the-millions-spent-on-military-grade-tech-to-deter-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investing millions of euros on drones and other military technology</a> to expand their surveillance of refugee groups, its clear message being that those investments are not deterring illegal migration and are only encouraging vulnerable people to take even more risky routes. Others in the space like Anduril have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/anduril-funding-series-d-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaped huge financial rewards</a> arguably on the back of their own <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-03/tech-s-most-controversial-startup-now-makes-attack-drones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversy</a>. But Tekever&#8217;s CEO and founder believes that his company not only fills a specific technical gap in the market, but that its use ensures more good than it does harm.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are talking about vast regions like the ocean there are a lot of unknowns about what is going on,&#8221; he said. Typically, organizations have relied on satellite imagery to get pictures of what is going on in the water, but this is not ideal since most satellite imagery is days old by the time it&#8217;s seen by a user. &#8220;Fishing, smuggling, trafficking, immigration &#8212; these are all areas where real-time intelligence required. It’s not just footage, but the beginning of solving the problem. The objective is that you should be able to act before something bad happens,&#8221; and, because Tekever is also using predictive analytics, to preview what will come.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are doing is gathering vast amounts of data to solve problems as they occur,&#8221; he said, noting that even having an extra five minutes to respond can make a difference because of how fast conditions can change in the water. For the UK&#8217;s Home Office, for example, he noted that one priority has been to identify migrant boats in the English Channel to help escort them to shore, to avoid potentially tragic accidents. &#8220;The press focuses on migration issue itself but it’s a huge humanitarian issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Going forward, there is a vast amount &#8212; a sea, even &#8212; of ways that Tekever might develop its technology. Looking at and making sense of bodies of water requires the crunching of vast amounts of data, Mendes said, but that also gives the company a large number of datasets that could be put to use, too. It has yet to be able to read submarine activity, something that today needs lidar and radar on seacraft to identify; but that is an area it&#8217;s starting to develop. Another is to identify and classify oil spills, he said.</p>
<p>Right now, Tekever&#8217;s focus remains on what Mendes described to me as &#8220;the blue economy&#8221;, but it is also breaking ground on&#8230; ground. Its focus seems to be to continue trying to create new ways of looking at the most complicated terrains. One area he noted it wants to do more in is forest and specifically rainforest. It invested in a Brazilian drone company, Santos Lab, several years ago, giving it a foothold in that part of the world.</p>
<p>“Tekever is a very unconventional UAS company and a market leader with outclass technology, thousands of hours of operational experience, a seasoned leadership team and a phenomenal and profitable business vision in a fast-growing market,&#8221; said Mo El Husseiny, managing partner at Ventura Capital, in a statement. “These attributes have made it a flagship investment for Ventura, aligned to our portfolio of disruptors in technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Tekever is one of the hottest European Deeptech scaleups, and we’re very proud to continue working with the team and helping them disrupt the global market” added Diogo Chalbert Santos, a partner at Iberis Capital. “It’s amazing what Tekever has already achieved as a bootstrapped business and I’d say not even the sky is a limit with this round.” (It seems that Santos can&#8217;t resist a pun, an investor after my own heart.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside the dramatic <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-ecommerce-forecast-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth</a> in e-commerce, in part <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/05/1091182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fueled by the pandemic</a>, there&#8217;s also increased demand for services that can help merchants more easily participate online. A startup called <a href="https://soona.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soona</a>, now backed by an additional $35 million in Series B funding, has been tapping into this market with its platform that allows brands to create content for their e-commerce websites and marketing through &#8220;virtual&#8221; photo and video shoots. That is, instead of having merchants ship off their items for a remote photo shoot, then wait for the results, Soona&#8217;s technology allows the brands to participate in the photo shoot process, both remotely and in real time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We invite you to join your photo shoot in the browser. It&#8217;s not all that different than you and I joining a Zoom meeting,&#8221; explains Soona co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethgiorgi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liz Giorgi</a>. &#8220;You click on the calendar invitation and your photo shoot appears in the browser where you can see every single photo and video clip as it&#8217;s captured in real time. Those assets are there for you to interact with, so the customers or the teams can give feedback on those assets to the photographer,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2261138" style="width: 516px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261138" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2261138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?w=506" alt="" width="506" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=223,300 223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=768,1031 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=506,680 506w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2261138" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Soona</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261101" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Soona&#8217;s customers can communicate to the photographer if they want to do things like change the composition, add or remove props from the scene or anything else they want to tweak about the photo shoot. What&#8217;s more, the merchants appreciate how they don&#8217;t have to pay upfront for the service. Instead, they&#8217;ll pay $39 per photo or $93 per video clip, and only have to purchase the assets they actually want. Once their selection is made, the photos and videos are delivered within 24 hours, ready to be uploaded to the merchants&#8217; website or marketing channels. Merchants can also visit their past shoots at any time and order more content.</p>
<p>The business&#8217;s success has now led to a new infusion of capital, as Soona is announcing today it&#8217;s received $35 million in new funding led by Bain Capital Ventures. Prior investors Union Square Ventures, Matchstick Ventures, Starting Line Ventures, 2048 Ventures and Range Ventures also participated in the round, bringing the company&#8217;s total raise to date to $51 million.</p>
<p>Giorgi&#8217;s background is in professional media production. Before starting Soona, she ran her own internet video production company, Mighteor, after working in media and television production. She says the experience has given her a good eye for determining how to make content, and specifically, how to make content beautiful. Her co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayleyanderson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hayley Anderson</a>, meanwhile, has a background in animation and was a creative director at Mighteor, which was later <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/11/04/standard-youtube-community-acquires-mighteor-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by</a> creator network Standard.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2261135" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261135" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2261135" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/founderphotos-23.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/founderphotos-23.jpg 4480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/founderphotos-23.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/founderphotos-23.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/founderphotos-23.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/founderphotos-23.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/founderphotos-23.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/founderphotos-23.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/founderphotos-23.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2261135" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Soona; Hayley Anderson and Liz Giorgi</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The duo founded Soona in 2019, launching their initial product the same year. In its earlier days, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/soona-seed-funding/">Soona worked by</a> having customers come into actual studios for their photo and video shoots, while using software that offered quick uploads of the footage for the customers to shop from immediately. But the pandemic forced Soona to readjust and switch to a virtual model. As it turned out, embracing this model has helped the business grow not only during the height of the pandemic, when in-person activities shut down, but also in the months since as remote work became more of a business norm. Soona grew its revenue 400% from 2020 to 2021, then another 300% from 2021 to 2022. The company won&#8217;t share its annual revenue figures, however, citing its competitive advantage in keeping its business metrics private.</p>
<p>Today, Soona has served around 10,000 merchants, including customers like Wild Earth, Lola Tampons, The Sill, SNOW, Birchbox and others, but not via a subscription model. Instead, it&#8217;s a transactional business &#8212; but one Giorgi believes has found the right product-market fit, as 63% of its revenue on a monthly basis last year came from repeat customers. Around 60% of its customers are $1 million to $5 million e-commerce stores, many of which are building on Shopify. The company is strong in cosmetics, beauty, wellness, fashion and footwear, and is now growing more in consumer packaged goods and nutrition products.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we may not have a recurring business model, there is a high level of reoccurrence to how often brands need these assets. And so by making it possible for them to choose when and how they&#8217;re going to spend money and make investments in these visual assets, we&#8217;ve made it really easy for them to continue to work with Soona,&#8221; notes Giorgi. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not taking subscriptions off the table,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Today, there are other businesses that allow merchants to ship in products for remote photo shoots, like Pow Photography, but they don&#8217;t offer Soona&#8217;s real-time experience. And some rivals primarily focus on &#8220;product-on-white&#8221; photography &#8212; product images on white backgrounds for traditional e-commerce sites &#8212; as opposed to the richer content created by pairing products with models in photos shot in living rooms or kitchen sets, for example. Meanwhile, other competitors work to connect merchants with photographers directly in more of a marketplace-style offering.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2261139" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261139" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2261139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/virtual-shoot_desktop-1.gif?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-2261139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Soona</p></div></p>
<p>Soona&#8217;s proprietary technology, however, offers the customers everything they need to plan their photo shoot online, including access to models &#8212; both human and pet! &#8212; and stylists. Models work on a contract basis, similar to other gig economy jobs. But Soona&#8217;s photographers can either take on the jobs as gigs or transition to full-time employees. Today, there are around 35 full-time photographers on staff, and roughly 100 on contract.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, Soona is looking to grow its marketplace of model services, which is now one of the quickest-growing segments of its business &#8212; 20% of the total business in 2021, in fact. Soona plans to triple the size of this platform in 2022 to bring on more types of diverse talent and new ways of showing off products for its merchant customers. It will also invest in technology that will help make more recommendations to brands about what type of photo shoots to create by asking for select business data and the merchant&#8217;s goals. Already, Soona has launched Amazon and Instagram-recommended shoots, and is planning to launch something similar for TikTok.</p>
<p>The company also plans to expand its API platform, to grow its set of integrations beyond Shopify, which today accounts for 55% of its customer base. Going forward, Soona aims to integrate with other pieces of the e-commerce technology stack, like Klayvio or BigCommerce, for example.</p>
<p>The company, which has hubs in Denver, Austin and the Twin Cities, will also triple its engineering team by adding engineers outside the current team in Minneapolis. It will grow its product team as well.</p>
<p>Giorgi declined to speak to Soona&#8217;s current valuation, but noted Soona is &#8220;on the path&#8221; toward becoming the next female-founded unicorn. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to get there very soon,&#8221; she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Quite a number of earlier-stage deals are going to get done at prices that might not make sense in a few months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well, here we are.</p>
<p>The bad things are still happening: The U.S. stock market opened in the red this morning, with broad indices losing ground (the S&amp;P 500 is off 2.3%) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking even more punishment (off 2.7%).</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closer to home for startups are cloud stocks, a collection of companies that sell software along modern lines &#8212; read: SaaS via public cloud. They&#8217;re taking even heavier blows, with<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WCLD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> one key index</a> off 3.33% at the moment I write this to you.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But that damage is modest compared to what is going on in the decentralized world, with major cryptos falling sharply, again, adding to their seven-day losses. A quick (rounded) <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update on the red ink</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin: -3% last 24 hours, off 20% in the last week</li>
<li>Ether: -7% last 24 hours, off 30% in the last week</li>
<li>Cardano: -7% last 24 hours, off 32% in the last week</li>
<li>Sol: -11% last 24 hours, -39% in the last week</li>
</ul>
<p>That screaming sound you hear in the background is every trader who was holding leveraged longs on decentralized assets. If you bought the last dip, you just got punched. If you bought the dip with extra hot sauce, you took an even greater loss. (I don&#8217;t mean to make light here; if you are seriously taking hits, care for yourself, and remember that all money is an invention.)</p>
<p>The result of the carnage is that late-stage valuations are starting to stutter. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/swoon-in-tech-stocks-puts-startup-valuations-in-harsh-new-light-11642762808" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal interviewed Mary D’Onofrio of Bessemer Venture Partners</a> &#8212; a regular here on The Exchange &#8212; about the selloff last week, before today&#8217;s added pain. She said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The public market reset is affecting how we think about our private-market entry prices for VC deals.</p></blockquote>
<p>D’Onofrio is a growth-stage investor, so her notes here carry quite a lot of weight. More simply, the translation from public market pullback to private market reset is already underway, but on enough of a time delay that the earlier stages of startup investment are unlikely to feel it for a while yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this era of remote work, people want as much flexibility as possible to live where they want, when they want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no surprise that we’ve seen a flurry of startups emerge to give people more options for long-term stays. </span><a href="https://www.anyplace.com/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=ru" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one such startup. A self-described “digital nomad,” Satoru Steve Naito says he co-founded San Francisco-based Anyplace in 2017 because he wanted the product for himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to its name, Anyplace began its life as a marketplace that gives people the option to book hotels or rentals for 30 days or more nearly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">anyplace</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they want to. That marketplace today is across over 60 countries in more than 450 cities. And now, the startup is moving into an operator role with its latest product, Anyplace Select, which is designed for remote workers and corporate travelers to be able to work from anywhere with furnished apartments that include a “fully equipped” home office.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260513" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the pandemic has raged on and offices continue to be shut down, more people have had the flexibility to move around like never before. Anyplace launched Select last year in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and San Diego, and achieved a $1 million run rate within seven months of its launch, according to Naito, who serves as the company’s CEO. Monthly revenue growth of the Select offering is over 50% on average and, as of this month, its occupancy rate is over 90%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyplace partners with real estate developers such as Greystar and AvalonBay to rent units, furnish them and then master leases them out at a higher price with its select offering. Each apartment has a “fully equipped office setup” and comes with a flexible-term contract (minimum of 30 days). They include a height-adjustable standing desk, ergonomic chair, 34-inch “ultra-wide” monitor, professional microphone, webcam, collapsible green screen, laptop stand, docking station and key light, among other things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every Select apartment provides the same or higher level of productivity as a home office,” Naito said. “Wi-Fi speed will never be an issue either, as all units have gigabit internet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would a remote worker who wants to try living in another city not just rent a place on Airbnb? The ability to have a house or apartment set up for remote work is not as easy to find as one might think, Naito contends &#8212; some offerings might have slow Wi-Fi while others might not offer an adequate desk or dedicated workspace. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most current accommodations optimize for pre-pandemic stays. People really worked all day from their rooms while staying in hotels or Airbnb,” Naito said. “However, in the post-pandemic world, people are spending more time making Zoom calls and working from their rooms. So we are creating accommodations optimized for the post-pandemic world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, Airbnb has historically focused on short-term rentals, but now the hospitality giant is seeing an increase in longer-term rentals on its marketplace &#8212; evidence that there is increased demand for longer-term rentals. Last May, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told Yahoo Finance that 24% of Airbnb stays </span><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-q1-earnings-booking-longer-than-28-days-131056944.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were 28 days or more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; compared to 14% just two years prior. In further evidence of its belief in the trend, Airbnb also recently backed another startup in the space, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/zeus-living-closes-on-55m-to-offer-flexible-furnished-rentals-as-it-expands-beyond-corporate-housing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeus Living</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which started out focusing on offering flexible options for corporate travelers but is now expanding to a broader pool of potential customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Anyplace had just been operating a marketplace, it is now shifting its broader business focus to be an operator with its new Select offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, Airbnb is not our competitor, but a partner and actually one of our biggest acquisition channels,” Naito told TechCrunch. “I don&#8217;t believe Airbnb will move into the operator space, with their own inventory. Their strength is in the platform business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To “aggressively” expand its inventory into other markets and continue to improve its functionality, Anyplace is announcing today that it has raised $5.3 million in a Series A financing led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GA Technologies,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with participation from J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ason Calacanis, Launch Fund, Japanese soccer star and Dreamers Ventures co-founder (with Will Smith) Keisuke Honda, Mercari co-founder Hiroshi Tomishima and East Ventures. The round brings Anyplace’s total raised to $8 million, and will go also toward boosting its current headcount of 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has already begun raising capital for its next round, already receiving “several investment commitments,” according to Naito, due to the company’s “rapid growth and the surge in demand for the kind of accommodations that Anyplace Select offers.” Specifically, the startup is looking to expand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to major cities in the U.S., particularly to popular vacation destinations such as Hawaii, Miami, Austin and Denver, Naito said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People no longer have to quit their full-time jobs to become digital nomads. Before the pandemic, people had to leave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their companies and become freelancers or small business owners in order to live a nomadic lifestyle,” Naito told TechCrunch. “But now, tech giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter are allowing their employees to work remotely full time…The pandemic has created many new types of nomads. So this is a major paradigm shift in the way people work.”</span></p>

He has overcome the language and various other barriers that immigrant founders face,” Honda said. “ I believe that grit is one of the most important things to succeed in a startup. Also, I was impressed by the fact that he built the product he wanted, and that he himself lives and works in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honda added that as a soccer player, he has traveled to many countries and stayed in “many hotels and Airbnb rentals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have never seen accommodations like Anyplace Select with a fully equipped office environment,” he told TechCrunch. “Obviously, the number of people who work from home has been increasing and they don&#8217;t want to live only in one place. Anyplace Select will be the standard accommodation for such people in the post-pandemic world.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based Venture fund <a href="https://www.swiftarcventures.com/">Swiftarc Ventures</a> is launching a new fund dubbed Swiftarc Telehealth to take advantage of the boom in Telehealth-focused startups which have emerged, partly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The $75 million fund will focus on three initial areas:  Obesity, Mental &amp; Behavioral Health, and Pediatrics. It will also look at startups in Remote Patient Monitoring, Chronic Care Management, and In-Home Evaluations.</p>
<p>The timing is good. It’s estimated that over 10 years’ worth of Telehealth legislation was pushed forward in the US in less than 3 months, and more than three-fourths of the US population has now utilized some form of telemedicine. The continued reimbursement support of virtual visits in the field of psychiatry and mental health is also looking like an area of expansion. In Obesity Care, Swiftcare says dietitians, clinicians and primary care physicians being able to communicate with each other on a platform is likely to be an opportunity for tech startups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260312" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Swiftarc will also draw on the expertise of medical experts including Sloan Saunders, Co-founder, and CEO of Intellihealth, and Dr. Paul Bedocs, a leading dermatologist, as members of the Swiftarc Medical Advisory board.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.swiftarcventures.com/sid">Sid Jawahar</a>, founder and managing partner of Swiftarc Ventures.</p>
<p>Sid Jawahar, Founder and Managing Partner at Swiftarc Ventures said: “We feel good about<br />
participating in areas of healthcare that have been historically underserved. Being curious, impactful, and deliberate are the three core tenets with which we began. Our goal is to fundamentally disrupt standard, antiquated healthcare delivery models and to find innovative solutions to improve access to high-quality care, ultimately reshaping the patient healthcare experience forever.”</p>
<p>Swiftarc believes that this platform-based telemedicine approach may well help control other related and serious health conditions like diabetes and hypertension at pre-onset stage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Jawahar added: “We had not really been participating directly in healthcare deals, which all changed when we saw telehealth becoming the next frontier. That led to a really a deep, exhaustive 14-month study of the industry. We really wanted to roll up our sleeves and talk to the folks that had been in it for a long time. There&#8217;s a lot of really interesting fragmented activity in telehealth. We looked at 15 health centers, everything from cardiology to neurology to dermatology to see how virtual care would fundamentally augment how healthcare was being performed. And where we landed was on these three use cases we thought were the most efficacious today: Mental Health, obesity, and pediatrics.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fathom.video/">Fathom</a>, a startup that is building an AI notetaker for Zoom, today announced that it has raised a $4.7 million seed round from a range of early-stage investors, including Zoom&#8217;s own Apps Fund. Other investors include the likes of early Zoom investors Maven Ventures, Bill Tai and Matt Ocko, early-stage funds Character.vc, Active Capital, Global Founders Capital, Rackhouse.vc and Soma Capital, as well as the CEOs of Reddit, Twitch, Cruise, Mercury, People.ai, Snapdocs and Shogun. That&#8217;s a broad coalition of investors, one that&#8217;s surely in part driven by the fact that Fathom founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rrwhite/">Richard White</a> also previously built <a href="https://uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was actually at UserVoice where I got the idea for what&#8217;s now turned into Fathom because I was doing a lot of research and customer calls in service of investigating a different product we were building at UserVoice,&#8221; White told me. &#8220;I think it was kind of January 2020 [&#8230;] and I did like 300 Zoom calls in that first month. It was kind of crazy. I&#8217;m not sure why I signed up to that many research calls. I got really well acquainted to what a terrible experience it is to have to talk to people all day long and type notes at the same time &#8212; and then after the call is over, clean up those notes so that they make sense. It&#8217;s a very stressful kind of process and you worry you&#8217;re going to miss something.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260978" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260978" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2260978" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2260978" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fathom</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260977" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To fix that, White and his team built Fathom to make it easy to not just automatically record and transcribe every Zoom call, but also to quickly generate summaries after the call which can then be emailed to participants or imported into a CRM system, for example. During a call, all you have to do is highlight important parts using the service&#8217;s Zoom or desktop app.</p>
<p>While sales teams are some of the obvious users for this kind of service &#8212; they tend to have a lot of Zoom calls these days, after all &#8212; White argues that there is also a wider market for a service like this and that none of the features are necessarily sales-specific. &#8220;Overall, we try to build a platform that is useful for anyone that&#8217;s on a decent number of Zoom calls per week,&#8221; said White.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260979" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260979" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2260979" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?w=300" alt="Fathom founder and CEO Richard White" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2260979" class="wp-caption-text">Fathom founder and CEO Richard White</p></div></p>
<p>To create this product, White took some work that had already been done at UserVoice and then spun that out as a new company &#8212; and in the process, the team also made it into Y Combinator. That may seem like a bit of an odd choice for a seasoned entrepreneur, but as White noted, a lot has changed in the last few years and simply having a cohort of like-minded founders that are going through the same processes is a very useful thing to have. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned probably as much from the common curriculum at YC as I have from having this peer network of people that are all hustling and doing the same thing,&#8221; White noted. He also likened YC to a startup union that can help with fundraising and negotiating with vendors, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of now, Fathom is available for free, with plans to add paid features over time (though the core experience will remain free). As of now, though, support for other platforms like Google Meet or Microsoft Teams is not on the roadmap.</p>
<p>“Zoom has already transformed our lives and the way we do business &#8211; now that we live on video, the need and opportunity for <span class="il">Fathom</span> is obvious,&#8221; said Jim Scheinman, early Zoom investor and Founding Managing Partner at Maven Ventures. &#8220;The <span class="il">Fathom</span> team is incredibly strong and experienced, and they&#8217;re solving a key problem that Zoom customers face on a daily basis and will change the way people experience their business calls for the better. Being one of the first deeply integrated Zoom Apps opens the door for massive growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fathom, of course, isn&#8217;t the only company trying to solve this problem. <a href="https://www.chorus.ai/product/ai-for-revenue-teams">Chorus</a> similarly tries to provide AI-driven solutions for sales calls, for example, while services like <a href="https://www.gong.io/">Gong</a> focus more on analyzing customer-facing interactions across platforms and <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter</a> mostly focuses on the transcription side of the process.</p>

<p>The pay-for-processing business model has always been a largely unquestioned mainstay within the cryptocurrency landscape. Since the inception of digital assets, investors, developers and enthusiasts have been subjected to paying a processing or “miner” fee on top of the cost of the actual token purchased.</p>
<p>In April 2021, the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average cost</a> of sending bitcoin reached an all-time high of $59, surpassing its peak in December <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-ltc-eth.html#alltime&amp;search=2017">2017</a>, when the average transaction fees skyrocketed to $52. Then there’s Ethereum and its notoriously high gas fees. In 2021, the blockchain saw a number of crypto networks leaving Ethereum in search of more sustainable options such as rival blockchain Solana.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Needless to say, investing in crypto is becoming increasingly more expensive. Right now, the majority of the ecosystem is becoming disgruntled by the exorbitant cost of crypto and its use cases, especially in relation to fees on Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, enthusiasts and speculators are gritting their teeth and bearing it, accepting it as an annoying trade-off that comes with their involvement in something that should revolutionize money.</p>
<p>However, what happens when that majority loses their enthusiasm to pursue other ways to transact and move value? We already see transactions on “centralized” services like Binance Smart Chain overtaking distributed systems like Ethereum because of a more competitive fee structure.</p>
<p>What will become of the dream of having a truly decentralized crypto ecosystem? Is it really impossible for decentralized networks to compete with centralized ones, from a transaction fee standpoint?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>It’s time for a free-market approach</h2>
<p>At present, the network economics of all current major public cryptocurrencies and blockchains ignore the need for utility-value-based pricing, which means that the price of transacting on a blockchain is not congruent with the customer’s perception of the utility value of making that transaction.</p>
<p>In other words, the fee range for transactions is not determined with the consumer’s needs in mind, nor the competitive landscape. In fact, there is little benefit for consumers when it comes to the pay-for-processing model since there is no cap on what fee can be charged for a transaction. Once fees amount to a large proportion of the value you are trying to transact, it can become inefficient and impractical to use such a network for those transactions.</p>
<p>While many would assume or hope that the network benefits from the real value of the utility provided to the user, the reality is that the pay-for-processing model only benefits crypto miners and other network stakeholders such as stakers, and not the users themselves.</p>
<p>For example, in Bitcoin, rewards are paid to miners for completing blocks of verified crypto transactions, and all fees are paid out to them. There remains an artificially scarce “block size” within which these transactions are processed, and miners have historically refused to let this block size increase.</p>
<p>Instead, they continue to demand higher fees to include transactions into a block. According to <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day">YChart</a>, Bitcoin miners’ average daily revenue stands around $47 million, up from around $29 million at the beginning of 2021, an increase of 62%.</p>
<p>In order for things to be sustainable in the long run, perhaps it’s time that transacting in crypto becomes beneficial to users by using utility-value-based pricing. It is high time that the world of digital assets adopts a conventional free-market economic approach, where the customer is always king.</p>
<h2>High transaction fees are a barrier to crypto network expansion</h2>
<p>Enthusiasts and early adopters will eventually become apathetic to a network, and when that time comes, pay-for-processing use cases for all these networks will most likely be reduced to only the transactions that users are willing to pay higher prices for – infrequent and higher-value settlements.</p>
<p>If this becomes a reality, value will be lost for a network’s stakeholders through under-pricing higher-value use-cases, while at the same time losing network revenue potentially derived from lower-value, high-volume use cases.</p>
<p>I refer to this impending scenario as utility mispricing — an inevitable fate for all cryptocurrency networks that rely on pay-for-processing to reward network stakeholders: that is, miners, masternode owners and stakers. The effects of utility mispricing include a decline in revenue and adoption of these networks, specifically at the point that there is an uptick in new user growth.</p>
<p>Ultimately, consumer confidence will wane, subsequently leading to a loss of brand equity, and this is likely to be fueled by negative media sentiment (as it is now, with relation to the exorbitant fees on the largest two crypto networks).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if any of the major cryptocurrency networks will ever solve this problem in an elegant and efficient manner, short of having to implement and get consensus for a complete refactoring of their network revenue model.</p>
<h2>Alternative business models are key for network revenue</h2>
<p>While the best-case scenario would be to not throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater, adopting completely new network revenue models may be the answer. Arguably, the utility-value-based pricing model for cryptocurrency is the most user-beneficial alternative model in which low to feeless transactions can take place.</p>
<p>To achieve this, networks must set pricing through governance that involves all stakeholders, allowing for both on-chain and off-chain stakeholders to have a say on pricing parameters.</p>
<p>An example of this is Nano, a feeless cryptocurrency network that utilizes open representative voting. Votes are shared and rebroadcasted between nodes, tallied up and compared against the online voting weight available. Once a node sees a block that has received a sufficient number of votes to reach quorum, that block is confirmed in less than a minute.</p>
<p>The network offers no direct monetary incentive for nodes, thus removing emergent centralization forces and positioning it for longer-term trending toward decentralization, although the question of how this model will scale when it loses the altruism of its participants remains unanswered.</p>
<p>Another example of a network finding its way around a pay-for-processing model is Koinos. Its aim is to provide a mass-market user experience on a blockchain through what they refer to as “mana” – operating much like the mana one would come across in a video game.</p>
<p>Every token on the network is assigned a set amount of mana – similar to purchasing a mobile device that comes with preloaded data, this form of “fuel” is expended when a user consumes network resources. In this way, feeless transactions are able to accrue to liquid token holders.</p>
<p>One could also refer to this approach as hold-to-play, where the users choose to keep their tokens liquid, preventing them from participating in any yield-generating activities. Once any of the mana in any given token is consumed, that token is locked for a period of time, with the purpose of creating an opportunity cost in lieu of a real-time monetary cost that serves to disincentivize the submission of value-less transactions. Therefore, making the mana fee mechanism more dynamic and scalable than charging explicit transaction fees.</p>
<p>While there are a handful of other emerging networks that are following a model that is driven by user satisfaction, only time will tell whether major cryptocurrencies will follow suit.</p>
<h2>Major cryptos’ viability to scale remains at risk</h2>
<p>Right now, major cryptocurrencies are managing to remain relevant because of user altruism and enthusiasm; networks do not yet need to think outside of the “pay-to-play” box. However, as time passes and the hype becomes measured against the network’s performance and competitiveness in light of alternatives, networks will need to rethink the pay-for-processing model and find new solutions that are beneficial to the user as well as the network itself.</p>
<p>In any other business, customers inform the value and relevance of a product. Currently, there is an illusion that crypto enterprises don’t have to adhere to the same system, but there will have to be a shift in due time.</p>
<p>Only by providing real value to users on decentralized networks that is comparable to centralized services can the longevity of any cryptocurrency project be ensured in the long run.</p>
<p>The existing crypto ecosystems must adapt and recognize the fact that users are stakeholders, too. It is critical to ensure a network’s business model allows pricing services appropriately across all its target use cases while earning and distributing enough network revenue to make the project attractive to its investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Netherlands&#8217; competition authority has fined Apple €5 million (~$5.6M) for failing to comply with conditions in an order requiring it to allow local dating apps to make user of third party payment technology in their apps.</p>
<p>The tech giant could be on the hook for another €5M fine next week if it doesn&#8217;t meet the regulatory requirement by then, and each week thereafter for a couple more months &#8212; up to a maximum of €50M in relation to this particular order.</p>
<p>The fine relates to an <a href="https://www.acm.nl/sites/default/files/documents/summary-of-decision-on-abuse-of-dominant-position-by-apple.pdf">order</a> made by Dutch watchdog, the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), last year &#8212; which found Apple in breach of antitrust rules and ordered it to adjust the conditions it imposes on dating app providers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261099" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At specific antitrust issue are App Store terms mandating the use of Apple&#8217;s own in-app payment infrastructure (aka the IAP API) for any sales of digital content, via which the tech giant extracts a commission.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s terms also ban the use of alternative payment systems by dating apps.</p>
<p>T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he regulator also took issue with Apple banning dating apps</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from referring to other payment methods in their apps.</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/apple-fails-satisfy-requirements-set-acm">ACM said today</a> that Apple has failed to satisfy its conditions and must make amendments to bring the rules for dating apps in line with its order.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the App Store, dating-app providers must also be able to use payment systems other than Apple’s payment system. In addition, dating-app providers must have the ability to refer to payment systems outside of the app,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The full detail of Apple&#8217;s continued infringements are not clearly stated. But the biggie seems to be Apple has not yet done what it was asked and <em>actually </em>made it possible for dating app providers to use other payment systems.</p>
<p>The Dutch regulator also criticises barriers it suggests Apple has erected to make it more difficult for dating app providers to use non-Apple payment infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple has failed to satisfy the requirements on several points,&#8221; the ACM writes. &#8220;The most important one is that Apple has failed to adjust its conditions, as a result of which dating-app providers are still unable to use other payment systems. At the moment, dating-app providers can merely express their ‘interest’.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, Apple has raised several barriers for dating-app providers to the use of third-party payment systems. That, too, is at odds with ACM’s requirements. For example, Apple seemingly forces app providers to make a choice: either refer to payment systems outside of the app or to an alternative payment system. That is not allowed. Providers must be able to choose both options.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The ACM told Apple it would need to amend conditions for dating apps in a decision last year. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But &#8212; as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/apple-app-store-dutch-antitrust-order/">reported earlier</a></span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; Apple succeeded in delaying reporting of the order as it sought an injunction (some parts of the order are still under court seal). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It was also able to delay application of the order until mid January.</span></p>
<p>Last week it emerged that Apple still intended to collect a commission from local dating apps on any sales of digital content processed by non-Apple payment infrastructure &#8212; writing in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/">developer support note</a>: “Consistent with the ACM’s order, dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider will pay Apple a commission on transactions.”</p>
<p>At the time of writing that claim still appears on Apple&#8217;s post about &#8220;StoreKit External Purchase Entitlement&#8221; (as it refers to the ACM order). And it&#8217;s possible that parts of the order which remain sealed relate to commissions. But is has not been possible to confirm the detail here.</p>
<p>In a response to a question TechCrunch put to the ACM last week, querying Apple&#8217;s claim that it can still charge fees on apps that use non-Apple payment systems, a spokesperson for the regulator declined a response &#8212; saying they could &#8220;only refer to the part of the order the court upheld and cleared for publication&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s support site, meanwhile, still only points interested local developers to a <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/storekit-external-entitlement/">developer interest form</a>&#8221; &#8212; instead of offering a clear process for implementing non-Apple payment methods.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s accompanying text also continues to offer only a vague line that more information will be<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> available &#8220;shortly&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This delay in implementing a procedure for local dating apps to deploy alternative payment methods has cost Apple €5M in fines so far (and counting). </span></p>
<p>Of course, a few million dollar fine &#8212; or even a €50M penalty &#8212; won&#8217;t cause much consternation in Cupertino.</p>
<p>But of far greater concern for Apple are the now multiple competition complaints and probes into its App Store terms &#8212; which are attacking the commission it collects on in-app purchases &#8212; with its developer T&amp;Cs under regulatory investigation and/or order around the world, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">the EU</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">the UK</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-to-allow-third-party-app-payment-options-in-south-korea/">Asia</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">the US</a>.</p>
<p>In the short term &#8212; and/or failing a substantial, global competition reform offer by Apple that would make App Store competition complaints go away &#8212; a regulatory patchwork looms for iOS app developers as each market/region&#8217;s regulators turn their attention to assessing Apple&#8217;s small print.</p>
<p>In the short term, consumer and developer wins around competition and pricing of iOS apps look more likely to come grudgingly &#8212; hard fought and hard won.</p>
<p>However <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">ex ante regulation</a> of Internet giants&#8217; T&amp;Cs is now on the table in many markets &#8212; with the explicit goal of speeding up behavioral corrections. So a strategy of wilful delay looks set to get a lot more expensive in the future.</p>
<p>Apple has been contacted for comment on the ACM fine.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>If you own stuff, I am sorry to report that you are probably poorer today than you were on Friday, and even less wealthy than you were the Friday before. Things are selling off and we had to talk about it:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261096" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Stocks are down, and cryptos are getting utterly hammered. It&#8217;s a bad time to own equities, but worse if you are invested in digital assets. Bitcoin, ether, and Solana are taking body-blows while the stock market wilts. I guess this means that all our 401k contributions will be cheaper in February? Small wins, but still.</li>
<li>Swiggy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/indian-food-delivery-giant-swiggy-raises-700-million-at-10-7-billion-valuation/">raised a huge round at a simply enormous price</a>, which is good for the company but has us asking questions. OfficeSpace <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2022/workspace-management-platform-officespace-raises-150-million-dollars/">raised $150 million</a>, which caught our eye, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/spectrum-labs-b/">the recent Spectrum Labs appears to make good sense</a>.</li>
<li>And to close out we asked <em>is the party over?</em> This <a href="https://500ish.com/the-great-deflate-6bc847df9809">MG Siegler piece</a> was in our brain as we chewed over the situation. The dissonance between the public and private markets feels peak, and we aren&#8217;t sure how quickly their diverging velocities can keep up the tension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how the selloff is impacting you, we hope that you have a lovely week and stay warm. Hugs!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://gorillas.io">Gorillas</a> has <a href="https://gorillas.io/en/blog/gorillas-x-frichti">announced</a> that it plans to acquire <a href="https://www.frichti.co">Frichti</a>, a French startup that delivers both ready-to-eat meals and groceries. The acquisition hasn’t closed just yet but both companies have entered exclusive discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t share details about the deal itself, especially as it isn&#8217;t completely signed,&#8221; Frichti co-founder and co-CEO Julia Bijaoui told me. &#8220;But it is correct to say that these are negotiations that should lead to Frichti getting acquired by Gorillas.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked when the transaction is supposed to close, she told me it could take &#8220;a few weeks or a few months&#8221;, it&#8217;s still hard to tell exactly. Over the years, Frichti had raised around €100 million in total ($114 million at today&#8217;s exchange rate).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261100" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gorillas is part of a group of startups that are trying to reinvent grocery deliveries in Europe. The company has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">nearly $1 billion</a> in its most recent funding round and is already <a href="https://gorillas.io/en/delivery-areas">operating</a> in eight markets — including France.</p>
<p>It competes with <a href="https://www.goflink.com">Flink</a>, <a href="https://tryzapp.com">Zapp</a>, <a href="https://www.cajoo.eu">Cajoo</a>, <a href="https://getir.com">Getir</a> and <a href="https://gopuff.com">Gopuff</a> (following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/">Dija’s and Fancy’s acquisitions</a>). With these apps, customers can buy everything they would find in a small grocery store. And they all promise near-instant deliveries so that you don’t have to plan in advance when you need to order groceries.</p>
<p>In addition to this new crop of startups, other well-established companies are trying to position themselves as competitors to instant grocery startups. For instance, Deliveroo and Uber Eats are both emphasizing grocery deliveries in their respective app.</p>
<p>Frichti, on the other hand, has been around since 2015, but with a different positioning. In the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/10/frichti-grabs-1-1-million-for-its-full-stack-food-delivery-service/">article</a> that I wrote back in 2015, I called the startup a full-stack food delivery startup. The startup designs its own recipes, cooks ready-to-eat meals in its own kitchens, stores food in its own micro-fulfillment centers and handles deliveries with its own delivery service.</p>
<p>The result is a complete end-to-end service with a strong brand and reasonable prices. Over the past few years, the company has expanded to include fruits, vegetables, grocery items and private label products. It has served 450,000 customers in total across eight different cities in France and Belgium.</p>
<h2>The subcontracting incident of summer 2020</h2>
<p>It’s a graceful exit for Frichti and the acquisition makes a ton of sense for Gorillas. Gorillas is acquiring a strong brand, a network of micro-fulfillment centers and a different segment in the delivery space.</p>
<p>Frichti and Gorillas will still operate as two different services in Frichti&#8217;s existing markets France and Belgium. As for Gorillas&#8217; six other markets, the company could choose a different path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, we haven&#8217;t decided yet but it&#8217;s more likely that we scale many of the building blocks of Frichti&#8217;s product — but under an umbrella brand that could be Gorillas,&#8221; Frichti&#8217;s Julia Bijaoui said.</p>
<p>And because Frichti has been around for so long, Gorillas could learn a thing or two from Frichti. &#8220;We have had six years to build this model of quick commerce,&#8221; Bijaoui said. &#8220;We&#8217;re generating an operating profit, which is quite unusual in this industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the past 18 months haven’t been so easy for Frichti. In June 2020, Libération’s Gurvan Kristanadjaja <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/06/01/sans-papiers-sans-contrat-bienvenue-chez-frichti_1790003/">reported</a> that some of Frichti’s deliveries were handled by undocumented workers. According to Frichti’s founders, the startup wasn’t aware of that. Instead, Frichti, like all delivery companies, relied on subcontracting companies to hire delivery people and handle some deliveries for the platform.</p>
<p>And one of those subcontracting companies lured undocumented immigrants and told them that they could make money with Frichti deliveries. There was no work contract, no minimum pay.</p>
<p>That was just one example that highlighted a much bigger problem. Frichti checked the status of all its delivery partners to make sure that they have a proper working permit and get paid properly. The company underestimated the issue.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Instead of blaming Frichti, this crisis highlights a widespread problem with the subcontracting model and app-based gig work					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Hundreds of delivery people realized that they would lose their source of income. So they decided to protest and they <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/06/05/les-livreurs-de-bonheur-sans-papiers-de-frichti-en-colere_1790397/">blocked access</a> to Frichti’s micro-fulfillment centers. During several weeks, Frichti simply couldn’t operate normally.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/societe/livreurs-sans-papiers-de-frichti-un-an-apres-que-sont-ils-devenus-20210603_4G4OU2G3K5EFFJZ2CWPLQ4AQZU/">Libération</a>, 200 out of 500 delivery persons working with Frichti didn’t have a residence permit.</p>
<p>That incident became a serious crisis that could have led to Frichti’s bankruptcy. A few weeks later, around half of the undocumented migrants who handled Frichti deliveries <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/07/22/la-moitie-des-livreurs-frichti-sans-papiers-bientot-regularises_1794907/">received</a> a residence permit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had this incident during the summer of 2020. Clearly, we had some flaws in our process to check the identity and the permits of our delivery partners. It&#8217;s something that we have completely fixed today. We make sure that our delivery people have a residence permit and work in optimal conditions,&#8221; Bijaoui said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an event that taught us a lot and I think we came out of it stronger because we partnered with them and helped them get residence permits,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Instead of blaming Frichti, this crisis highlights a widespread problem with the subcontracting model and app-based gig work. Account renting and dishonest subcontracting companies have been an issue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/business/uber-eats-deliveroo-glovo-migrants.html">for years</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, both regulators and companies have been slow when it comes to implementing changes for the better. I’m sure the Frichti team is glad that it has turned this page of the company’s story, but I’m also sure there are <em>other</em> companies who will face similar incidents.</p>
<p>After years of exploding growth, there has been some consolidation in the food and grocery delivery space — as today’s acquisition proves once again. Let’s hope that these newly formed delivery giants won’t turn a blind eye on exploitation in the gig economy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sayata developed a fully automated way for brokers to provide several insurance quotes from leading providers based on a few pieces of information about the business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Insurance broker and carrier marketplace <a href="https://www.sayata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sayata</a> took in $35 million in additional funds toward its Series A after raising $17 million in funds last August.</p>
<p>Pitango Growth and Hanaco Ventures co-led the extension, with participation from previous investors Team8 Capital, Vertex Ventures, Elron Ventures and OurCrowd.</p>
<p>The new funding follows over 10 times revenue growth in 2021 for the Boston-based company. Founded two years ago, the company offers a way for small and medium businesses to secure insurance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260921" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To get insurance, these businesses typically go through an insurance broker rather than go directly to the insurance provider, Asaf Lifshitz, co-founder and CEO of Sayata, said via email.</p>
<p>“The process above is much more time intensive and manual,” Lifshitz said. “Securing business insurance takes a big chunk of a broker’s day. Hours are spent gathering quotes, helping the client make sense of them, processing applications and a lot of back and forth with insurance providers to finalize coverage.”</p>
<p>Instead, Sayata developed a marketplace that is fully automated and done online to provide several insurance quotes from leading insurance providers based on a few pieces of information about the business inputted by the broker. Those quotes, along with customized marketing materials on the plans, are forwarded to the business to select and secure coverage.</p>
<p>With this approach, brokers using Sayata are able to offer customers more and better coverage options and respond to requests faster. That and an easy process means clients often go with the insurance offered by Sayata’s broker partners, Lifshitz said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To date, Sayata has more than 1,000 users representing over 100 brokerage and carrier partners. It works with insurance providers, including Axis, Brit, Hiscox and Tokio Marine, as well as leading technological managing general agents at At-Bay, Coalition, Cowbell and Corvus.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $60 million since being founded in 2017 by Lifshitz, Avishay Maya and Iddan Golomb. The additional capital will enable the company to add to its headcount of 47, up from 17 at the same time last year.</p>
<p>It also enables the company to go after more of the small and medium-sized business insurance market that Lifshitz estimates is over $100 billion just in the United States.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of market demand for a better way to secure commercial insurance for SMBs,” he said. “Currently, the company primarily offers cyber insurance on the platform, and our clients have specifically asked for us to add more lines of insurance to the Sayata platform. Extending the current round is a great way to expand into new lines of coverage faster to meet that demand.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company helps advisors and their clients identify the right health plan and if you may need long-term care planning (spoiler, you probably will).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With almost <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-2022-spotlight-first-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4,000 Medicare Advantage plans</a> to choose from, it not only makes choosing one a complex decision, but making a wrong decision could affect the wallet if something unexpected should happen.</p>
<p>Miami-based startup <a href="http://www.caribouwealth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caribou</a> aims to make that decision easier through its healthcare cost prediction and optimization software packaged into a SaaS business model designed for financial planners so they can advise their clients on the best plan.</p>
<p>The company, led by co-founders Christine Simone and Cory Blumenfeld and founding engineer Giorgio Delgado, gathers data on factors, like utilization, health conditions and medications, and provides financial advisors with a scalable tool to evaluate a client’s healthcare planning needs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260718" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Simone explained that financial advisors don’t often ask clients about their medication costs or health conditions, so some of the pillars the company helps advisors and their clients identify include health plan selection and if you may need long-term care planning — which Simone estimated 70% of people usually do.</p>
<p>Simone and Blumenfeld started Caribou in 2020 after careers in healthcare, where they saw stakeholders not addressing the financial component of care.</p>
<p>“And that burden unfortunately gets placed on the consumer,” Simone told TechCrunch. “Every day we hear about rising healthcare costs and medical bankruptcy, and I&#8217;m so excited that we&#8217;re empowering consumers to proactively plan for the costs and make smarter decisions using data.”</p>
<p>The company raised $575,000 in early 2021, and today, announced another $3 million in a seed round to bring its total funding to $3.1 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment was led by Jack and Max Altman, who were joined by Lightspeed Scout Fund, Dash Fund, existing investors Garage Capital and N49P, as well as a group of angel investors, including Plaid CTO Leslie Schrock and Tribe’s Arjun Sethi.</p>
<p>Jack Altman said in a written statement that Caribou is picking up the healthcare planning where employers leave off.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re seeing solutions in the employer space aiming to reduce healthcare spend for employees, companies and payers,” he added. “What happens once people leave those companies or their HR departments no longer have access to that data? Caribou&#8217;s positioning through the financial system lens is a great opportunity to reach a different segment of customers and offer them something incredibly valuable.”</p>
<p>Caribou’s software has only been in the market for a few months, but the company is already racking up dozens of customers, including BLB&amp;B Advisors, CapSouth Wealth Management and Jackson Square Capital.</p>
<p>Though it was too early to talk about growth metrics, Simone says growth, especially off of the open enrollment season in the fourth quarter, “was crazy busy in terms of adoption,” and now the company is at a threshold of putting firms on a waitlist. Current customers represent tens of thousands of end clients, and the company is already able to prove that it saved consumers hundreds of thousands of dollars in healthcare costs.</p>
<p>The new funding will be invested in product development to be able to provide more robust financial insights and reach wider-scale distribution. The company also aims to grow its customer success team and double its overall employee headcount by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Caribou’s goal is to focus on the end consumer, so while it is distributing its software through the financial industry, its product roadmap also includes different distribution channels, including technology platforms that consumers could access directly.</p>
<p>“There’s only 39% of Americans that work with a financial advisor, so we also need to be looking at opportunities outside of financial advisors,” Simone said. “We want to be able to distribute our tool like a back-end plug-in embedded into some of these other financial technology platforms to give access to more consumers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another UK parliamentary committee has weighed in on the government&#8217;s controversial plan to regulate Internet content with a broadbrush focus on &#8216;safety&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee, warned in detailed <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/8608/documents/86960/default/">report</a> today that it has &#8220;urgent concerns&#8221; the draft legislation &#8220;neither adequately protects freedom of expression nor is clear and robust enough to tackle the various types of illegal and harmful content on user-to-user and search services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Among the committee&#8217;s myriad worries are how fuzzily the bill defines different types of harms, such as illegal content &#8212; and  designations of harms &#8212; with MPs calling out the government&#8217;s failure to include more detail in the bill itself, making it harder to judge impact as key components (like Codes of Practice) will follow via secondary legislation so aren&#8217;t yet on the table.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261045" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That general vagueness, combined with the complexities related to the choice for a &#8220;duty of care&#8221; approach &#8212; which the report notes in fact breaks down into several specific duties (vis-a-vis illegal content; content that poses a risk to children; and, for a subset of high risk P2P services, content that poses a risk to adults) &#8212; means the proposed framework may not be able to achieve the sought for &#8220;comprehensive safety regime&#8221;, in the committee&#8217;s view.</p>
<p>The bill also creates risks for freedom of expression, per the committee &#8212; which has recommended the government incorporates a balancing test for the regulator, Ofcom, to assess whether platforms have &#8220;duly balanced their freedom of expression obligations with their decision making&#8221;.</p>
<p>The risk of platforms responding to sudden, ill-defined liability around broad swathes of content by over-removing speech &#8212; leading to a chilling impact on freedom of expression in the UK &#8212; is one of the many criticisms raised against the bill which the committee appears to be picking up on.</p>
<p>It suggests the government reframes definitions of harmful content and relevant safety duties to bring the bill in<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> line with international human rights law &#8212; in order to try to safeguard against the risk of over-removal by providing &#8220;minimum standards against which a provider’s actions, systems and processes to tackle harm, including automated or algorithmic content moderation, should be judged&#8221;.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even on child safety &#8212; a core issue UK ministers have repeatedly pinned to the legislation &#8212; the committee flags &#8220;weaknesses&#8221; in the bill that they assert mean the proposed regime &#8220;does not map adequately onto the reality of the problem&#8221;.</p>
<p>They have called for the government to go further in this area, urging the bill to be expanded to cover &#8220;technically legal&#8221; practices, such as breadcrumbing (aka &#8220;where perpetrators deliberately subvert the thresholds of criminal activity and for content removal by a service provide&#8221;) &#8212; citing witness testimony which suggests the practice, while not in fact illegal, &#8220;nonetheless forms part of the sequence for online CSEA [child sexual exploitation and abuse]&#8221;.</p>
<p>Similarly, the committee suggests the bill needs to go further to protect women and girls against types of online violence and abuse specifically directed at them (such as &#8220;tech-enabled ‘nudifying’ of women and deepfake pornography&#8221;).</p>
<p>On Ofcom&#8217;s powers of investigation of platforms, the committee argues they need to be further strengthened &#8212; urging amendments to give the regulator the power to &#8220;conduct confidential auditing or vetting of a service’s systems to assess the operation and outputs in practice&#8221;; and to &#8220;request generic information about how &#8216;content is disseminated by means of a service'&#8221;, with MPs further suggesting the bill should provide more specific detail about the types of data Ofcom can request from platforms (presumably to avoid the risk of platforms seeking to evade effective oversight).</p>
<p>However &#8212; on enforcement &#8212; the committee has concerns in the other direction and is worried over a lack of clarity over how Ofcom&#8217;s (set to be) very substantial powers may be used against platforms.</p>
<p>It has recommended a series of tweaks, such as making clear these powers only apply to in-scope services.</p>
<p>MPs are also calling for a redrafting of the use of so-called &#8220;technology notices&#8221; &#8212; which will enable the regulator to mandate the use of new technology (following &#8220;persistent and prevalent&#8221; failings of the duty of care) &#8212; saying the scope and application of this power should be &#8220;more tightly&#8221; defined, and more practical information provided on the actions required to bring providers into compliance, as well as more detail on how Ofcom will test whether the use of such power is proportionate.</p>
<p>Here the committee flags issues of potential business disruption. It also suggests the government take time to evaluate whether these powers are &#8220;appropriately future-proofed given the advent of technology like VPNs and DNS over HTTPs&#8221;.</p>
<p>Other recommendations in the report include a call for the bill to contain more clarity on the subject of redress and judicial review.</p>
<p>The committee also warns against the government creating a dedicated joint committee to oversee online safety and digital regulation, arguing that parliamentary scrutiny is &#8220;best serviced by the existing, independent, cross-party select committees and evidenced by the work we have done and will continue to do in this area&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It remains to be seen how much notice the government takes of the committee&#8217;s recommendations. Although the secretary of state for digital, Nadine Dorries, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/uk-warns-facebook-over-safety-criminal-liability-legislation/">previously suggested</a> she is open to taking on board parliamentary feedback to the sweeping package of legislation.</p>
<p>The report, by the DCMS Committee, follows earlier recommendations &#8212; in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/uk-joint-committee-report-online-safety-bill/">December</a> &#8212; by a parliamentary joint committee focused on scrutinizing the bill which also warned that the draft legislation risked falling short of the government&#8217;s safety aims.</p>
<p>The government published the draft Online Safety bill back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">May 2021</a> &#8212; setting out a long-trailed plan to impose a duty of care on Internet platforms with the aim of protecting users from a swathe of harms, whether related to (already illegal) content such as terrorist propaganda, child sexual abuse material and hate speech, through more broadly problematic but not necessarily illegal content such as bullying or content promoting eating disorders or suicide (which may create disproportionate risks for younger users of social media platforms).</p>
<p>Speaking to the joint committee in November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/uk-warns-facebook-over-safety-criminal-liability-legislation/">Dorries predicted </a>the legislation will usher in a systemic change to Internet culture &#8212; telling MPs and peers it will create &#8220;huge, huge&#8221; change to how Internet platforms operate.</p>
<p>The bill, which is still making its way through parliament, targets a broad range of Internet platforms and envisages enforcing safety-focused governance standards via regulated Codes of Conduct, overseen by Ofcom in an expanded role &#8212; including with incoming powers to issue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">substantial penalties for breaches</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK Online Safety Bill, coming next year, will propose fines of up to 10% of annual turnover for breaching duty of care rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/embed/#?secret=fTqK29Z0xv" data-secret="fTqK29Z0xv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The sweeping scope of the regulation &#8212; the intent for the law to target not just illegal content spreading online but stuff that falls into more of a grey area where restrictions risk impinging on freedom of expression and speech &#8212; mean the proposal has attracted huge criticism from civil liberties and digital rights groups, as well as from businesses concerned about liability and the compliance burden.</p>
<p>In parallel, the government has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">stepping up attacks on platforms&#8217; use of end-to-end encryption</a> &#8212; deploying rhetoric that seeks to imply robust security is a barrier to catching pedophiles (see, for example, the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/20/no_place_hide_campaign_anti_e2ee_ukgov/">government&#8217;s recently unveiled NoPlaceToHide PR to try to turn the public against E2E encryption</a>). So critics are also concerned that ministers are trying to subvert Internet security and privacy by recasting good practices as barriers to a goal imposing &#8216;child safety&#8217; through mass digital surveillance.</p>
<p>On that front, in recent months, the Home Office has also been splashing a little taxpayer cash to try to foster the development of technologies which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/uk-names-five-projects-its-funding-for-csam-detection/">could be applied to E2EE systems to scan for child sexual abuse material</a> &#8212; which it claims could offer a middle ground between robust security and law enforcement&#8217;s data access requirements.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill already argue that using a trumped up claim of child &#8216;protection&#8217; as a populist lever to push for the removal of the strongest security and privacy protections from all Internet users &#8212; simultaneously encouraging a cottage industry of commercial providers to spring up and tout &#8216;child protection&#8217; surveillance services for sale &#8212; is a lot closer to gaslighting than safeguarding, however.</p>
<p>Zooming back out, there is also plenty of concern over the risk of the UK over regulating its digital economy.</p>
<p>And of the bill becoming a parliamentary &#8220;hobby horse&#8221; for every type of online grievance, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/ex-minister-predicts-huge-battleground-over-uks-plan-to-set-internet-content-rules/">one former minister of state put it</a> &#8212; with the potential for complex and poorly defined content regulation to end up as a disproportionate burden on UK startups vs tech giants like Facebook whose self-serving algorithms and content moderation fuelled calls for Internet regulation in the first place, as well as being hugely harmful to UK Internet users&#8217; human rights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Amid the deal-making and partnership news this week, one item raised both of my eyebrows. Although I must admit, I wasn&#8217;t exactly surprised. I&#8217;m talking about the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and its plans to develop a new rating program that will evaluate the safeguards that vehicles with &#8220;partial automation&#8221; use to help drivers stay focused on the road.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260986" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>IIHS, a nonprofit that is funded by auto insurance companies, will give systems good, acceptable, marginal or poor ratings. The first set of ratings is expected to be issued in 2022, IIHS said, though it did not give a specific date because ongoing supply chain issues have made it more difficult to obtain vehicles for testing.</p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s takeaway? Not a single advanced driver assistance system offered in today&#8217;s new vehicles would meet its pending safety criteria. You can read my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/advanced-driver-assistance-tech-in-cars-today-wont-pass-iihs-new-safety-rating/">full coverage of this here</a>; but for those who don&#8217;t click that link, here are two important items to consider.</p>
<p>1.) While most partial automation systems — think of the combination of lane centering and adaptive cruise control — have some safeguards in place, none of them meets all of the organization&#8217;s pending criteria. This can lead to drivers intentionally or unintentionally pushing the system well beyond its safe operation.</p>
<p>2.) This new IIHS rating system isn&#8217;t even addressing other <strong>functional </strong>aspects of the systems that could also potentially contribute to crashes, such as how well their cameras or radar sensors identify obstacles. That&#8217;s a much bigger and complex issue. Who do you think should take that on?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Side note: Consumer Reports&#8217; 2022 autos Top Picks, which will be announced on February 17, will include evaluations of driver monitoring systems. CR will add two points to a vehicle&#8217;s overall score if it features a system that encourages safe driving as part of the model&#8217;s active driving assistance package.</p>
<p>One final, maybe fun? item. I went back and looked at my predictions for 2021. They&#8217;re all here in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/the-station-the-2021-predictions-issue-part-two/">The Station edition</a> from January 11, 2021 (this is the second part, but I also recap the first part at the bottom). Check it out, and give me a grade. ;D</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk a little about how cities are embracing micromobility, and how they can improve. </span></p>
<p><b>Transport for London</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorofLondon/status/1483096249817608195?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently released stats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that showed the share of journeys made in the city by cycling or walking has increased from 27% to 42% during the pandemic. Even more promising is the </span><a href="https://www.bicycleretailer.com/studies-reports/2022/01/16/more-half-women-cyclists-started-riding-or-returned-during-pandemic#.Yeh-1lhBz0p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Bicycle Dealers Association&#8217;s Bicycling Buying 2021 Consumer Research study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which found 56% of female bicyclists who are riding today either started cycling or returned to it during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All great signs that the momentum is here, but cities need to step up their infrastructure game. </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/3-in-4-people-want-to-ride-a-bike-but-are-put-off-by-lack-of-safe-lanes-172868"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Victoria, Australia found that 75% of respondents are interested in biking, but are concerned about lack of safety infrastructure. The Aussies are no doubt not the only ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it doesn’t only come down to infrastructure. Cities also need to be working with micromobility companies to ensure easy and affordable access to bikes and scooters. Look at Prague as an example. The city </span><a href="https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/prague-public-transport-s-free-bikesharing-program-to-become-permanent-offer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently decided to make free 15-minute bikeshare rides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a permanent part of its public transport offer. New York City is also working with Brooklyn-based bike and scooter subscription service </span><b>Beyond</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://cities-today.com/new-yorks-transit-tech-lab-announces-covid-19-response-challenge-winners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study how micromobility can be integrated with public transit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(NYC is also working with </span><b>Lyft</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to offer free 60-day </span><b>Citibike </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">memberships to public and private hospital workers who are battling rising Covid-19 Omicron cases.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which, yet another micromobility startup, </span><b>Helbiz</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is integrating with Google Maps worldwide, which will no doubt help micromobility become more a part of the broader transit ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/stockholm-sweden-clampdown-e-scooters-voi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stockholm is actually reducing the number of shared e-scooters in the city by 50%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of the apparent chaos of so 23,000 scooters roaming around. The city will allow all eight of its current micromobility providers to continue operating a reduced service. While I initially wince at the thought of cutting back greener forms of transit, public opinion is important for long-term adoption. A recent </span><a href="https://www.dn.se/sthlm/stockholmare-allt-mer-negativt-installda-till-elsparkcyklar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Stockholmers found 57% were negative about e-scooters, versus 50% last year.</span></p>
<p><b>In other news…</b></p>
<p><b>HumanForest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxVUctyhSAM_ZrLTgdREBYsuulvOAjplamC5VHr3zdeu-nAkJlwcnJyYk2BZ0yn3mMu5Hqmcu6gAxx5hVIgkZohTd5ppno6cDYQpwfXSS6Jz9NHAtiMX3VJFche59VbU3wMV4WQYiSLpkYpwehoOzYqxTvaKyf5YITpGONS3W1NdR6CBQ3fkM4YgKx6KWXPj_7twd7xHsfRWl9Os7U2bphwsHoEx9jsJpUAKTebtylucfYrAptcMF_3ZqmbCR8xQS7NHLFbkyv--WDmFZo_mhMZideMMka7TuIRnWhZa_k4UGmdndXYGy5aOL9-jhD9Y6Dbk7W5zshlPy9RJOkEM1hr2gJ2sakGuyDueXn0AqBFE8atBhQ4wUuBu90r9xJefk5PwHlwOW4yRXdiYJypUbJejrddaO8glFCS9wQVuIhVQf8b_xcKP6Td"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><b>Deliveroo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give London delivery workers access to shared e-bikes. The company also just ran the first of what will be multiple challenges to encourage sustainable riding among its customers. The first, called the ‘CO2 Saver’ took place from January 17 to 23, and involves riders monitoring the amount of CO2 they saved from being emitted, the hours they spent outside and the amount of energy they burned through cycling. The winners are rewarded with TreeCoins, or points that cna be used towards rides.  </span></p>
<p><b>Gogoro</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is doing a second vehicle collab with </span><b>Yamaha </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to produce the Yamaha EMF, which is built from the ground up to utilize Gogoro’s battery swapping platform. The EMF will be available in Taiwan in March. </span></p>
<p><b>Bird </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-bms-safe-sustainable-scooter-batteries/">published a blog post</a> that dug into its battery management system, which runs real-time diagnostics and sets dynamic power limits on the operator’s IP68-rated battery cell packs for e-scooters, while communicating directly with the e-scooters’ CAN bus. Bird’s BMS allows the company to monitor and take action on any safety or sustainability issues like battery failures.</span></p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>OK, so this isn&#8217;t a traditional company X raises $$$ type of deal, but this week we&#8217;re mixing it up. I find this item notable because it illustrates increasing interest from traditional automakers to use lidar in passenger vehicles.</p>
<p>The gist: <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> agreed to use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/mercedes-future-vehicles-will-have-luminar-lidar-under-new-deal/">Luminar&#8217;s </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/mercedes-future-vehicles-will-have-luminar-lidar-under-new-deal/">lidar technology</a> in future vehicles as part of a broader deal that includes data sharing and the automaker taking a small stake in the company. Mercedes-Benz will acquire up to 1.5 million Luminar shares, in exchange for certain data and services.</p>
<p>The companies declined to share information about when Luminar lidar would be integrated into Mercedes-Benz vehicles. I went back and listened to an interview I had with Markus Schäfer, Daimler AG board member and Mercedes-Benz AG&#8217;s CTO responsible for development and procurement. We were talking about the EQXX Vision, a halo car of sorts that was revealed earlier this month ahead of the CES tech trade show.</p>
<p>The vehicle, which went from idea to prototype in 18 months, is meant be the foundation for its future electric vehicles and it featured all sorts of technological innovations with the battery and drivetrain as well as other items that Schäfer said will be in Mercedes-Benz electric vehicles beginning in 2024.</p>
<p>Perhaps Luminar&#8217;s lidar will also show up in 2024 model year Mercedes vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong> Factorial Energy </strong><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/01/20/2369935/0/en/Factorial-Energy-Raises-200-Million-To-Accelerate-Commercialization-of-its-Novel-Solid-state-Batteries-for-Electric-Vehicles.html">raised $200 million</a> as part of a Series D round of funding that was led by automakers Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis. The company said the funding will be used to accelerate commercial production and deployment of its solid-state battery technology.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Gogoro</strong>, the Taiwanese company best known for its electric smartscooters and swappable battery infrastructure, has just added current strategic partner <strong>Hero MotoCorp</strong>, activist and impact investment firm <strong>Engine No. 1</strong> and another investor to its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/hero-motocorp-engine-no-1-join-gogoros-pipe-bringing-it-up-to-285m/"> PIPE investment, bringing the total funding to $285 million, up from $257 million</a>. The company still intends to complete its SPAC deal with <strong>Poema Global </strong>by the end of this quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Monta</strong>, the electric vehicle charging platform, closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Creandum, an early-stage venture capital firm based in Stockholm. The company said that Headline also made a significant investment.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Systems</strong>, a company founded by three former SpaceX engineers to build autonomous battery-electric rail vehicles, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/former-spacex-engineers-bring-autonomous-electric-rail-vehicle-startup-out-of-stealth/">came out of stealth mode</a> with a $49.55 million Series A raise. The company, which has raised $53.15 million to date, including a $3.6 million seed round, is working to create a more efficient, decarbonized freight network that flows on top of existing railway infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Phantom Auto</strong>, a startup that has developed remote operation software for vehicles, received a strategic investment of $42 million led by freight and logistics service provider ArcBest and NFI. As part of the deal, ArcBest and NFI reached a commercial agreement to deploy thousands of Phantom-powered forklifts in the coming years. The funding also includes investment from Bessemer Venture Partners, Maniv Mobility, Perot Jain, and other previous investors. Phantom Auto initially focused on the autonomous vehicle industry, but pivoted to logistics vehicles like forklifts. Last March, global logistics company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/logistics-giant-geodis-partners-with-phantom-auto-to-deploy-remote-controlled-forklifts/">Geodis tapped Phantom Auto</a> to help it deploy remotely operated forklifts at two sites and eventually expand to other warehouses.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Mitsubishi Electric</strong>, the automaker&#8217;s electronics equipment manufacturing company, is starting a pilot program to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/mitsubishi-partners-with-cartken-to-break-into-the-robotic-delivery-world/">explore the value of autonomous robots</a>. The company will be working with <strong>Cartken</strong>, the Google alum startup that came out of stealth last March, to unleash a small number of Cartken&#8217;s delivery robots in a Japanese mall to provide indoor and curb-side food delivery services, initially for Starbucks customers.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Blink Charging</strong>, the electric vehicle charger manufacturer, will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/blink-charging-to-supply-ev-chargers-to-general-motors-dealerships/">deploy EV chargers</a> at <strong>General Motors</strong> dealerships across the U.S. and Canada. The startup will be teaming up with facility solutions provider ABM to supply its new IQ 200 Level 2 chargers to GM. Blink said it has around 30,000 EV chargers set up across 13 countries; this deal might help Blink gain more brand recognition and compete with companies with larger market share.</p>
<p><strong>Electrek</strong> <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/01/21/which-electric-vehicles-still-qualify-for-us-federal-tax-credit/">rounds up every EV</a> that still qualifies for the U.S. federal tax credit.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Painter</strong>, who founded auto pricing company TrueCar Inc. and car subscription service Fair, has a new thing going. Painter launched a company in 2020 called NextCar that was supposed to be a B2B type business that sold a software-as-a-service platform to vehicle subscription providers. NextCar Holdings remains, but under it a new company called &#8220;Autonomy&#8221; has been born. Autonomy will be a consumer-facing business that lets customers rent a Tesla Model 3 for a flat monthly fee. <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/scott-painters-vehicle-subscription-services-firm-nextcar-rebrands-autonomy-launches-tesla">Painter told <em>Automotive News</em></a> that it is &#8220;not a traditional lease or car loan.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen</strong> is bringing back the e-Up minicar, according to <a href="https://www.golem.de/sonstiges/zustimmung/auswahl.html?from=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.golem.de%2Fnews%2Felektroauto-vw-e-up-ab-mitte-februar-wieder-bestellbar-2201-162468.html&amp;referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">German news site Golem</a>.</p>
<h3>In-vehicle tech and other dribs and drabs</h3>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> signed a five-year agreement with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/ford-signs-5-year-agreement-with-stripe-to-scale-e-commerce/">online payment processor Stripe</a> to scale the automaker&#8217;s e-commerce capabilities. Stripe will facilitate transactions for vehicle orders and reservations, handle financing options for Ford&#8217;s commercial customers and route customer&#8217;s payments from the automaker&#8217;s website to the correct local Ford or Lincoln dealer. Ford said it plans to begin rolling out Stripe&#8217;s technology in the second half of 2022, starting with North America.</p>
<p><strong>General Motors</strong> plans to expand its hydrogen fuel cell business and apply the technology to <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0119-hydrotec.html">other commercial applications</a> beyond vehicles, including power generators used for the military and EV chargers. GM&#8217;s branded Hydrotec fuel cell technology is currently in development for use in heavy-duty trucks, aerospace and locomotives.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai</strong> is partnering with <a href="https://ionq.com/news/january-19-2022-ionq-and-hyundai-partner-to-advance-batteries">quantum computer maker IonQ</a> to develop new variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms. Why? The plan is to use these quantum algoritums to study lithium compounds and their chemical reactions involved in battery chemistry. The aim is to develop batteries that are cheaper, safer and have better performance.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> shareholders urged a judge to find that <strong>CEO Elon Musk</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/tesla-shareholders-urge-judge-to-find-musk-coerced-board-to-buy-solarcity/">coerced the company&#8217;s board</a> to acquire SolarCity in 2016, a transaction that a group of shareholders allege was a &#8220;bailout&#8221; of the failing solar company of which Musk was the top shareholder. During a Zoom hearing on Tuesday, the shareholders asked that Musk be ordered to return the stock he received from the deal and pay Tesla $13 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen</strong> and <strong>Bosch</strong> have signed a memorandum of understanding to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/volkswagen-and-bosch-set-up-jv-to-push-european-battery-production/">explore a joint venture</a> dedicated to providing Europe with battery equipment solutions. The two companies aim to supply integrated battery production systems and on-site ramp-up and maintenance support for battery cell and system manufacturers. The JV is expected to help VW reach its goal to build six cell factories by 2030, but it will also be available to serve other factories across Europe.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Inventa’s online platform recommends products based on actual transaction data and provides credit, in 30-, 60-, and 90-day increments, to retailers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inventa, a Brazil-based company offering a digital marketplace for small and medium-sized companies to discover and purchase new inventory, raised $20 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz and Monashees co-led the round and were joined by Founders Fund, Greenoaks, Greylock, Tiger Global and angel investors Hans Tung and Carlos Gracia from Kavak. Also participating in the round were existing investors Pear VC, NXTP, ONEVC, MAYA Capital and Alter Global.</p>
<p>This fresh infusion of capital comes three months after the company announced $5.5 million in seed funding. And all of that for a company that started in March 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260870" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Marcos Salama founded the company with former General Atlantic investor Laura Camargo and former McKinsey data science expert Fernando Carrasco to provide technology, data and credit to Brazilian entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Salama, who is from Spain, has a background in mechanical engineering and has worked for both McKinsey and Rappi, which is how he made his way to Brazil. While leading Rappi’s groceries business, he worked with retailers and saw how small stores were struggling to access an assortment of goods and credit.</p>
<p><a href="https://inventa.shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inventa</a> uses technology to provide an easier purchasing process for small businesses. Inventa’s online platform recommends products based on actual transaction data and provides credit, in 30-, 60- and 90-day increments, to retailers. There is also a supplier side, where they can upload products, manage pricing and see what is selling and what isn’t.</p>
<p>One of the drivers for going after additional funding so soon was that Inventa is growing at over 100% month over month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There are 5 million entrepreneurs who have small stores in Brazil that Inventa is targeting,” Salama said. “Our B2B marketplace connects brands and small retailers to help them with assortment in the areas of cosmetics, healthy food and home decor. They can also see what is trending, which makes recommendations more useful.”</p>
<p>The company offers over 7,000 products from 400 brands and has amassed more than 20,000 customers.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Inventa to invest in its technology team — much of its 100-person workforce is in engineering — and to build its sales and marketing teams. Salama expects to grow massively in the employee area with a goal of adding another 400 people in the next few years.</p>
<p>He also plans to grow its brands to 10,000 as Inventa goes deeper into the cosmetics, healthy foods and home decor verticals. In addition, the company will focus on its technology development so that it can eventually offer a free software product for small suppliers and retailers.</p>
<p>“Amazon, MercadoLibre and Rappi are catering to the business-to-consumer world, but in B2B, there are much less companies targeting this market,” Salama said. “It is large, but there are no solutions, so we are ready to serve them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weather forecast company <a href="https://www.accuweather.com">AccuWeather</a> is acquiring French startup <a href="https://plumelabs.com/en/">Plume Labs</a> —&nbsp;terms of the deal are undisclosed. Originally founded in 2014, Plume Labs has gradually expanded its product offering to offer three different products focused on air pollution data.</p>
<p>First, the startup launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/plume-air-report-is-a-weather-forecasting-app-for-urban-air-pollution/">a mobile app</a> for iOS and Android that gives you information about air quality. At first, it was a simple city-level air pollution forecasting app. The company would aggregate data from different sources to predict how pollution would evolve over time.</p>
<p>Over time, Plume Labs improved its forecasting abilities as it can now predict air quality for the next few days. Plue Labs uses some machine learning models for its predictions. It now also offers detailed maps with street-by-street information. This way, if you’re commuting to work on a bike or a moped, you know that you should avoid a busy street in particular.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261062" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Plume Labs then wanted to empower its users by making air quality tracking visual and actionable. That’s why it designed its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/plume-labs-flow-is-an-air-quality-tracker-to-avoid-pollution/">air quality tracker</a> that connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth Low Energy.</p>
<p>The second-generation device can track particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) as well as polluting gases (nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds). It&#8217;s been relatively successful as there are currently more Plume Labs devices being used than government-supported monitoring stations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Plume Labs’ Flow is an air quality tracker to avoid pollution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/plume-labs-flow-is-an-air-quality-tracker-to-avoid-pollution/embed/#?secret=QfsdteiDwz" data-secret="QfsdteiDwz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Finally, Plume Labs started offering air pollution data as <a href="https://plumelabs.com/en/forecast-api/">an API</a>. The company has aggregated thousands of environmental monitoring stations around the world and applied its machine learning model on this data. This way, Plume Labs customers get a head start if they want to integrate air quality data in their products. They don&#8217;t have to deal with different data sources and unify these data sets into a single set. Similarly, they don&#8217;t have to allocate resources on machine learning applied to air pollution.</p>
<p>In January 2020, AccuWeather integrated Plume Labs’ data in its weather forecasting products. The weather forecasting company used that opportunity to acquire a stake in Plume Labs. And now, AccuWeather is going one step further and acquiring the rest of the company.</p>
<p>“Air quality plays an intrinsic role in AccuWeather’s mission of saving lives and helping people prosper, and this acquisition will help us provide users and customers with an even more personalized experience as well as a 360-degree understanding of the impact of weather on their wellness,” AccuWeather president Steven R. Smith said in a statement. “Our exclusive alliance delivered on the promise to help put our users in greater control of their health, and we are committed to that goal even more firmly with this new strategic direction.”</p>
<p>Plume Labs will become the center for climate and environmental data for AccuWeather. This acquisition proves that air pollution is becoming a key metric for many industries.</p>
<p>“Seven years ago, David Lissmyr and I launched Plume Labs to make air quality information accessible to everyone,” Plume Labs co-founder and CEO Romain Lacombe said in a statement. “Since then, our work has helped galvanize the fight for clean air by making the health impact of climate change personal. Joining forces with AccuWeather now is an extraordinary opportunity to amplify our impact at planetary scale and help 1.5 billion people avoid air pollution around the world.”</p>
<p>Up next, the Plume Labs team and technology will continue to operate and expand its work to other environmental risks, such as wildfires. Climate risk forecasting is still in its early days, but today’s acquisition confirms that it is going to become more important over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years into the pandemic, online conversations are for many of us still the primary interactions that we are having every day, and we are collectively having billions of them. But as many of us have discovered, not all of those are squeaky clean, positive experiences. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.spectrumlabsai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spectrum Labs</a> &#8212; which provides artificial intelligence technology to platform providers to detect and shut down toxic exchanges in real time (specifically, 20 milliseconds or less) &#8212; is announcing $32 million in funding. It plans to use the money to continue investing in its technology to double down on its growing consumer business and to forge ahead in a new area, providing services to enterprises for their internal and customer-facing conversations, providing not just a way to help detect when toxicity is creeping into exchanges, but to provide an audit trail for the activity for wider trust and safety tracking and initiatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aspire to be the leaders in language where civility matters,&#8221; CEO Justin Davis said in an interview.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Intel Capital, with Munich Re Ventures, Gaingels, OurCrowd, Harris Barton, and previous backers Wing Venture Capital, Greycroft, Ridge Ventures, Super{set}, and Global Founders Capital also participating. Greycroft led Spectrum&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous round of $10 million in September 2020</a>, and the company has now raised $46 million in total.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Davis, who co-founded the company with Josh Newman (the CTO), said Spectrum Labs is not disclosing valuation, but the company&#8217;s business size today speaks to how it&#8217;s been doing.</p>
<p>Spectrum Labs today works with just over 20 big platforms &#8212; they include social networking companies Pinterest and The Meet Group, dating site Grindr, Jimmy Wales&#8217; entertainment wiki Fandom, Riot Games, and e-learning platform Udemy &#8212; which in turn have millions of customers sending billions of messages to each other day, either in open chat rooms or in more direct, private conversations.</p>
<p>Its technology is based around natural language and works in real time both on text-based interactions and audio interactions.</p>
<p>Davis notes that its audio work is &#8220;read&#8221; as audio, not transcribed to text first, which gives Spectrum&#8217;s customers a significant jump on responding to the activity, and counteracting what Davis referred to as &#8220;The Wild West nature of voice,&#8221; due to how slow responses typically are for those not using Spectrum&#8217;s technology: a platform has to wait for users to flag iffy content, then the platform has to find that audio in the transcriptions, and then it can take action &#8212; a process that could take days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is all the more important since voice-based services &#8212; with the rise not just of podcasting but services like Clubhouse and Spaces on Twitter &#8212; are growing in popularity.</p>
<p>Whether text or audio, Spectrum scans these exchanges for toxic content covering more than 40 behavior profiles that it built initially in consultation with researchers and academics around the world and continues to hone as it ingests more data from across the web. The profiles cover parameters like harassment, hate speech, violent extremism, scams, grooming, illegal solicitation and doxxing. It currently supports scanning in nearly 40 languages, Davis tells me, adding that it could work with any language, , although Davis tells me that there is no language limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can technically cover any language in a matter of weeks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The most visible examples of online toxicity have been in the consumer sphere &#8212; where they have played out in open-forum and more private online bullying and hate speech and other illegal activity, an area where Spectrum Labs will continue to do work and invest in technology to detect ever more complicated and sophisticated approaches from bad actors. One focus for Spectrum Labs will be in working on ways to improve how customers themselves can also play a role in deciding what they do and definitely do not want to see, alongside controls and tools for a platform&#8217;s trust and safety team. This is a tricky area, and arguably one reason why toxicity has gotten out of hand is because traditionally platforms have wanted to take a hands-off, free speech approach and not meddle in content, since the other side of the coin is that they can also be accused of censoring, a debate that is still very much playing out today.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a natural tension between what the policy implements and what users want and are willing to accept,&#8221; Davis said. His company&#8217;s view is that the job of a platform &#8220;is keeping the worst of the worst off, but also to provide consumer controls to make selection over what they want to see over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside that, Spectrum plans to move more into enterprise services.</p>
<p>The opportunity in enterprise is an interesting one, as it includes not just how people within a company converse with each other (which largely might take a similar form to the consumer-facing services that Spectrum Labs already provides), but also how a company interfaces with the outside world in areas like sales, customer service and marketing, and then leveraging the information that Spectrum Labs gathers in its analytics to potentially alter how each of those areas subsequently operates.</p>
<p>To be sure, this is not a market segment that has been ignored. Spectrum&#8217;s competitors here will include another startup in the conversation monitoring space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/aware-raises-60m-for-tech-that-monitors-internal-messaging-platforms-for-legal-compliance-sentiment-analysis-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aware</a>, which focuses on enterprise exclusively. (<a href="https://l1ght.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L1ght</a>, meanwhile, is another competitor in the consumer sphere.)</p>
<p>And there will certainly be others. We noted when we last wrote about Spectrum Labs that the founders and founding team came from Krux, a marketing technology company that was acquired by Salesforce (where they worked before leaving to found Spectrum Labs). I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Salesforce taking a more interested role in this area in the future, not least because it is building out a very wide toolset to help companies run their businesses more efficiently, not just limited to CRM; but also because Bret Taylor, who once founded another social network and used to be the CTO of Facebook, is now helping to run the show, and may well have an especially informed grip on how communications forums can be used and abused.</p>
<p>For now, to address both the consumer and enterprise issues, Intel is coming in as a strategic investor in this round, Davis tells me. The plan will be to integrate Spectrum Labs&#8217; technology to work more closely with Intel&#8217;s chip designs, which will increase the speed that it works even more, and Intel will be able to use as a unique selling point with Intel&#8217;s would-be hardware customers as they give a higher priority to trust and safety issues themselves.</p>
<p>“We believe Spectrum Labs’ Natural Language Understanding technology has the potential to become the core platform that powers the trust initiatives of thousands of companies around the world,” said Mark Rostick, VP and senior MD at Intel Capital, in a statement. “As digital trust and ethical operations emerge as a key factor to help organizations differentiate themselves, we see a huge opportunity to build a Trust &amp; Safety tech layer into enterprise operations.”<u></u><u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swiggy, India&#8217;s top food delivery startup, has raised $700 million in a new financing round, just six months after securing $1.25 billion, as it aggressively expands its offerings including the instant-delivery service in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Invesco led the Bengaluru-headquartered startup&#8217;s Series K round, which according to a source familiar with the matter values the seven year-old startup at $10.7 billion. Swiggy was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-raises-1-25-billion-led-by-softbank-and-prosus/">valued at $5.5 billion in July last year</a>.</p>
<p>At a $10.7 billion valuation, Swiggy has surpassed the valuation of its 13-year-old chief rival Zomato, which went public last year and whose market cap has shrunk to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/23/paytm-zomato-nykaa-and-policybazaar-shares-drop-to-record-lows/">under $10 billion</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261033" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>New investors Baron Capital Group, Sumeru Venture, IIFL AMC Late Stake Tech Fund, Kotak, Axis Growth, Sixteenth Street Capital, Ghisallo, Smile Group, Segantii Capital as well as existing backers including Prosus Ventures, Alpha Wave Global, Qatar Investment Authority and ARK Impact also invested in the new round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in late September that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/indian-food-delivery-giant-swiggy-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-over-10-billion-valuation/">Invesco was in talks to lead an investment of over $500 million</a> in Swiggy.</p>
<p>The new funding follows a strong year of growth for Swiggy in which the startup nearly doubled its food delivery business&#8217; gross order value, it said. Instamart, Swiggy&#8217;s instant delivery service, is set to reach an annual GMV run rate of $1 billion in the next three quarters, the startup said.</p>
<p>Instamart has become one of the major focus areas for Swiggy in the past year and a half.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which operates in over 500 Indian cities, said last year that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/swiggy-to-invest-700-million-in-express-delivery-service-instamart/">plans to invest $700 million</a> to scale Instamart&#8217;s offerings and reach. The quick delivery space, which has made inroads in several markets in recent years, is becoming competitive in India, too.</p>
<p>Y Combinator Continuity Fund led the Mumbai-headquartered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-in-india-raises-100-million/">10-minute-delivery service Zepto&#8217;s $100 million funding late last year.</a> Zomato-backed BlinkIt (formerly known as Grofers), which like Swiggy is also backed by SoftBank, pivoted to instant delivery space last year.</p>
<p>“As long-term investors, the Invesco Developing Markets fund seeks investment opportunities in the best companies in the world, led by world-class management teams, and that have the potential for long-term structural growth,” said Justin Leverenz, Chief Investment Officer at Invesco Developing Markets Fund, said in a statement. “Our investment in Swiggy represents such an investment.”</p>
<p>Sriharsha Majety, co-founder and chief executive of Swiggy, said Instamart has reached a GMV in just 17 months what it took the core food delivery business 40 months to deliver.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to make Swiggy the platform that 100 million consumers can use 15 times a month. We will continue to invest in our people, products, and partners to create a positive impact on the ecosystem and accelerate the digital transformation in food and grocery delivery and other on-demand services,” he added.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food services market, which is expected to reach $97 billion by March of 2026, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report to clients last year.</p>
<p>“India food services market is large and expected to reach $97 billion by FY25. Organized food service is growing faster and expected to reach 55% market share by FY25. We expect online penetration to expand to 20% by FY25 and market size to reach $20 billion growing at 46% CAGR. Significant part of the growth will be driven by new customer acquisition and penetration into smaller markets. Zomato had 10 million monthly transacting users (MTU) in FY20, expected to increase 5x by FY25 to ~50 million,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Amazon, a third player, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">entered the food delivery space in India</a> in recent years, but, as a Zomato executive mentioned in a public forum last year, the American e-commerce group has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">yet to make inroads</a> in this category.</p>
