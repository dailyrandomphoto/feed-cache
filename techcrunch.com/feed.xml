					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 16, 2021. While the world deals with myriad issues, we’re sticking to our usual remit. Hugs and love to everyone, and here’s hoping for a better tomorrow. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/">How Nuro is taking on Google, the world:</a> </strong>The race to build commercial-ready self-driving cars is big, well funded and competitive. And companies are taking diverging paths in their approach to the autonomous driving question. Nuro is one such company, and TechCrunch has the inside scoop in our latest EC-1. Enjoy!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">Tesla under investigation for Autopilot crashes:</a> </strong>Speaking of self-driving cars, Tesla’s efforts on the project are in the spotlight after a number of collisions between the company’s cars and parked first-responder vehicles. Tesla’s diver assistance program appears to be the culprit. How you feel about the inquiry will depend on whether you hold Tesla stock, but the situation underscores just how hard it is to get self-driving, full or not, to work in the wild.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/the-hyperactive-late-stage-market-should-keep-the-startup-investing-game-afoot/"><strong>Chime, Carta and Discord:</strong></a> As U.S. unicorns raise new mega-rounds, or work to close their next epic funding round, TechCrunch wondered what the rash of startups worth $10 billion or more could mean for startups earlier in their lifecycle. The news is good for startups and their founders alike.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/roblox-acquires-discord-competitor-guilded/"><strong>Guilded sells to Roblox:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Microsoft failed to acquire Discord, but Roblox didn’t miss when it came to Guilded. Admittedly, Guilded is a far smaller company than Discord, but the two startups play in the same space, so the Roblox deal really does matter. The market for gamer chat apps is probably big enough to support a few players, but Roblox, flush with cash, was more than happy to pony up for Guilded, which raised just over $10 million while private.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/tropic-picks-up-25m-to-streamline-software-procurement-experiences/"><strong>Tropic raises $25M for better software procurement:</strong></a> The pandemic taught the world that software gets paid for. Why? Because without it business literally stops. Software companies did well during the pandemic thanks to the centrality to regular operations that their business enjoyed. But no one wants to overpay. That’s where Tropic comes in &#8212; and now the startup that wants to help others spend less on software has $25 million to play with.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/shopistry-bags-2m-to-provide-headless-commerce-without-the-headaches/"><strong>Shopistry raises $2M for better headless commerce:</strong></a> We are presuming that this startup’s name is pronounced <em>SHOP-istry</em>, else it would make little sense. Regardless, Shopistry is building a modular e-commerce service that it thinks is better than other headless e-commerce services. It has pretty big competition in BigCommerce and Shopify, but those companies were also once wee startups.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/brainq-raises-40m-to-transform-stroke-patient-rehabilitation-with-its-home-therapy-device/">BrainQ wants to transform stroke rehab:</a> </strong>At-home stroke therapy startup BrainQ has racked up a $40 million round, TechCrunch wrote today. What does its hardware do? It “stimulates the damaged part of the brain and promotes self-repair,” and does so with enough impact that it secured “a Breakthrough Device certification from the FDA.” I mean, that’s super cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/how-one-founder-identified-a-gap-in-education-working-as-a-teacher-and-built-a-startup-to-fix-it/"><strong>How Amanda DoAmaral built Fiveable:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today on the Found podcast, TechCrunch has a real treat: “Hear how DoAmaral took her dissatisfaction with an inadequate system and turned that into the motivation to build a venture-scale business outside of it.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Nuro EC-1</h2>
<p>In 2010, Google&#8217;s autonomous vehicle project placed self-driving cars on Bay Area streets and freeways, but practical applications were thought to be at least a decade away.</p>
<p>The futurists were right on schedule: In 2020, Mountain View-based Nuro was testing its second-generation R2 robotic vehicle, the first to earn a federal exemption to operate an autonomous vehicle.</p>
<p>By the time Nuro raised $940 million for its Series B, it had already partnered with companies like CVS, Walmart and Domino&#8217;s to use the R2 for last-mile deliveries.</p>
<p>But before Nuro could even consider reaching product-market fit, its founders had to overcome technological challenges, win over regulators and strike partnerships with a range of consumer-facing companies.</p>
<p>“Neither JZ nor I think of ourselves as classic entrepreneurs or that starting a company is something we had to do in our lives,” says co-founder Dave Ferguson. “It was much more the result of soul searching and trying to figure out what is the biggest possible impact that we could have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/">How Google’s self-driving car project accidentally spawned its robotic delivery rival</a></p>
<p>Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-regulations/">Why regulators love Nuro’s self-driving delivery vehicles</a></p>
<p>Part 3: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-partnerships/">How Nuro became the robotic face of Domino’s</a></p>
<p>Part 4: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-operations/">Here’s what the inevitable friendly neighborhood robot invasion looks like</a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/tinder-will-soon-make-voluntary-id-verification-available-globally/"><strong>Soon everyone will be able to verify their Tinder date:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After initially rolling out in Japan back in 2019, Tinder intends to roll out ID verification for all of its users around the world in coming quarters. Frankly, this sounds like a good idea, and one that could improve the app’s overall safety. Our only question is how it took this long for Tinder to get to.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/cisco-beefing-up-app-monitoring-portfolio-with-acquisition-of-epsagon-for-500m/"><strong>Cisco buys Epsagon:</strong></a> U.S. tech company Cisco has plonked down around $500 million for Israeli app monitoring company Epsagon. Sure, Israel is best known for its cybersecurity work, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the country is one-note. The deal didn’t appear to move Cisco’s stock, which eased modestly during a generally lackluster day for technology shares. Still, we don’t see this size of deal as often as we once did, it feels, so we wanted to highlight it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/pearson-to-pay-1m-fine-for-misleading-investors-about-2018-data-breach/">Do you want more privacy breaches? This is how you get more privacy breaches.</a> </strong>That’s my takeaway from news that Pearson is paying a $1 million fine for a 2018 breach that leaked millions of student records, one that it failed to mention to investors. The SEC agreed to the settlement. Next they’ll fine Exxon $47.29 for lying about climate change.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After meeting an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/">ignominious end in 2017</a>, the anonymous gossip app once popular with college students lives again. Yik Yak returned to the iOS App Store on Monday (sorry, Android users) under new ownership, inspiring a fresh round of interest in the long-dead social network.</p>

<p>&mdash; Yik Yak (@YikYakApp) <a href="https://twitter.com/YikYakApp/status/1427310464585900035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With a reputation for rampant cyber-bullying and harassment, moderation woes were central to the app&#8217;s failure. Once ubiquitous on many college campuses, Yik Yak <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/fading-anonymous-social-network-yik-yak-is-reportedly-laying-off-most-of-its-employees/">limped into 2016</a>, laying off most employees and struggling to keep users engaged. The app tried to pivot away from campus gossip and toward location-based social networking that same year, but it wasn&#8217;t enough and the once high-flying social network was sold for scrap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GVis4hJnsW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/">Yik Yak shuts down after Square paid $1 million for its engineers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yik Yak shuts down after Square paid $1 million for its engineers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/embed/#?secret=GVis4hJnsW" data-secret="GVis4hJnsW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As co-founders Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington wound down the app in 2017, Square paid $1 million for several Yik Yak engineers and rights to some of the company&#8217;s intellectual property. The company had raised $73 million and was valued around $400 million in 2014, during its peak. TechCrunch contacted the company for information about its new ownership, which is apparently based in Nashville, but has yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>Though we&#8217;re still not sure who re-launched it, the new version of Yik Yak is well aware of the original app&#8217;s pitfalls. After providing a phone number to sign up, a short onboarding sequence warns users of a zero tolerance &#8220;one strike and you&#8217;re out&#8221; policy for bullying and threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re committed to combating bullying and hate speech on the Yik Yak platform by any means necessary,&#8221; the new Yik Yak team, which acquired the rights to develop the app in February, <a href="https://yikyak.com/the-yak-is-back">wrote on a relaunched website</a>.</p>
<p>Being aware of what issues will inevitably arise on a social network and being prepared to moderate those issues at scale are two very different propositions. Yik Yak is anonymous, but it&#8217;s also an app focused on what&#8217;s happening IRL nearby within a tight radius, two factors that could combine to pose even more of a moderation challenge.</p>
<p>Within the new app, a sidebar points users toward &#8220;stay safe&#8221; resources address and array of issues that could arise on the app, like ridesharing, bullying, sexual consent and COVID-19, though the app doesn&#8217;t yet include explicit misinformation policies.</p>
<p>Another section in the sidebar offers a list of mental health resources and encourages users to downvote and report any bullying on the app so it can be reviewed by the Yik Yak team. The company says that yaks with a negative ranking from five or more downvotes will be automatically removed from the app&#8217;s feed, though we&#8217;ve asked the company for more details about its content moderation plans, including if a team at Yik Yak is dedicated to the task.</p>
<p>The new Yik Yak is built around location-based sharing and users can share messages, called &#8220;yaks,&#8221; to anyone within a five-mile radius. If you&#8217;re in a rural area or otherwise quiet zone devoid of yaks, you can amuse yourself with the confessions that show up on a chart of popular national posts.</p>
<p>For now, many high-ranking posts are excited chatter about the app&#8217;s return from former Yik Yak devotees — mostly younger millennials who&#8217;ve since graduated from college. A smattering of popular posts warns that Gen Z-ers too young to have used Yik Yak during its heyday won&#8217;t know what hit them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this app now 100% 25-30 year olds?&#8221; one post reads. &#8220;The Zoomers aren&#8217;t ready for the return of the Yak,&#8221; another user wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korea’s LG Energy Solution has entered into a six-year agreement with an Australian mining company for cobalt and nickel, securing a stable supply of key minerals to make electric vehicle batteries.</p>
<p>LG Energy, a subsidiary of LG Chem, will purchase 71,000 dry metric tons of nickel and 7,000 dry metric tons of cobalt from Australian Mines Limited starting from the end of 2024. That’s enough raw material to make batteries for 1.3 million EVs with a driving range of over 310 miles per charge.</p>
<p>“Securing key raw materials and a responsible battery supply chain has become a critical element in gaining a greater control within the industry, as the demand for electric vehicles worldwide heightened in recent years,” LG Energy Solution CEO Jong-hyun Kim said in a statement.</p>
<p>The materials will be sourced from Australian Mines’ $1.5 billion Sconi Project based in Queensland, which is currently under development. The site will use a “dry stacking method” to store filtered tailings, an alternative and more eco-friendly way to manage waste from a mining site. Instead of dumping tailings into local water sources or burying them in underground quarries, dry stacking removes the water from the waste, leaving a sand-like substance that can be securely stored in management facilities.</p>
<p>“Although more costly compared to the conventional method due to construction and maintenance expenses, the dry stacking method is deemed an environmentally friendly way to extract raw materials,” LG Energy said in a statement.</p>
<p>The sole condition to the agreement is that Australian Mines secure financing for the construction of the project before the end of June next year. If secured, the agreement would account for all of the anticipated output of the site.</p>
<p>The two companies have the option to extend the agreement by another five years by mutual agreement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LG Energy is a subsidiary of LG Chem, one of the world’s largest producers of batteries and battery materials. Last month, the company said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/lg-chem-will-invest-5-2b-in-battery-materials-through-2025/">it had earmarked</a> ₩6 trillion ($5.2 billion) in its battery businesses, specifically the production of anode materials, separation membranes and cathode binders. Earlier this summer, it also entered into an agreement with Queensland Pacific Metals valued at ₩12 billion ($10.3 million), for 7,000 tons of nickel and 700 tons of cobalt per year over a 10-year period.</p>
<p>LG Chem counts Volkswagen, General Motors and Tesla amongst its customers. It said it anticipates the global battery market only expanding in the coming years, from ₩39 trillion ($34 billion) in 2021 to ₩100 trillion ($87 billion) by 2026.</p>
<p>It isn’t the only major player vying to secure sources of raw materials. In a move to obtain its own battery source, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">Tesla inked a deal</a> with commodity production giant BHP in July for nickel from its mines in Western Australian.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">T-Mobile has confirmed &#8220;unauthorized access&#8221; to its systems, days after a portion of customer data was listed for sale on a known cybercriminal forum.</p>
<p>The U.S. cell giant, which last year completed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/t-mobile-officially-completes-merger-with-sprint-ceo-john-legere-steps-down-ahead-of-schedule/">a $26 billion merger with Sprint</a>, confirmed an intrusion but that it has &#8220;not yet determined that there is any personal customer data involved.&#8221; The company said that its investigation will &#8220;take some time,&#8221; and no timeline was given.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed, and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Vice reported <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million">this weekend</a> that T-Mobile was investigating a possible intrusion after a seller was claiming to be in possession of millions of records. The seller told Vice that they had 100 million records on T-Mobile customers, which included customer account names, phone numbers, the IMEI numbers of phones on the account, and Social Security number and driver&#8217;s license information — details that the company often collects to verify the identities of its customers.</p>
<p>Vice verified a sample of the records from the seller, suggesting the data is in at least partially valid.</p>
<p>The forum post, which TechCrunch has seen, asks for 6 bitcoin, or about $275,000, for a 30 million subset of customers&#8217; data. The data was allegedly obtained from a T-Mobile-run database server that was connected to the internet, according to a screenshot posted <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-claims-to-steal-data-of-100-million-t-mobile-customers/">by Bleeping Computer</a>, which also reported that the seller has the IMEI database &#8220;going back to 2004.&#8221; IMEI and ISMI numbers can be used to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">uniquely identify and locate</a> a cellphone user.</p>
<p>An earlier post seen by TechCrunch from the same seller and using the same sample of data claimed to have 124 million records, but still did not name T-Mobile as the source of the data. The post was deleted in the past few days.</p>
<p>This is by our count the fifth time that T-Mobile was hacked in recent years.</p>
<p>In January, T-Mobile said it had a data breach that saw cybercriminals steal about 200,000 call records and other subscriber data. Last year, T-Mobile had two incidents — it <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/t-mobile-says-hacker-gained-access-to-employee-email-accounts-user-data/">admitted a breach</a> on its email systems that saw hackers access some T-Mobile employee email accounts and access customer data; and a breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/more-than-1-million-t-mobile-customers-exposed-by-breach/">a million prepaid customers&#8217;</a> personal and billing information months later. In 2018, T-Mobile said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/t-mobile-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-data-breach/">as many as two million customers</a> may have had their personal information scraped.</p>

		<blockquote>
			It used to be that if you were a fintech startup or, for lack of a better term, a digitally native financial services business, you might be eyeing an acquisition from an incumbent in the industry.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But lately, fintech upstarts are the ones doing the acquiring. Over just the last year or so, we’ve seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>In February 2020, <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">LendingClub</a> announced plans to <a href="https://bank.lendingclub.com/lendingclub-announces-acquisition-of-radius-bank/">acquire Radius Bank</a> in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $185 million. The deal <a href="https://bank.lendingclub.com/its-official-today-radius-joined-lendingclub/">closed in February 2021</a>, leading to a very quick and surprising <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lendingclub-stock-jumps-40-after-surprise-q2-profit-11627505448?mod=article_inline">second-quarter profit</a>.</li>
<li>In March of this year, <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/sofi-acquires-community-bank-golden-pacific-bancorp-to-speed-up-its-national-bank-charter-process/">agreed to acquire Golden Pacific Bancorp (GBP)</a> for about $22.3 million in a deal that was designed to accelerate its acquisition of a national bank charter.</li>
<li>Earlier this month, blockchain-based lender <a href="https://www.figure.com/">Figure Technologies</a> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210803005925/en/Figure-Announces-Merger-With-Top-Mortgage-Lender-Homebridge-Financial-Services">agreed to merge</a> with mortgage firm Homebridge Financial Services, which has 180 retail branches and funded more than $25 billion in home loans in 2020.</li>
<li>And last fall, fintech startup and challenger bank Jiko <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/09/04/fintech-startup-jiko-completes-buy-of-nationally-regulated-u-s-bank/">acquired Wadena, Minnesota-based Mid-Central National Bank</a> in a deal that took years of due diligence and whose sales price fell in the range of a Series A round, according to the founder.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s going on here? Why are fintechs now acquiring legacy financial services businesses, instead of the other way around?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s ambitious upstart decentralized social media working group &#8220;<a href="https://blueskyweb.org/">bluesky</a>&#8221; took an important step Monday as the social media company appointed a formal project lead who will direct how the protocol develops moving forward.</p>
<p>Crypto developer Jay Graber was tapped by Twitter to helm the initiative, which the company hopes will eventually create a decentralized social media protocol that a number of social networks including Twitter will operate on. The separate bluesky organization will operate independently but to date has been funded and managed largely by employees at Twitter.</p>
<p>Graber had already been working in a less formal role inside the bluesky team, with Twitter paying her to create a technical review of the decentralized social ecosystem for a working group of developers in the space. Graber previously worked on the developer team behind privacy focused cryptocurrency Zcash and built out her own decentralized social network called <a href="https://happening.net/">Happening</a>, designed to compete with Facebook Events. Graber eventually walked away from the effort after having issues bootstrapping a user base interested in the benefits of decentralization, something that has grown to be a near-insurmountable issue for most upstart networks in the space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m excited to announce that I’ll be leading <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bluesky</a>, an initiative started by <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Twitter</a> to decentralize social media.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In an interview back in January, Graber told TechCrunch she saw a major opportunity in Twitter entering the decentralized social space due to the hefty user base on the Twitter platform, which will itself eventually migrate to the protocol, the company has said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The really powerful thing about Twitter doing a decentralized protocol move is that if you could design a protocol that works in an ideal way, you don&#8217;t have to go through the initial effort of finding the niche to bootstrap from because Twitter will bring so many users,&#8221; Graber told us.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In January, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">TechCrunch profiled the initiative</a> as it gathered more attention following Twitter&#8217;s permanent ban of former President Donald Trump from its platform. Following Trump&#8217;s removal, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey highlighted the bluesky effort as one of the company&#8217;s ongoing initiatives to ensure that social media moderation could be less </span>decentralized<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in the future. A decentralized social media protocol would allow for individual networks to govern themselves without one company or organization exercising monolithic control over the sphere of online conversations. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think a huge focus for everyone involved has been thinking how do we enable better moderation, and not just coming from one source,&#8221; Graber told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The bluesky organization is still in its earliest stages. Graber&#8217;s next task is bulking up the team with its first hires, which include a protocol developer and web developer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford-owned micromobility company Spin has announced an integration with Google Maps. Now, users planning their trips in 84 cities, towns and campuses across the U.S., Canada, Germany and Spain will be able to view Spin&#8217;s electric scooters and bikes on the app while planning their trip.</p>
<p>Spin joins its top competition on the popular mapping app, Lime, which also recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">announced an integration with transit planning app Moovit</a>. We can expect to see further integrations of micromobility operators with mapping apps as shared mobility becomes part of the broader transit ecosystem.</p>
<p>A recent report from the <a href="https://nabsa.net/about/industry/">North American Bikeshare &amp; Scootershare Association</a> on the state of the micromobility industry found that 50% of riders reported using shared mobility to connect to transit, and 16% of all micromobility trips were for the purpose of connecting to transit.</p>
<p>Similar to Lime, the Spin icon will now show up under Google Map&#8217;s bike section when planning a journey &#8212; only in the mobile app, not on the desktop. A user will see the nearest available Spin vehicle, how long it will take to walk to it, what the estimated battery range is and the expected arrival time if using the vehicle. Choosing that option will direct users to the Spin app to pay for and unlock the vehicle.</p>
<p>“With this integration, Spin is making it easier for millions of Google Maps users to easily incorporate shared bikes and scooters into their daily trips,” Ben Bear, CEO of Spin, said in a statement. “Our goal is to make it as low friction as possible for consumers to plan multi-modal journeys. It needs to be just as easy, and even more convenient to get around with bikes, buses, trains and scooters as it is with a personal car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bear also said this collaboration with Google is Spin&#8217;s largest yet, and he teased &#8220;many more in the pipeline.&#8221; Spin is already integrated into platforms like Citymapper, Moovit, Transit and Kölner Verkehrs-Betriebe. This news comes not long after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/">Spin announced it would be adding e-bikes to the mix</a> and trying to capture market share with exclusive or semi-exclusive city partnerships. A major app integration such as this one could be a vote of confidence for Spin looking to partner with more cities in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder announced this morning that in the &#8220;<a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">coming quarters</a>,&#8221; users will be able to verify their ID on the app. This feature <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041821872-Age-verify-to-chat-with-matches">was first rolled out in Japan</a> in 2019, where Tinder users must verify that they are at least 18 years old. Aside from places like Japan, where this is mandated by law, ID verification will &#8220;begin as voluntary,&#8221; Tinder wrote in a <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>ID verification will be free for all users, similar to its <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034941812-What-is-Photo-Verification-">photo verification</a> feature. According to a Tinder spokesperson, the company will also use ID verification to cross-reference data like the sex offender registry in regions where that information is accessible. Tinder already does this via credit card lookup when users sign up for a subscription. Per its <a href="https://policies.tinder.com/terms/us/en">terms of use</a>, Tinder requires that users &#8220;have never been convicted of or pled no contest to a felony, a sex crime, or any crime involving violence, and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The existing photo verification feature adds a Twitter-like blue check to a user&#8217;s profile, while ID verification will yield another distinct badge. That way, users can tell whether or not a potential date has confirmed their identity via photo verification, ID verification, both or neither.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating a truly equitable solution for ID Verification is a challenging, but critical safety project and we are looking to our communities as well as experts to help inform our approach,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>While Tinder has made continued investments in safety features, free ID verification can only go so far &#8212; especially when voluntary, putting the onus on individual users to decide whether or not they feel comfortable meeting up with unverified users. But in March 2021, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Match Group, the parent company to Tinder, announced its </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/match-group-makes-seven-figure-investment-in-background-check-nonprofit-garbo/">seven-figure contribution</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to the nonprofit background check company Garbo. </span>Garbo&#8217;s background checks could help detect dating app users with a history of violence or abuse, but we have yet to see how that will be integrated into Tinder, and if users will be charged for access. Notably, Garbo conducts &#8220;equitable background&#8221; checks, meaning that it will exclude <a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715">drug possession charges and minor traffic incidents</a> on its platform, citing the way that these charges are disproportionately levied against vulnerable communities.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Though Tinder said it will not be using Garbo&#8217;s tech to power its ID verification tools, the company noted to TechCrunch that it will have more information to share about background checks via Garbo in the fall. Tinder didn&#8217;t share whether or not access to information from Garbo will be paywalled. At the time of the investment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/match-group-makes-seven-figure-investment-in-background-check-nonprofit-garbo/">Match Group said</a> it would determine pricing &#8212; if it does choose to paywall this information &#8212; based on factors like user adoption, how many people want to use it and how many searches they want to perform.</span></p>
<p>Tinder&#8217;s investment in safety features is encouraging, but if left behind a paywall, impact may be limited. Match Group faced serious scrutiny in December 2019, when <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one">an investigation</a> by Columbia Journalism Investigations (CJI) and ProPublica found that the company screened for sexual predators on Match, a paid service, but not on free apps like Tinder, OkCupid and PlentyofFish. At the time, a spokesperson for the company said, “There are definitely registered sex offenders on our free products.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In January 2020, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/subcommittee-chairman-krishnamoorthi-launches-investigation-into-user-safety">launched an investigation</a> into user safety policies on dating apps, sending letters to Match Group, The Meet Group, Bumble and Grindr. He wrote, &#8220;Protection from sexual predators should not be a luxury confined to paying customers.” The following month, U.S. Representatives Ann Kuster (D-NH) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) wrote a <a href="https://schakowsky.house.gov/media/press-releases/schakowsky-kuster-lead-letter-match-group-president-calling-improvements">letter to Match Group</a>, signed by nine other representatives, stating their concern that Match Group doesn&#8217;t cross-reference user responses with sex offender registries.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Around the same time, Match Group made several moves to invest more deeply in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-02-25-The-Top-10-Safety-Focused-Features-on-Tinder">user safety</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; for example, it </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">acquired Noonlight</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in January 2020, which allows users in the U.S. to share who, when and where they&#8217;re meeting someone. In dangerous situations, users can discreetly trigger emergency services &#8212; Noonlight will first reach out to the user, then call 911 if necessary (Noonlight&#8217;s basic version is free, but some features like connecting to an Apple Watch, Google Home or Alexa are only available by upgrading to a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://help.noonlight.com/en/articles/3270559-how-much-does-noonlight-cost">$5 or $10 monthly plan</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">). Features like these can be controversial due to concerns about police intervention, but might help some users feel a sense of security. But blocking offenders prior to signup could lessen the need for such intervention in the first place.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The past decade has seen several structural changes in know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations in Europe and globally. High-profile money laundering cases and the penetration of illicit funds into global markets have caught the attention of regulators and the public, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>The Wirecard scandal was a particularly salacious example, in which the investigation into widespread fraud <a href="https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/07/wirecard-a-scandal/">revealed a chain of shell companies involved in illegal distribution of narcotics and pornography</a>. Over at Danske Bank, some <a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/aml/how-danske-is-cleaning-up-after-a-200b-money-laundering-scandal/29595.article">$227 billion was laundered through an Estonian subsidiary</a>, going virtually unnoticed for nine years.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an action <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338">against Ripple Labs and two of its executives</a>, claiming they had raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering. That case is ongoing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Traditional forms of regulation from the fiat world do not reciprocally apply to every aspect of crypto nor to the fundamental nature of blockchain technology.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As regulators and financial institutions improve their understanding of these criminal practices, AML requirements have likewise been improved. But these adjustments have been an overwhelmingly reactive, trial-by-fire process.</p>
<p>To address the challenges of the fast-evolving blockchain ecosystem, the European Union has begun to introduce more stringent financial regulations that further bolster the regulatory system in order to improve licensing models. Many member states now regulate crypto assets individually, and Germany is leading the way in being the first to regulate cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>These individual regulations clearly prescribe the pathway for crypto companies, outlining the requirements for obtaining and maintaining a financial license from the regulator. Compliance naturally boosts investor confidence and protection.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As these financial crimes and crypto itself evolves, so have regulatory bodies’ efforts to monitor, address and enforce restrictions. Internationally, the most prominent monitoring body is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which outlines general guidance and determines best practices in anti-money-laundering practices and combating the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p>Although FATF is considered soft law, the task force sets the bar for workable regulations within crypto assets. Especially notable is FATF’s Recommendation 16, better known as the “travel rule,” which requires businesses to collect and store the personal data of participants in blockchain transactions. In theory, access to this data will enable authorities to have better oversight and enforcement of crypto market regulations. In other words, they’ll know exactly who is doing exactly what. Transparency is key.</p>
<h2>The travel rule conundrum</h2>
<p>FATF’s travel rule impacts two types of businesses: traditional financial institutions (banks, credit firms and so on) and crypto companies, otherwise known as <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/latest-fatf-rules-jolt-crypto-businesses-what-are-the-new-realities-crypto-has-to-acknowledge-to-stay-afloat/">virtual asset service providers</a> (VASPs).</p>
<p>In its original incarnation, the travel rule only applied to banks, but was expanded to crypto companies in 2019. In 2021, many of the FATF member jurisdictions began to incorporate the travel rule into their local AML laws. This regulatory shift sent shockwaves through the crypto sector. The stakes of refusal are high: Failure to incorporate the travel rule results in a service provider being declared noncompliant, which is a major obstacle to doing business.</p>
<p>But, the travel rule is also a major hindrance that doesn’t take into account the novelty of crypto technology. It is problematic for crypto businesses to integrate due to the major amount of effort it poses when obtaining KYC data about the recipient and integrating it into day-to-day business.</p>
<p>In order for crypto businesses to obtain this information for outgoing payments, data would have to be provided by the client and would end up being virtually impossible to verify. This is highly disruptive to the crypto’s emblematic efficiency. Moreover, its implementation presents challenges regarding the accuracy of the data received by VASPs and banks. Also, it creates further data vulnerabilities due to additional data silos being created across the globe.</p>
<p>When it comes to international standardization measures rather than those isolated within certain communities, there is a wide gap between exclusively on-chain solutions (transactions that are recorded and verified on one specific blockchain) and cross-chain communication, which allows for interactions between different blockchains or for combining on-chain transactions with off-chain transactions that are conducted on other electronic systems, such as PayPal.</p>
<p>We must eventually find a halfway point between those with valid concerns about the anonymity crypto assets provide and those who see regulation as prohibitively restrictive on crypto. Both sides have a point, but crypto’s continued legitimacy and viability within the larger financial markets and industry is a net positive for all parties, making this negotiation nothing short of crucial.</p>
<h2>Not anti-regulation, just anti-unworkable regulations</h2>
<p>Ultimately, we need to regulate with efficacy, which necessitates legislation that is applicable specifically to digital assets and does not hinder the market without really solving any AML-related problems.</p>
<p>The already global nature of the traditional financial industry underscores the value of and need for FATF’s issuance of an international framework for regulatory oversight within crypto.</p>
<p>The criminal financial trade &#8212; money laundering, illegal weapons sales, human trafficking and so on &#8212; is also an international business. Thus, cracking down on it is, out of necessity, an international effort.</p>
<p>The decentralized nature of blockchain, which runs contrary to the central-server standard we know and use nearly everywhere, presents a formidable challenge here. Rules and regulations for traditional financial institutions are being implemented part and parcel onto crypto — a misstep and misunderstanding that ignores the innovation and novelty this economic ecosystem and its underlying technology entails.</p>
<p>Traditional forms of regulation from the fiat world do not reciprocally apply to every aspect of crypto nor to the fundamental nature of blockchain technology. However well intentioned they may be, because these imposed regulations are built on an old system, they must be adapted and modified.</p>
<p>The creation of fair restrictions on the technology’s use requires a fundamental understanding and cooperation within the limits and characteristics of those technologies. In traditional financial circles, the topic of blockchain is currently subject to more impassioned rhetoric than genuine understanding.</p>
<p>At the heart of the issue is the fundamental misunderstanding that blockchain transactions are anonymous or untraceable. Blockchain transactions are pseudo-anonymous and, in most circumstances, can offer more traceability and transparency than traditional banking. Illegal activity conducted on the blockchain will always be far more traceable than cash transactions, for example.</p>
<p>Technology with such immense potential should be made accessible, regulated and beneficial for everyone. Blockchain and digital assets are already revolutionizing the way we operate, and regulatory measures need to follow suit. The way forward cannot simply be delivering old-school directives, demanding obedience and doling out unfair punishments. There’s no reason a new way forward isn’t possible.</p>
<h2>The end of the outlaw era</h2>
<p>Activity can already be monitored through a collective database of users known to abide by international standards. This knowledge of approved users and vendors allows the industry to spot misconduct or malfeasance far sooner than usual, singling out and restricting illegitimate users.</p>
<p>By means of a well-thought-through tweaking of the suggested regulations, a verified network can collectively be built to ensure trust and properly leverage blockchain’s potential, while barring those bad actors intent on corrupting or manipulating the system. That would be a huge step forward in prosecuting international financial crimes and ensuring crypto’s legitimacy globally.</p>
<p>Crypto’s outlaw days are over, but it’s gained an unprecedented level of legitimacy that can only be preserved and bolstered by abiding with regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>That regulatory oversight can’t just be the old way of doing things copy-and-pasted onto blockchain transactions. Instead, it needs to be one that helps fight criminal activity, shores up investor confidence and throws a bone &#8212; not a wrench &#8212; to the very mechanics that make crypto a desirable financial investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pearson/">Pearson</a>, a London-based publishing and education giant that provides software to schools and universities has agreed to pay $1 million to settle charges that it misled investors about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/education-software-maker-pearson-says-data-breach-affected-thousands-of-accounts-in-the-u-s/">a 2018 data breach resulting in the theft of millions of student records</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-154">settlement</a> on Monday after the agency found that Pearson made “misleading statements and omissions” about its 2018 data breach, which saw millions of student usernames and scrambled passwords stolen, along with the administrator login credentials of 13,000 schools, district and university customer accounts.</p>
<p>The agency said that in Person&#8217;s semi-annual review filed in July 2019, the company referred to the incident as a “hypothetical risk,” even after the data breach had happened. Similarly, <a href="https://www.pearson.com/news-and-research/announcements/2019/07/pearson-customer-notification.html">in a statement that same month</a>, Pearson said the breach may include dates of birth and email addresses, when it knew that such records were stolen, according to the SEC.</p>
<p>Pearson also said that it had &#8220;strict protections&#8221; in place when it actually took the company six months to patch the vulnerability after it was notified.</p>
<p>“As the order finds, Pearson opted not to disclose this breach to investors until it was contacted by the media, and even then Pearson understated the nature and scope of the incident, and overstated the company’s data protections,” said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit. “As public companies face the growing threat of cyber intrusions, they must provide accurate information to investors about material cyber incidents.”</p>
<p>While Pearson did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, Pearson agreed to pay a $1 million penalty — a small fraction of the $489 million in pre-tax profits that the company raked in last year.</p>
<p>A Pearson spokesperson told TechCrunch: “We&#8217;re pleased to resolve this matter with the SEC. We also appreciate the work of the FBI and the Justice Department to identify and charge those responsible for a global cyberattack that affected Pearson and many other companies and industries, including at least one government agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pearson said the breach related to its AIMSweb1.0 web-based software for entering and tracking students’ academic performance, which it retired in July 2019. &#8220;Pearson continues to enhance its cybersecurity efforts to minimize the risk of cyberattacks in an ever-changing threat landscape,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox is using M&amp;A to bulk up its social infrastructure, announcing Monday morning that they had acquired the team at <a href="https://www.guilded.gg/">Guilded</a> that has been building a chat platform for competitive gamers.</p>
<p>The service competes with gaming chat giant Discord, with the team&#8217;s founders telling TechCrunch in the past that as Discord&#8217;s ambitions had grown beyond the gaming world, its core product was meeting fewer competitive gaming needs. Like Discord, users can have text and voice conversations on the Guilded platform, but Guilded also allowed users to organize communities around events and calendars, with plenty of specific functionality designed around ensuring that tournaments happened seamlessly.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s product supported hundreds of games, with specific functionality for a handful of titles, including League of Legends, Fortnite, CS: GO and, yes, Roblox. Earlier this year, the company launched a bot API designed to help nontechnical users build bots that could enrich their gaming communities.</p>
<p>Guilded had raised $10.2 million in venture capital funding to date according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/guilded/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/guilded-raises-7-million-for-its-competitive-gaming-focused-chat-app/">$7 million Series A</a> led by Matrix Partners early last year. The company launched out of Y Combinator in mid-2017.</p>

<p>Terms of the Roblox deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. In an announcement <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005389/en/Roblox-Acquires-Guilded-a-Platform-to-Connect-Gaming-Communities">post</a>, Roblox detailed that the Guilded team will operate as an independent product group going forward. In a<a href="https://www.guilded.gg/blog/joining-roblox"> separate blog post</a>, Guilded CEO Eli Brown wrote that existing stakeholders will be able to continue using the product as they have previously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone &#8211; including communities, partners, and bot developers &#8211; will be able to keep using Guilded the same way you are now,&#8221; Brown wrote. &#8220;Roblox believes in our team and in our mission, and we&#8217;re going to continue to operate as an independent product in order to achieve it.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Roblox has seen profound success and heightened investor attention in recent years as the pandemic has pushed more gamers online and brought more users into the fold, but that success has drawn the attention of competitors. In June, Facebook acquired a small Roblox competitor called Crayta, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing just weeks ago that he planned to transform Facebook into a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; company, using a term many have come to associate closely with what Roblox has been building. Guilded represents an opportunity for Roblox to bring its user base deeper inside its own suite of products, creating a social infrastructure that keeps users engaged.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin, the space company helmed by billionaire Jeff Bezos, is taking NASA to court. The company filed a complaint with a federal claims court on Monday over the agency’s decision to award a lunar lander contract solely to rival company SpaceX.</p>
<p>The complaint, which Blue Origin successfully petitioned to have sealed, says NASA&#8217;s evaluation of proposals for the the Human Landing System was &#8220;unlawful and improper.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Blue Origin filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA’s Human Landing System,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition, and ensure a safe return to the moon for America.”</p>
<p>The Human Landing System, a key part of NASA’s forthcoming Artemis program, is the lander that will return humans to the moon’s surface for the first time since the days of Apollo. NASA aims to have the human lander touching down at the lunar south pole in 2024.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">NASA awarded the HLS contract</a> to a single company — SpaceX, which submitted a $2.9 billion bid. That NASA selected only one company, rather than two, was a surprise (the agency likes to hedge its bets). Only a few weeks later, Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics, which also submitted a bid for the lander program, filed separate protests with the Government Accountability Office over the decision. GAO later upheld NASA’s decision, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/government-watchdog-rejects-blue-origins-protest-over-lunar-lander-contract/">maintaining that</a> “the [contract] announcement reserved the right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no award at all.”</p>
<p>(Read a blow-by-blow of GAO’s rationale by TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">here</a>).</p>
<p>When GAO released its decision, it seemed like that might have been case closed: SpaceX won, Blue Origin lost. This new lawsuit, filed to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, is a clear signal that Jeff Bezos’ company has no intention of backing down.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For its part, a NASA spokesperson would say little more to TechCrunch than that the agency was notified of the complaint and &#8220;officials are currently reviewing details of the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a federal court filing represents Blue Origin’s buttoned-up protests, the company has also been waging a separate attack on social media, releasing a series of infographics aimed at discrediting SpaceX’s Starship and NASA’s decision to use it for moon missions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190043" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190043" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190043" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1325" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg 1275w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=116,150 116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=232,300 232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=768,994 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=525,680 525w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=1187,1536 1187w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blue-origin-hls-national-team-lunar-starship-infographic.jpg?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190043" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.blueorigin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Origin <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>On one infographic, referring to Starship, the words “IMMENSELY COMPLEX &amp; HIGH RISK” blaze across the image in red; another described it as “a launch vehicle that has never flown to orbit and is still being designed.”</p>
<p>The case number is 1:21-cv-01695-RAH. TechCrunch has reached out to NASA for comment and will update the story if they respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic was a catalyst for showing companies looking to cut costs just how much they were spending on their software tools. New York-based <a href="https://tropicapp.io/">Tropic</a>’s platform not only uncovers those savings, but also brings a click-and-approve approach to buying software. Today, the company announced a $25 million Series A round of funding.</p>
<p>Canaan Partners led the round, with participation from Founder Collective and Mo Koyfman’s new fund, Shine. It gives Tropic $27.1 million in total funding since the company emerged from stealth in 2020, CEO David Campbell told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Prior to founding the company with Justin Etkin, Campbell was in technology and sales roles, selling software contracts of every size, and realized how complex and rigid the contracts were getting as companies grew larger and the lack of price transparency increased. The complexity of some contracts can cause companies to overpay, even locking companies into payments they can’t afford, Campbell said.</p>
<p>On top of that, more buyers are younger now and their experience with purchasing software is pulling out their phone to download an app, while buying a customer relationship management tool will take six months to buy and cost thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>“Looking at the space, we are in a mirror maze of software, including companies using software to build products that they then sell back to the software companies,” Campbell said. “Companies are only buying software once a year, yet the process can be so complex.”</p>
<p>Tropic’s SaaS procurement model gathers the whole process under one platform. Unlike some competitors’ approaches, it takes on the heavy lifting so when companies have to buy or renew a contract, users can access Tropic’s one-click purchasing service to outsource the transaction. After the contracts are signed, its platform manages the technology and ensures financing is in order. This approach saves companies 23%, on average, on the software purchases, which Campbell said “moves the needle” for many companies where software is the No. 1 cost after salary.</p>
<p>In recent years, cloud software has become a fast-growing spend category across most businesses. Campbell said the average company can have more than 100 software contracts, while that jumps to over 500 for enterprise organizations. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/203428/total-enterprise-software-revenue-forecast/">global spend on enterprise software</a> is forecasted to reach $599 billion by the end of 2021, a 13.2% increase over the previous year, according to Statista.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the last 12 months, the company added over 60 customers, counting Qualtrics, Vimeo, Zapier and Intercom, surpassed $250 million in managed spend and processed transactions for over 1,200 vendors. The company is seeing 100% quarter over quarter growth, and in the last quarter, doubled its annual recurring revenue, Campbell said.</p>
<p>Tropic will use the funding for R &amp; D and to deepen integrations with existing procurement tools in the cloud software ecosystem. Over the past year, the company’s headcount has grown to 50 and Campbell has “aggressive hiring plans between now and the rest of the year” focused on the tech side with engineering and product management.</p>
<p>Hootan Rashidifard, principal from Canaan Partners, said his firm was tracking the software procurement sector and learned about Tropic through Founder Collective, which led the company’s seed round.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re seeing software and financial services converge and Tropic sits squarely at the intersection of both in a category with massive tailwinds,” Rashidifard said via email. “Software is accelerating the share of expenses while also penetrating every part of an organization, and software purchasing is becoming more decentralized. Tropic’s platform is in a fragmented market with high payment volume, which is ripe for layering on all kinds of adjacent services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six years ago, I sat in the Google self-driving project&#8217;s Firefly vehicle — which I described, at the time, as a &#8220;little gumdrop on wheels&#8221; — and let it ferry me around a closed course in Mountain View, California.</p>
<p>Little did I know that two of the people behind Firefly&#8217;s ability to see and perceive the world around it and react to that information would soon leave to start and steer an autonomous vehicle company of their very own.</p>
<p>Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu aren&#8217;t the only Google self-driving project employees to launch an AV startup, but they might be the most underrated. Their company, <strong>Nuro</strong>, is valued at $5 billion and has high-profile partnerships with leaders in retail, logistics and food including FedEx, Domino&#8217;s and Walmart. And, they seem to have navigated the regulatory obstacle course with success — at least so far.</p>
<p>Yet, Nuro has remained largely in the shadows of other autonomous vehicle companies. Perhaps it&#8217;s because Nuro&#8217;s focus on autonomous delivery hasn&#8217;t captured the imagination of a general public that envisions themselves being whisked away in a robotaxi. Or it might be that they&#8217;re quieter.</p>
<p>Those quiet days might be coming to an end soon.</p>
<p>This series aims to look under Nuro&#8217;s hood, so to speak, from its earliest days as a startup to where it might be headed next — and with whom.</p>
<p>The lead writer of this EC-1 is <strong>Mark Harris</strong>, a freelance reporter known for investigative and long-form articles on science and technology. Our resident scoop machine, Harris is based in Seattle and also writes for Wired, The Guardian, The Economist, MIT Technology Review and Scientific American. He has broken stories about self-driving vehicles, giant airships, AI body scanners, faulty defibrillators and monkey-powered robots. In 2014, he was a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT, and in 2015 he won the AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Gold Award.</p>
<p>The lead editor of this EC-1 was <strong>Kirsten Korosec</strong>, transportation editor at TechCrunch (that&#8217;s me), who has been writing about autonomous vehicles and the people behind them since 2014; OK maybe earlier. The assistant editor for this series was <strong>Ram Iyer</strong>, the copy editor was<strong> Richard Dal Porto</strong>, and illustrations were drawn by <strong>Nigel Sussman</strong>. The EC-1 series editor is <strong>Danny Crichton</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Nuro had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Harris nor Korosec have any financial ties to Nuro.</em></p>
<p>The Nuro EC-1 comprises four articles numbering 10,600 words and a reading time of 43 minutes. Here are the topics we&#8217;ll be dialing into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/">How Google&#8217;s self-driving car project accidentally spawned its robotic delivery rival</a>&#8221; (3,200 words/13 minutes) — explores the early days of Nuro and its founders and how they realized that the most useful robot they could ever build would be an autonomous delivery vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Regulations</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-regulations/">Why regulators love Nuro&#8217;s self-driving delivery vehicles</a>&#8221; (2,400 words/10 minutes) — analyzes how Nuro won over federal regulators and navigated a patchwork of policies to be able to test and deploy its autonomous delivery vehicles in several states.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Partnerships</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-partnerships/">How Nuro became the robotic face of Domino&#8217;s</a>&#8221; (2,500 words/10 minutes) — digs into Nuro&#8217;s relationship with Domino&#8217;s as well its trials with other companies including fast casual restaurant chain Chipotle, Kroger grocery stores and CVS pharmacies and how those relationships have affected the design and functions of the R2 bot.</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: Operations</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-operations/">Here&#8217;s what the inevitable friendly neighborhood robot invasion looks like</a>&#8221; (2,500 words/10 minutes) — examines where Nuro has set up shop, and more importantly, how it goes about picking locations and learning from its experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re always iterating on the EC-1 format. If you have questions, comments or ideas, please send an email to TechCrunch Managing Editor Danny Crichton at <a href="mailto:danny@techcrunch.com">danny@techcrunch.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro doesn&#8217;t have a typical Silicon Valley origin story. It didn&#8217;t emerge after a long, slow slog from a suburban garage or through a flash of insight in a university laboratory. Nor was it founded at the behest of an eccentric billionaire with money to burn.</p>
<p>Nuro was born — and ramped up quickly — thanks to a cash windfall from what is now one of its biggest rivals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Nuro was born — and ramped up quickly — thanks to a cash windfall from what is now one of its biggest rivals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In the spring of 2016, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu were teammates on Google&#8217;s self-driving car effort. Ferguson was directing the project&#8217;s computer vision, machine learning and behavior prediction teams, while Zhu (widely JZ) was in charge of the car&#8217;s perception technologies and cutting-edge simulators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both were leading pretty large teams and were responsible for a pretty large portion of the Google car&#8217;s software system,&#8221; Zhu recalls.</p>
<p>As Google prepared to spin out its autonomous car tech into the company that would become Waymo, it first needed to settle a bonus program devised in the earliest days of its so-called Chauffeur project. Under the scheme, early team members could choose staggered payouts over a period of eight years — or leave Google and get a lump sum all at once.</p>
<p>Ferguson and Zhu would not confirm the amount they received, but court filings released as part of Waymo&#8217;s trade secrets case against Uber suggest they each received payouts in the neighborhood of $40 million by choosing to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we were fortunate enough to receive as part of the self-driving car project enabled us to take riskier opportunities, to go and try to build something that had a significant chance of not working out at all,&#8221; Ferguson says.</p>
<p>Within weeks of their departure, the two had incorporated Nuro Inc, a company with the non-ironic mission to &#8220;better everyday life through robotics.&#8221; Its first product aimed to take a unique approach to self-driving cars: Road vehicles with all of the technical sophistication and software smarts of Google&#8217;s robotaxis, but none of the passengers.</p>
<p>In the five years since, Nuro&#8217;s home delivery robots have proven themselves smart, safe and nimble, outpacing Google&#8217;s vehicles to secure the first commercial deployment permit for autonomous vehicles in California, as well as groundbreaking concessions from the U.S. government.</p>
<p>While robotaxi companies struggle with technical hitches and regulatory red tape, Nuro has already made thousands of robotic pizza and grocery deliveries across the U.S., and Ferguson (as president) and Zhu (as CEO) are now heading a company that as of its last funding round in November 2020 valued it at $5 billion with more than 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>But how did they get there so fast, and where are they headed next?</p>
<h2>Turning money into robots</h2>
<p>&#8220;Neither JZ nor I think of ourselves as classic entrepreneurs or that starting a company is something we had to do in our lives,&#8221; Ferguson says. &#8220;It was much more the result of soul searching and trying to figure out what is the biggest possible impact that we could have.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Nuro's autonomous vehicles (AVs) don't have a human driver on board. There's no room in the narrow chassis for a driver's seat, no need for a steering wheel, accelerator or brake pedals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro&#8217;s delivery autonomous vehicles (AVs) don&#8217;t have a human driver on board. The company&#8217;s founders Dave Ferguson (president) and Jiajun Zhu&#8217;s (CEO) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/">vision of a driverless delivery vehicle</a> sought to do away with a lot of the stuff that is essential for a normal car to have, like doors and airbags and even a steering wheel. They built an AV that spared no room in the narrow chassis for a driver&#8217;s seat, and had no need for an accelerator, windshield or brake pedals.</p>
<p>So when the company <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/NHTSA-2019-0017-0001">petitioned the U.S. government</a> in 2018 for a minor exemption from rules requiring a rearview mirror, backup camera and a windshield, Nuro might have assumed the process wouldn&#8217;t be very arduous.</p>
<p>They were wrong.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If Nuro is to become the generation-defining company its founders desire, it will be due as much to innovation in regulation as advances in the technology it develops.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.aamva.org/AAMVA-Comments-on-Nuro-AV-Exemption-Petition/">2019 letter</a> to the U.S. Department of Transportation, The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) &#8220;[wondered] about the description of pedestrian &#8216;crumple zones,&#8217; and whether this may impact the vehicle&#8217;s crash-worthiness in the event of a vehicle-to-vehicle crash. Even in the absence of passengers, AAMVA has concerns about cargo ejection from the vehicle and how Nuro envisions protections from loose loads affecting the driving public.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Society of Professional Engineers similarly complained that Nuro&#8217;s request lacked information about the detection of moving objects. &#8220;How would the R2X function if a small child darts onto the road from the passenger side of the vehicle as a school bus is approaching from the driver&#8217;s side?&#8221; it asked. It also recommended the petition be denied until Nuro could provide a more detailed cybersecurity plan against its bots being hacked or hijacked.</p>
<p>The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (now the Alliance Automotive Innovation), which represents most U.S. carmakers, wrote that the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency (NHTSA) should not use Nuro&#8217;s kind of petition to &#8220;introduce new safety requirements for [AVs] that have not gone through the rigorous rule-making process.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you can see is that many comments came from entrenched interests,&#8221; said David Estrada, Nuro&#8217;s chief legal and policy officer. &#8220;And that&#8217;s understandable. There are multibillion dollar industries that can be disrupted if autonomous vehicles become successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be fair, critical comments also came from nonprofit organizations genuinely concerned about unleashing robots on city streets. The Center for Auto Safety, an independent consumer group, thought that Nuro did not provide enough information on its development and testing, nor any meaningful comparison with the safety of similar, human-driven vehicles. &#8220;Indeed, the planned reliance on &#8216;early on-road tests … with human-manned professional safety drivers&#8217; suggests that Nuro has limited confidence in R2X&#8217;s safe operation,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189997" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189997" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2189997 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg" alt="Nuro-R2-specs-infographic" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2189997" class="wp-caption-text">Nuro&#8217;s R2 delivery autonomous vehicle. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>Despite such concerns, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/nuro_grant_notice_final-unofficial.pdf">granted</a> Nuro the exemptions it sought in February last year. Up to 5,000 R2 vehicles could be produced for a limited period of two years and subject to Nuro reporting any incidents, without a windshield, rearview mirror or backup camera. Although only a small concession, it was the first — and so far, only — time the U.S. government had relaxed vehicle safety requirements for an AV.</p>
<p>Now Estrada and Nuro hope to use that momentum to chip away at a mountain of regulations that never envisaged vehicles controlled by on-board robots or distant humans, extending from the foothills of local and state government to the peaks of federal and international safety rules.</p>
<p>If Nuro is to become the generation-defining company its founders desire, it will be due as much to innovation in regulation as advances in the technology it develops.</p>
<h2>Regulate for success</h2>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any of the credible, big AV players want this to be a free-for-all,&#8221; said Dave Ferguson, Nuro&#8217;s co-founder and president. &#8220;We need the confidence of a clear regulatory framework to invest the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars necessary to manufacture vehicles at scale. Otherwise, it&#8217;s really going to limit our ability to deploy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pandemic pizza was definitely a thing.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers forked out a record-breaking $14 billion to have pizza delivered to their doors in 2020, and nearly half of that total was spent with just one brand: Domino&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Domino&#8217;s is the home of pizza delivery,&#8221; said Dennis Maloney, Domino&#8217;s chief innovation officer. &#8220;Delivery is at the core of who we are, so it&#8217;s very important for us to lead when it comes to the consumer experience of delivery.&#8221;</p>

			U.S. consumers forked out a record-breaking $14 billion to have pizza delivered to their doors in 2020, and nearly half of that total was spent with just one brand: Domino&#8217;s.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYM1flimFa4">latest TV ad</a>, an order of Domino&#8217;s pizza speeds to its destination inside a Nuro R2 delivery autonomous vehicle (AV). The R2 deftly avoids potholes, falling trees and traffic jams caused by The Noid — a character created by Domino&#8217;s in the 1980s to symbolize the difficulties of delivering a pizza in 30 minutes or less.</p>
<p>The reality is much more sedate. Domino&#8217;s currently has just one R2 that operates from a single Domino&#8217;s store on the generally calm streets of Woodland Heights in Houston, Texas. And since the AV&#8217;s introduction in April, The Noid has yet to put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The R2 adds a bunch of efficiencies while not taking away from any existing capabilities,&#8221; Maloney said. &#8220;As we start getting the bot into regular operation, we&#8217;ll see if it plays out the way we expect it to. So far, all the indications are good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Partnerships are key for Nuro. The company&#8217;s business model is to sign contracts with established brands that either have their own branded vehicles or use traditional delivery companies like UPS or the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p>Nuro is carrying out trials and pilot deliveries with a number of companies, including fast casual restaurant chain Chipotle, Kroger grocery stores, CVS pharmacies, bricks-and-mortar retail behemoth Walmart, and, most recently, global parcel courier FedEx. While it is a dizzyingly impressive list for a company less than five years old, their interest was driven as much by global trends as by Nuro&#8217;s technology, admits Cosimo Leipold, head of partnerships at Nuro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody today wants what they want and they want it faster than ever, but frankly they&#8217;re not willing to pay for it,&#8221; Leipold said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve reached a point where almost every company is going to have to offer delivery services, and now it&#8217;s just the question of how they&#8217;ll do it in the best possible way and with the most possible control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nuro&#8217;s delivery AVs — aka bots — offer the tantalizing promise of safe, reliable and efficient delivery without sacrificing revenue and customer data to third-party platforms like Grubhub, DoorDash or Instacart. Alongside Nuro&#8217;s stated aim of driving the <a href="https://medium.com/nuro/serving-americas-food-deserts-a7442e922053">cost of delivery</a> down to zero, it is little surprise that Nuro now finds itself in the enviable position of being able to pick and choose the partners it wants — and the less enviable position of having to choose which partner to prioritize.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the story of how one of Nuro&#8217;s biggest partnerships came to be, and the lessons and companies that will drive its future growth.</p>
<h2>Deliveries with extra cheese</h2>
<p>Domino&#8217;s has a long history of innovating in delivery, usually accompanied by a strong marketing campaign. In the 1980s, the company bought 10 customized Tritan Aerocar 2s, a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/25651/a-slice-of-history-buy-this-rare-tritan-a2-dominos-delivery-car">Jetsons-styled three-wheeler</a>, for use as delivery vehicles. In 2015, the company unveiled the <a href="https://www.hagerty.com/media/car-profiles/why-dominos-dxp-delivery-cars-were-anything-but-half-baked/">DXP</a>, a Chevrolet Spark modified with a single seat and a built-in warming oven, designed specifically for transporting pizza.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The first sign that your town is about to welcome a horde of Nuro robots will be the appearance of a fleet of human-driven Toyota Priuses modified with cameras, lidars and radars.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In early 2021, a Nuro autonomous delivery vehicle pulled to a halt at a four-way stop in its hometown of Mountain View, California to let a user cross. This seemingly humdrum moment quickly looked like a decidedly science fiction storyline — the user was a small sidewalk robot from another startup on its own mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, we yielded to it, but it was, wow, we have entered a different world,&#8221; said Amy Jones Satrom, head of Operations at Nuro.</p>
<p>Mountain View is home to competitor Waymo and other autonomous vehicle testing activity. But for those who want to take part in that science fiction scene, Houston provides the full experience.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Nuro&#8217;s operations team has to delicately balance speed, safety, convenience and congestion, even as the company embarks on a growth spurt that will see robots spreading to other cities, states and partners in the months ahead.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Waymo is testing self-driving trucks in Houston, and a fully driverless shuttle service is due to start public service there early next year. Nuro&#8217;s Texas effort started in April, when an R2 robot began its commercial pizza delivery service in partnership with Domino&#8217;s. Some customers ordering pizzas from the Domino&#8217;s Woodland Heights store will see the option to have their pies delivered by robot.</p>
<p>Customers can trace the progress of the self-driving vehicle on the Domino&#8217;s app and, when it pulls up outside their home, tap in a unique PIN on its touchscreen to access their order. Nuro is also operating in Houston with Kroger supermarkets and FedEx.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we laugh about is how customers constantly talk to the bot,&#8221; Dennis Maloney, Domino&#8217;s chief innovation pfficer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like they think it&#8217;s &#8216;Knight Rider.&#8217; It&#8217;s very common for customers to thank it or say goodbye, which is great because that indicates we&#8217;re creating an engaging experience that they&#8217;re not frustrated by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Creating an experience, where people want to chat with their new robot neighbors instead of chasing them down the street with pitchforks, falls to Jones Satrom&#8217;s operations team. It has to delicately balance speed, safety, convenience and congestion, even as Nuro embarks on a growth spurt that will see robots spreading to other cities, states and partners in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it manages that, and what the future holds for Nuro&#8217;s ever-so-gentle robot invasion.</p>
<h2>Mapping the territory</h2>
<p>Few people are as well suited to overseeing Nuro&#8217;s high-stakes robot rollout as Jones Satrom, who started her career as a nuclear engineer on an aircraft carrier and previously managed the integration of Kiva Systems&#8217; robots into Amazon&#8217;s warehouses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Understanding why investors are so willing to buy small stakes in dozens of private companies worth billions of dollars is key to grokking the crush of investment we see among younger tech startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As last week came to a close, funding news involving three major U.S. technology startups lit up on Twitter.</p>
<p>Carta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/carta-says-it-just-used-its-own-product-to-establish-a-new-and-far-higher-valuation-for-itself/">closed a $500 million Series G</a> at a $7.4 billion price tag. Chime put together <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chime-financial-raises-750-million-in-latest-funding-round-11628872069">a $750 million round</a> at a $25 billion valuation. And Discord <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-discord-raising-at-roughly">was reported</a> to be hunting up new cash that would value it at around $15 billion.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Each funding round has something special about it that we need to discuss. Why? Because while it&#8217;s well known that the unicorn market is crowded &#8212; reaching a $1 billion valuation in today&#8217;s capital-flush markets is no longer particularly rare for startups &#8212; the number of startups worth a multiple of that valuation threshold is growing rapidly. And understanding why investors are so willing to buy minute stakes in dozens of private companies worth billions of dollars is key to grokking the crush of investment we see among younger technology startups.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>To make the point, CB Insights&#8217; <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">unicorn leaderboard</a> lists 55 companies with valuations of $7.5 billion or more. That&#8217;s nearly five dozen companies worth more than Carta after its most recent round. According to the list, 38 of today&#8217;s unicorns are worth $10 billion or more.</p>
<p>The 55 startups valued at $7.5 billion and more are worth more than $1 trillion in aggregate, while the 38 decacorns are worth more than $900 billion when counted as a group.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve become too accustomed to simply reading the latest nine-figure round invested at an 11-figure price and shrugging. So, this morning, let&#8217;s talk about Carta and Chime and Discord and why each of them may have managed their latest, or anticipated, valuation gain.</p>
<p>When we talk about unicorns, we&#8217;re simply discussing a generally growth-oriented cohort of technology upstarts. But once a startup reaches closer to the $10 billion valuation threshold, we&#8217;re really talking about ducks increasingly too big for their pond. They are the next set of IPOs both domestically and abroad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cisco.com">Cisco</a> announced <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/12082021">on Friday</a> that it&#8217;s acquiring Israeli applications-monitoring startup Epsagon at a price pegged at $500 million. The purchase gives Cisco a more modern microservices-focused component for its growing applications-monitoring portfolio.</p>
<p>The Israeli business publication <a class="c-link" href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-cisco-confirms-acquisition-of-israeli-startup-epsagon-1001381718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Globes reported</a> it had gotten confirmation from Cisco that the deal was for $500 million, but Cisco would not confirm that price with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The acquisition comes on top of a couple of other high-profile app-monitoring deals, including AppDynamics, which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/">bought in 2018</a> for $3.7 billion, and ThousandEyes, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/cisco-to-acquire-internet-monitoring-solution-thousandeyes/">nabbed last year for $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>With Epsagon, the company is getting a way to monitor more modern applications built with containers and Kubernetes. Epsagon&#8217;s value proposition is a solution built from the ground up to monitor these kinds of workloads, giving users tracing and metrics, something that&#8217;s not always easy to do given the ephemeral nature of containers.</p>

<p>As Cisco&#8217;s Liz Centoni wrote <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/12082021">in a blog post</a> announcing the deal, Epsagon adds to the company&#8217;s concept of a full-stack offering in their applications-monitoring portfolio. Instead of having a bunch of different applications monitoring tools for different tasks, the company envisions one that works together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cisco’s approach to full-stack observability gives our customers the ability to move beyond just monitoring to a paradigm that delivers shared context across teams and enables our customers to deliver exceptional digital experiences, optimize for cost, security and performance and maximize digital business revenue,&#8221; Centoni wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That experience point is particularly important because when an application isn&#8217;t working, it isn&#8217;t happening in a vacuum. It has a cascading impact across the company, possibly affecting the core business itself and certainly causing customer distress, which could put pressure on customer service to field complaints, and the site reliability team to fix it. In the worst case, it could result in customer loss and an injured reputation.</p>
<p>If the application-monitoring system can act as an early warning system, it could help prevent the site or application from going down in the first place, and when it does go down, help track the root cause to get it up and running more quickly.</p>
<p>The challenge here for Cisco is incorporating Epsagon into the existing components of the application-monitoring portfolio and delivering that unified monitoring experience without making it feel like a Frankenstein&#8217;s monster of a solution globbed together from the various pieces.</p>
<p>Epsagon launched in 2018 and has raised $30 million. According to a report in <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3915194,00.html">the Israeli publication, Calcalist</a>, the company was on the verge of a big Series B round with a valuation in the range of $200 million when it accepted this offer. It certainly seems to have given its early investors a good return. The deal is expected to close later this year.</p>
