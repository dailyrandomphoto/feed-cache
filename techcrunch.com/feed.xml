										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel-based AI healthtech company, <a href="https://www.dia-analysis.com">DiA Imaging Analysis</a>, which is using deep learning and machine learning to automate analysis of ultrasound scans, has closed a $14 million Series B round of funding.</p>
<p>Backers in the growth round, which comes three years after DiA last raised, include new investors Alchimia Ventures, Downing Ventures, ICON Fund, Philips and XTX Ventures &#8212; with existing investors also participating including CE Ventures, Connecticut Innovations, Defta Partners, Mindset Ventures, and Dr Shmuel Cabilly. In total, it&#8217;s taken in $25M to date.</p>
<p>The latest financing will go on expanding its product range and going after new and expanded partnerships with ultrasound vendors, PACS/Healthcare IT companies, resellers, and distributors while continuing to build out its presence across three regional markets.</p>
<p>The healthtech company sells AI-powered support software to clinicians and healthcare professionals to help them capture and analyze ultrasound imagery &#8212; a process which, when done manually, requires human expertise to visually interpret scan data. So DiA touts its AI technology as &#8220;taking the subjectivity out of the manual and visual estimation processes being performed today&#8221;.</p>
<p>It has trained AIs to assess ultrasound imagery so as to automatically hone in on key details or identify abnormalities &#8212; offering a range of products targeted at different clinical requirements associated with ultrasound analysis, including several focused on the heart (where its software can, for example, be used to measure and analyze aspects like ejection fraction; right ventricle size and function; plus perform detection assistance for coronary disease, among other offerings).</p>
<p>It also has a product that leverages ultrasound data to automate measurement of bladder volume.</p>
<p>DiA claims its AI software imitates the way the human eye detects borders and identifies motion &#8212; touting it as an advance over &#8220;subjective&#8221; human analysis that also brings speed and efficiency gains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our software tools are supporting tool for clinicians needing to both acquiring the right image and interpreting ultrasound data,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Hila Goldman-Aslan.</p>
<p>DiA&#8217;s AI-based analysis is being used in some 20 markets currently &#8212; including in North America and Europe (in China it also says a partner gained approval for use of its software as part of their own device) &#8212; with the company deploying a go-to-market strategy that involves working with channel partners (such as GE, Philips and Konica Minolta) which offer the software as an add on on their ultrasound or PACS systems.</p>
<p>Per Goldman-Aslan, some 3,000+ end-users have access to its software at this stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our technology is vendor neutral and cross platform therefore runs on any ultrasound device or healthcare IT systems. That is why you can see we have more than 10 partnerships with both device companies as well as healthcare IT/PACS companies. There is no other startup in this space I know that has these capabilities, commercial traction or many FDA/CE AI-based solutions,&#8221; she says, adding: &#8220;Up to date we have 7 FDA/CE approved solutions for cardiac and abdominal areas and more are on the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>An AI&#8217;s performance is of course only as good as the data-set it&#8217;s been trained on. And in the healthcare space efficacy is an especially crucial factor &#8212; given that any bias in training data could lead to a flawed model which misdiagnoses or under/over-estimates disease risks in patient groups who were not well represented in the training data.</p>
<p>Asked about how its AIs were trained to be able to spot key details in ultrasound imagery, Goldman-Aslan told TechCrunch: &#8220;We have access to hundreds of thousands ultrasound images through many medical facilities therefore have the ability to move fast from one automatic area to another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We collect diverse population data with different pathology, as well as data from various devices,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a Phrase &#8216;Garbage in Garbage out&#8217;. The key is not to bring garbage in,&#8221; she also told us. &#8220;Our data sets are tagged and classified by several physicians and technicians, each are experts with many years on experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have a strong rejection system that rejects images that was taken incorrectly. This is how we overcome the subjectivity of how data was acquired.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the FDA clearances obtained by DiA are 510(k) Class II approvals &#8212; and Goldman-Aslan confirmed to us that it has not (and does not intend) to apply for Premarket Approval (PMA) for its products from the FDA.</p>
<p>The 510(k) route is widely used for gaining approval for putting many types of medical devices into the US market. However it has been criticized as a light-touch regime &#8212; and certainly does not entail the same level of scrutiny as the more rigorous PMA process.</p>
<p>The wider point is that regulation of fast-developing AI technologies tends to lag behind developments in how they&#8217;re being applied &#8212; including as they push increasingly into the healthcare space where there&#8217;s certainly huge promise but also serious risks if they fail to live up to the glossy marketing &#8212; meaning there is still something of a gap between the promises made by device makers and how much regulatory oversight their tools actually get.</p>
<p>In the European Union, for example, the CE scheme &#8212; which sets out some health, safety and environmental standards for devices &#8212; can simply require a manufacturer to self declare conformity, without any independent verification they&#8217;re actually meeting the standards they claim, although some medical devices can require a degree of independent assessment of conformity under the CE scheme. But it&#8217;s not considered a rigorous regime for regulating the safety of novel technologies like AI.</p>
<p>Hence the EU is now working on introducing an additional layer of conformity assessments specifically for applications of AI deemed &#8216;high risk&#8217; &#8212; under the incoming Artificial Intelligence Act.</p>
<p>Healthcare use-cases, like DiA&#8217;s AI-based ultrasound analysis, would almost certainly fall under that classification so would face some additional regulatory requirements under the AIA. For now, though, the on-the-table proposal is being debated by EU co-legislators and a dedicated regulatory regime for risky applications of AI remains years out of coming into force in the region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Waymo, the self-driving vehicle company under Alphabet, has launched a robotaxi service that will be open to certain vetted riders in San Francisco.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Tuesday, the company officially kicked off its Waymo One Trusted Tester program in the city with a fleet of all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs equipped with the company&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2020/03/introducing-5th-generation-waymo-driver.html">fifth generation of its autonomous vehicle system</a>. This AV system, which has been branded the Waymo Driver, is informed by 20 million self-driven miles on public roads and over 10 billion miles driven in simulation, according to Waymo.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The so-called Waymo One Trusted Tester program mirrors the company&#8217;s strategy in Phoenix, where it rolled out its first commercial ride-hailing service several years ago. The Trusted Tester program is a rebranding of Waymo&#8217;s previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/waymo-launches-self-driving-car-service-waymo-one/">Early Rider Program</a> that it launched in Metro Phoenix in April 2017. Seeing as it&#8217;s been over four years, those riders are no longer exactly &#8220;early,&#8221; so a name change was in order, according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Phoenix, Waymo eventually invited some of the early riders to move over to the Waymo One service, which let users publicly share their impressions on the service and invite friends or family member who weren&#8217;t part of the early rider program. Waymo then opened up the service to everyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">San Franciscans can download the Waymo One app and express their interest in joining the program, which will begin with an initial select group from diverse backgrounds with varied transportation needs, including wheelchair accessibility, according to Waymo. The company would not share how many riders would be included in the initial group, nor how many Jaguars it will have roaming the city, but it did say riders would have to be willing to offer a lot of detailed feedback on their riding experience and sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Waymo will encourage riders to use its autonomous service to help them with their everyday mobility needs. The rides are free for now, and will start out in an initial territory in parts of San Francisco, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the Sunset, Richmond, Pac Heights, Noe, the Castro, Haight Ashbury and more, with expectations to expand over time. The service will be offered 24 hours per day, seven days per week, the spokesperson told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The company will have so-called &#8220;autonomous specialists&#8221; — another term for human safety operators — sitting in the front seat to monitor the ride and ensure a safe experience. These safety drivers are contract workers, and employed by Transdev. Waymo has long partnered with Transdev to provide staffing for some of its operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Waymo&#8217;s rider support team will also be available at the tap of the button on the in-car screen or through the app if riders have any questions during their rides, the spokesperson said.</p>
<div dir="auto">
<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo&#8217;s first ride-hailing service launched in Phoenix, but its roots are in California, notably the Silicon Valley enclave of Mountain View. It&#8217;s been testing in the greater San Francisco Bay area for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The company began testing its robotaxi service by offering autonomous rides to its employees in the city earlier this year.</p>
<p>The news about the Trusted Tester launch comes a week after Waymo announced that it&#8217;s scaling up its Waymo Via autonomous trucking operations in Texas, Arizona and California and is building a trucking hub outside of Dallas. The company has also been testing its fifth generation Driver on Class 8 trucks in Texas, hauling freight for carriers like J.B. Hunt, so this newest application of the Driver is a sign that Waymo is either succeeding at its push to full autonomy, or that it&#8217;s putting the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-arm-raises-2-5b-in-second-external-investment-round/">$2.5 billion</a> in funding to good use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Greenfly’s latest funding round has a new face: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Phoenix Suns point guard </span>Chris Paul joined as a strategic investor and partner in the company, which developed digital media flow management software.</p>
<p>Paul’s investment is part of an $8.4 million strategic growth round that also includes Verance Capital, Higher Ground Labs, DD Venture Capital, SW19 Ventures, LinkinFirm and Allievo Capital, as well as existing investors Go4it Capital, Elysian Park Ventures, Alpha Edison and Iconica Partners.</p>
<p>The new round gives Los Angeles-based Greenfly over $23 million raised since the company was founded in 2014 by former Major League Baseball All-Star Shawn Green and his cousin Daniel Kirschner, who previously held senior roles at the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission and Activision Blizzard.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GAS44XiZEp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/06/lebron-james-tweet/">LeBron Tweets, Blames Chris Paul For Making Him Sign Up</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LeBron Tweets, Blames Chris Paul For Making Him Sign Up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/06/lebron-james-tweet/embed/#?secret=GAS44XiZEp" data-secret="GAS44XiZEp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Green and Kirschner saw how social media was driving new sources of revenue for organizations like sports teams, politics and consumer brands, but needed a way for real-time distribution of media to be easily shared. Kirschner explained that when Green first started in his career, there were times when he needed to provide feedback for a public moment, like when his home run record was tied, and it occurred to Green that they could build a mini media studio.</p>
<p>Paul, an 11-time National Basketball Association All-Star, was one of Greenfly&#8217;s early adopters, using the platform to share content to his social media channels following his games. However, Paul realized he was also sitting on valuable content within his phone, like game or event photos, but without a good system for easily accessing them or matching them to events going on at that moment. He considers Greenfly &#8220;instant access to a media gallery&#8221; that he can share on his social media accounts.</p>
<p>One of the best features, he explained, was seeing a post on social media with only two photos of an event, but while searching Greenfly, he came across 12 to 15 other photos that he had never seen. He believes the company will continue to grow, and as a partner, will work with Greenfly to build awareness for the platform and get other players involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a big believer of creating memories and seeing photos,&#8221; Paul told TechCrunch. &#8220;You can go in and search for my name and Devin Booker&#8217;s and see photos of us playing together. The NBA uses Greenfly to automate the media and share with others. I love it because it makes it easy — you don’t want something hard and complicated.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of just repurposing materials, Greenfly will continue to build a workflow around events that provides sourcing, creation and automated distribution of photos and short-form videos created for social media.</p>
<p>Greenfly is also working on increased improvements to curate media most relevant to users, and is collecting data to provide more insights around that so that users can manage relationships with their community to amplify their messages. The new funding will go toward growth and expansion to build additional collaboration tools and content as more players sign on.</p>
<p>“With Chris, it is an opportunity to come at it from the athlete’s perspective,” Kirschner said. “Our deals are mainly with leagues and teams, so to be working with athletes, who are their own brands, enables us to be the system of record for all sides.”</p>
<p>The past year was a big growth period for the company, and it had been reaching a tipping point just prior to 2020, he added. Greenfly is now working with more than 30 sports leagues, including the NBA, Major League Baseball and World Surf League.</p>
<p>It also boasts over 500 organizations in sports, media and entertainment, political campaigns, social causes and consumer brands, and is experiencing over 100% growth so far in 2021, Kirschner said.</p>
<p>With social media evolving, the company is looking for more polished content because it learned that stories and intimate content performs better.</p>
<p>“We set out to build a content collaboration platform to provide content that athletes and others can share on social media and also manage that workflow around large, complex organizations,” he added. “Organizations have lots of content and we make that available through routing tools and curation, making it easy to find what you are looking for.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> acquired <a href="http://slack.com/">Slack</a> at the end of last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">for almost $28 billion</a>, the deal seemed on its face to make sense, given that the coronavirus pandemic accelerated already growing demand for tools that enable people to work remotely and that roughly 90% of Slack’s enterprise customers already used Salesforce.</p>
<p>Today, the question is: How well are things going?</p>
<p>Salesforce just last week announced some initial integrations with Slack, including introducing so-called account and deal Slack rooms to its “Sales Cloud,&#8221; which Salesforce says will allow sales teams to interact around a customer deal cycle. Rob Seaman, SVP for Slack at Salesforce, told TechCrunch last week that, more broadly, “We really want Slack to be the primary engagement surface for our users, their communications, their work, their workflows and the processes and the apps they support.&#8221;</p>
<p>But these kinds of public pronouncements don&#8217;t get to the heart of what&#8217;s happening <em>inside</em> the company. That&#8217;s where TechCrunch steps in. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt happening September 21-23</a>, we are thrilled to be sitting down with both Bret Taylor &#8212; the entrepreneur and former Facebook executive who is now the No. 2 executive at Salesforce &#8212; and famed Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, to learn far more about their collective mission to take on Microsoft, and what, if anything, the market doesn&#8217;t understand about the tie-up between Salesforce and Slack. (Saleforces&#8217;s shares are only up slightly from a year ago and priced 16% higher than they were at the start of this year, compared to the S&amp;P 500, which is up 35%.)</p>
<p>Who reports to whom? How independently is Slack being run? How will the two judge the success of the merger, and by when? These are just a few of the many questions we have for these two iconic executives, whose candid conversation with TC is one you won&#8217;t want to miss.</p>
<p>To participate in this year&#8217;s virtual show, check out the<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true"> handful of pass options with discounts now available for founders, students and nonprofits</a>. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">Get your ticket soon</a>, though; prices more than double on September 20. We hope to see you online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart today <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/08/24/walmart-launches-walmart-golocal-a-new-delivery-as-a-service-business">announced</a> of a new delivery service business called Walmart GoLocal, which allows other merchants, both large and small, to tap into Walmart&#8217;s own delivery platform to get orders to their customers. Merchants can choose to the use the service for a variety of delivery types, including scheduled and unscheduled deliveries, including same-day delivery, and they can expand their delivery capacity and coverage as their own customer demand requires.</p>
<p>GoLocal is powered by services Walmart first developed for its own delivery needs. Over the past three years, Walmart has been working to scale its in-house <a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/express-delivery/3696472">Express Delivery service, </a>which promises delivery in two hours or less. This service now offers 160,000+ products at some 3,000 stores, reaching nearly 70% of the U.S. population, the company says. Now it believes it&#8217;s ready to make these same capabilities available to other merchants across the U.S. with GoLocal.</p>
<p>While the new B2B service allows merchants to leverage Walmart&#8217;s last-mile network and logistics, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that Walmart employees will be delivering the packages &#8212; at least at first.</p>
<p>Instead, GoLocal&#8217;s last-mile capabilities will be handled by gig workers from <a href="https://drive4spark.walmart.com/">Walmart&#8217;s Spark Driver program.</a> These same drivers also support Walmart&#8217;s same-day grocery delivery. But while the same-day service additionally<a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/walmart-grocery-delivery-reaches-3000-stores/594282/"> relies on third-party delivery services </a>&#8212; like Roadie, DoorDash and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/">Uber&#8217;s Postmates</a> &#8212; Walmart tells us that third-party delivery services won&#8217;t be involved in GoLocal.</p>
<p>Instead, Walmart plans to expand GoLocal over time to include more associate-powered delivery. Already, Walmart is testing associate delivery in electric vans in Northwest Arkansas, for example. These vans would allow Walmart to power delivery for a wider variety of merchants &#8212; like those with larger products that wouldn&#8217;t fit into Spark drivers&#8217; personal cars and trucks. Walmart also plans to evolve GoLocal delivery via newer innovations like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/furner_excited-to-see-the-progress-were-making-activity-6830524149019103232-ibgA">drones</a> and autonomous vehicles, which Walmart has been testing through its Express Delivery service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve worked hard to develop a reliable last mile delivery program for our customers,&#8221; said Tom Ward, senior vice president, Last Mile, Walmart U.S., in a statement. &#8220;Now, we’re pleased to be able to use these capabilities to serve another set of customers – local merchants. Be it delivering goods from a local bakery to auto supplies from a national retailer, we’ve designed Walmart GoLocal to be customizable for merchants of all sizes and categories so they can focus on doing what they do best, leaving delivery speed and efficiency to us,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Participating GoLocal merchants don&#8217;t have to be of a certain size. Anyone from a mom-and-pop to a national retailer can opt to use the service. They also don&#8217;t have to sell on Walmart.com&#8217;s marketplace, as this isn&#8217;t a fulfillment service where Walmart both houses and delivers third-party inventory &#8212; it&#8217;s just the last-mile delivery portion. The merchant inventory remains at their own local stores.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While any retailer could use GoLocal, getting started requires technical integrations on the retailers&#8217; part. Walmart provides an API that plugs into their existing commerce platform which will ping GoLocal when customers place orders. This alerts GoLocal to dispatch the driver while Walmart captures delivery experience feedback, it says. If widely adopted, this could also give Walmart access to local delivery data to analyze that could aid in improving its own delivery business or inform decisions about fulfillment center placement &#8212; a potential competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Walmart says it already has some merchant partners signed up for GoLocal, including contracts with some national enterprise retailers, but is not yet permitted to disclose those names. It won&#8217;t detail the pricing for the service, explaining that as a white-label option with a variety of features, the prices are customized to each retailer&#8217;s individual needs.</p>
<p>The service is one of several initiatives Walmart now has underway to generate revenue by serving the needs of other retailers. Recently, Walmart announced it would sell access <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/walmart-to-sell-its-e-commerce-technologies-to-other-retailers/">to its own e-commerce technologies</a> to retail businesses, for example. This is a part of Walmart&#8217;s broader strategy that will see it looking to turn a profit based on providing access to technologies and services it once used only for its own operations.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Square. Uber. Zillow. Airbnb. Besides being some of the biggest technology companies, what else do these titans have in common? They all operate in entrenched, highly fragmented, geographically localized and regulated industries. That means they required a lot of upfront venture capital investment to disrupt their respective markets. And the investment has paid off — these are now some of the most valuable companies in the world.</p>
<p>Venture capital alone hasn&#8217;t funded some of the largest companies. One of today&#8217;s most successful tech entrepreneurs was funded by massive infusions of investment from the federal government — Elon Musk received <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html">$4.9 billion in public subsidies</a> for his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. Moreover, government investment, via tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, made it more affordable for consumers to buy the green transportation they needed.</p>
<p>But one massive industry has not yet benefited from the large amounts of money that both venture capital and government can provide: Childcare. Families in the United States spend <a href="https://www.investin.care/">$136 billion on infant and child care every year</a>, and the market is only growing. If you include school-age care and education for all children under 18, that number <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2020075REV">grows to $212 billion</a>. In investor terms, the TAM (total addressable market) is huge.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			To put things in perspective, one new company has raised more funding in 2021 than the entire childcare industry.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So where is the investment? Biden&#8217;s current compromise on an infrastructure plan <a href=" https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/24/us/joe-biden-news#what-is-in-the-infrastructure-plan">does not include</a> many provisions for childcare. Venture investment in this space is nascent and insufficient. In 2020, only $171 million was invested in care and early childhood education. The funding situation has improved in 2021, with <a href="https://medium.com/reach-capital/investing-in-the-youngest-learners-and-the-future-of-families-b7c9a7d07766">$516 million invested in childcare</a>, but it’s still just a tiny fraction of the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-h1-2021-monthly-recap/">$288 billion of venture capital invested</a> so far this year.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/">single new company</a> has raised more funding in 2021 than the entire childcare industry.</p>
<p>Funding emerging childcare technology may require a lot of upfront capital. For starters, the industry is regulated and safety is and should remain a priority. Caring for and educating young children takes training, skill and love — it cannot be done by a computer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there are so many facets of the industry that are ripe for innovation. Parents sometimes take weeks to find a childcare provider that meets their needs. In some markets, there is <a href="https://childcaredeserts.org/2018/">not nearly enough supply</a> (three children for every licensed slot) to meet the demand. Assessing quality, pricing and availability is challenging, and payments and business operations tools for the nation’s 300,000+ daycares are still often pen, paper and Excel spreadsheet affairs.</p>
<p>This industry just needs patient investors with long-term perspectives.</p>
<p>This is a great time to diversify investment portfolios and support relatively recession-proof companies meaningfully expanding access to childcare. COVID has finally started to bring this largely offline industry online. Parents are now willing to go digital for childcare decisions and providers are adopting new online technologies at a record pace. These tailwinds provide the perfect conditions for startups.</p>
<p>Solving this problem is a huge business opportunity that affects so much else. When the millions of parents with young children can’t find care, they can’t work. We saw this over and over again since the start of the pandemic. The average American family can spend up to 25% of their income on early childhood care, while the average care worker makes approximately $12 an hour.</p>
<p>Unlocking innovation here at scale will require public and private investment. Government shapes and enables markets, from the explosion of technology that followed from Kennedy&#8217;s investment in the space race to more recent fundamental investments in wind, solar and electric vehicles. NASA catalyzed dozens of new technologies in the 1960s because it had both a generous budget and the flexibility to work with the best private-sector contractors available to solve specific problems.</p>
<p>The revitalization of the childcare sector would benefit from an ambitious and galvanizing “moonshot” goal, like providing universal, free childcare for all Americans.</p>
<p>By collaborating with flexibility and creativity across the public and private sectors, we can achieve a basic shared goal that other democracies have already fulfilled — the accessible provision of high-quality childcare for all members of society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Subscription newsletter platform kingpin Substack shared today that they&#8217;ve acqui-hired the team behind <a href="https://cocoon.com/">Cocoon</a>, a subscription social media app built for close friends.</p>
<p>We covered the Y Combinator-backed startup&#8217;s initial $3 million seed raise led by Lerer Hippeau back in November 2019, shortly before the pandemic dramatically reconfigured how people used social media to communicate with the people nearest and dearest to them. Cocoon&#8217;s initial pitch was for a social network for your closest friends, something that could level-up the text group chat you may have been stuck using before; over time, Cocoon evolved its platform&#8217;s dynamics to allow for more open social circles that users could fine-tune at will. With the app, users could share text and photo updates while also using passive data from sources like mobile location data or fitness stats to deliver automatic updates to Slack channel-like feeds for specific groups of their friends.</p>
<p>The app was co-founded by Sachin Monga and Alex Cornell, who met in product roles at Facebook.</p>
<p><em>Update: an earlier version of this story implied that the Cocoon app would not continue to operate post-acquisition, it will operate independently.</em></p>

<p>Unlike plenty of other networking apps, Cocoon didn&#8217;t rely on advertising or user data to monetize, instead pushing users to pay for a $4 monthly subscription. Though it will continue to operate independently, Substack says they won&#8217;t be acquiring the fledgling Cocoon app, instead choosing to bring the small team aboard. Given some of Substack&#8217;s recent initiatives around community building for their network of newsletter writers, it isn&#8217;t surprising that they&#8217;re seeking more talent in the space to help evolve the functionality of their platform.</p>
<p>Back in March, the startup detailed it had closed a $65 million Series B at a $650 million valuation, bolstering up on cash as they look to define a space that has gotten more eyeballs on it as of late, with both Twitter and Facebook releasing newsletter products this year.  They&#8217;ve been snapping up a few smaller startups over the past few months. Earlier this month, they disclosed that they had bought the debate platform Letter for an undisclosed sum. In May, they acqui-hired the team from a community-building consultancy startup called People &amp; Company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, Instagram unveiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">Shops</a> as part of Facebook&#8217;s larger pivot toward e-commerce. Shops is front-and-almost-center on the app&#8217;s bottom navigation bar, even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/instagram-swaps-out-its-activity-tab-for-shop-in-new-global-test/">more readily accessible</a> than the button to upload a new photo. Now, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/instagram-tests-ads-in-its-shop-tab/">testing</a> in the U.S. earlier this month, Instagram will introduce ads on the Instagram Shop tab globally, rolling them out in all countries where the Instagram Shop tab is available.</p>
<p>This marks Instagram&#8217;s latest update in evolving its e-commerce platform. It previously implemented <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">shopping in Reels</a> to compete with TikTok, organized exclusive product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">Drops</a> into their own Shop category and added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/instagram-adds-affiliate-and-shop-features-for-creators/">affiliate features</a> for creators to earn a commission on sales of sponsored products.</p>
<p>Currently, items on Shops appear in a two-column grid of square tiles. Ads will appear as a tile within this structure, but they&#8217;ll be marked &#8220;Sponsored&#8221; in the bottom-left corner of the image. When the ad is clicked, it will open the Product Details page, which shows more information about the item, additional images and other products from the brand. Users can save a product from an ad to their wish list or send it to a friend &#8212; if the ad is inappropriate, they can press and hold its tile to see options to hide or report the ad.</p>

<p>Instagram tested Shops ads with U.S. advertisers like Away, Donny Davy, Boo Oh, Clare paint, JNJ Gifts, DEUX and Fenty Beauty. As TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/instagram-tests-ads-in-its-shop-tab/">previously reported</a>, these ads will launch with an auction-based model and only appear on mobile, since Shops isn&#8217;t available on desktop. A user&#8217;s experience with these ads will depend on how they use Instagram and how many people are shopping in the Instagram tab.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Imagine typing out a series of steps in plain English that would reflect a list of actions a human QA tester would undertake to test an app, then turning that list into an automated testing script. That&#8217;s exactly what <a href="https://testrigor.com/">testRigor</a>, a member of the Y Combinator Summer 2021 cohort, has done. Today the early-stage startup announced a $4.1 million seed round.</p>
<p>Investors include FlashPoint VC, Y Combinator, PTV, Phystech Ventures and several individuals. The company previously raised a $300,000 angel investment and a $700,000 pre-seed investment for a total of $5.1 million raised to this point.</p>
<p>The beauty of testRigor is that you can type out a series of steps like &#8220;Click the Start button&#8221; or &#8220;Click the Stop button&#8221; and testRigor turns this into code, automatically runs the script and reports back whether the application has passed or failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it executes your instructions, and then will give you basically a pass or fail at the end. If it fails, it tells you what the issues were, allowing you to create a JIRA ticket and fix it in place or showing what the steps are to reproduce the issue. [&#8230;] And this is actually where we bring the most value,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Artem Golubev explained.</p>

<p>To make this process even simpler, the company has created a Chrome extension for recording testing steps, and it also will create tests automatically based on analytics that determine how people use the app, testing the most popular features.</p>
<p>They call the latter feature behavioral testing. &#8220;We literally deploy our analytics script in production, and then the system will automatically [build a test] based on how your end users are using your application in production,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has around 100 customers, including Netflix and other Fortune 500 companies, along with 22 employees, 12 of whom were hired this year. Golubev hopes to have 30 in place by the end of the year. He says that hiring people has been a challenge, and one of the reasons he joined Y Combinator was to get help in that area.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m running around trying to solve this problem of hiring people, and we saw YC being helpful in this area. Our number one largest problem is we can&#8217;t hire quickly enough,&#8221; he said. He believes that being part of YC has indeed helped in this regard.</p>
<p>In spite of the hiring challenge he&#8217;s facing, he believes that you need to hire a diverse workforce and reports that around 40% of his 22 employees are women. He says that he believes a lot of companies are missing out on good people because of their own biases. &#8220;What I have seen is that people have such a huge bias, they&#8217;re missing out on very talented people who don&#8217;t match their kind of imaginary profile,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Golubev says that he launched pre-COVID as a remote company, and he believed that once he got funding like this round, he would open an office, but now he&#8217;s determined to be 100% remote, and sees GitLab, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/gitlab-offers-key-lessons-in-running-an-all-remote-workforce-in-new-e-book/">a fully remote company</a>, as a model for him as he grows his company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Two Sigma Ventures led the financing event, putting in $10 million, with prior investors completing the round.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HR automation software startup <a href="https://www.sora.co/">Sora</a> announced this morning that it closed a $14 million Series A round of funding. Two Sigma Ventures led the financing event, putting in $10 million, with prior investors completing the round.</p>
<p>The round comes after Sora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/sora-raises-5-3m-to-power-its-hr-automation-service/">raised a $5.3 million seed round in July 2020</a>. First Round and Elad Gil led that investment.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Sora CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/ldelbeccaro">Laura Del Beccaro</a> to chat about the round. We were curious about why this was the right moment for the company to raise more capital &#8212; the startup noted last year that it had around 2.5 years of runway &#8212; and what it intends to do with the money.</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, Del Beccaro said that her company raised its seed round to validate its market after finding early traction with its product. The CEO added that her company found better problem validation &#8212; product-market fit, essentially &#8212; than it had anticipated in the following quarters, and that after a year of scaling &#8220;thoughtfully&#8221; is now ready to accelerate its growth in both financial and human terms.</p>
<p>Sora reached an inflection point, she said, sometime in the first half of 2020. The early COVID days, in other words. The pandemic was tough on HR teams, Del Beccaro explained: With employees going remote, and a shift to hiring over Zoom, you can imagine why HR teams were having a time and a half during the rapid shakeups of the labor market.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s growth accelerated toward the end of 2020, the CEO said, leading to 7x customer growth and 8x revenue growth since its seed round.</p>
<p>To better understand why Sora found strong traction during COVID, let&#8217;s remind ourselves what the startup&#8217;s software actually does. It helps HR operations teams collect and sync data from various systems, create standardized processes for particular tasks, and aids collaboration among the larger people or HR team at a company. To do that, Sora can trigger automated emails from HR, centralize HR ops tasks, and shuttle data to and from disparate software tools used by a larger human resources team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The result, per Del Beccaro, is a reduction in busywork and rote tasks for HR operations teams, saving time and reducing the chance that a particular task falls through the cracks; because HR operations teams often oversee onboarding, for example, not making mistakes is pretty key.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious if Sora might eventually become a hub for employees to interact with HR systems more broadly; if the startup is already doing the work to connect deeply to HR software, why not save employees time by providing them with a single portal? Del Beccaro said that her company was becoming a source of truth for the HR world, but that an explosion of HR tooling in recent years has left some companies leery of adding another employee-facing tool to their collection.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who works for a major company what their Okta or similar dashboard looks like for an explanation of what she means, if it&#8217;s not clear.</p>
<p>Sora said that its target customer base is companies with around 100 employees and up, though some smaller customers that see more rapid onboarding and offboarding also make good Sora targets. The startup charges per employee managed, with no limit on processes because Sora wants HR teams to build as many workflows inside of its service as they want. The more integrated a company&#8217;s HR operations become in Sora, we reckon, the less likely it is to churn, so the pricing model makes sense.</p>
<p>Off a good year of growth, Sora has 11 employees today, essentially the same size that it was when it raised its seed round. Given its growth since that point, the startup has demonstrated notable operating leverage for a company of its size. Flush with new funds, Sora intends to double its staff in the next year.</p>
<p>Why did Sora pick Two Sigma to lead its round? Per the CEO, it is a newer firm, which means that her startup won&#8217;t be competing with dozens of other portfolio companies. But more importantly, Del Beccaro spoke highly of the partner at the firm who led the Series A, <a href="https://twitter.com/schwiepit">Frances Schwiep</a>, telling TechCrunch that she immediately understood what Sora wanted to do.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke briefly with Schwiep about her investment. The venture capitalist said that she had been looking at the HR tech world for some time. And having seen at her prior gig how much work in the robotic process automation space went into employee onboarding and offboarding, Sora fit where she saw HR tech heading. She also cited a few macro trends that are favorable for the startup, including declining average employee tenure &#8212; the more headcount turnover, the more HR work there is to either do by hand or automate &#8212; and a move to more remote work.</p>
<p>When we last checked in with Sora, we noted the no-code elements of its service, designed to let HR operations teams set workflows that they might want to automate. This time around, such a setup felt more like table stakes than something to call out in particular. Technology moves quickly.</p>
<p>The next time we talk to Sora, we&#8217;ll expect harder revenue figures given that it is no longer a seed-stage startup. For now, let&#8217;s see how far it can get with $14 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crop steering turns growing carrots or cannabis from an art into a science. Indoor growers have long turned to this practice to improve yields, which involves precisely controlling and manipulating three variables: light, climate and irrigation. If tweaked properly, growers can force taller plants, larger flowers and quicker grow times.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://trym.io/">Trym</a> is announcing it&#8217;s adding crop steering analytics to its seed-to-sale software product. With the addition of this new function, Trym offers cultivators a complete package that tracks a cannabis plant from seed to harvest while maintaining regulatory compliance with Metrc. And it does so while providing detailed data on its growth through crop steering.</p>
<p>Trym&#8217;s crop steering function utilizes third-party hardware. Devices from Growlink and Trolmaster offer APIs, which feed Trym the data on the plant&#8217;s environmental conditions. Other crop steering products traditionally require growers to use dedicated hardware with their platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the market attention that crop steering has gained recently, there&#8217;s a gap in the industry for software providing both crop steering capabilities paired with comprehensive operational and compliance management tools,&#8221; says Karen Mayberry, CMO and co-founder of Trym. &#8220;Cultivators have attempted to use software provided by sensor companies to analyze data needed for crop steering, but with limited success due to the lacking functionality of these tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trym&#8217;s product is designed to give commercial cannabis growers deep insights into their operations. The platform aims to replace the multiple apps and spreadsheet tracking cultivators often use. The company was founded in 2018 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/trym-raises-3-1m-seed-to-further-build-its-cannabis-cultivation-platform/">raised a $3.1 million seed round</a> in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is moving into e-commerce. The company <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-ways-to-discover-and-shop-on-tiktok">announced</a> this morning an expanded partnership with e-commerce platform Shopify, as well as a pilot test of TikTok Shopping among select Shopify merchants across the U.S., U.K., and Canada in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>The social video platform first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">announced</a> its plans to partner with Shopify last October, with the introduction of new tools that allowed Shopify merchants to create, run and optimize their TikTok marketing campaigns directly from the Shopify dashboard, as well as new integrations within the TikTok For Business Ads Manager.</p>
<p>The expanded deal being detailed today takes things a step further. Soon, Shopify merchants with a TikTok For Business account will be able to add a new &#8220;Shopping&#8221; tab to their TikTok profiles and sync their product catalogs to create mini-storefronts on their profile.</p>
<p>Kylie Jenner is among the early adopters of the new service, and will use the feature with her Kylie Cosmetics brand, which will be available to shop directly on TikTok. The pilot is also underway with other Shopify merchants in the U.S. and U.K., and will roll out to merchants in Canada in the weeks ahead. Merchants can request to join the pilot through Shopify&#8217;s own TikTok channel, the company notes.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the new partnership involves bringing product links to Shopify merchants which can be used to tag products in their TikTok videos. This way, TikTok users will be able to click the tagged product to be directed towards the merchant&#8217;s storefront for checkout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Creators are paving the way for a new kind of entrepreneurship where content, community, and commerce are key,&#8221; said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify, in a <a href="https://news.shopify.com/scaling-social-commerce-shopify-introduces-new-in-app-shopping-experiences-on-tiktok">statement</a>. &#8220;By enabling new in-app shopping experiences and product discovery on TikTok for the first time, Shopify is powering the creator economy on one of the fastest-growing social and entertainment platforms in the world. We are excited to help this next generation of entrepreneurs connect with their audiences in more ways—and with TikTok as a visionary partner,&#8221; he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shopify also said there&#8217;s growing demand among merchants for working with TikTok, noting installs across Shopify’s social commerce channels increased by 76% from February 2020 to February 2021.</p>
<p>TikTok has been steadily developing its e-commerce features over the years, with tests that included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/tiktoks-new-hashtag-challenge-plus-lets-video-viewers-shop-for-products-in-the-app/">the 2019 launch of the Hashtag Challenge Plus,</a> which added a shoppable component to a hashtag, directing video viewers to shop a website from within TikTok. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/levis-partnered-with-tiktok-on-social-commerce-and-doubled-its-product-views/">brands like Levi’s leveraged</a> TikTok’s “Shop Now” buttons that allowed consumers to make purchases through links posted on TikTok. And, in addition to last fall&#8217;s initial unveiling of the Shopify partnership, Walmart began using TikTok for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/"> live-streamed</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">shopping events</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-07/tiktok-plans-u-s-e-commerce-expansion-with-new-features-ft?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg had reported</a> TikTok was preparing a larger expansion into e-commerce in the U.S. in 2021, which included the ability for users to share links to products, a commission program, and live-streamed shopping, all in an effort to challenge Facebook. It later noted <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/tiktok-begins-testing-in-app-shopping-to-challenge-facebook?sref=gni836kR">that tests of in-app shopping had begun</a> with some brands in Europe.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s larger goal with shoppable content could ultimately be to challenge Facebook and Instagram, which has also been investing in online shopping in recent years with things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">Facebook and Instagram Shops</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/instagram-swaps-out-its-activity-tab-for-shop-in-new-global-test/">dedicated Shop tab in Instagram</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">shopping in Reels</a>, and more.</p>
<p>However, in TikTok Shopping, the checkout takes place through Shopify &#8212; by clicking the storefront or product link within TikTok, the user is directed to the merchant website to make the purchase and complete the transaction. Shopify then powers the transaction and payment. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/instagram-launches-its-redesigned-shop-now-powered-by-facebook-pay/">On Instagram Shop</a>, meanwhile, checkout takes place natively inside the app, and transactions are processed through Facebook Pay, which can feel more seamless to the end user.</p>
<p>TikTok tells us it plans to pilot these new shopping solutions among hundreds of Shopify merchants, ahead of a more public launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Latin America startup ecosystem is having a great year, with mega-rounds being announced at breakneck speed and new unicorns minted almost monthly. This is mostly due to the clearly maturing startup scene in the region, with proven successes such as Nubank, Cornershop, Gympass and Loggi helping to bolster LatAm&#8217;s credibility.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many of the region’s rounds are led by or saw participation from investors based elsewhere. Firms such as SoftBank, Tiger Global Management, Tencent, Accel, Ribbit Capital and QED Investors are pouring money into LatAm. Some are even seeing more opportunity than in the U.S. — Latin America, they believe, has historically been ripe for disruption, especially in the fintech and proptech sectors, due to the significant underbanked and unbanked population in the region and the relatively unstructured real estate industry.</p>
<p>Last month, my colleagues Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">found</a> that structural factors such as <a href="https://docsend.com/view/49zkutri8yxtbgmu">strong digital penetration</a> and <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/latin-america-ecommerce-2020">quick e-commerce growth</a> are among the key reasons Latin America is breaking venture capital records this year. One Mexico-based VC even declared that the story was about &#8220;talent, not capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local VCs are raving about the human capital in the region, but for some global investors, the appeal of Latin America extends beyond the talent to the general populace. Shu Nyatta, a managing partner at SoftBank who co-leads its $5 billion Latin America Fund, pointed out a dynamic that might seem obvious but is rarely articulated: Technology in LatAm is often more about <em>inclusion</em> rather than <em>disruption</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vast majority of the population is underserved in almost every category of consumption. Similarly, most businesses are underserved by modern software solutions,&#8221; Nyatta explained. &#8220;There’s so much to build for so many people and businesses. In San Francisco, the venture ecosystem makes life a little better for individuals and businesses who are already living in the future. In LatAm, tech entrepreneurs are building the future for everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accel Partner Ethan Choi says the region’s consumer markets are growing rapidly thanks to a fast-growing middle class and &#8220;technology permeating through every aspect of consumers’ lives.&#8221; This has spurred demand for digital offerings, which has led to more startups, and consequently, investor interest.</p>
<h2>Brazil and Mexico riding the gravy train</h2>
<p>One look at the dollars pouring into LatAm this year is enough to convince anyone of the skyrocketing interest.</p>
<p>Latin America saw a total of $6.2 billion in incoming venture capital in the first half of 2021, more than double the $2.6 billion in the same period last year, and even beating the $4.1 billion invested across all of 2020, according to preliminary data from <a href="https://lavca.org/">LAVCA</a> (the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America — LAVCA used a different methodology than CB Insights, in case you’re wondering).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2015, researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek remotely hacked into a Jeep Cherokee <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/">driven by a Wired reporter</a>, Andy Greenberg, in an attempt to warn the auto industry of potential pitfalls in their software and inspire legislation around automotive cybersecurity. It did that and more. Fiat Chrysler, which owns Jeep, ended up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/25/business/fiat-chrysler-recalls-1-4-million-vehicles-to-fix-hacking-issue.html?_r=1">recalling 1.4 million vehicles</a> and <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/2015/07/27/fiat-chrysler-nhtsa-fine-recalls/30693265/">paying $105 million in fines</a> to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration.</p>
<p>Aside from a massive hit to Jeep’s brand image, Yoav Levy, co-founder and CEO of automotive cybersecurity company Upstream, reckons this stunt cost the automaker over $1 billion in losses from recalls. On Tuesday, Israel-based Upstream announced a Series C funding raise of $62 million that it will use to bolster its automotive cloud-based security to ensure remote hacks like this don’t happen.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Upstream Security reels in $9M Series A to protect connected cars&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/upstream-security-reels-in-9m-series-a-to-protect-connected-cars/embed/#?secret=xuvO5oA1Xy" data-secret="xuvO5oA1Xy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“From the automaker’s cloud, we monitor all the data that is being sent toward the vehicle before the vehicle is actually getting it, and if we’re doing a good job, we can actually block these messages before they get to the car,” Levy told TechCrunch. “We analyze connected car data and telematics data that is being uploaded from the vehicles, analyzing data from mobile phone applications or over-the-air updates and we’re looking for anomalies in the data.”</p>
<p>Aside from scaling its security operations further, Upstream also intends to use the fresh funds to expand its offerings in data analytics, insurance telematics, predictive analytics and business intelligence, the company said. Levy said Upstream often finds anomalies in the data it analyzes that are unrelated to cybersecurity and thinks this is a chance to build out additional applications targeted at OEMs to provide further insights.</p>
<p>That said, Upstream might do just fine by focusing exclusively on automotive cybersecurity, a market that is projected to increase from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cyber-security-automotive-industry-market-170885898.html">$1.9 billion in 2020 to $4 billion in 2025</a>. Reinforcement mandates are partially responsible for this growth. The<a href="https://unece.org/transport/vehicle-regulations/wp29-world-forum-harmonization-vehicle-regulations-wp29"> World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP 29)</a> has issued cyber vehicle regulation compliance that requires manufacturers selling cars in Europe, Japan and Korea to monitor their vehicles 24/7 with a vehicle security operations center (VSOC). A VSOC is a control room of sorts full of analysts monitoring the infrastructure, cloud, data and firewalls at all times. Although the U.S. doesn’t have any cybersecurity mandates in place for the automotive industry, automakers still increasingly want to produce their product and brand image, lest they fall prey to the same fate as Chrysler-Fiat.</p>

The company offers automakers a dashboard with cloud-based analytics.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside its cloud-based analytics tools and dashboard, VSOC is also a service that Upstream offers. The company currently has close to four million connected vehicles from six different OEMs on its platform across the United States, Europe and Japan, said Levy. He expects that number to continue to grow as more connected vehicles hit the streets.</p>
<p>“Cars are getting more connected each year and OEMs are doubling the amount of data they collect every year,” said Levy. “It’s not only the car and the cloud, but also vehicle-to-vehicle infrastructure, much more sophisticated modules and computers inside the car that are doing edge computing, ADAS systems, computer vision, level two autonomous and soon level three. So with the complexity of connectivity, it’s inevitable that there’s going to be software bugs that could be exploited by hackers who will take control of and inject their own code.”</p>
<p>While the idea of having someone hijack your car remotely and start blaring music as it crashes you into a wall is scary, Levy says most hackers aren’t after violence, or even your car. They want your data. This is especially salient with fleets, and it often manifests in ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>“Think of it like it’s Christmas Eve and you’re a last-mile delivery company, and suddenly you cannot unlock your doors or start your engines,” said Levy. “This is not good for business.”</p>
<p>Levy says this is where cloud-based security comes in handy as well. Rather than seeing into one car at a time, you get a bird’s eye view of the fleet and all of the connected devices, as well as any data incoming from the internet that could be malicious.</p>
<p>Upstream’s path to market is mainly focused on convincing car manufacturers that this technology is necessary, but Levy says fleets are the next big opportunity for the company within the next year or so.</p>
<p>With this latest round, the company has raised a total of $105 million since its founding in 2017. The Series C was led by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and was joined by new investors I.D.I. Insurance, 57 Stars’ NextGen Mobility Fund and La Maison Partners. Existing investors Glilot Capital, Salesforce venture, Volvo Group  Venture Capital, Nationwide, Delek US and others also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Levy said some of its historic investors are also customers. Upstream is privately funded by Alliance Ventures (Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi), Volvo Group Venture Capital, Hyundai, Nationwide Insurance, Salesforce Ventures, MSI, CRV, Glilot Capital Partners and Maniv Mobility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is today opening up access to Podcast Subscriptions to all podcast creators in the U.S., after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">first launching the service</a> for testing with a smaller number of creators back in April. Through Spotify’s podcast creation tool <a href="https://anchor.fm/">Anchor</a>, podcasters of all sizes will now able to mark select episodes as subscriber-only content, then publish them to Spotify and other platforms. Since launch, over 100 podcasts have adopted subscriptions, Spotify says. Based on the early feedback from these creators, the company is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-24/opening-up-podcast-subscriptions-to-all-u-s-podcasters/">now making</a> a couple of key changes to both pricing and functionality as the service becomes more broadly available.</p>
<p>Before, creators could choose between one of three price points: either $2.99, $4.99, or $7.99 per month. Creators were able to choose which price point made the most sense for their audience.</p>
<p>But the company learned that creators wanted even more flexibility in pricing, which is why it&#8217;s now expanding the number of price points to 20 options, starting as low as $0.49 and then increasing all the way up to $150.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193061" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193061" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2193061" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pod-subs_blog-inline_01.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193061" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotify explained that its research found that creators wanted some sense of where to start with pricing, rather than offering a completely open-ended system. That&#8217;s why the pricing isn&#8217;t something creators today manually enter. Going forward, Spotify will show the three price points that tested well &#8212; $0.99, $4.99 and $9.99 &#8212; before listing the other 17 options. Of those three, the company told us $4.99 was the best performing.</p>
<p>In addition to the ability to set pricing and gain access to a private RSS feed that can be used by listeners who prefer using a different podcast app, Spotify will now offer podcast creators the ability to download a list of contact addresses for their subscribers. This allows them to further engage with their subscriber base to offer them more benefits, the company notes. It could also be a selling point for creators who would otherwise not want to get on board with a paid subscription offering like this, if it meant losing out on a more direct relationship with their customer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotify is not the only service offering paid podcasts. Apple recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">announced</a> its own podcast subscription platform. But Spotify&#8217;s is currently the more affordable of the two. Apple will take a 30% cut from podcast revenue in year one, dropping to 15% in year two &#8212; similar to other subscription apps. Spotify, meanwhile, is keeping its program free for the next two years, meaning that creators keep 100% of revenues until 2023. After that, Spotify plans to take just a 5% cut of subscription revenues.</p>
<p>With this first step into a marketplace model, it&#8217;s notable to see Spotify &#8212; a staunch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder">Apple critic</a> in the antitrust fight &#8212; taking such a small percentage of creator revenues. Spotify has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">argued</a> for years that Apple&#8217;s cut of Spotify&#8217;s own subscription business is an anticompetitive practice, especially since Apple is a business rival via its subscription-based Apple Music service, and now, its podcast subscriptions, too.</p>
<p>Today, Spotify hosts a number of subscription-based podcasts, including bigger names like NPR (which is on Apple&#8217;s paid podcasts service, too), as well as independent creators like Betches U Up?, Cultivating H.E.R. Space, and Mindful in Minutes. Creators who choose to work with Spotify aren&#8217;t locked in &#8212; they can share private RSS fees with their customers and publish to other platforms, like Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s subscription podcast service works a bit differently, as creators can offer subscriptions to individual shows or groups of shows called &#8220;channels,&#8221; or even freemium access. However, creators on Apple&#8217;s platform collect customer emails through links in the show notes, which open in-app. Spotify creators, by comparison, redirect subscribers to subscribe to their shows via URLs provided inside the Spotify app. On the resulting webpage, listeners can sign up and provide their email.</p>
<p>The news of Spotify&#8217;s broader launch for Podcast Subscriptions follows a growing chorus of complaints from podcasters that Apple&#8217;s own subscriptions service is off to a rough start. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630517/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-dashboard">A report from The Verge</a> documented creators&#8217; complaints about bugs, confusing user interfaces, interoperability issues, and more. In the meantime, Spotify claims its waitlist for creators interested in its podcast subscriptions had &#8220;thousands&#8221; of sign-ups.</p>
<p>The company says it will expand access to international customers soon. Starting on September 15, international listeners will gain access to subscriber-only content. And shortly after, creators will gain access to Podcast Subscriptions, too.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tango is designed to help employees get back as much as 20% of their workweek spent searching for that one piece of information or tracking down the right colleague to assist with a task.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ken Babcock and his co-founders, Dan Giovacchini and Brian Shultz, were in the midst of Harvard Business School in March 2020 when they felt the call to start <a href="https://www.tango.us">Tango</a>, a Chrome extension that auto-captures workflow best practices so that teams can learn from their top performers.</p>
<p>“This window of opportunity was driven by the pandemic as we saw a lot of companies become distributed and go remote,” CEO Babcock told TechCrunch. “Team leaders were remotely onboarding people, for perhaps the first time, and accelerating ramp times. There was no longer the opportunity to tap on people’s shoulders in the office, so much of the training was left to people’s own devices.”</p>
<p>They dropped out of their program to start Los Angeles-based Tango, and today, announced a $5.7 million seed round for its workflow intelligence platform. Wing Venture Capital led the round and was joined by General Catalyst, Global Silicon Valley, Outsiders Fund and Red Sea Ventures. A group of angel investors also joined, including former Yelp executive Michael Stoppelman, former Uber head of data Jai Ranganathan, KeepTruckin CEO Shoaib Makani and Awesome People Ventures’ Julia Lipton.</p>
<p>Tango is designed to help employees, particularly in customer success and sales enablement, get back as much as 20% of their workweek spent searching for that one piece of information or tracking down the right colleague to assist with a task. Its technology creates tutorials by recording a users’ workflow — actions, links to pages, URLs and screenshots — and turns that into step-by-step documentation with a video.</p>
<p>Previously the co-founders bootstrapped the company, and decided to go after seed funding to expand the product and growth teams and invest in product development so that Tango could take a product-led growth strategy, Babcock said. The team now has 13 employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since starting last year, Tango has secured 10 pilots to figure out the data and capabilities before it is set to launch publicly in September. Babcock said the company will always have a free version of the product, as well as premium and enterprise versions that will unlock additional capabilities.</p>
<p>“The big thing is around integrations and meeting people where the consumer content is,” Babcock added. “We are reducing that burden of creating documentation, and for companies that already have Wikis or other materials, learning how to inject ourselves into those systems.”</p>
<p>Zach DeWitt, partner at Wing Venture Capital, said he met the company three years ago through a mutual friend.</p>
<p>His firm invests in early-stage, business-to-business startups unlocking a novel data set. In Tango’s case, the company was creating a new data set for the enterprise and business, where users can analyze workflow.</p>
<p>With the average tech company using 150 SaaS apps, up from 20 a decade ago, there are permutations about which app to use, how to use them, what happens if the user gets stuck and what if none of the data is being captured, Dewitt said. Tango works in the background and captures workflow, which is the foundation to the business’ success.</p>
<p>“I was blown away by the approach,” he added. “You have to meet people where they get stuck and even anticipate where they get stuck so you can serve the Tango tutorial to get unstuck. It can also change the company’s culture when it rewards people to share knowledge. The whole idea is beneficial to multiple parties: to those who are getting stuck and to new hires. That is powerful.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cora.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cora</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian digital lender to small-and-medium-sized businesses, has raised $116 million in a Series B round led by Greenoaks Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a large Series B by any standards, but particularly so for a Latin American startup. It’s also notable that São Paulo-based Cora only raised its $26.7 million Series A round &#8212; led by Silicon Valley VC firm Ribbit Capital &#8212; in early April. The startup has now raised a total of $152.7 million since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company wasn’t actively in the market, according to CEO and co-founder Igor Senra, but was approached by existing backer Greenoaks and other investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Tiger Global and Tencent are first-time backers in Cora with this latest round, joining existing investors Greenoaks, Kaszek, QED and Ribbit Capital.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tboq8duB2G"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/ribbit-capital-leads-26-7m-round-for-brazilian-fintech-cora/">Ribbit Capital leads $26.7M round for Brazilian fintech Cora</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ribbit Capital leads $26.7M round for Brazilian fintech Cora&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/ribbit-capital-leads-26-7m-round-for-brazilian-fintech-cora/embed/#?secret=tboq8duB2G" data-secret="tboq8duB2G" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Greenoaks came to us and said they were very impressed, and ready to lead our Series B,” Senra said. “Their main goal was they didn’t want us to spend time on fundraising, but instead stay focused on building the company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pattern is similar to previous ones for Cora, which saw existing backers lead its previous rounds as well, which the company sees as a “strong signal that everything is going in the right direction.” The company declined to comment on valuation.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Cora got its license approved from the Central Bank of Brazil, making it a 403 bank. The fintech then launched its product in October 2020 and today </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers a checking account combined with a software layer that aims to help SMBs manage their financials. It is currently in beta with a limited group of users for a corporate credit card. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192846" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192846" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192846 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/credit_card_Cora-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192846" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cora</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Credit limits in general increase as customers use their accounts to receive money and pay their expenses,” he said. “We see this product evolving over time to solve all the financial needs that a small business owner could have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch last October, Cora has been growing its customers 40% per month, according to Senra. During that same period, the company has seen its transaction value/revenue grow by nearly 60% monthly. Today, the startup has more than 120,000 customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s nice to see that volume is growing even higher than our customer base,” Senra told TechCrunch. “Our business must gain trust in order to gain volume. Once our customer base believes we are doing a good job serving them, the way to demonstrate that is to give us more volume.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it is not yet profitable because it’s focused on growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we already have a positive unit economics per customer,” Senra added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a number of other fintechs, Cora’s model is that most of its offerings are free for its customers but it mostly makes money off of interchange fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company is focused on growing in Brazil, which is large and complex enough, Senra noted. It may consider going abroad in three to four years, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Cora has 150 employees, up from 68 at the end of last year and 40 a year ago. About 130 of its employees are “partners” in the company, Senra said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup plans to use its new capital toward product development, growth, operations and building out a credit offering. It is using the data it is generating “to provide way better credit” for its customers, Senra said, starting with credit cards, then receivables and other kinds of credit such as emergency credit or credit for investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to deeply understand our customers’ needs and trying to create products they love,” Senra told TechCrunch. “We consider ourselves the opposite of traditional banks, which are usually not good at taking care of their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Cora is focused on the B2B service providers, but Senra expects that by the beginning of next year, it can start exploring “other segments” such as other kinds of SMBs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a total addressable market of 5 million companies, so there is a lot of room to grow,” he added. “But we are pushing ourselves to expand other verticals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Patrick Backhouse of Greenoaks Capital believes that Brazil has an “enormous” SME economy that has historically been “underserved by incumbent banks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Existing services are expensive and inefficient, creating opportunities for technology enabled service providers to offer better and cheaper services,” he said. “We believe Cora is a once in a generation company building efficient digital finance tools for small businesses. Since investing in the company&#8217;s Series A, we’ve seen accelerated momentum and proof that this is an enormous addressable market.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the growing volume of</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ransomware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and supply chain security attacks, there is a need for organizations to more rapidly detect threats. It&#8217;s that opportunity that startup Hunters is looking to capitalize on as the company today announced that it has raised a $30 million Series B round led by</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bessemer-venture-partners/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bessemer Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BVP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunters, which has offices in Newton, Mass. and Tel Aviv, Israel, was founded in 2018 and has raised a total of $50.4 million to date. The company raised a</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/hunters-ai-raises-4-5m-for-its-autonomous-threat-hunting-solution/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of $5.4 million in May 2019 led by YL Ventures and Blumberg Capital. A $15M Series A round followed in June 2020 with participation from Microsoft’s</span><a href="https://m12.vc/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">M12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.usvp.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An additional</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hunters-raises-additional-growth-funding-from-snowflake-ventures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth round</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was announced in December 2020, with Snowflake Ventures investing in Hunters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup  builds a technology known as Extended Threat Detection and Response (XDR) which pulls in data from different sources and sensors. All that data is then correlated and analyzed to &#8216;hunt&#8217; for potential indicators of compromise. Hunters co-founder and CEO Uri May explained that his company&#8217;s Open XDR platform can help to identify the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that attackers use to gain access and exploit an organization. The goal is to help reduce the time to detection and accelerate the time to response for a potential security incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The involvement of Snowflake Ventures as an investor as well as Snowflake as a partner for Hunters is one of the reasons that attracted Bessemer to the company. Alex Ferrara, partner at BVP said that from his perspective while there are other vendors in the same space as Hunters, none of them have partnered with a cloud data warehouse vendor like Snowflake, which was a big differentiator for him. Overall, it&#8217;s the market landscape and current state of cyberattacks that makes Hunters an interesting startup for Ferrara and his firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are excited about Hunters because you know we are seeing the institutionalization of ransomware,&#8221; Ferrara, told TechCrunch. &#8220;So I think there is a need for something like Hunters that can be more proactive in a world where I think many enterprises and mid-market companies have already been compromised.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key market trend that Ferrara sees Hunters fitting into is with the need to help fill the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gap for talented security professionals. Hunters’ technology makes use of automation and machine learning, such that security analysts are able to be more effective in a shorter amount of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">May said that the new funding will help to move Hunters to the next stage of the startup company&#8217;s evolution. To date, he said the company has hit its own internal milestones for customer acquisition and revenues, finding a good market fit for its XDR technology. Now he&#8217;s looking to scale the business, growing the go-to-market sales and marketing initiatives and partner efforts. May emphasized that he&#8217;s also keen to use the funding to cut through the increasingly noisy business of security technology with new innovations that will disrupt the market, providing even more capabilities to users.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the new innovations that Hunters is working on is enhanced machine learning technology to better understand and correlate sources of information. Expanding sources for the Hunters platform is another area where May expects to expand his company&#8217;s platform, with the future integration of more threat intelligence data feeds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a very elaborate and unique roadmap that we&#8217;re working on in terms of innovation that is related to the research that we&#8217;re conducting around cybersecurity,&#8221; May said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During a banner year for connected fitness, Peloton stumbled, as its two treadmills – the Tread+ and Tread – drew the scrutiny of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The two eventually collaborated for the planned recall of 125,000 Tread+ units, while offering fixes to 6,450 Treads – the budget model had a pre-launch go out in limited quantities (largely in Canada).</p>
<p>Today the company is announcing the full launch (or re-launch) of the Tread, which will hit the U.S., Canada and U.K. on August 30 for $2,495 USD /$3,295 CAD / £2,295. It will also arrive in Germany for €2495, this fall. Following the recall, the press release for the Tread features no fewer than eight instances of the word “safety” – clearly a big focus this time around.</p>
<p>The new Tread requires a four-digit safety code to unlock a new workout, as well as a physical safety key that can be pulled out for a quick stop. Users can also remove the key and take it with them to avoid unauthorized usage. The Tread is compact at 68 x 33 x 62 inches and features a 28.8-inch touchscreen that tilts 50 degrees.</p>

<p>After initial pushback, Peloton agreed to the recall of the Tread+ after, “a six-year-old child recently died after being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. In addition, Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”</p>
<p>The Tread, meanwhile, suffered an issue with a touchscreen that could potential detach, fall off and injure users while running. Those who purchased the early version of the tread are entitled to a free repair of the touchscreen. Those changes will be incorporated into new units to avoid the initial issue.</p>
<p>Owners of the Tread+, meanwhile, have until November 6, 2022 for a full refund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating single-family homes for the homeless using 3D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">printing robotics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Developing construction systems to create infrastructure and habitats on the moon, and eventually Mars, with NASA. </span>Delivering what is believed to be the largest 3D-printed structure in North America &#8212; a barracks for Texas Military Department.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just some of the things that Austin, Texas-based construction tech startup </span><a href="http://www.iconbuild.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the company is adding a massive $207 million Series B raise to its list of accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been covering ICON since its $9 million seed round in October of 2018, so seeing the company reach this milestone less than three years later is kind of cool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norwest Venture Partners led the startup’s Series B round, which also included participation from 8VC, Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), BOND, Citi Crosstimbers, Ensemble, Fifth Wall, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEN</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">x</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Moderne Ventures and Oakhouse Partners. The financing brings ICON’s total equity raised to $266 million. The company declined to reveal its valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON was founded in late 2017 and launched during SXSW in March 2018 with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">first permitted 3D-printed home in the U.S. That 350-square-foot house took about 48 hours (at 25% speed) to print. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON purposely chose concrete as a material because, as co-founder and CEO Jason Ballard put it, “It’s one of the most resilient materials on Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the startup says it has delivered more than two dozen 3D-printed homes and structures across the U.S. and Mexico. More than half of those homes have been for the homeless or those in chronic poverty. For example, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n 2020, ICON delivered 3D-printed homes in Mexico with nonprofit partner New Story. It also completed a series of homes serving the chronically homeless in Austin, Texas, with nonprofit Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup broke into the mainstream housing market in early 2021 with what it said were the </span><a href="https://www.east17thstreetresidences.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first 3D-printed homes for sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. for developer 3Strands in Austin, Texas. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the four homes are under contract. The remaining two homes will hit the market on August 31. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And recently, ICON revealed its “next generation” Vulcan construction system and debuted its new</span><a href="https://www.iconbuild.com/updates/icon-unveils-its-next-gen-3d-printer-and-introduces-house-zero"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploration Series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of homes. The first home in the series, “House Zero,” was optimized and designed specifically for 3D printing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some context, ICON says its proprietary Vulcan technology produces “resilient, energy-efficient” homes faster than conventional construction methods and with less waste and more design freedom. The company’s new Vulcan construction system, according to Ballard, can 3D print homes and structures up to 3,000 square feet, is 1.5x larger and 2x faster than its previous Vulcan 3D printers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the company’s early days, Ballard has maintained ICON is motivated by the global housing crisis and lack of solutions to address it. Using 3D printers, robotics and advanced materials, he believes, is one way to tackle the lack of affordable housing, a problem that is only getting worse across the country and in Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON’s list of future plans include the delivery of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social, disaster relief and more mainstream housing, Ballard said, in addition to developing construction systems to create infrastructure and habitats on the moon, and eventually Mars, with NASA.</span></p>
<p>ICON also has two ongoing projects with NASA. Recently, Mars Dune Alpha was just announced by NASA, ICON and BIG – and ICON so far has finished printing the wall system and is onto the roof now. Also, NASA is recruiting for crewed missions to begin nextfFall to live in the first simulated Martian habitat 3D printed by ICON.</p>
<div>Project Olympus represents ICON&#8217;s effort to develop a space-based construction system for future exploration of the Moon and &#8220;to imagine humanity&#8217;s home on another world.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Our goal is to have ICON tech on the Moon in the next decade,&#8221; Ballard said.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked, Ballard said the most significant thing that has happened since the company&#8217;s $35 million Series A last August has been the “the radical increase in demand for 3D-printed homes and structures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That single metric represents a lot for us,” Ballard told TechCrunch. “People have to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these houses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tackle the housing shortage, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world needs to increase supply, decrease cost, increase speed, increase resiliency, increase sustainability&#8230; all without compromising quality and beauty, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps there are a few approaches that can do some of those things, but only construction scale 3D printing holds the potential to do all of those things,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON has seen impressive financial growth, with 400% revenue growth nearly every year since inception, according to Ballard. It’s also tripled its team in the past, year and now has more than 100 employees. It expects to double in size within the next year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series B funds will go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more construction of 3D-printed homes, “rapid scaling and R&amp;D,” further space-based tech advancements and creating “a lasting societal impact on housing issues,” Ballard said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have already stood up early-stage manufacturing and are in the process of upgrading and accelerating those efforts in order to meet demand for more 3D-printed houses even as we close the round,” Ballard said. “In the next five years, we believe we will be delivering thousands of homes per year and on our way to tens of thousands of homes per year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norwest Venture Partners Managing Partner Jeff Crowe, who is joining ICON’s board as part of the financing, said his firm believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON’s 3D printing construction technology will “massively impact the housing shortage in the U.S. and around the globe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is “enormously difficult” to bring together the advanced robotics, materials science and software to develop a robust 3D printing construction technology in the first place, Crowe said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is still harder to develop the technology in a way that can produce hundreds and thousands of beautiful, affordable, comfortable, energy efficient homes in varying geographies with reliability and predictability &#8212; not just one or two demonstration units in a controlled setting,” he wrote via e-mail. “ICON has done all that, and&#8230;has all the elements to be a breakout, generational success.”</span></p>
