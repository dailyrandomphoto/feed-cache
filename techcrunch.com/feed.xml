										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of activity going on with social commerce in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp holding the keys to the marketplace-facing side of things to fintech companies like Paystack and Flutterwave bringing value with their storefronts capabilities, small and medium-sized merchants have more reach to their customers than ever before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, the majority of these small businesses still struggle to deliver their products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a mix of technology and offline methods, <a href="https://sendbox.co/">Sendbox</a> presents merchants with a more reliable platform and has raised $1.8 million seed to help them with their e-commerce fulfilment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures, Enza Capital, FJLabs, and Golden Palm Investments invested in the round while Flexport and Y Combinator participated (Sendbox was part of YC&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/most-african-yc-backed-startups-in-todays-batch-are-focused-on-fintech/">2021 winter batch</a>)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the pre-seed raised from Microtraction and 4DX Ventures three years ago, Sendbox&#8217;s total investment is a little over $2 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journey of Sendbox started nine years ago when founder and CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/emotu">Emotu Balogun</a> was running his previous startup Traclist. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The now-defunct company was a fashion marketplace in Nigeria that helped small merchants sell their products online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before shutting down, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traclist ran into scaling issues as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most of its merchants could not get their fulfilment done despite the presence of a few logistics companies in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a solution that allowed us to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> service providers onto a platform and integrate them into our marketplace, said Balogun to TechCrunch over a call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;And if it existed, it would have given us the ability to decentralize the operations of our marketplace and scale it up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later Balogun figured other marketplaces had this same problem. Once these platforms got customers to buy products,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the next puzzle was how to help out with logistics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Seeing as no logistics provider was efficient enough to help Traclist with its fulfilment needs, Balogun started building Sendbox in 2016 with Olusegun Afolahan; the pair fully launched the company two years later.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Sendbox has made </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adjustments to its model and interaction with merchants and customers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its core remains</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide e-commerce fulfilment for African merchants, starting from Nigeria. &#8220;Sendbox wants to help small e-commerce merchants who sell </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers through their own online and offline channels with fulfilment,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; said the chief executive giving a one-line pitch of the company.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2219207" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219207" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2219207" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?w=680" alt="Sendbox" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219207" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sendbox</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small merchants who use providers such as DHL to move local and international shipments might not command discounted delivery rates because they move little volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Sendbox, aggregating a lot of providers, is proposing to offer these discounted rates to merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the thing that attracts a lot of merchants to us. Because what happens is, they&#8217;re able to start small and actually grow their business because we are giving them favourable rates,&#8221; said Balogun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rates help merchants save on average 30-40% per item and eliminates the need to work with separate logistics providers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Sendbox&#8217;s generated revenue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is shared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the logistics providers as a reward for chasing a symbiotic relationship</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sendbox makes local deliveries within Nigeria and international deliveries to over 200 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Ibadan are the most favoured destinations for local deliveries, while Canada, the U.S., and the U.K. hold top spots for the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to that, Balogun says Sendbox offers next day delivery for orders within Lagos, three to five days for nationwide deliveries and five to seven days for international deliveries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What merchants have moved the most are clothing, fashion, lifestyle, beauty, and self-care products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sendbox is available to users via iOS, Android, web, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, other e-commerce platforms and developer APIs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The three-year-old company has reached over 10,000 merchants through these channels and claims to have made more than 200,000 deliveries since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, of which 35%-40% are international.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Balogun tells TechCrunch that Sendbox&#8217;s revenue and transactions have grown 300% year over year in the last three years. And t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o continue that exponential growth, Sendbox will expand its product capabilities and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">geographical presence as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, our vision </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to become the e-commerce operating system for African merchants and logistics is the first entry point for the company,&#8221; said Balogun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next entry is financing and payments &#8212; an identical play to what other platforms such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/backed-by-greycroft-klasha-gets-2-4m-to-improve-cross-border-commerce-in-africa/">Klasha</a> operate by combining three worlds of e-commerce, logistics, and payments.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in the works for Sendbox is a few e-commerce and marketplace integrations and a move to other countries in West and East Africa, the CEO added. The company hopes to bring these plans, including hiring new talent, to fruition with this investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;African e-commerce is accelerating faster than anybody could have imagined a decade ago and it needs smart solutions to ensure that logistics and fulfilment capacity doesn&#8217;t lag behind,&#8221; Walter Baddoo, the co-founder and general partner at 4DX Ventures, said of the seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only were we impressed by Sendbox&#8217;s 300% year-on-year growth since launch, but we&#8217;re seeing the market potential balloon with over 40 million Nigerian SMEs and a projected industry value for social and e-commerce reaching $45 billion on the continent by 2025</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s e-commerce market is expected to be worth $75 billion by 2025. And with merchants&#8217; need for e-commerce fulfilment growing by the day, we should expect new companies to spring forth in the coming years. It will be interesting to see how the market shapes up from competition between them and the likes of Sendbox and Egypt&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bosta-raises-6-7m-to-expand-e-commerce-delivery-business-across-africa-and-mena/">Bosta</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/egyptian-startup-flextock-closes-3-25m-in-the-largest-pre-seed-yet-in-mena/">Flextock</a> (another YC-backed winter 2021 company), young but established companies that have raised VC money this year to scale in different markets across the continent.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is testing Pool Chance, a feature that lets riders heading in the same direction share the cost of the journey, in Kenya, with plans to roll out the low-cost service to Ghana and Nigeria. </span>TechCrunch discovered the option when booking a car in Nairobi, Kenya. An Uber spokesperson later confirmed it was part of a pilot (beta version) of the service that it plans to roll out more widely, pending the outcome of the smaller test.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new service, being introduced for the first time in Africa, is similar to UberPool </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/uberpool-launch-for-real/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched in the San Francisco Bay Area </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2014 and later introduced in multiple cities across the world. The low-cost popular service remains </span><a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/uberpool-temporarily-unavailable?nodeId=1bbcee42-8f54-4a99-a237-e365911fec7d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suspended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in many regions including the US and Canada due to Covid-19 restrictions, but it seems the technology firm is slowly bringing it back in some markets and introducing it where it was unavailable before. Uber said the two products share a similar concept but are not identical, without offering further details.</span></p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.uberpeople.net/threads/pool-chance.439391/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this thread</a> in an Uber drivers&#8217; forum describes the difference like this. Pool Chance is just that: you have a chance of getting a discounted ride if the driver picks up other riders; otherwise you pay the regular fees you&#8217;d pay for an individual ride. UberPool negotiates a specific carpool rate for the rider regardless of who else gets into the vehicle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219124" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pool Chance trip option is available on the </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/en-KE/blog/introducing-pool-chance-in-nairobi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget service, Chap Chap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nairobi;Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the populous </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/en-NG/blog/introducing-pool-chance-in-accra-and-lagos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian city of Lagos and Ghanaâs capital Accra</span></a>,Â <span style="font-weight: 400;">it will be accessible on the UberX category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are currently trialling a new Uber ride, Pool Chance, which will cut costs for riders in Nairobi (Kenya) when they share their ride with others heading in the same direction,&#8221; Uberâs head of communications for East &amp; West Africa, Lorraine Ondoru, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We use this approach when introducing something new and we want to ensure the marketplace remains healthy and balanced. We will share more details once this has been officially launched,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, Uber launched Pool Chance in Auckland, New Zealand after introducing it in Kyiv, Ukraine in October last year. They also <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/newsroom/sydpool/">switched back on</a> the low-cost rideshare service in Australia&#8217;s Sydney and Perth cities earlier in the year, and thereafter launched Pool Chance in Adelaide.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber says on the app that Pool Chance will bring the cost of rides down by up to 30%, further making its trips more affordable to riders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable shared rides can mean more riders using the app, which can lead to more trips, less downtime, and more overall earnings for you,â Uber said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about the new service, in a message to its drivers, in the three African countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is available in eight </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across Africa including Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, and Morocco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the continent, it has over the last few months expanded and introduced new products in its new strategy to retain its customers and attract new ones amidst growing competition from rivals like Bolt, the Estonian-based ride hailing firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Uber expanded to two additional cities in Nigeria &#8211; Ibadan and Port Harcourt &#8211; bringing into the regions a service that is already available in three other cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In South Africa, it also expanded its reach by nine cities this year and introduced its premium service dubbed Uber Comfort to be offered alongside UberX, UberBlack and the budget service, UberGo. It also added a feature that allows booking of a trip a month in advance in August, a service that was already available in other markets across the world.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uberâs plan to introduce the fare-splitting service in markets across Africa comes after it said in a recent </span><a href="https://d1nyezh1ys8wfo.cloudfront.net/static/PDFs/Transit+Horizons+vF.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that âride-sharing will likely play an increasingly important role within the public transportation mix in the next 3-5 years.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company added that while bus and rail transportation will remain core to public transportation due to their ability to transport large numbers of people, they will be complemented by microtransit, ride-sharing and micro-mobility means.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe addition of new modes with a variable cost structure like ride-sharing and the proliferation of on-demand services will unlock new optimums of efficiency and lower cost structures for public transportation agencies,â said Uber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, it said, will go towards ensuring and improving âthe equity, accessibility, resilience, and flexibility of their networks.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Uber Transit, a division serving public transportation, and Routematch, a company they bought last year that provides software to transit agencies, it said in the report that it&#8217;s providing new tools to help agencies to operate more efficiently and offer support to its riders too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the establishment of Uber Transit in 2015, the tech firm has rolled out services in regions across the world that go towards making public transport seamless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2019, it launched an Uber in-app service that enables riders in Denver to plan their journeys and purchase tickets, and offered software to power public transportation after partnering with Marin Transit, in California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September last year it launched in some markets âUber and Transitâ, an in-app feature that makes it possible for riders to use the ride-hailing service to combine trips with other public transportation means like trains and buses.Â </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is set to announce new hardware today. The company is holding a (virtual) keynote at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And youâll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/what-to-expect-from-apple-google-and-samsungs-big-events/">Rumor has it</a> that the company is set to announce some new Macs. Over the past year, Apple has updated its entry-level computers with new custom-designed M1 chips. And now, the company could bring its own chips to higher-end computers, such as a 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, a new Mac Mini and a 27-inch iMac.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple could use this opportunity to redesign its laptops from the ground up with new display technologies, a new array of ports and a new form factor in general. But thatâs not all. Apple has also been working on an updated version of its entry-level AirPods.</p>
<p>You can watch the livestream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you can open the TV app and look for the âApple Special Eventâ section. It lets you stream todayâs event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you donât have an Apple TV and donât want to use YouTube, the company also lets you livestream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers â Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic forced the legal profession to cobble together remote work strategies, often through a combination of video conferencing and emails. Founded in Melbourne, <a href="https://www.immediation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immediation</a> provides a tailor-made solution with digital courtrooms and mediation tools. It has been adopted by Australian federal courts and New Zealand government agencies, and is now expanding in the United States and European markets after raising $3.6 million AUD (about $2.7 million USD). Investors include Thorney Investment Group and its founder and chair, Alex Waislitz.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 and launched in 2019, Immediationâs users include the Federal Court of Australia, the Victorial Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT), and New Zealand agencies like the Ministry of Justice, Sport New Zealand and Domain Name Commission NZ. The startup says over the past 12 months, its revenue has increased 6x year-over-year and its user growth has jumped 2,000%. Immediation currently has about 40 employees in five countries, and a panel of more than 100 mediators and arbitrators. Its new funding brings Immediationâs total raised to $10 million AUD.</p>
<p>In addition to Australia and New Zealand, Immediation also has users in Southeast Asian markets, and will spend the next 12 months focused on growing in the U.S. and European markets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218588" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before starting Immediation as a mediation platform (it also now supports law firms, tribunals and resolution bodies), founder and managing director Laura Keily worked for two decades as a corporate lawyer and barrister. She told TechCrunch in an email that she wanted to create an online mediation platform because âI saw firsthand that people were locked out of being able to access justice effectively. The legal system is complex, lengthy and expensive. Itâs an old system regimented by ancient rules and processes, which are not scalable and are inefficient.â</p>

<p>Before using Immediation, many of its clients only had the option of face-to-face meetings in a mediation center or courtroom. Immediation launched its platform publicly in September 2019, a few months before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>âThe onset of COVID-19 was a turning point,â Keily said. âAs industries were forced to move online overnight, our team pivoted quickly to address the immediate concerns of the legal industry and provide a blueprint for a seamless transition online.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In 2020,</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Â Immediation saw a 2,200% increase in users across more than 2020, including a 500-person hearing over five days for the first ever Willem C. Vis International Arbitration Moot, a moot competition attended by hundreds of law schools.</span></p>

<p>Keily said Immediation was created by lawyers to replicate physical courtrooms, mediation suites, legal client floors and dispute resolution environments. Its tools include the ability to record hearings, share and manage documents, co-draft and execute contracts, enable confidential communication between lawyers and clients during proceedings and set up secure, private rooms for different parties. Judicial officers and mediators retain control participants in a private room, so they can move or remove them as necessary.</p>
<p>Maintaining lawyer-client confidentiality is essential. Immediation built secure chat and party rooms so âclient-lawyer teams can communicate in complete confidence with their own team, even when proceedings are in full flight, knowing that no one else, by design, can see those messages or enter the party room,â said Keily.</p>
<p>Immediation also announced today that it has appointed Christine Christian, the chair of Auctus Investment Group and Tamara Credit Partners, as its new chair, and Rachael Neumann and Greg Wildisen to its board. It added Afterpay chair Elena Rubin and Rampersand VC founding partner Jim Cassidy to its advisory board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the gating factors for getting more homeowners to make the switch to solar energy has been that solar, as a business, is hard one to get right, with <a href="https://okcredit.in/blog/why-do-many-solar-energy-startups-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many a company failing</a> when they&#8217;ve been unable to strike the right balance between the technology working as it should, provisioning services in a cost-effective way, providing good customer service, and handling their own overhead. Today, a startup that believes it has squared some of these problems away is announcing a big funding round as it gears up for growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.enpal.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enpal</a> &#8212; a solar startup out of Berlin, Germany, that uses AI for provisioning and installing services, and then a subscription-style model for homeowners to pay for it (you might even call it a SaaS model: solar-as-a-service) &#8212; has raised â¬150 million ($174 million) from SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The funding closes out its Series C at â¬250 million ($290 million), including â¬100 million that Enpal raised earlier this year from investors that included HV Capital and SolarCity co-founder Peter Rive. The investment values Enpal at â¬950 million ($1.1 billion) post-money, the company has confirmed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To date, Enpal has raised around $360 million in equity, with another $406 million in debt.</p>
<p>The company has some 10,000 customers in Germany, and the plan will be to continue growing in its home market, as well as make its first efforts to expand to new ones. Ultimately Enpal&#8217;s goal, CEO Mario Kohle said, is to make using renewable energy a realistic option for everyone and everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our plan is to go beyond Germany because the climate crisis goes beyond our boarders,&#8221; Kohle said in an interview. &#8220;We also think that this small thing that we invented could also expand into e-mobility and community-based energy distribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 with Viktor Wingert and Jochen Ziervogel, Kohle said the original idea was to build a new startup that could be more proactive about the climate crisis. His previous company, a sales lead-generation startup that he sold to PE firm General Atlantic, happened to have a number of customers that came from the solar market. Kohle liked what they were trying to do, but he saw them fail time and time again. He started to do some research into why, and found that it wasn&#8217;t the solar technology per se, but all of the hurdles in selling and provisioning it efficiently. The business model just didn&#8217;t add up for most of them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So this is where Enpal &#8212; which is a portmanteau of &#8220;energy&#8221; and &#8220;pal&#8221;, Kohle said &#8212; put all of its focus.</p>
<p>It first built an AI-based algorithm that lets users take pictures of their roofs, and then uses computer vision and other techniques to determine the size and positioning of the installation required. The whole provisioning part of the installation is done remotely, with technicians only visiting the house at the point of installation, meaning a faster service at a lower cost.</p>
<p>From there, customers use an IoT app to measure their energy gathering, storage (on <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">lithium iron phosphate cells also supplied by Enpal)</span> and consumption, and to pay for services. Customers do not pay for the energy they use, but they pay rent on the solar panels and for the all-round service &#8212; which include installation, maintenance, repair if necessary, and insurance. Users sign on for 20-year contracts and are able to purchase their panels for 1 euro at the end of that period.</p>
<p>While a number of energy-focused green-tech companies in the market today are focused on innovations in how to generate energy or consume less of it, or with a smaller impact on our environment, Enpal is part of an emerging group that are leaning on those innovations, but are themselves more focused on how to make scaling those solutions more practical and profitable.</p>
<p>Another startup called Aurora Solar is tackling this as a B2B2C problem: in May, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/aurora-solar-aims-to-power-the-growing-solar-industry-with-a-250m-round-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a $250 million Series C of its own</a> earlier this year for technology that also uses computer vision (along with satellite mapping and other data), which it sells to solar companies to help them automate home installation designs and cost estimates, thereby also reducing the huge costs associated with that.</p>
<p>Moonshots, of course, come with risks. Aurora&#8217;s focus on selling software to the solar industry means that it doesn&#8217;t control the full business model and its success is predicated on its customers continuing to grow (and not failing because of the many other challenges in running a solar business).</p>
<p>Enpal has a different kind of challenge, which is that it needs to make sure it doesn&#8217;t find itself over-leveraged with the number of solar installations it has out in the market subsidized by Enpal itself, with perhaps those customers not buying as much solar energy as they&#8217;d been projected to buy. And while you might argue that there are hundreds of tech companies that essentially follow similar principles &#8212; any company that supplies a device to a customer so that the customer pays for a service on that device &#8212; at an estimated cost of between $15,000 and $40,000 for a solar power system for a 2,000 square-foot house, this hardware is typically two orders of magnitude more expensive than, say, a set-top box. That basic model subsidizing panels is one reason the company has taken on so much debt.</p>
<p>Kohle believes the chances of that playing out in a tough way for the company are low simply because the model so compelling. The company is not yet profitable, but &#8220;We have a positive contribution margin from the beginning&#8221; because of the SaaS model, he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s something the customers are paying, and it means we are cash flow positive from the beginning. And what customers like is that they are paying less and getting a solar system for free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors also seem to agree.</p>
<p>âRising electricity prices and increasing demand mean renewable energy adoption is rapidly becoming mainstream,â said Yanni Pipilis, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. âWe believe Enpal offers customers an all-in-one solar solution, lowering the barriers to entry for consumers. Itâs great to be working with Mario and the Enpal team to make more households energy independent.â</p>
<p><em>Updated to correct how customers pay for the service: it&#8217;s a flat rental fee per month, not based on usage.</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every October for the last four decades, Breast Cancer Awareness Month has helped to raise visibility of the most prevalent cancer on Earth â one that takes almost three-quarters of a million lives every year.</p>
<p>Despite recorded cases stretching back to ancient Egypt, breast cancer was considered an âunspeakableâ condition for millennia. Women were expected to suffer in silence and âdignity.â</p>
<p>This stigma fueled academic ignorance, with breast cancer languishing as a relatively unstudied disease until just a few decades ago. For most of the last century, a woman suffering from breast cancer would be offered radiation therapy and/or surgery â often radical surgery, leaving them disfigured for little benefit â while the treatment of other cancers progressed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Breast cancer mortality barely changed from the 1930s to the 1970s, until a concerted effort by feminist and womenâs liberation groups elevated the study and treatment of breast cancer to its rightful position in heavily male-dominated hospitals and research institutions. Treatment transformed in a generation.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, a woman diagnosed with breast cancer had roughly a 40% chance of surviving the next 10 years. Today, that probability has almost doubled, thanks to new drugs, cutting-edge screening methods, and more subtle and effective surgery.</p>
<p>Crucial to this transformation has been an emphasis on early diagnosis. The earlier breast cancer is spotted, the easier it is to treat. Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly critical role in identifying breast cancer. This year, Britain&#8217;s National Health Service (NHS) announced<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/222653/ai-breast-cancer-screening-project-wins/"> a study</a> of how AI could screen for breast cancer. While intended to augment, not replace, human doctors, this would help to mitigate a shortage of radiographers â<a href="https://www.rcr.ac.uk/posts/new-rcr-census-shows-nhs-needs-nearly-2000-more-radiologists"> 2,000 more</a> are needed to clear the NHSâ backlog in scans caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Startups are also using AI to tackle this shortage. Britainâs <a href="https://www.kheironmed.com/">Kheiron Medical Technologies</a> plans to use AI to screen half a million women for breast cancer. Spainâs <a href="https://www.thebluebox.tech/">the Blue Box</a> is developing a device that can detect breast cancer from urine samples. Indiaâs <a href="https://www.niramai.com/">Niramai</a> is working on a low-cost tool that could help screen large numbers of women in rural and semi-urban areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But equally crucial to improving outcomes is identifying patients at high risk of relapsing. Around one in 10 breast cancer patients will relapse after their initial treatment, decreasing their chance of survival.</p>
<p>Identifying them early has historically been difficult, but my team, working with Gustave Roussy, a French cancer hospital, has developed an AI tool that can spot 8 in 10 patients at high risk of relapsing. AI helps to get patients the treatment they need earlier on while also sparing lower-risk patients from frequent, unsettling checkups. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies accelerate breast cancer drug trials by recruiting high-risk patients faster.</p>
<p>Patient data privacy can be an understandable roadblock to rapid research. Hospitals are cautious about sending data off-site, and no pharmaceutical company wants to share valuable data with competitors. But AI is helping to solve these issues, allowing for the quicker, safer and cheaper development of new treatments.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning">Federated learning</a>, a novel form of AI that trains on data from multiple institutions without the data leaving the hospitals, is being used across Europe to give researchers access to essential, yet previously inaccessible, data.</p>
<p>We will also use AI to deepen our understanding of why the most aggressive forms of breast cancer are resistant to certain drugs, helping us to develop new, tailored drugs that discriminate between healthy and tumor cells better than chemotherapy.</p>
<p>While AIâs influence is increasing, equally important to improving outcomes is a recognition that healthcare is a fundamentally human endeavor. No algorithm could ever comfort a patient in their darkest moments, and no machine could ever instill and inspire the resilience that every patient needs in order to beat their disease.</p>
<p>I and every other doctor know that treating disease is as much about understanding the patient as it is about understanding their affliction. Clinician empathy <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pon.2115">is related to</a> higher patient satisfaction and lower distress, motivating a patient to continue a difficult course of treatment. Thankfully, the AI technology that is increasingly helping breast cancer treatment is designed to augment and empower doctors.</p>
<p>Breast cancer is no longer âunspeakableâ for the millions who are diagnosed with it every year. The sea of pink ribbons that herald the start of October signal how far we have come in our battle against one of our oldest foes &#8212; one that we are now defeating. We may never fully eradicate breast cancer. But with AI helping to diagnose patients earlier and enabling the rapid development of treatments, it is possible that in a few decades, we may no longer have the need for a Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome back to <strong>Week in Review</strong>!</p>
<p>Last week, we talked about Apple&#8217;s subscription addiction. This week, I&#8217;m diving deep into whether there&#8217;s actually any meaning to pull out of the NFT mania of 2021.</p>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p>The NFT market is still defying reason, but then again that&#8217;s kind of its thing. But one thing I&#8217;m especially unsure about lately as I see JPGs continue to sell for millions of dollars is&#8230; does any of this actually matter?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time over the last year grappling with the NFT market, at times I&#8217;ve lost sleep over it. As a reporter frequently covering this market, I don&#8217;t own or trade the little images myself, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped me from obsessing over the fluctuations in their prices and scouring Discords trying to follow the trends. I&#8217;ve tuned into countless Twitter Spaces and lurked subreddits trying to understand it all. I&#8217;ve also done my best to keep most of that out of this newsletter &#8212; it&#8217;s a weird niche interest that&#8217;s especially niche at the moment &#8212; but as Bitcoin flirts with a new all-time-high and the NFT mania persists, just consider this a timely update.</p>
<p>So, in the past month, investors have continued dropping billions upon billions of dollars on NFTs. OpenSea <a href="https://dappradar.com/ethereum/marketplaces/opensea">has seen more than $3 billion in transaction volume</a> in the past 30 days, and that number is actually way down quite a bit from August, showcasing just how much off-peak money continues to flow into NFTs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of that money has gone to some colorful places. One of the bigger success stories of the past month has been the platform CrypToadz which investors dumped $100 million into. They look like <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptoadz-by-gremplin">this</a>. In the past couple weeks, a brand new project called MekaVerse saw $130 million in transaction volume. They&#8217;re <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mekaverse">a bit prettier</a>, but would you spend more than $8,000 on one? The platform <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/">Cryptoslam</a> (where I pulled most of the data I reference here) is tracking 163 platforms which did more than $1 million in volume in the past 30 days, a number which doesn&#8217;t even account for individual artists selling their work on platforms like OpenSea.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GgeICiYg81"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/nba-top-shot-creator-on-the-nft-craze-and-why-ethereum-still-isnt-consumer-friendly/">NBA Top Shot creator on the NFT craze and why Ethereum still isn&#8217;t consumer friendly</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NBA Top Shot creator on the NFT craze and why Ethereum still isn&#8217;t consumer friendly&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/nba-top-shot-creator-on-the-nft-craze-and-why-ethereum-still-isnt-consumer-friendly/embed/#?secret=GgeICiYg81" data-secret="GgeICiYg81" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, there are two incredibly different segments of NFT communities out there, larger-scale NFT projects like <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a> and NBA Top Shot with tens and hundreds of thousands of users and smaller-scale NFT projects like CryptoPunks and Art Blocks with just a few hundred or thousand owners. Larger-scale projects can represent more traditional gaming titles with more complex in-game economies while smaller-scale projects simply look more like fine art markets teamed with exclusive social clubs. Some smaller-scale projects have the ambition to eventually become larger-scale ones, but many have capped the number of NFTs in their projects and are designed to be exclusive.</p>
<p>In the past 30 days, Axie Infinity did more than $500 million in sales spread across nearly 2 million transactions and over 350,000 buyers. On the flip side, CryptoPunks did $200 million in sales during that same time frame across 484 transactions and 309 buyers.</p>
<p>Generally, when I&#8217;m talking about some of these big sales from smaller-scale projects with friends of mine, the first thing they mention is how this is probably all just money laundering. While I&#8217;d certainly imagine <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny/status/1443435334365114370?s=20">some of that is happening</a>, that&#8217;s ultimately a much more boring explanation than my best guess of what&#8217;s really going on, which is that a group of several thousand investors have separately rationalized irrational investing. They just happen to have chosen to do so through buying pixel art and drawings of animals.</p>
<p>While some investors might suggest that a handful of the earliest NFTs hold intrinsic value as historic objects, there are plenty of brand new NFT projects earning ten-million dollar valuations on day one with low amounts of effort and imagination.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="onWR0ozK9z"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">The Cult of CryptoPunks</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Cult of CryptoPunks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/embed/#?secret=onWR0ozK9z" data-secret="onWR0ozK9z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s seemingly the result of momentum from awe-struck retail investors entering a market filled with massive amounts of wealth being generated and re-invested by Ethereum millionaires who can massively overpay for deals while pushing the implied value of the objects, the projects, the entire NFT market and the price of Ethereum up concurrently. Most of these investors are also people who have held onto Ethereum through its waves and have grown fundamentally averse to cashing out, meaning they&#8217;re less likely to sell the NFTs they buy unless they&#8217;re just trying to buy another more expensive NFT or have been made an offer too good to refuse. As a result, many high-value smaller-scale projects stay liquid on the low-end while fewer sales of the rarer items underpin the massive valuations of the projects and those occasional big buys keep pushing prices higher.</p>
<p>All of this babbling of mine is to say, what&#8217;s happening here is strange. It&#8217;s also an incredibly large amount of noise mostly coming from a few thousand buyers.</p>
<p>But when most investors talk about mainstream adoption and future use cases, they&#8217;re looking at the creation of more larger-scale projects like Axie and Top Shot which embody many of the technical bells and whistles of crypto economics in more user-friendly packages that can reach the mainstream. NFTs as a concept for driving more complex virtual economies is, indeed, really fascinating, but I don&#8217;t think there are as many takeaways to draw from billions of dollars flowing into digital art and these smaller-scale projects like CrypToadz as many crypto investors and venture capitalists are trying to convince themselves.</p>
<p>Only three NFT platforms out there had more than 10,000 active unique buyers in their community in the past 30 days, and while the successes of platforms like Axie Infinity are definitely worth dissecting, it also seems clear we&#8217;re in the midst of a speculative frenzy and it&#8217;s not a very easy time to draw sober conclusions about what all this madness means for the future of the web.</p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p>Here are a few stories this week that I think you should take a closer look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/"><b>Apple probably won&#8217;t be supporting alternate App Store payments anytime soon</b></a><br />
Apple did their best to convince the press and public that the court&#8217;s decision in its legal fight with Epic Games was an outright win for Apple, but over the weekend they quietly announced that weeks later they&#8217;re appealing the decision and asking the courts to put the ordered changes to allow alternative payments inside iOS apps on hold.</p>
<p>Apple put on a cool demeanor after this ruling, but it&#8217;s apparent that there are billions on the line for Apple if this order stands. Therefore delaying its rollout means billions of dollars that aren&#8217;t going to other payment providers or staying in developer coffers. Epic had already appealed the decision as well, hoping to try for a more favorable ruling, but it&#8217;s clear that anyone hoping for a speedy resolution will be disappointed &#8212; as is often the case in corporate law.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/animal-crossing-new-horizons-will-get-major-updates-and-happy-home-paradise-dlc-on-november-5/"><b>Nintendo reshapes its SaaS ambitions</b></a><br />
Nintendo has been and probably always will be a bit of an odd big company. They&#8217;ve been resistant to new trends in gaming and when they embrace them, they don&#8217;t necessarily do a great job capitalizing on them, and yet their mountain of beloved IP allows them chance after chance to get things right. This week, they announced more details on their new annual membership called Nintendo Switch Online+ which, for $50 per year will give gamers a deeper array of content. That&#8217;s a good deal more than the standard $20 per year for the regular Nintendo Switch Online subscription, but beyond expanded virtual console support for an unannounced array of N64 games, it&#8217;s not clear what exactly the sell is for consumers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they&#8217;re launching the service with free access to a major update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It&#8217;s a play that only works when you&#8217;re Nintendo and the penetration of your first-party titles is so incredibly high among device-owners (and especially likely subscribers). Nintendo has sold more than 3.4 million copies of the new Animal Crossing title globally.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">Microsoft pulls LinkedIn from China</a><br />
</b>It&#8217;s been a particularly turbulent time for tech companies across China as government regulators crack down and the outlook clouds for big platforms there. This week, Microsoft announced that it&#8217;s pulling LinkedIn out of China, detailing that LinkedIn was now âfacing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.â LinkedIn didn&#8217;t have a huge presence in China so this won&#8217;t make major waves, but as other American tech giants are forced to make major adjustments to their China strategy, this marks yet another datapoint in the cooling of relations between China and the West.</p>
<p>The LinkedIn&#8217;s of the world don&#8217;t hold much sway in China, the most curious bit of this is how this regulatory upswing eventually affects Apple which does hold plenty of influence. While officials probably aren&#8217;t keen to jam them up, the past year has shown that China&#8217;s regulators have plenty of surprises up their sleeves.</p>

<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our newly-renamed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">TechCrunch+</a> subscription service this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/inside-plaids-plans-to-build-a-new-global-finance-network/"><b>Inside Plaid</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;Visa and Plaid might have chosen to go their own ways in the end, but the year wasnât a total loss for the data connectivity startup: Plaid claims its customer count grew 60% in 2020, and company execs say it has had similar growth so far this year&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/founders-should-use-predictive-modeling-to-fundraise-smarter/"><b>Founders should use predictive modeling to fundraise smarter</b></a><br />
&#8220;More capital is flooding into growth equity at earlier stages, and itâs happening faster than ever before. But even with the rampant enthusiasm for pouring bigger equity checks into startups, founders are now in a unique place in time where they can think differently about how to capitalize their companies&#8230;.<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/how-our-startup-boosted-productivity-with-get-s-done-day/"><b>How one startup boosted productivity with &#8216;get s*** done&#8217; day</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;To improve our productivity, we introduced a Getting Shit Done Day (GSDD): Our employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved (we encourage our employees to avoid social media on this day, but we are not looking over their shoulder). The goal of GSDD is to increase the amount of time we spend in deep work by minimizing distractions for one day every other week&#8230;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this weekâs startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>This week, cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase announced that it is launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/">its own NFT platform</a> to take on OpenSea, an existing NFT platform. Some techies aptly pointed out that both Coinbase and OpenSea are backed by Andreessen Horowitz, leading to questions around competitive conflicts that could arise from having a shared investor (itâs unclear if a16z ever sold its shares in Coinbase after it went public).</p>
<p>As we discussed on Equity this week, the idea of having competitive companies within the same portfolio feels uncomfortable. It could impact how open each company is with its investors, and, as we saw with Hinge Health, can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/bessemer-replaces-board-member-at-hinge-health-following-competitive-tensions/">cause tension if thereâs an overlap in advisers.</a> Itâs a fair argument.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218530" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SCIBSfXMVk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/coinbase-goes-fishing-for-openseas-catch/">Coinbase goes fishing for OpensSeaâs catch</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coinbase goes fishing for OpensSeaâs catch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/coinbase-goes-fishing-for-openseas-catch/embed/#?secret=SCIBSfXMVk" data-secret="SCIBSfXMVk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But, is it just me, or does competitive conflict sound somewhat inevitable? As venture firms grow, especially an institution like a16z, the idea that no portfolio companies in booming sectors like fintech or crypto overlap in vision feels unrealistic. Clubhouse, another a16z-backed company, was met with an entire wave of competitors after its debut â and I joked then that it&#8217;s only a matter of time until one of the firmâs portfolio companies pivots to social audio, too.</p>
<p>In a world of rapid deal-making and booming subsectors, competitive conflict will continue to grow. Imitation holds startups to a higher standard. If a startup can copy your idea, and entirely win based off of that, a shared investor is likely not your problem. Sure, there should be some processes in place to make sure that your board member isnât sitting in meetings with your closest competitor, but, beyond extreme cases, the line is blurring on what should constitute conflicts.</p>
<p>Iâm being harsh, but thatâs my first reaction. Your competitor can always eat your lunch, but in the great OpenSea, maybe that just means itâs time to swim a little deeper.</p>
<p>As always, you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> or <a href="https://linktr.ee/Equitypod">listen to me on Equity.</a> This week, I also made a guest appearance on Here &amp; Now <a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/10/13/education-technology">to talk about edtechâs evolution!</a></p>
<h2>A fund for, and by, South Asian female entrepreneurs</h2>

<p>As a South Asian female, I was amped to see the emerging fund manager world get a new influx of my people this week. Neythri Futures Fund announced that it has closed a $10 million fund with investments from leading South Asian men and women.</p>
<p><strong>Hereâs what you need to know: </strong>The fund, per founding managing partner Mythili Sankaran, brought together 200 investors, with 90% South Asian women and, hereâs the kicker, 70% first-time investors. It was built on AngelList, which has been working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/">a suite of SaaS tools for venture capitalists.</a></p>

ClassPass, for those who donât know, helps fill workout classes with consumers, while Mindbody provides the software that helps fitness centers and boutique shops better run their business.</p>
<p><strong>Hereâs what to know: </strong>It felt sensical and smart, two words that should be associated with acquisitions.</p>
<blockquote><p>By combining forces, the Mindbody/ClassPass entity has the opportunity for huge growth. ClassPass studios that are not using a booking software â Lanman says itâs about one-third of the studios on ClassPass â will now have the chance to sign up with Mindbody.</p>
<p>Mindbodyâs consumer-facing business will have the chance to double down on their experience by signing up for a ClassPass subscription and get access to those studios. And, of course, gyms and studios that use Mindbody for Ã  la carte bookings could be upsold to ClassPass, as well. â Jordan Crook</p></blockquote>

<p>This week on Equity, the TechCrunch team looked at how two travel-focused startups have pivoted and rebounded their way through the pandemic. While one startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/zeus-living-closes-on-55m-to-offer-flexible-furnished-rentals-as-it-expands-beyond-corporate-housing/">chose to focus on flexible living</a>, another decided to go the fintech route.</p>
<p><strong>Hereâs what to know</strong>: TripActions went from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/from-0-in-revenue-to-a-7-25b-valuation-why-tripactions-275m-raise-has-fintech-to-thank/">$0 in revenue to $7.25 billion</a> in valuation. How? Well, as Mary Ann reports, TripActions leaned into the very nascent fintech product that it launched a month before the pandemic hit, giving it growth and a way to support customers through expense management. The news reminds us all that every startup, eventually, is a fintech company.</p>
<p><em>Fintech &amp; friends:</em></p>

<h2>Around TC</h2>
<p>This week, Iâm going to convince you that one of the best, free ways to build a better venture-backed business is â¦ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a>. The weekly event, put together by some of the best internal folks at the publication, connects founders and the investors who finance them in a chill chat.</p>
<p>TC interviews investors on their thought process when writing checks, pushing for specifics and reverse engineering their biggest deals to date. Then, in the latter half of each episode, founders in the audience are encouraged to jump on our virtual stage and pitch their products, receiving live feedback from our esteemed duos.</p>
<p>This past week, we had Chime founder and CEO Chris Britt with Menlo Ventures partner Shawn Carolan. In the past, weâve had Poshmark CEO Manish Chandra, Mayfieldâs Navin Chaddha, Planet FWDâs Julia Collins and Cleo Capitalâs Sarah Kunst.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is free for anyone who would like to attend live, so come hang every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week inÂ Apps,Â <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a>Â that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, withÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a>Â 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year alsoÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a>Â 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average AmericanÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a>Â 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>

<h3>Google responds to the Epic Games antitrust suit, Apple appeals</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1689580" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1689580" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1689580" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="399" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=680,399 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-revenue-google-play.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1689580" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Epic Games</p></div></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">As the Apple v. Epic GamesÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">lawsuit</a>Â <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">goes under appeal,</a> Google this week filed an answer and counterclaim in the Epic Gamesâ antitrust litigation against the company. The tech giant and Android maker denies Epicâs allegations of antitrust behavior and instead says that itâs owed relief, as Epic Games breached the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement (DDA) by allowing Fortnite players who download the app through Google Play to use Epicâs own payment processing technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This situation is similar to what took place on the App Store, where Epic Games updated its app to workaround App Store policies, and then facilitated payments through its own payments system, in violation of its legal contract with Apple. The courtâs decision in Appleâs case was that Epic owed financial relief to Apple, to the tuneÂ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-pays-apple-6-million/">of $6 million</a>.</p>
<p>Epic Games did much of the same thing on Google Play, the counterclaim alleges. Last year, Epic submitted a build of Fortnite to Google Play which used Epicâs own direct payments system and not Google Play Billing. This submission was immediately rejected for failing to comply with Googleâs policies. Epic then submitted a compliant version in April 2020, which Google now describes as âan act of deception designed to provoke litigation.â The new version had concealed Epicâs payment system in an update that was sent to both Apple and Googleâs app stores. This would allow Epic to switch over to its own payment system by applying a server-side configuration change, or âhotfix,â without Googleâs knowledge.</p>
<p>That switch was flipped on August 13, 2020. It allowed Fortnite users to choose between Google Play Billing and Epicâs own direct payments system. Now Google wants to recoup the money lost to this version, as those who downloaded the app from the Play Store could continue to use Epic&#8217;s billing, even after the app was pulled down.</p>
<p>Epicâs position has been that Apple and Googleâs requirement to use their own in-app payment systems exclusively is a monopolistic practice that disadvantages developers. In Appleâs case,Â <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">the court agreed</a> that Apple should not block developers from sharing a link to other payment methods inside their own app or communicating to customers. It did not declare Apple a monopoly. Despite the largely favorable ruling,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/"> Apple decided to appeal its case this week,</a> after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">Epic filed its own appeal</a>.</p>
<p>The key factor to Apple&#8217;s appeal is that it&#8217;s also asking the court to put a hold on it having to implement changes to the App Store&#8217;s anti-steering guidelines. That means, instead of permitting developers to add links to their website and other methods of payments, things would continue as is until the appeals case was decided. That could be months or even years from now.</p>
<p>In terms of the antitrust complaint, Googleâs situation is a bit different from Apple&#8217;s, however. Android already allows for sideloading apps â that means thereâs another method of reaching Android users outside Google Play, making an antitrust claim more difficult.</p>
<h3>Twitter adds more ads</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1824810" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1824810" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1824810" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-187232514.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1824810" class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)</p></div></p>
<p>Twitter says itâs going to test a new ad format and placement on its platform. On Wednesday, Twitter Revenue Product LeadÂ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brucefalck/">Bruce Falck</a>Â said Twitter would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/twitter-found-a-way-to-show-users-more-ads/">begin showing ads on mobile devices</a> inside conversation threads after the first, third and eighth replies. While the company stopped short of confirming the change would be permanent, it did say it would experiment with the formula to best determine the insertion points and layouts that made the most sense. Twitter also said it would consider making the display of the ads something creators would opt into, rather than forcing them to accept ads in their threads. In that case, creators would also see a share of ad revenue, Twitter said.</p>
<p>The company historicallyÂ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18213567/twitter-to-stop-sharing-mau-as-users-decline-q4-2018-earnings">hasÂ struggled</a>Â toÂ <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/twitter-posts-strong-revenue-result-in-q3-as-user-growth-slows/588093/">grow</a> its user base by significant numbers, meaning itâs had to get more creative with maximizing the revenue itâs able to extract from its existing users. Despite a flurry of new product development &#8212; which has included creator tools, subscriptions, audio chat rooms, tipping and more &#8212; Twitter has not yet had a runaway hit. For example, third-party data indicated recently Twitterâs new creator platform called Super Follow had only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">generated</a>Â around $6,000 in its first two weeks live in the U.S. and Canada, or perhaps a bit more ($12,400 during 17 days in September,Â <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">according</a> to a second firmâs analysis).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Twitter made aÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitter-plans-to-double-revenue-by-2023-reach-315m-daily-users/">promise to investors</a> that it will be able to double its revenue from $3.7 billion in 2020 to $7.5 billion or more in 2023. If the new products don&#8217;t turn a sizable profit, increasing Twitter&#8217;s ad load could help. Unfortunately, monetizing conversations like this could encourage users to post more content they hope to make viral. That could impact Twitterâs content and culture. Twitter is already a place that tends to reward a sort of performative type of user â like those posting snark, jokes, angry tweets and other emotive content; tying tweetsâ âviralityâ to creator revenue could push Twitter even further away from the genuine, thoughtful conversations the company claims it wants to host.</p>

At the core of the Disney Genie experience is a smart trip-planning capability that maps out a personalized itinerary based on which rides, attractions or food and entertainment experiences guests want to make sure to do while at the parks. This is rolling out to the My Disney Experience app, and will accommodate real-time scheduling changes &#8212; like if you decide to take a detour on your route or head back to the hotel for a break, for instance. The feature could potentially put some third-party itinerary apps out of business, given Disney will have the advantage of leveraging its own park data and real-time updates, like ride closures and the like.</li>

<p>When Trumpâs ban on TikTok failed, the short-form video app Byte exited to rival <a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> â an admission of sorts that TikTokâs momentum couldnât be beaten if it was allowed to remain in the U.S. This week, Byte&#8217;s new owner Clash relaunched its app with the âbest of Byteâ under the hood alongside a suite of creator tools for monetizing a fan base. And this time, the focus isnât on beating TikTok, but working in parallel alongside it. The newly rebuilt Clash app introduces a set of tools for creators and their fans, including a virtual tipping mechanism called Drops (not to be confused with product drops, popular in e-commerce) and a paid messaging system called Fanmail. The idea is that Clash would be used with a creator&#8217;s most loyal fans who would like to have more exclusive access, a closer connection or behind-the-scenes content, among other things. Creators can cash out when they&#8217;ve earned at least $25 in Drops. The app relaunched in Byte&#8217;s place on the App Store and is arriving on Android soon.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hardware season is heading for a dramatic finale next week, with three events from three major companies, three days in a row. Apple, Google and Samsung (in that order) are all hosting big events next week, getting their last big announcements (hopefully) out of the way ahead of the upcoming holiday season.</p>
<p>That means your friendly neighborhood hardware editor &#8212; and much of the TechCrunch staff &#8212; is set to be busy for the next few weeks, writing about and reviewing all manner of gadgets. Meantime, weâve got some information to go off, in terms of what we can expect next week, through a combination of rumors, leaks and process of elimination.</p>
<p>That last bit holds especially true in the case of Apple and Samsung. Both companies are following recent big product unveils, and barring brand new product lines, we can triangulate whatâs likely next on the docket for each. Google, meanwhile, has essentially announced what itâs got brewing for Tuesday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219040" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Letâs work chronologically here.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150727" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150727" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2150727" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro silver keyboard. close up Mac on the blue background" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg 2121w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1287781079.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150727" class="wp-caption-text">Apple MacBook Pro silver keyboard. close up Mac on the blue background</p></div></p>
<p>Appleâs kicking things off <strong>Monday at 10AM PT/1PM ET</strong>. Itâs been just over a month since the companyâs latest event, which brought new iPhones, Apple Watches and iPads. One big missing product line was absent, however. We didnât see any new Macs. With macOS Monterey dropping any day now, and the companyâs already announced plans to upgrade its entire line to first-party silicon, the absence was felt at the event.</p>
<p>It seemed reasonable to expect the company might go the press release route, but instead, it looks like Appleâs opted to give Mac its moment in the spotlight. As Iâve noted before, companies are generally less obligated to cram everything into a single event now that they&#8217;re not asking attendees to fly from around the world to be there. Some have taken liberties with this notion &#8212; though I donât anticipate that to be the case here. At the very least, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/macbook-pro-better-displays-faster-magsafe-charging/">we expect some big Mac news</a>, including:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>A new MacBook Pro in 13 and 16-inch versions</li>
<li>A new Mac Mini</li>
<li>A 27-inch iMac</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2153026" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153026" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153026" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9190.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153026" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The first two essentially replace last yearâs M1 models, which effectively had the same guts. A new, even faster M1X chip is said to be arriving, along with potential hardware redesigns. The 27-inch iMac, meanwhile, would augment the 24-inch model, serving as a more pro-focused system.</p>
<p>An overdue update to the entry-level AirPods are said to be in the works, as well, featuring improved sound quality and design more inline with the Pros &#8212; but without active noise canceling.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184612" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184612" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2184612" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg 1060w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=768,319 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=680,282 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184612" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Speaking of new chips, Google already announced its plan to unveil its in-house Tensor chip, becoming the latest company to buck Qualcomm for first-party silicon. That will be used to power the new Pixel 6 and a Pro model. The handsets feature a radical redesign for a line thatâs been stumbling to stay afloat in the smartphone wars.</p>
<p>Google has gone as far as putting up a product page for the pair ahead of the event. Cribbing from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/"> Gregâs writeup</a> of the initial announcement here:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The base 6 will have a matte aluminum finish with a 6.4â³ display, while the Pro has a shinier polished aluminum finish with a 6.7â³ display.</li>
<li>Pixel 6 has two cameras (wide and ultrawide), while the 6 Pro adds a telephoto zoom lens.</li>
<li>If you were hoping the increasingly common âcamera bumpâ trend was on the way outâ¦ not quite. The bump has now evolved into the âcamera bar,â with Googleâs Rick Osterloh noting that better sensors and lenses just wonât fit in a smaller package.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/pixel-6-further-leaks/">A recent leak</a> has offered up a bit more info on their camera system &#8212; two rear-facing on the 6 and three on the Pro. Theyâll both feature a 50-megapixel wide-angle and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide, while the Pro adds a 48-megapixel telephoto. That event is going down Tuesday at <strong>10AM PT/1PM ET</strong>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188134" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188134" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188134" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9880.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188134" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Samsungâs Wednesday event is the biggest question mark of the three &#8212; which, given how Samsung products tend to leak, is not something we get to say much. The new foldables were recently announced and we donât expect another Galaxy S device until around MWC in February/March of next year. A PC or tablet seems to be a reasonable guess. Though the bright colors in the invite could offer another clue. That event kicks off at <strong>7AM PT/10AM ET on Wednesday.</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. Itâs inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.Â </em></p>
<p>Hello friends! Happy weekend. Up top, thereâs an extra Equity episode dropping today digging into the larger China-Microsoft dustup over LinkedIn. So if you need more on that, itâs coming. Letâs go!</p>
<p>The key money story in Startup Land this week was the simply massive GitLab IPO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218986" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In case you are behind, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/">GitLab filed to go public</a>, and we noted that at current market prices, the DevOps giant could be worth some $10 billion. That wound up being conservative. GitLab wound up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/gitlab-raises-ipo-range-targeting-valuation-of-as-much-as-11b/">raising its IPO price range far above its initial estimate</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">then pricing at $77</a>. Late Friday afternoon, as I write to you, itâs worth more than $108 per share.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="X5aQWIjrOy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">3 things GitLab&#8217;s wild IPO pricing says about public markets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 things GitLab&#8217;s wild IPO pricing says about public markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/embed/#?secret=X5aQWIjrOy" data-secret="X5aQWIjrOy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I got on the horn with GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij to chat about the deal. Iâve nattered with Sijbrandij here and there for some time, starting back with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/13/the-newest-members-of-the-100m-arr-club/">this particular story</a>. So it was good fun to talk to him on IPO day, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/an-interview-with-visionary-founder-ceo-on-large-unicorns-ipo-day/">constrained as he was by normal SEC rules</a>. Hereâs what I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why did GitLab go public now?</strong> It hit all the marks, Sijbrandij said, including revenue scale, revenue predictability and compliance. And the IPO date wound up being 10 years to the month from when co-founder Dmitriy Zaporozhets wrote his first code for the company. So thatâs a nice circle of timing. Humans do so love round numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Did GitLabâs strong net retention metrics help with revenue predictability?</strong> Yes, but Sijbrandij didnât want to say that explicitly.</li>
<li><strong>Open-source is now an advantage, not a hindrance:</strong> This point is an echo of something we noted concerning startups the other month, but itâs worth flagging all the same. Having open-source code is now a <em>boon</em> to companies hoping to build long-term relationships with developers, something that is often key when it comes to product-led growth, Iâd hazard. This is the polar opposite of the world that existed a decade ago, and is perhaps why Microsoft changed its tune some time back on the concept of open code.</li>
<li><strong>And will we see GitLab get into MLOps as well as DevOps? </strong>Maybe? Sijbrandij wasnât black-and-white on the matter, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/weights-biases-raises-new-capital-as-developer-tools-remain-a-venture-focus-ml-matures/">but with the MLOps world accelerating</a>, I wouldnât be shocked if we saw GitLab wander into what could be called startup territory in time. It certainly now has the cash to do whatever it wants.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cloudflare versus the world</h2>
<p>Letâs dive back to the news from late September that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/cloudflare-enters-infrastructure-services-market-with-new-r2-storage-product/">Cloudflare was moving into the âstorage as a serviceâ market</a>. The news was that Cloudflare intends to offer cloud storage through its collection of global data centers. The product news was far afield from what Cloudflare is best known for, namely making websites appear more quickly and more securely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why was the now-public company getting into something as commodified as <em>storage? </em>At the time, Ron Miller wrote that Cloudflare was turning something it built for itself and offering it to others. And that by eliminating some fees, Cloudflareâs storage service â R2 â would be cheaper than what Amazon offers, for example, via its AWS collection of infra services.</p>
<p>I have had a thought. Namely, I will not be utterly gobsmacked if we see large, but not titanic, tech companies with a global footprint that offer a particular flavor of digital service <em>also</em> get into providing what <em>appear</em> to be initially niche infra tooling that competes modestly â at first â with what Amazon and Microsoft currently offer via AWS and Azure.</p>
<p>This may be Big Dumb, but we can explain ourselves a bit by analogy. My argument is akin to how Intel ran the world with its particular CPU methodology for a long time, only to lose the future to not only GPUs forced into the cryptocurrency salt mines, but also a grip of startups building, say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/hailo-raises-136m-ai-chips/">AI-tuned silicon</a>. In our analogy, AWS is Intel and AI chips are things like R2 from Cloudflare.</p>
<p>The days when AWS and Azure were trading price cuts back and forth is behind us. Whatâs next?</p>
<h2>Odds, ends</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2021/10/prisidio-raises-additional-3-5m-in-seed-funding.html">mix of Midwest VCs put $3.5 million into Presidio</a>, a digital vault startup aimed at consumers. Itâs a Florida-based company, and is looking toward a 2022 launch. I have myriad questions about this. But that someone is building a storage-centric startup in this time and era caught my eye.</li>
<li>Cap table software company <a href="https://carta.com/data-desk/#interactive-data">Carta put out a data product</a> that I have enjoyed tinkering with. If you want to mess about with a host of funding data sortable by era and company type, itâs good fun.</li>
<li>I was going to write up notes on <a href="https://adambird.com/posts/back-to-eu/">this essay from a U.K. startup</a> about how it is redomiciling to the EU after its home country started to change privacy rules, but our own Natasha Lomas beat me to it. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/so-much-for-levelling-up/">read her post</a>, which is better than what I could have come up with.</li>
<li>And, speaking of the U.K., Freetrade in the country has now <a href="https://freetrade.io/blog/freetrade-reaches-one-million-users">signed up 1 million users</a>. This stat matters as it indicates that the Robinhood boom is truly an international consumer movement that will lift many startupsâ boats.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Analogue&#8217;s much-anticipated Pocket retro gaming machine will come with more than just sleek design and the ability to play tons of classic games. The device will be the first with AnalogueOS on it, an effort to make what founder Chris Taber calls the &#8220;Library of Alexandria of video games.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, he called it the &#8220;<em>great fucking</em> Library of Alexandria,&#8221; which gives you an idea of how excited he is about it. See, retro gaming is a strange place â there&#8217;s tons of information out there, but few sources are exhaustive and many are decidedly retro themselves.</p>
<p>Depending on the information you want, you may find it in a wiki dedicated to a game or system, a message board frequented by old 8-bit gaming devs, a hex file used in modding a ROM, even an out-of-print book. The history and versions of a game, as well as ephemera like manuals, reviews, and technical documentation might be scattered in a dozen places.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218853" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s the goal of AnalogueOS to curate and present as much as this information as possible, as close to the games themselves as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;At its heart, AnalogueOS is purpose built for exploring and celebrating all of video game history. Designed to be the definitive, scholarly operating system for playing and experiencing the entire medium. Our vision is total, absolute,&#8221; said Taber. &#8220;And yes, AnalogueOS will be on every future Analogue system.&#8221;</p>
<p>To start with the OS will be a flexible and extensible way to play and track your games. If you&#8217;ve got dozens of games for the GameBoy, Game Gear, Lynx, and so on, you certainly could just pop one in and play. But the Pocket is meant to be a showcase, not simply the nicest way to play those games (though it almost certainly will be that).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218932" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218932" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218932" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg" alt="Images of different handheld games being played on an Analogue Pocket." width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg 1557w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=1536,1150 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket-styles.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218932" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Analogue</p></div></p>
<p>Therefore each game will be embellished with box art, screenshots, publisher and other metadata, all in an organized fashion so you can say one day, &#8220;What Sunsoft games do I have?&#8221; and just browse those. Or if you&#8217;re curious about one in particular, say <em>Blaster Master: Enemy Below</em>, you can browse through data pertaining to that title, its revisions and changes, sequels and prequels, guides and screenshots.</p>
<p>Not all the data will be available right off the bat, as the database is still under construction, but Taber confirmed that the intent â and Analogue is the type of obsessive company to follow through â is to integrate as much of this as users choose. As most of this data is text, it can easily be integrated directly into the OS with minimal storage cost. &#8220;You stick a game cartridge in and it will be able to read exactly what game it is,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For collectors looking for a specific region or revision of a game â rare cartridges used in competitions, illegal distributions, promotions and so on â that information can be confirmed in seconds now. Find something interesting at an estate sale? Pop it in the Pocket and find out exactly what version of the game it is â garden variety or once-in-a-lifetime find?</p>
<p>Box art, being more bulky, can be downloaded by users from sets devs are already working on. Folks who move in retro gaming circles will already be familiar with the type of light work involved in scanning your library and bringing over only the required images. (There are copyright considerations here, so the company must be careful what it provides.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218929" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218929" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218929" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png" alt="Screenshots of the AnalogueOS interface showing the ability to save states and track gameplay." width="1024" height="828" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png 1419w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=768,621 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=680,550 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/analogueOS-1.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218929" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Analogue</p></div></p>
<p>The Pocket will enable save states to be used on cartridge-based games, a huge boon for gamers who prefer to get as close to the original hardware and software as possible. Analogue is outspoken in its preference for FPGA-based cores that imitate the original chips rather than software-based emulation, and being able to load a game and hardware state in that architecture is surely a tricky process.</p>
<p>The OS will track your play by hour and day, and you can even make your own &#8220;playlists&#8221; to share with others (assuming they have the games to go with them). And there are quality of life changes like remapping controls, Bluetooth controller support and so on.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as you can see, Analogue wants to make its hardware not just the best way to play retro games on modern hardware (like high-definition TVs, which old consoles weren&#8217;t designed for), but also a complete resource for history and collector data on the games themselves. It&#8217;s ambitious, and though some may point out that there are such resources already available, they&#8217;re scattered and fragmented. If Analogue can successfully unify all this information into a single place, and make it available where the players are â in front of the game â it could help the company graduate from luxury option to must-have in the retro gaming world.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch&#8217;s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. Or, as in today&#8217;s episode, talk our way through some big breaking news from the technology world so that we can better understand just what is going on.</p>
<p>Danny and Alex got together late Friday on a Twitter Space to discuss <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">Microsoft&#8217;s decision to pull LinkedIn from the Chinese market</a>, a move that lit up headlines around the world. That LinkedIn was still in China in 2021 may feel more surprising than the news that it will exit that particular market, but the moment matters all the same as it marks the end of an experiment &#8212; could a mega-tech company have a US HQ and a first-party service live in China?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218957" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Er, no, it turns out. Not really.</p>
<p>Microsoft found itself jammed between its own ethics, and governmental censure. It was a lose-lose for the company, so pulling the plug was the smart move. The company isn&#8217;t going to miss the revenue.</p>
<p>For startups, the Microsoft decision is a good reminder that doing business in China is at a minimum very hard for non-Chinese companies, and perhaps impossible. Recall that Microsoft had to work with a Chinese company (21Vianet) to get Azure into the country at all, and that the Chinese government is using a few companies to build a new OS for the country so that it can replace Windows.</p>
<p>Precisely how good that OS will prove is not yet clear, at least from a consumer perspective.</p>
<p>And then we riffed on GitLab&#8217;s IPO. My favorite topic of the week. You&#8217;ll see why it came up when you hit play. Chat Monday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There may be plenty of funding for some startups these days. But plenty of companies will tell you otherwise. <a href="https://govclab.com/">VC Lab</a>, an accelerator for venture capital firms, wants to create investors who will back the rest of the world.</p>
<p>A basic hurdle to this goal is the standard paperwork you need to set up a new fund. It currently requires specialized lawyers whose time can cost more than $100,000 per fund formation.</p>
<p>Today, VC Lab is providing a set of <a href="https://govclab.com/2021/09/27/cornerstone-limited-partner-agreement/">freely available boilerplate documents</a> intended to streamline the process, save everyone time and money and make fund governance structures more accessible.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219068" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>âWe have general partners launching funds from all around the world,â co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeoressi/">Adeo Ressi</a> explains. âThe last cohort enrolled venture investors from 62 different countries, including Central Asia, Africa, and every other place you can imagine.â</p>
<p>Legal costs are the last thing they need.</p>
<p>âThe new managers who are getting into venture are coming in with a passion for change â the funds often have a very focused thesis, and they tend to be smaller in size. They really want to help the companies they work with to succeed at any cost. They donât need 200 to 400 pages of legal agreements governing every small decision that they make. They need lean and light, easy-to-use agreements.â</p>
<p>The package, which <a href="https://govclab.com/2021/10/08/releasing-cornerstone-to-fix-vc/">VC Lab is calling Cornerstone</a>, is a short 33 pages that include a term sheet, a subscription agreement and an LPA (and this <a href="https://govclab.com/2021/10/07/how-to-use-cornerstone-to-form-a-fund/">user guide</a>). Similar fund formation documents regularly run into the hundreds of pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>âThereâs been widespread recognition that fund formation docs are ridiculously complex and in need of an overhaul,â says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hansekim/">Hans Kim</a>, a longtime startup lawyer in Silicon Valley who co-authored the new package. âIâve had numerous founder clients who made money and want to put their capital to good use through investing. But if they get more serious than personal angel investing, you refer them to a fund formation lawyer. Then they see the price and have to think twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Improvements include a streamlined list of definitions, simplified sections on management fees and triggers for limited operator mode, according to co-author <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richgora/">Rich Gora</a> of Gora LLC. The current document includes details for domiciling the firm in the United States with plans for other popular locations like Canada, the Netherlands and Singapore coming soon.</p>
<p>As a fund formation lawyer who works with a wide variety of investors, he says the goal is to help businesspeople work out business issues in plain terms. Once the parties have talked through what they want to agree to, they can take the product to an expert like himself to finalize.</p>
<p>âOver the last 10 months,â he says about the writing process, âwe looked at every single industry LP agreement we could find. We took concepts that would be 20 lines and distilled them into three. The concepts are there but the lawyer verbiage is gone.â</p>
<p>Ressi estimates that the new documents can cut legal costs in half or more, depending on factors like how many LPs you bring in. Thereâs also a shortage of lawyers with fund formation expertise, he notes. Providing standard documents will speed this process up and help the global venture capital ecosystem develop faster.</p>
<p>VC Lab was formed within the <a href="https://fi.co/">Founder Institute</a>, a global startup accelerator that has already made similar contributions to the startup ecosystem. Nearly nine years ago it helped develop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/thefunded-founder-institute-and-wilson-sonsini-debut-startup-friendly-seed-financing-vehicle-convertible-equity/">the concept of convertible equity</a>, a precursor to the SAFE note, which removes the debt elements from convertible notes.</p>
<p>âWe believe that all the bottlenecks need to be done away with,â Ressi says about startup investing. âThen, there will be an explosion of new VCs and new LPs all around the world who are entering the asset class. That will create a real positive change for humanity because, no matter where you are in the world, you can pursue an idea to make the world a better place and find the resources you need to make it a reality. Unfortunately, this is not true today.â</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 15, 2021! Happy Friday to you and yours; I am proud of us all for making it through a week that was more than hectic. Up top, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/final-hours-to-save-100-on-passes-to-tc-sessions-space-2021/">discounts end on our space event in very short order</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/f12-isnt-hacking-missouri-governor-threatens-to-prosecute-local-journalist-for-finding-exposed-state-data/">Missouri governor conflates journalism, hacking</a>:</strong> The United States is a large nation with many smart and many less-smart people. A story from the latter category ended up in our wheelhouse when a state governor decided that a journalist pointing out security flaws in an official website was malicious hacking. Perhaps stories like this are why so many Gen Z folks are doomers?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/instacart-shopper-activists-are-going-on-strike/">Instacart shoppers are going on strike</a>: </strong>Try to recall a time when some section of the Instacart workforce was happy and not either about to strike or on strike. Itâs hard, yeah? This Saturday, âsome Instacart shoppers will go on strike, protesting the companyâs low pay and lack of communication with its laborers,â TechCrunch reports. Letâs see if this particular piece of the larger Striketober saga ends up with worker-friendly results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/apple-removes-a-popular-quran-app-in-china-after-request-from-local-regulators/">Apple yanks Quran app after Chinese regulators ask</a>:</strong> The day after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">Microsoft announced</a> that it was going to pull LinkedInâs main service from China after failing to reconcile that countryâs government and its own views, Apple appears to have complied with a Chinese state request to remove âQuran Majeed, a popular app for reading the Islamic religious text and other prayer-related informationâ from the Chinese app store. This isnât a small act, given the Chinese stateâs <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/new-details-torture-cover-ups-china-s-internment-camps-revealed-n1270014">abuse of Muslims inside its borders</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Letâs take our time today in the world of startups, it being Friday and all.</p>
<p>First up, we have a great piece from <a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan">Rebecca Bellan</a> digging into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/meet-the-startups-changing-mobility-for-emerging-middle-classes/">host of startups that are helping emerging middle classes around the world get places</a>. This list includes, and I quote, âSwvl, Treepz, Jatri, SafeBoda, Urbvan, Chalo and Buser,â among others. If you are into the transportation tech beat, itâs a great read.</p>
<p>Next up, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andystinnes/">Andy Stinnes</a>, a general partner at Cloud Apps Capital Partners, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/the-venture-bull-market-is-great-for-founders-but-not-in-the-way-they-might-expect/">wrote an essay for the blog today</a> discussing that while the present-day venture capital bull market (more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">here</a>) is a general good for founders, âcloser inspection reveals that these trends are a lot more nuanced and apply very unequally across the funding continuum from seed to the late stage.â If you are looking to raise capital, itâs worth your time.</p>
<p>Moving along, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/tayhatmaker">Taylor Hatmaker</a> did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/core-manticore-metaverse-game-creation-hands-on/">yeomanâs work digging into Core</a>, a metaverse environment where she wandered around, finding the landscape to be both great-looking and âseamless.â If you want a peek into what could be the future of gaming and social interaction, this is for you.</p>
<p>And, before we get to the rest of our startup rundown, I wrote an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/an-interview-with-visionary-founder-ceo-on-large-unicorns-ipo-day/">imaginary interview with a made-up CEO concerning a fictional IPO</a>. For more context, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/an-interview-with-a-leading-venture-capitalist/">head here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/pandora-is-partnering-with-soundcloud-to-launch-a-new-station/">SoundCloud lands Pandora partnership, new radio station</a>:</strong> As Spotify grew to become a music behemoth, SoundCloud stuck closer to the underground. And it survived, which some didnât expect. Today, the upstart music service announced a deal with Pandora that could help bring it a bit more audience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/clubhouse-music-mode/">Clubhouse adds âmusic modeâ</a></strong>: Sticking to a musical theme for another measure or two, Clubhouse has built out a way for musicians to better stream their music live on the service. So, I suppose Clubhouse can now also be <a href="http://instantrimshot.com/">coffeehouse</a>?</li>
<li><strong>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/spot-ai-emerges-from-stealth-with-22m-with-a-platform-to-draw-out-more-intelligence-from-organizations-basic-security-videos/">Spot AI leaves stealth with its security cam search tool</a>:</strong> Flush with $22 million and freshly denuded of its âstealthâ tag, Spot AI is out in the public view today, which is fitting as its core product deals with security cameras and how they are ingested. The company âreadsâ footage from the devices, allowing the video itself to be searchable. Which is cool, if vaguely creepy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bringing it in-house: What to look for when hiring a general counsel</h2>
<p>Experienced lawyers may be drawn away from big firms to join a startup as general counsel for a variety of reasons, LinkSquaresâ chief legal officer Tim Parilla writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>âFor some, itâs an attempt to find a better work-life balance (whoops!), while others are eager to build and manage their own team or see it as an opportunity to work for a mission-driven company,â he writes.</p>
<p>For founders, itâs an opportunity to snag a seasoned professional who can build in-depth knowledge of your business &#8212; rather than relying on a generic (and costly) outside law firm.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">During the pandemic, we realized that we were swamped with work and overloaded with information. So we came up with an idea to fix that.</p>
<p>At Travelpayouts, we plan a strategy for a year, then each team plans iterations for every quarter, and within a quarter, we plan for two weeks ahead. By doing it this way, every day propels the company towards its goals.</p>
<p>However, unexpected challenges and tasks show up in all areas on a daily basis. For example, managers are sometimes overloaded with meetings that affect their productivity. So it is not surprising that some tasks just fall short of deadlines and accumulate over time.</p>
<p>To improve our productivity, we introduced a Getting Shit Done Day (GSDD): Our employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved (we encourage our employees to avoid social media on this day, but we are not looking over their shoulder). The goal of GSDD is to increase the amount of time we spend in deep work by minimizing distractions for one day every other week.</p>
<p>After two months of testing the GSDD in our marketing and business development departments, weâve seen some results. First, long-term projects, which took weeks before, began to wrap up earlier. Second, we were able to explore a few topics that we never got around to: For example, monetizing our own traffic through affiliate programs, effective outreach methods, and email marketing best practices.</p>
<p>Thanks to the GSDD, we have also delved into tasks that were otherwise sidelined:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix fired an employee who led the company&#8217;s trans employee resource group and planned a walkout on October 20, a current and former Netflix employee with knowledge of the situation confirmed to TechCrunch. The termination was first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle">reported by The Verge</a>.</p>
<p>Netflix workers planned the walkout to protest statements that its co-CEO Ted Sarandos made about Dave Chappelle&#8217;s recently released special, &#8220;The Closer.&#8221; The company claims<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723592/netflix-trans-employees-walkout-statements-ceo">Â </a>that it fired the employee in question because the company suspects that they leaked internal information.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,&#8221; a Netflix representative told TechCrunch. &#8220;We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218933" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The leaked information in question appears to be some internal metrics on &#8220;The Closer&#8221; that appeared in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">story by Bloomberg</a>, which reported that Netflix spent $24.1 million for the one-off special. Meanwhile, the company spent $3.9 million on Bo Burnham&#8217;s recent comedy special &#8220;Inside&#8221; and $21.4 million on the buzzy, nine-episode &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-says-squid-game-is-its-biggest-series-launch-ever?srnd=pursuits-vp">best-ever debut.</a></p>
<p>Earlier this month, as Netflix prepared to release &#8220;The Closer,&#8221; employees <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">raised concerns</a> about potentially harmful anti-trans jokes in the show &#8212; Chapelle goes as far as declaring that he&#8217;s &#8220;Team TERF,&#8221; referring to trans-exclusionary radical feminists, who conflate gender with biological sex and oppose the movement for transgender rights. When Netflix released the special on October 5 anyway, employees and Netflix subscribers alike lashed out against the streaming service.</p>
<p>The day after the special&#8217;s release, a trans software engineer at Netflix, Terra Field, tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1445914236668895236">viral thread</a> about the impact of anti-trans rhetoric. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Promoting TERF ideology (which is what we did by giving it a platform yesterday) directly harms trans people, it is not some neutral act. This is not an argument with two sides. It is an argument with trans people who want to be alive and people who don&#8217;t want us to be,&#8221; Field wrote.Â </span></p>

But Field was <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1448097310026747908">reinstated</a> the next day after finding that she didn&#8217;t try to attend the meeting with ill intent &#8212; in fact, a director had shared the link, leading her to think she could attend. But some Netflix employees were fed up, especially after co-CEO Ted Sarandos <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-defense-1235088647/">wrote in an email</a> to them that &#8220;content on screen doesn&#8217;t directly translate to real-world harm.&#8221; He continued, &#8220;we have &#8216;Sex Education,&#8217; &#8216;Orange Is the New Black,&#8217; &#8216;Control Z,&#8217; Hannah Gadsby and Dave Chappelle all on Netflix. Key to this is increasing diversity on the content team itself.&#8221;</div>
<p>A lesbian comedian celebrated for her Emmy-winning Netflix special &#8220;Nanette,&#8221; Hannah Gadsby spoke out against Sarandos&#8217; attempt to paint her as a figurehead for queer inclusivity at Netflix.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We are only in the first chapter of Latin Americaâs long journey to tech growth. But with the regionâs thirst for innovation, the market is expected to expand<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/"> nearly tenfold</a> over the next decade, with open banking through the use of APIs leading the way and acting as digital transformation facilitators.</p>
<p>With LatAm businesses and startups continuously integrating with new-age platforms and services, adopting an API-driven transformation strategy has become essential â as a result, the entire financial system is being âAPIfied.â</p>
<p>In other words, this open API ecosystem, in which third-party service providers access consumer data from financial institutions, means financial services will be optimized to lower costs and time spent on transactions and improve user experience.</p>
<p>The advantages of having open communication between different products and services are nearly infinite for credit scoring, moving money between bank accounts, and spanning verticals like the neobanks, credit providers, and personal finance products Latin Americans use every day.</p>
<p>In 2019, API usage was more mature in the<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/estrategias-con-apis-en-am%C3%A9rica-latina-y-tendencias-nicholas/"> financial and e-commerce</a> sectors, but it is now venturing into other areas such as marketing and insurance. <a href="https://www.delitosfinancieros.org/fintech-pagos-digitales-y-las-nuevas-herramientas-financieras-para-el-comercio-electronico-en-america-latina/">Fintech companies</a> are increasingly collaborating with traditional players like banks, payment agencies, insurance providers and stock exchanges. Cryptocurrency trading platforms and companies are also fighting for their space in the spotlight and have adopted API platforms to support crypto-assets since most of their operations are already digitized.</p>
<p>The API revolution seems well underway. So, whatâs next for LatAm?</p>
<h2>The key to tech penetration in LatAm: APIs</h2>
<p>Until recently, many traditional financial institutions and banks in LatAm were gatekeepers, with a bank account being the prerequisite for consumers to participate in the economy. And prior to the <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap112.pdf">advent of fintech</a>, these financial institutionsâ back-office infrastructures for risk management, credit decisions, and fraud detection involved manual effort and required cross-departmental coordination.</p>
<p>Each step was carried out by a person, from registering a user to the production of products and services. This often left customer data unexploited, increased transaction costs, impeded innovation and degraded customer experience.</p>
<p>As financial institutions grapple with digital transformation, <a href="https://www.fintechamericas.co/news/the-art-of-collaboration-how-banks-fintech-can-partner-for-success/">Andres Meta, VP at Grupo Bind</a> and co-founder of Arfintech, said many banks are partnering with fintechs or accessing technology-based products to create unique business models and stay relevant.</p>
<p>One way to revamp the back-office, lower costs and improve communication is to use APIs. This will enable access to information, improve consumption of products and services, and disrupt and de-structure established value chains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We can&#8217;t check out every investing outfit&#8217;s demo day. But one event that we try to catch every year is that of <a href="https://www.pear.vc/">Pear</a>, which is held annually each fall and features (blessedly) just a dozen or so very nascent startups.</p>
<p>Pear, a seed-stage venture firm founded in 2013, has an impressive track record when it comes to identifying promising companies from their earliest stages, including DoorDash, Gusto, Aurora Solar, Vanta, Branch Metrics and Guardant Health. As notably, despite introducing a far smaller number of teams to investors than Y Combinator and more renowned accelerator programs, there always seem to be at least one or two projects in Pear&#8217;s Demo Day mix that turn into actual, sustainable and, sometimes, sizable companies.</p>
<p>Consider that over seven previous &#8220;batches&#8221; that featured a collective 69 teams altogether, Pear has helped push into the market Xilis, which uses âmicro-organoidsâ to quickly make thousands of 3D replicas of a patientâs tumor that can then be tested for drug compatibility (it closed a <a href="https://www.precisiononcologynews.com/cancer/xilis-raises-70m-series-financing-support-miniature-organoid-platform-technology">$70 million</a> Series A round this summer); the relationship intelligence company Affinity (which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/affinity-a-relationship-intelligence-company-raises-80m-to-help-close-deals/">$80 million</a> in Series C funding last month), and Viz.ai, whose software helps doctors diagnose strokes and coordinate care (and whose funding now tops $150 million after closing its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-viz-ai-raises-71-million-in-new-funding-11615980601">most recent round</a> back in March). Pear has some others it can, and does, boast about, too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This year, the event, held this past Wednesday, shined a light on 13 of these very nascent teams. Pear also connected investors in attendance with five of its own portfolio companies that were just coming out of stealth mode. For those of you who might be interested in tracking emerging themes or actual investment opportunities, here&#8217;s a quick rundown of who pitched what (with the Pear-backed companies at the end of this list).</p>
<p>Note that we did not write the descriptions below. These were the exact pitches that the teams delivered straight to investors in attendance, so you&#8217;ll naturally spot a bit of hyperbole (because, startups).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.transcera.bio/"><strong>Transcera</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Hunter Globe (CEO), Wayne Lencer (Academic Co-Founder), Justin Wolfe (CSO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Biologic drugs have been one of the biggest revolutions in medicine of the last 30 years. Blockbuster biologics like Humira changed the way we treat chronic diseases, from Crohnâs Disease to cancer, and created a $375 billion market. But thereâs a problem. Biologics are large, complex molecules that are not naturally absorbed in the body. The way we get around this today is by injecting or infusing biologic drugs, so they can get more directly to the bloodstream. Many patients wonât stick with an injectable treatment long term. Others wonât take one at all. Pharma companies have been trying to enable oral absorption of large molecule drugs for years. These approaches donât work well, and result in very low levels of absorption &#8211; usually less than 1% of the total administered drug. We developed a better way &#8211; a platform that enables greater absorption of biologics following oral administration. After 30 years of research on cholera and how the bacteria infects the human body, Dr. Wayne Lencer, a Harvard Professor and Transcera co-founder, discovered a type of lipid which can carry larger molecules across the bodyâs cellular barriers. His lab at Boston Childrenâs Hospital synthesized and simplified these carriers to enhance absorption of biologic drugs. This is a platform technology which we plan to apply to many chronic diseases. But weâre starting with oral peptide drugs for diabetes and obesity.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://omniscientlabs.io"><strong>Omniscient Labs</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Andrew Fang (CTO), Jon Braatz (CEO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Omniscient Labâs geospatial image intelligence platform uses computer vision to automatically monitor locations, starting with defense and intelligence customers.

Omniscientâs platform detects equipment, facilities&#8217; and surfaces&#8217; historical patterns, while integrating with existing workflows. Theyâve received grants from the Air Force and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency that can lead to large contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://recorahealth.com"><strong>Recora</strong></a></p>
<p>Founder: Abhishek Chandra (CEO)</p>
<p>&#8220;One in three of us will die of heart disease â itâs time to change that.Recora is the enterprise platform for cardiac care. We help members recover from home after a heart attack. Right now, patients drive to a hospital to complete a recovery program. These facilities are 40 miles away and have 6 week wait times. So 96% of people donât finish and quickly get hospitalized again.<br />
Using video visits and connected devices, weâve designed a virtual cardiac recovery program. We ran a 200-patient pilot last year and showed 3x better outcomes. Today we cover 23,000 patients across 12 hospitals and are enrolling them at 220% month-over-month. Just these three contracts are a $46 million opportunity. Weâre on track to close 20 contracts in 26 states over the next twelve months, and corner a $10 billion market. Before Recora, we founded and scaled Spring Health, a $2 billion mental health platform. Now weâre redefining the future of heart health so that everyone can live a long, full, and optimal life.&#8221;</p>
