<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m a startup founder looking to expand in the U.S. I was originally looking at opening an office in Silicon Valley to be close to software engineers and investors, but then … COVID-19 :) </strong></p>
<p><strong>A lot has changed over the last year — can I still come?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Hopeful in Hungary</strong></p>
<p>Dear Hopeful:</p>
<p>How and where work is getting done in Silicon Valley (as well as in much of the world)  shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic. That said, yes, it can still make business sense for many to join the Silicon Valley ecosystem.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q1-2021-pitchbook-analyst-note-the-bay-area-still-holds-the-keys-to-vc?utm_medium=nl-na&amp;utm_source=reports&amp;utm_campaign=q1-2021-pitchbook-analyst-note-the-bay-area-still-holds-the-keys-to-vc&amp;sourceType=NEWSLETTER">a recent report from PitchBook</a>, Silicon Valley will continue to be the center for VC investment and high-tech talent, even though several large tech companies relocated out of Silicon Valley and implemented full-time work-from-home policies &#8212; and many predicted that “the Bay Area tech scene as we know it would be lost, and VC would find a new home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, while the pandemic’s impact on the venture industry will be felt in years to come, VC will continue to be centered in Silicon Valley. <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/063-immigration-global-mobility-working-from-home-and-the-future-of-work/">In a recent episode of my podcast</a>, I discussed work trends and how to use immigration to support company priorities as well as attract and retain talent in the United States.</p>
<p>The PitchBook report points out that Silicon Valley “has kept a tight hold on fundraising in the U.S., closing on commitments exceeding $151 billion over the past five years, more than the rest of the U.S. ecosystems combined. LPs have continued to funnel capital to area VCs because of the region’s track record of success, which includes 17 of the 22 U.S. companies to ever receive a private valuation of $10 billion or more.”</p>

<p>So while VCs will likely return to the old ways of networking and funding post-pandemic, we’ll see a hybrid of online and in-person meetings because there are so many benefits to in-person networking and exchanging ideas.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m sure I’m not the only one who had a minor meltdown on seeing that Slack had finally added the Connect feature it announced in October. I’m a firm believer that there are already entirely too many ways to get ahold of me. On top of the countless inbox pitches I field on a daily basis, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook have contributed to the barrage &#8212; and Clubhouse seems to be elbowing its way in.</p>
<p>Surely not Slack, too? That bastion of workplace productivity and Simpsons gifs has (mostly) been a safe haven. Today, the company added Connect, promising, “Employees at more than 74,000 organizations and counting can now securely direct message anyone – inside or outside their company.”</p>
<p>A convenient new resource for open communications? Or a Pacific Rim-style breach waiting to send a never-ending barrage of horrors into your workplace chat? Obviously that depends on a lot of things &#8212; including who you are and what you do. We have, however, reached out to Slack to get clarification on a few things, including just how open workplaces across the world will be to the aforementioned 74,000 organizations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A]n organization’s IT admins can control who has access to this feature, disable this feature for their teams, and monitor all external connections, including Slack Connect DMs. Once this feature is enabled, DMs can be initiated without the need for additional admin approval. If an organization has disabled Slack Connect DMs, their users cannot send or accept Slack Connect DM invitations. If an organization has limited the ability to accept Slack Connect DMs to those coming from verified organizations, their users will not be able to accept Slack Connect DMs from non-verified organizations. This will also help in preventing spam and phishing attempts.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the feature is opt-in, not opt-out. If the IT admins don’t turn the feature on, their users won’t be able to either send or receive DMs through the new system. One of the upshots of the feature is third-party app integration through services like Calendly (for scheduling) and DocuSign (for, erm, document signing).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve all heard the adage, less is more. But when it comes to learning all the complex ins and outs of building and launching a successful startup, more is definitely the way to go. Enter not one, but two bootcamp experiences for the early-stage crowd: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage: Operations and Fundraising</a> on April 1-2 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising</a> on July 8-9.</p>
<p>Here’s another relevant adage: A penny saved is a penny earned. Kill two adages with one click, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">buy a dual-event pass at the early-bird price</a> and you’ll save $100 or more. More knowledge for less money — what’s not to love?</p>
<p><strong>Big, fat caveat:</strong> Procrastinate at your own peril. Prices on dual-event passes go up this <strong>Friday, March 26 at precisely 11:59 pm (PST).</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both TC Early Stage events focus on the essential skills every founder needs to succeed, and you’ll learn from leading industry experts. Each bootcamp features a discrete set of speakers, range of topics and presentations, but they&#8217;re all dedicated to helping founders in the early stages of the startup journey build a solid foundation.</p>
<p>We have a tremendously talented group of people ready to share their expertise and experience with you. Check out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#b0807dca-a87a-47e9-903a-86c80adef221">TC Early Stage agenda for April</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has clearly had an impact on the way we work, and this is especially true for salespeople. <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> introduced a number updates to Sales Cloud this morning including Salesforce Meetings, a smart overlay for Zoom meetings that gives information and advice to the sales team as they interact with potential customers in online meetings.</p>
<p>Bill Patterson, EVP and General Manager of CRM applications at Salesforce says that the company wanted to help sales teams manage these types of interactions better and take advantage of the fact they are digital.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a broad recognition, not just from Salesforce, but really from every sales organization that selling is forever changed, and I think that there&#8217;s been a broad understanding, and maybe a surprise in learning how effective we can be in the from anywhere kind of times, whether that&#8217;s in office or not in office or whatever,&#8221; Patterson explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Salesforce Meetings gives that overlay of information, whether it&#8217;s advice to slow down the pace of your speech or information about the person speaking. It can also compile action items and present a To Do list to participants at the end of each meeting to make sure that tasks don&#8217;t fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>This is made possible in part through the Einstein intelligence layer that is built across the entire Salesforce platform. In this case, it takes advantage of a new tool called Einstein Intelligent Insights, which the company is also exposing as a feature for developers to build their own solutions using this tool.</p>
<p>For sales people who might find the tool a bit too invasive, you can dial the confidence level of the information up or down on an individual basis, so that you can get a lot of information or a little depending on your needs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uWgPfIFYkD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=uWgPfIFYkD" data-secret="uWgPfIFYkD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For now, it works with Zoom and the company has been working closely with the Zoom development team to provide the API and SDK tooling it needs to pull something like this off, according to Patterson. He notes that plans are in the works to make it compatible with WebEx and Microsoft Teams in the future.</p>
<p>While the idea was in the works prior to the pandemic, COVID created a sense of urgency for this kind of feature, as well as other features announced today like Pipeline Inspection, which uses AI to analyze the sales pipeline. It searches for changes to deals over time with the goal of finding the ones that could benefit most from coaching or managerial support to get them over the finish line.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials says that this ability to capture information in online meetings is changing the way we think about CRM.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing the caught my attention is how tightly integrated video meetings/collaboration is now into sales process. This is really compelling because meeting interactions that may not find their way into the CRM system are now automatically captured,&#8221; Leary told me.</p>
<p>Salesforce Meetings is available today, while Pipeline Inspection is expected to be available this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Covering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/bevy-raises-40m-series-c-with-20-coming-from-black-investors/">YC Demo Day</a> yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/">was good fun</a>, but I missed a few items while watching several hundred startup pitches. A few years ago, these stories might have been the biggest news of the week.</p>
<p>But with the venture capital market redlining its engines while public markets remain sympathetic to growing, unprofitable companies, there&#8217;s lots going on. So, as a follow-up to our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/discords-10b-exit-compass-and-intermedia-cloud-communications-set-ipo-price-ranges/">first late-stage roundup</a> that we published yesterday morning, here&#8217;s another.</p>

<hr />
<p>This time we&#8217;re discussing IPO news from DigitalOcean (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/olo-raises-ipo-range-as-digitalocean-sees-possible-5b-debut-valuation/">context</a>), Kaltura (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/kaltura-files-to-go-public-on-the-back-of-accelerating-revenue-growth-rising-losses/">context</a>), Robinhood (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">context</a>) and Zymergen, and big rounds for Lattice and goPuff. That&#8217;s a lot to chew on, but I&#8217;ll be brief and to the point.</p>

Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>IPO updates</h2>
<p>Today&#8217;s most pressing news is that <strong>DigitalOcean</strong>, a provider of cloud services to small businesses, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/digitalocean-ipo-prices-at-47-a-share-high-end-of-range-2021-03-24">priced its IPO</a> at $47 per share last night. That was right at the top of its public-offering price range of $44 to $47. Before counting shares reserved for its underwriters, DigitalOcean is worth just under $5 billion.</p>
<p>And the company raised a gross $775.5 million in the offering, giving DigitalOcean a massive war chest to pursue its vision. As the company has proved increasingly unprofitable on a GAAP basis in recent years, the extra cash isn&#8217;t a problem: DigitalOcean plans to reduce its aggregate debt load with some of the proceeds, which will improve its profitability.</p>
<p>The company won&#8217;t trade for hours, so we&#8217;re done with DigitalOcean for now. File it in your mind as a win, as the company raised $50 million last year at a $1.1 billion valuation (<a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>). That&#8217;s a quick 5x.</p>
<p>Next up from the IPO treadmill is <strong>Kaltura</strong>, which released a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001432133/000162828021005315/kalturas-1a1.htm">first guess</a> of its market value as a public company. Targeting $14 to $16 per share in its impending debut, the video software company is worth around $2 billion at the top end of its range, not counting shares reserved for its underwriting banks or other shares tied up in vested options and recruited stock units (RSUs).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plaid, the fintech giant, has announced the inaugural cohort of startups in its new accelerator program, FinRise.</p>
<p>The equity-free and capital-free program has chosen five early-stage fintech startups out of 100 applications to join its cohort, working on issues central to the financial services industry such as simplifying payments and access to credit. The accelerator, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/plaid-launches-finrise-an-incubator-for-underrepresented-fintech-founders/">announced two months ago</a>, is explicitly focused on backing underrepresented founders in tech.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Last week, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/altimeter-to-lead-plaid-deal-after-scrapped-visa-merger">reported</a> that Plaid is nearing a new financing deal that would value the company at between $10 billion to $15 billion. Beyond a high valuation, Plaid sports a key characteristic that positions it well to help early-stage startups: it has gone through regulatory hurdles. Months ago, Plaid announced it would not merge with Visa in what would have been a $5.3 billion dollar acquisition. This event, as well as advice on how privat fintech startups can deal with policy issues, will be part of FinRise programming.</p>
<p>While participants don’t get funding, FinRise has collated a number of “capital access partners” which basically means investors who are committed to meeting with these companies and potentially writing a check. This network includes Accion, Acrew, Amex Ventures, Flourish, Harlem Capital, Kapor, Matrix, Village Capital, Visible Hands, and First Round.</p>
<h3>Here’s a look at the five startups:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://com">Global Data Consortium</a> </strong>is building a process for global digital identity verification for businesses. Co-founded by Bill Spruill and Charles Gaddy, the startup is building a data supplier network of more than 200 sources to help build a standard of processes around digital identity verification. “As we continue to scale our platform it’s important to make sure our technical infrastructure continues to be enterprise-ready. Plaid’s engineering expertise and knowledge will prove useful to our team to help us plan and execute around our next level of service support architecture,” Spruill told TechCrunch.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.guidefi.com/about-us">Guidefi</a></strong> is a marketplace focused on connecting communities of color to culturally-savvy financial advisors. Led by Charlene Fadirepo, the financial wellness startup doesn’t charge for matches to advisors, but only begins pricing once services begini.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.ofcolor.com/">OfColor</a></strong> wants to be the go-to enterprise wellness platform for employees of color. Founder Yemi Rose tells TechCrunch that “a lot of companies we encounter generally pride themselves on being colorblind in their HR benefit practices, in spite of outcomes that show a different approach is needed&#8230;our biggest hurdle is education.” The startup focuses on features like a personalized financial manager as well as loans that allow employees to maximize their 401(k) contribution.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.hellowalnut.com/">Walnut</a></strong> is a point-of-sale lending platform that wants to make healthcare more affordable for patients. Roshan Patel, founder and CEO of the startup, says that its biggest competitor is PrimaHealth Credit, which focuses on elective care. “Walnut is care-agnostic: no matter where you are in the healthcare system, you can use Walnut to break up your bill into an installment plan that works for you. That can be at the dentist or cosmetic surgery practice, but it can also be in the emergency room or at your primary care physician,” he said.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.askzeta.com/">Zeta</a></strong> wants to build a better joint-bank experience for the modern couple. F<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/zeta-joint-card-seed/">irst covered by TechCrunch in February</a>, Zeta has already raised $1.5 million in venture funding to create a platform that makes it easier to join accounts and split purchases. “In some ways, we see ourselves as part of a replacement for Venmo,” CEO and co-founder Aditi Shekar said. “We saw couples Venmoing back and forth to each other sometimes six times a day…we want to take over your money chores.” While Zeta is entering the market as a tool for couples, Shekar sees the startup’s moonshot as being the go-to operational account for any modern household.</li>

But it’s rapidly becoming more efficient as machine learning is applied to the whole business model. Indeed, in the UK alone $60bn is spent a year on using outside expertise.

<p>Now Barcelona-based <a href="http://Arbolus.com">Arbolus</a> has raised a $6m funding round led by early-stage UK VC Fuel Ventures, in addition to Plug and Play, better known in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The 3-year old startup claims it has seen a 7x growth YoY and now has offices in Barcelona and New York. It’s also appointed Pau Beltran at CTO, who was formerly of Disney, eDreams, OneMind and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Arbolus’ approach to ‘enterprise knowledge,’ as it’s known, is employing natural language processing and an AI backbone to its platform.</p>
<p>Whereas ProSapient uses technology to make expert sourcing more efficient, Arbolus captures recordings of expert interviews, transcribes them on its platform, and then shares that knowledge within companies’ networks that subscribe to the platform.</p>
<p>Companies using the platform pay fees to actually use the software, and use all of the toolsets that are on there. It also makes transaction fees when companies pay independent experts on its platform.</p>
<p>Sam Glasswell, CEO and co-founder of Arbolus, said in a statement: “Having the right information gives you a competitive edge but the typical means of engaging with experts through one-hour calls alone is failing to deliver value. These interviews are usually held by a single department and their findings end up lost in PowerPoint presentations or reports. Therefore, companies are only building up a short-term view. We are bringing innovation to the ways companies are working with external experts by using groundbreaking technology to, not just build expertise within organizations, but deliver it in ways that are digestible, searchable and, most importantly, usable for the months and years ahead across different departments.”</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, Managing Partner from Fuel Ventures added: “Arbolus have done amazing things in its first 24 months and it&#8217;s a testament to the entrepreneurial ambition of Sam and Will backed up by their experience of helping to scale a $1bn company in their former lives.”</p>
<p>Arbolus says it is working with more than 80 customers, including Big Four firms such as KPMG, and startups like UiPath.</p>
<p>Founders Sam Glasswell and Will Leeming scaled an expert agency before this startup and realized a lot of knowledge was being lost in these expert networks because it simply wasn’t being captured in the right way. And they decided to base the company in Barcelona because it was able to attract talent and had all the advantages of being in the EU.</p>
<p>Glasswell told me: “In Barcelona we have an awesome office, our own space, a great team it&#8217;s certainly a beautiful city, and we&#8217;re able to attract really really top talent. I mean, people will move from anywhere in the world to go to Barcelona. It&#8217;s probably been one of the biggest success factors for us so far. Does the EU factor, help? Yes, I mean the fact that is in the EU in the trading bloc of the union does help… and we thought we&#8217;d just be able to build a much more culturally diverse team in the long run.”</p>
<p>Certainly, the future of work looks like it is shifting towards one where outside experts are used more and more by companies. If the gig economy has affected your pizza delivery, it’s also affecting the knowledge economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://breega.com">Breega</a>, a VC firm based in Paris, has announced the final closing of its third fund. The firm has managed to raise $130 million (€110 million).</p>
<p>This is Breega’s third fund and is officially called Breega Capital Venture 3. The firm’s previous fund launched in 2015 with €45 million ($53 million at today’s exchange rate).</p>
<p>Breega doesn’t focus on a vertical in particular. It says it can invest across many different categories, such as marketplaces, SaaS, agtech, HR tech, robotics, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment team has already deployed some of the capital of Breega’s new fund. Portfolio startups include Stations-e, Trustpair, IoTerop, BeOp, Otodo, Humanity, Alice&amp;Bob, Neobrain, Didomi, Ubble, Ponicode and reciTAL. They all have received some funding at the seed or Series A stage.</p>
<p>Breega believes it can support its portfolio companies with some operational help. The firm has its own team of experts when it comes to HR, business development, communications, legal and finance.</p>
<p>Some of the fund’s limited partners include entrepreneurs-turned-business-angles. For instance, Patrick Asdaghi, the co-founder of FoodChéri, has invested in the new fund. FoodChéri received some funding from Breega before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/10/sodexo-acquires-majority-stake-in-french-online-restaurant-foodcheri/">getting acquired</a> by Sodexo.</p>
<p>Other limited partners include Bpifrance, the European Investment Fund, Isomer Capital, several banks and insurance companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/poshmark/">Poshmark</a> has come a long way over the last decade. Launched in 2011, the social fashion marketplace has raised upwards of $150 million, and has now listed on the public markets. It&#8217;s valued at $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>But well before all the success, Mayfield&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/goshposh-its-been-a-ten-year-journey-to-ipo-tales-from-partnering-with-poshmark/">Navin Chaddha saw the potential</a>, leading the Series A for the company.</p>
<p>On our next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Chaddha and Poshmark founder and CEO Manish Chandra to discuss going from Series A to public company. (Registration info is at the bottom of this post.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chandra is a triple-threat executive. He has degrees in marketing, business and computer science, and is a serial entrepreneur who sold his previous company, Kaboodle, to Hearst in 2007. The introduction of the iPhone inspired him to think about the coming shift in consumer behavior, paving the way for an idea like Poshmark to thrive. As is so often the case, what seems obvious in hindsight was incredibly insightful at the time.</p>
<p>The brilliance wasn&#8217;t at all lost on Chaddha, an entrepreneur in his own right. Now, Chaddha leads Mayfield, a firm with $2.5 billion in assets under management. Of the 50 companies he&#8217;s invested in during his venture capital career, 17 have gone public and 24 have been acquired. In other words, it makes sense that he has made an appearance on the Forbes Midas list 12 times.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Chandra and Chaddha about the process of fundraising from the early stage to the growth stage and beyond. But more importantly, we&#8217;ll talk about how a company has to adapt in order to be successful over time.</p>
<p>Plus, Chandra and Chaddha will take a look at pitch decks submitted by the audience and give their live feedback. If you&#8217;re wondering how to perfect your deck, there may be no more valuable resource than the advice of this founder/investor duo.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ketch.com">Ketch</a>, a startup aiming to help businesses navigate the increasingly complex world of online privacy regulation and data compliance, is announcing that it has raised $23 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The company is also officially coming out of stealth. I actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/ketch-privacy-grader/">wrote about Ketch&#8217;s free PrivacyGrader tool</a> last year, but now it&#8217;s revealing the broader vision, as well as the products that businesses will actually be paying for.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by CEO Tom Chavez and CTO Vivek Vaidya. The pair previously founded Krux, a data management platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/to-beef-up-in-marketing-tech-salesforce-is-buying-krux-for-340m-in-cash-and-stock-potentially-750m-overall/">acquired by Salesforce</a> in 2016, and Vaidya told me that Ketch is the answer to a question that they&#8217;d begun to ask themselves: &#8220;What kind of infrastructure can we build that will make our former selves better?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chavez said that Ketch is designed to help businesses automate the process of remaining compliant with data regulations, wherever their visitors and customers are. He suggested that with geographically specific regulations like Europe&#8217;s GDPR in place, there&#8217;s a temptation to comply globally with the most stringent rules, but that&#8217;s not necessary or desirable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s possible to use data to grow and to comply with the regulations,&#8221; Chavez said. &#8220;One of our customers turned off digital marketing completely in order to comply. This has got to stop [&#8230;] They are a very responsible customer, but they didn’t know there are tools to navigate this complexity.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129650" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129650" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129650" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?w=680" alt="Ketch orchestration screenshot" width="680" height="362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129650" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ketch</p></div></p>
<p>The pair also suggested that things are even more complex than you might think, because true compliance means going beyond the &#8220;Hollywood facade&#8221; of a privacy banner — it requires actually implementing a customer&#8217;s requests across multiple platforms. For example, Vaidya said that when someone unsubscribes to your email list, there&#8217;s &#8220;a complex workflow that needs to be executed that to ensure that the email is not going to continue &#8230; and make sure the customer&#8217;s choices are respected in a timely manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, Chavez noted, if a customer tells you, &#8220;I want to delete my data,&#8221; and yet they keep getting marketing emails or targeted ads, they&#8217;re not going to be satisfied if you say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve handled that in the four walls of my own business, that&#8217;s an issue with my marketing and email partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chavez also said that Ketch isn&#8217;t designed to replace any of a business&#8217; existing marketing and customer data tools, but rather to &#8220;allow our customers to configure how they want to comply vis-a-vis what jurisdiction they&#8217;re operating in.&#8221; For example, the funding announcement includes a statement from Patreon&#8217;s legal counsel Priya Sanger describing Ketch as &#8220;an easily configurable consent management and orchestration system that was able to be deployed internationally&#8221; that &#8220;required minimal engineering time to integrate into our systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the Series A, it comes from CRV, super{set} (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/superset/">the startup studio founded by Chavez and Vaidya</a>), Ridge Ventures, Acrew Capital and Silicon Valley Bank. CRV&#8217;s Izhar Armony and Acrew&#8217;s Theresia Gouw are joining Ketch&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;d like to learn more about the product, Ketch is <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://content.ketch.com/nextgenerationconsentwebinar&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1616598611111000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2G1Ixbn6VAaBNVZgc0zCCh">hosting a webinar</a> at 11am Pacific today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Coinbase is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">about to go public</a> in the U.S., another cryptocurrency company is having a blockbuster first quarter of 2021. <a href="https://www.blockchain.com">Blockchain.com</a>, the company behind a popular cryptocurrency wallet, an exchange, a block explorer and more, has <a href="https://medium.com/blockchain/blockchain-com-raises-300m-series-c-led-by-dst-vy-capital-lightspeed-79d3259937f2">raised</a> a $300 million Series C round.</p>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention, you may remember that I wrote about Blockchain.com last month. At the time, the company announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/crypto-wallet-and-exchange-company-blockchain-com-raises-120-million/">a $120 million funding round</a>. In other words, the company is raising <em>once again</em> just a few weeks after its previous funding round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="holhON9Mc3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/crypto-wallet-and-exchange-company-blockchain-com-raises-120-million/">Crypto wallet and exchange company Blockchain.com raises $120 million</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This time, DST Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners and VY Capital are leading the round. Existing investors also participated. Following today’s funding round, the company has reached a post-money valuation of $5.2 billion.</p>
<p>Originally named Blockchain.info, the company first launched a blockchain explorer. If you’re not familiar with the blockchain industry, an explorer lets you enter the hash of any transaction that occurs on a blockchain to get more information — you can retrieve the transaction amount, the number of confirmations, the wallet addresses of the sender and the reveiver, etc.</p>
<p>But Blockchain.com is better known for its open-source wallet. The company offers a noncustodial wallet, which means that you’re in control of your private keys. Blockchain.com can’t directly access your funds.</p>
<p>31 million users have verified their identities on Blockchain.com. The number of active users have tripled over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Blockchain.com has diversified its activities over time. It has launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/blockchain-the-company-launches-an-exchange-the-pit/">an exchange</a> so that you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies from Blockchain.com directly. The startup also offers services to institutional investors. Blockchain.com can help you when it comes to buying and selling cryptocurrencies, custody, large over-the-counter transactions, etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to revenue, “Blockchain.com is highly profitable across each of our business lines,” co-founder and CEO Peter Smith <a href="https://medium.com/blockchain/blockchain-com-raises-300m-series-c-led-by-dst-vy-capital-lightspeed-79d3259937f2">wrote</a>. The new influx of funding is all about working with late-stage investors and growing rapidly. You can expect some Blockchain.com acquisitions down the road for instance.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, the Equity team brought on <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/shl">Sahil Lavingia</a> and <a href="https://www.hustlefund.vc/">Hustle Fund</a> General Partner <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33">Elizabeth Yin</a> to talk about equity crowdfunding. It’s been about a week since the SEC increased the equity crowdfunding cap from $1.07 million to $5 million, creating the perfect opportunity to go beyond the dollar amount and understand how the change impacts founders, venture capitalists, retail investors, and future fund managers.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief rundown of the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>We talk about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/will-new-sec-equity-crowdfunding-rules-encourage-more-founders-to-pass-the-hat/">the basics of this new SEC regulation</a>, and understand which platforms might be leading the pack for these bootstrapped campaigns. Indiegogo’s founder wrote a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/a-report-card-for-the-secs-new-equity-crowdfunding-rules/">n op-ed grading the new regulations</a> on the site.</li>
<li>Some banter on Gumroad’s 12-hour campaign that led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/gumroad-wants-to-make-equity-crowdfunding-mainstream/">a successfully crowdsourced $5 million for the company</a>. Lavingia talks about his decision to crowdfund a round in his company, why it made sense for the company, and what it will take to make this raise mainstream.</li>
<li>Of course, Yin shared a ton of helpful nuggets around crowdfunding, providing a venture capital perspective that was still bullish on growing the amount of check-writers in the ecosystem. Some recent equity crowdfunding campaigns have shown that there are thousands of individuals willing to fund the enterprises they want to see succeed. Juked.gg is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/how-vcs-and-founders-see-2021-differently/">one such example</a>.</li>
<li>There are also notes on the Testing the Waters dynamic that could usher some wiggle room to early-stage founders thinking about this.</li>
<li>Will equity crowdfunding supplant venture capital, or will it merely augment it? Our discussion leads us to ponder both possibilities. What seems clear is that equity crowdfunding could widen the band of companies that are &#8220;backable,&#8221; if not the band of companies that traditional venture capital players find enticing.</li>
<li>And we end with a whole bunch of meta debates, from the role of the platform in vetting campaigns. As with every innovation, including crowdfunding itself, there will be fraud and failure. But if there will be enough bad news to limit consumer interest is far from certain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of those nerdy topics that gets us really excited about the future of dollar allocation and startup creation. We hope you love the show and leave with a better understanding of what’s ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, former Glossier executives Henry Davis and Bryan Mahoney <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2020/03/10/ex-glossier-exec-turns-customers-into-partners-with-new-personal-care-startup/?sh=5c0540161045">unveiled a new e-commerce startup called Arfa</a>. Today, they&#8217;re announcing a new vision for the company, along with a new name, new funding and an acquisition.</p>
<p>The name first: Moving forward, the New York startup will be known as <a href="https://chord.co/">Chord</a>, which Davis (Chord&#8217;s chairman and COO) said reflects the fact that the startup is now &#8220;exclusively focused on our technology offering,&#8221; rather than on launching its own direct-to-consumer brands. (Davis also said that Chord will be sharing more news around plans for its existing brands soon.)</p>
<p>Mahoney (Chord&#8217;s CEO) said the platform provides brands with &#8220;commerce as a service.&#8221; In other words, as a business moves into the world of headless commerce (where they buy e-commerce infrastructure that&#8217;s separate from the front-end experience), Chord is designed to provide all of their needs, across multiple products and features including content management, a customer data platform and order management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Davis suggested that due to issues like insufficient data infrastructure and increasingly complex, multi-channel businesses, &#8220;Operators have been forced to make compromises and tradeoffs on their core business. We want to get rid of that as a concept. Your tech stack is here to support you.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?w=680" alt="Chord founders" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129627" class="wp-caption-text">Chord founders Henry Davis and Bryan Mahoney</p></div></p>
<p>And while there are certainly plenty of other headless commerce startups, when you look across the e-commerce landscape, Davis said, &#8220;Everyone’s fighting with same tools to do the same thing. Rather that bring another headless solution to access those same tools, we wanted to bring along an offering that made you differentiated and better.&#8221;</p>
<p>As one example of how Chord is different, Mahoney said that its customer data platform is something &#8220;we bake into everything we do,&#8221; offering &#8220;a single analytical layer&#8221; that&#8217;s collecting data across the platform.</p>
<p>The startup has also acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/yaguara-nabs-7-2m-seed-to-help-e-commerce-companies-understand-customers-better/">Denver-based e-commerce data startup Yaguara</a> for an undisclosed sum. With the Yaguara team joining Chord, Davis said the startup will be able to &#8220;double down&#8221; on data and data visualization.</p>
<p>And, as mention, the company has also raised an $18 million Series A, bringing its total funding to $25 million,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arfa/company_financials"> according to Crunchbase</a>. The round was led by Eclipse Ventures.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mahoney said the company&#8217;s vision is to &#8220;be known as the Stripe of headless commerce — the way that they have built the infrastructure powering payments on the internet, we want to power headless commerce.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might expect that a startup that makes community building software would be thriving during a pandemic when it&#8217;s so difficult for us to be together. And <a href="http://bevy.com/">Bevy</a>, a company whose product powers community sites like <a href="https://trailblazers.salesforce.com/">Salesforce Trailblazers</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdg">Google Developers</a> announced it has raised a $40 million Series C this morning, at least partly due to the growth related to that dynamic.</p>
<p>The round was led by Accel with participation from Upfront Ventures, Qualtrics co-founder Ryan Smith and LinkedIn, but what makes this investment remarkable is that it included 25 Black investors representing 20% of the investment.</p>
<p>One of those investors, James Lowery, who is a management consultant and entrepreneur, and was the first Black employee hired at McKinsey in 1968, sees the opportunity for this approach to be a model to attract investment from other under-represented groups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I know for a fact because of my friendship and my network that there are a lot of people, if they had the opportunity to invest in opportunities like this, they will do it, and they have the money to do it. And I think we can be the model for the nation,&#8221; Lowery said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of Black VC investment in startups like Bevy. In fact, only around <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/campaigns/us/audit/survey/diversity-venture-capital-human-capital-survey-dashboard.html">3% of venture capitalists</a> are Black and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/81-of-vc-firms-dont-have-a-single-black-investor-blck-vc-plans-on-changing-that/">81% of VC firms</a> don&#8217;t have a single Black investor.</p>
<p>Kobie Fuller, who is general Partner at investor Upfront Ventures, a Bevy board member and runs his own community called <a href="https://valence.community/">Valence</a>, says that investments like this can lead to a flywheel effect that can lead to increasing Black investment in startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;So for me, it&#8217;s about how do we get more Black investors on cap tables of companies early in their lifecycle before they go public, where wealth can be created. How do we get key members of executive teams being Black executives who have the ability to create wealth through options and equity. And how do we also make sure that we have proper representation on the boards of these companies, so that we can make sure that the CEOs and the C suite is held accountable towards the diversity goals,&#8221; Fuller said.</p>
<p>He sees a software platform like Bevy that facilitates community as a logical starting point for this approach, and the company needs to look like the broader communities it serves. &#8220;Making sure that our workforce is appropriately represented from a perspective of having appropriate level of Black employees to the board to the actual investors is just good business sense,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But the diversity angle doesn&#8217;t stop with the investor group. Bevy CEO and co-founder Derek Anderson says that last May when George Floyd was killed, his firm didn&#8217;t have a single person of color among the company&#8217;s 27 employees and not a single Black investor in his cap table. He wanted to change that, and he found that in diversifying, it not only was the right thing to do from a human perspective, it was also from a business one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that if we really started including people from the Black and Brown communities inside of Bevy that the collective bar of a talent was going to go up. We were going to look from a broader pool of candidates, and what we found as we&#8217;ve done this is that as the culture has started to change, the customer satisfaction is going up, our profits and our revenues &#8212; the trajectory is going up &#8212; and I see this thing is completely correlated,&#8221; Anderson said.</p>
<p>Last summer the company set a two year goal to get to 20% of employees being Black. While the number of employees is small, Bevy went from zero to 5% in June, 10% by September. Today it is just under 15% and expects to hit the 20% goal by summer, a year ahead of the goal it set last year.</p>

<p>Bevy grew out of a community called Startup Grind that Anderson started several years ago. Unable to find software to run and manage the community, he decided to build it himself. In 2017, he spun that product into a separate company that became Bevy, and he has raised $60 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>In addition to Salesforce and Google, other large enterprises are using Bevy to power their communities and events including Adobe, Atlassian, Twilio, Slack and Zendesk.</p>
<p>Today, the startup is valued at $325 million, which is 4x the amount it was valued at when it raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/bevy-series-b/">its $15 million Series B</a> in May 2019. It expects to reach $30 million in ARR by the end of this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early this month Google quietly began trials of &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217;: Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">planned replacement</a> adtech for tracking cookies, as it works toward phasing out support for third party cookies in the Chrome browser &#8212; testing a system to reconfigure the dominant web architecture by replacing individual ad targeting with ads that target groups of users (aka Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLoCs), and which &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">it loudly contended </a>&#8212; will still generate a fat upside for advertisers.</p>
<p>There are a number of gigantic questions about this plan. Not least whether targeting groups of people who are non-transparently stuck into algorithmically computed interest-based buckets based on their browsing history is going to reduce the harms that have come to be widely associated with behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>If your concern is online ads which discriminate against protected groups or seek to exploit vulnerable people (e.g. those with a gambling addiction), FLoCs may very well just serve up more of the abusive same. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">EFF</a> has, for example, called FLoCs a &#8220;terrible idea&#8221;, warning the system may amplify problems like discrimination and predatory targeting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Advertisers also query whether FLoCs will really generate like-for-like revenue, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">Google claims</a>.</p>
<p>Competition concerns are also closely dogging Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">under investigation by UK antitrust regulators</a> &#8212; and has drawn scrutiny from the US Department of Justice too, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google-exclusive-idUSKBN2BA10I">Reuters</a> reported recently.</p>
<p>Adtech players complain the shift will merely increase Google&#8217;s gatekeeper power over them by blocking their access to web users&#8217; data even as Google can continue to track its own users &#8212; leveraging that first party data alongside a new moat they claim will keep them in the dark about what individuals are doing online. (Though whether it will <em>actually</em> do that is not at all clear.)</p>
<p>Antitrust is of course a convenient argument for the adtech industry to use to strategically counter the prospect of privacy protections for individuals. But competition regulators on both sides of the pond are concerned enough over the power dynamics of Google ending support for tracking cookies that they&#8217;re taking a closer look.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the question of privacy itself &#8212; which obviously merits close scrutiny too.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zhQ4X3MH6q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/google-renounces-ad-tracking/">Google says it won&#8217;t adopt new tracking tech after phasing out cookies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google says it won&#8217;t adopt new tracking tech after phasing out cookies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/google-renounces-ad-tracking/embed/#?secret=zhQ4X3MH6q" data-secret="zhQ4X3MH6q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google&#8217;s sales pitch for the &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; is evident in its choice of brand name &#8212; which suggests its keen to push the perception of a technology that protects privacy.</p>
<p>This is Google&#8217;s response to the rising store of value being placed on protecting personal data &#8212; after years of data breach and data misuse scandals.</p>
<p>A terrible reputation now dogs the tracking industry (or the &#8220;data industrial complex&#8221;, as Apple likes to denounce it) &#8212; as a result of high profile scandals like Kremlin-fuelled voter manipulation in the US but also just the demonstrable dislike web users have of being ad-stalking around the Internet. (Very evident in the ever increasing use of tracker- and ad-blockers; and in the response of other web browsers which have adopted a number of anti-tracking measures years ahead of Google-owned Chrome).</p>
<p>Given Google&#8217;s hunger for its Privacy Sandbox to be perceived as pro-privacy it&#8217;s perhaps no small irony, then, that it&#8217;s not actually running these origin tests of FLoCs in Europe &#8212; where the world&#8217;s most stringent and comprehensive online privacy laws apply.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/google-will-not-run-floc-origin-tests-in-europe-due-to-gdpr-concerns/">AdExchanger</a> reported yesterday on comments made by a Google engineer d<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">uring a meeting of the Improving Web Advertising Business Group at the World Wide Web Consortium on Tuesday. </span>“For countries in Europe, we will not be turning on origin trials [of FLoC] for users in EEA [European Economic Area] countries,” <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Michael Kleber is reported to have said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TechCrunch had a confirm from Google in early March that this is the case. </span>&#8220;Initially, we plan to begin origin trials in the US and plan to carry this out internationally (including in the UK / EEA) at a later date,&#8221; a spokesman told us earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we’ve shared, we are in active discussions with independent authorities &#8212; including privacy regulators and the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority &#8212; as with other matters they are critical to identifying and shaping the best approach for us, for online privacy, for the industry and world as a whole,&#8221; he added then.</p>
<p>At issue here is the fact that Google has chosen to auto-enrol sites in the FLoC origin trials &#8212; rather than getting manual sign ups which would have offered a path for it to implement a consent flow.</p>
<p>And lack of consent to process personal data seems to be the legal area of concern for conducting such online tests in Europe where legislation like the ePrivacy Directive (which covers tracking cookies) and the more recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which further strengthens requirements for consent as a legal basis, both apply.</p>
<p>Asked how consent is being handled for the trials Google&#8217;s spokesman told us that some controls will be coming in April: &#8220;With the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/privacy-sandbox-in-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/privacy-sandbox-in-2021.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616666664189000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-Dvh_YOZArpHRJ3Izq3TVWcZIsw">Chrome 90 release </a>in April, we’ll be releasing the first controls for the Privacy Sandbox (first, a simple on/off), and we plan to expand on these controls in future Chrome releases, as more proposals reach the origin trial stage, and we receive more feedback from end users and industry.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s not clear why </span>Google is auto-enrolling sites into the trial rather than asking for opt-ins &#8212; beyond the obvious that such a step would add friction and introduce another layer of complexity by limiting the size of the test pool to only those who would consent. Google presumably doesn&#8217;t want to be so straightjacketed during product dev.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the origin trial, we are defaulting to supporting all sites that already contain ads to determine what FLoC a profile is assigned to,&#8221; its spokesman told us when we asked why it&#8217;s auto-enrolling sites. &#8220;Once FLoC’s final proposal is implemented, we expect the FLoC calculation will only draw on sites that opt into participating.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also specified that any user who has blocked third-party cookies won&#8217;t be included in the Origin Trial &#8212; so the trial is not a full &#8216;free-for-all&#8217;, even in the US.</p>
<p>There are reasons for Google to tread carefully. Its Privacy Sandbox tests were quickly shown to be leaking data about incognito browsing mode &#8212; revealing a piece of information that could be used to aid user fingerprinting. Which obviously isn&#8217;t good for privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If FloC is unavailable in incognito mode by design then this allows the detection of users browsing in private browsing mode,&#8221; wrote security and privacy researcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, in an <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/privacy-analysis-of-googles-privacy-sandbox-federated-learning-of-cohorts-leaking-information-about-browsing-in-incognito-mode/">initial privacy analysis of the Sandbox</a> this month in which he discussed the implications of the bug.</p>
<p>&#8220;While indeed, the private data about the FloC ID is not provided (and for a good reason), this is still an information leak,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Apparently it is a design bug because the behavior <a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc/blob/main/security-and-privacy-self-review.md">seems to be </a>foreseen to the feature authors. It allows differentiating between incognito and normal web browsing modes. Such behavior should be avoided.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox tests automating a new form of browser fingerprinting is not &#8216;on message&#8217; with the claimed boost for user privacy. But Google is presumably hoping to iron out such problems via testing and as development of the system continues.</p>
<p>(Indeed, Google&#8217;s spokesman also told us that &#8220;countering fingerprinting is an important goal of the Privacy Sandbox&#8221;, adding: &#8220;The group is developing technology to protect people from opaque or hidden techniques that share data about individual users and allow individuals to be tracked in a covert manner. One of these techniques, for example, involves using a device’s IP address to try and identify someone without their knowledge or ability to opt out.&#8221;)</p>
<p>At the same time it&#8217;s not clear whether or not Google needs to obtain user consent to run the tests legally in Europe. Other legal bases do exist &#8212; although it would take careful legal analysis to ascertain whether or not they could be used. But it&#8217;s certainly interesting that Google has decided it doesn&#8217;t want to risk testing if it can legally trial this tech in Europe without consent.</p>
<p>Likely relevant is the fact that the ePrivacy Directive is not like the harmonized GDPR &#8212; which funnels cross border complaints via a lead data supervisor, shrinking regulatory exposure at least in the first instance.</p>
<p>Any EU DPA may have competence to investigate matters related to ePrivacy in their national markets. To wit: At the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">end of last year</a> France&#8217;s CNIL skewered Google with a $120M fine related to dropping tracking cookies without consent &#8212; underlining the risks of getting EU law on consent wrong. And a privacy-related fine for Privacy Sandbox would be terrible PR. So Google may have calculated it&#8217;s simply less risky to wait.</p>
<p>Under EU law, certain types of personal data are also considered highly sensitive (aka &#8216;special category data&#8217;) and require an even higher bar of explicit consent to process. Such data couldn&#8217;t be bundled into a site-level consent &#8212; but would require specific consent for each instance. So, in other words, there would be even more friction involved in testing with such data.</p>
<p>That may explain why Google plans to do regional testing later &#8212; if it can figure out how to avoid processing such sensitive data. (Relevant: <a href="https://twitter.com/lukolejnik/status/1374403203039555586">Analysis</a> of Google&#8217;s proposal suggests the final version intends to avoid processing sensitive data in the computation of the FLoC ID &#8212; to avoid exactly that scenario.)</p>
<p>If/when Google does implement Privacy Sandbox tests in Europe &#8220;later&#8221;, as it has said it will (having also professed itself &#8220;100% committed to the Privacy Sandbox in Europe&#8221;), it will presumably do so when it has added the aforementioned controls to Chrome &#8212; meaning it would be in a position to offer some kind of prompt asking users if they wish to turn the tech off (or, better still, on).</p>
<p>Though, again, it&#8217;s not clear how exactly this will be implemented &#8212; and whether a consent flow will be part of the tests.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s the start. We are working to begin testing in Europe as soon as possible. We are 100% committed to the Privacy Sandbox in Europe.</p>
<p>&mdash; Marshall Vale (@marshallvale) <a href="https://twitter.com/marshallvale/status/1374494962646020098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Google has also not provided a timeline for when tests will start in Europe. Nor would it specify the other countries it&#8217;s running tests in beside the US when we asked about that.</p>
<p>At the time of writing it had not responded to a number of follow up questions either but we&#8217;ll update this report if we get more detail. <strong>Update: </strong>Google said it can&#8217;t currently offer any more detail on questions including how consent will be handled once FLoCs are deployed (i.e. post-trial, post-launch); and whether it believes it will be unnecessary to obtain individual consent to do cohort-based targeting once the system is fully developed. It also declined to specify the legal basis it will be relying upon for running tests in Europe &#8220;later&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very engaged on this topic and thinking carefully about it &#8212; but answers to questions about compliance with specific laws and obligations will ultimately turn on the technical operation of the Sandbox proposals, which are still being developed,&#8221; said its spokesman.</p>
<p>The (current) lack of regional tests raises questions about the suitability of Privacy Sandbox for European users &#8212; as the New York Times&#8217; Robin Berjon has pointed out, noting <a href="https://twitter.com/robinberjon/status/1374399491843887107">via Twitter</a> that &#8220;the market works differently&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not doing origin tests is already a problem&#8230; but not even knowing if it could eventually have a legal basis on which to run seems like a strange position to take?&#8221; he also wrote.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Google is surely going to need to test FLoCs in Europe at some point. Because the alternative &#8212; implementing regionally untested adtech &#8212; is unlikely to be a strong sell to advertisers who are already crying foul over Privacy Sandbox on competition and revenue risk grounds.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC), meanwhile &#8212; which, under GDPR, is Google&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the region &#8212; confirmed to us that Google has been consulting with it about the Privacy Sandbox plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google has been consulting the DPC on this matter and we were aware of the roll-out of the trial,&#8221; deputy commissioner Graham Doyle told us today. &#8220;As you are aware, this has not yet been rolled-out in the EU/EEA. If, and when, Google present us with detail plans, outlining their intention to start using this technology within the EU/EEA, we will examine all of the issues further at that point.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DPC has a number of investigations into Google&#8217;s business triggered by GDPR complaints &#8212; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">May 2019</a> probe into its adtech and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/googles-location-tracking-finally-under-formal-probe-in-europe/">February 2020</a> investigation into its processing of users&#8217; location data &#8212; all of which<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> are ongoing.</span></p>
<p>But &#8212; in one legacy example of the risks of getting EU data protection compliance wrong &#8212; Google was fined $57M by France&#8217;s CNIL back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">January 2019</a> (under GDPR as its EU users hadn&#8217;t yet come under the jurisdiction of Ireland&#8217;s DPC) for, in that case, not making it clear enough to Android users how it processes their personal information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.aspiration.com">Aspiration</a>, the financial services business for socially conscious consumers, is back with another environmentally friendly offering for its customers &#8212; this time, <a href="https://www.aspiration.com/zero">it&#8217;s a credit card</a>.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company, which has raised roughly $250 million from investors including the celebrities Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Downey Jr.&#8217;s Footprint Coalition, and Orlando Bloom and more traditional institutional investors like AlphaEdison, Capricorn Investment Group, the Omidyar Network, and Allen &amp; Co., wouldn&#8217;t say how much about the terms of the card or the credit limits available.</p>
<p>What Aspiration co-founder Andrei Cherny did discuss was the company&#8217;s sense of the significance of its new offering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There are plenty of credit cards out there that let you rack up miles, this is the only card that rewards you for taking miles off of the planet,” <span class="il">Aspiration</span> co-founder and CEO Andrei Cherny said in a statement. “For the first time, you can have a climate change-fighting tool right in your wallet.” <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>The key to Aspiration&#8217;s offset services is nothing more or less than tree planting. It&#8217;s the easiest way for consumers to eventually cancel out the greenhouse gas emissions associated with daily living in the U.S.</p>
<p>Every time someone uses the card, Aspiration will have one of its global reforestation partners plant a tree. If a customer uses Aspiration&#8217;s credit card 60 times, the resulting trees that are planted are enough to offset the carbon emissions from an average American home</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we’re doing is basing it on the average American’s carbon footprint,&#8221; Cherny affirmed. &#8220;Every time you make a purchase Aspiration plants your tree. The way the math works out. The average carbon impact of the average tree when you have 60 of them you eliminate the emissions from an average American home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Using Aspiration&#8217;s app, which includes<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aspiration-social-impact-of-spending/"> other tools for consumers to gauge the social impact of their purchases</a>, credit card customers can track their progress towards offsetting their emissions. For every month in which a user gets to carbon zero, Aspiration will reward them with 1% cashback on their credit card purchases.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gEmSroXq6V"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aspiration-social-impact-of-spending/">Aspiration can now tell you the ‘social impact’ of your monthly spending</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aspiration can now tell you the ‘social impact’ of your monthly spending&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aspiration-social-impact-of-spending/embed/#?secret=gEmSroXq6V" data-secret="gEmSroXq6V" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cherny said the company works with accredited partners and uses satellite imaging and on-the-ground monitoring to ensure that the forestation projects are proceeding according to plan and that the trees aren&#8217;t being harvested.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t just doing this out of a sense of corporate responsibility there&#8217;s actually an arbitrage case where the planting of seeds becomes a profit center (however nominal) for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we get to scale that will be the case,&#8221; Cherny said. &#8220;We are not a nonprofit, we&#8217;re a for-profit company dedicated to saving the planet. Until people can make a profit off of saving the planet in the same way people have been profiting on destroying the planet, there are going to continue to be problems&#8230; If only oil companies and incumbent banks can make money by destroying the planet, then we&#8217;re in trouble.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lidar companies across the planet are<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/the-station-the-lidar-spac-craze-and-10-investors-give-their-mobility-predictions/"> going SPAC</a>, but Baraja isn&#8217;t in a hurry to go public. The Australian lidar maker has raised a $31M B round to continue the deployment and development of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/barajas-unique-and-ingenious-take-on-lidar-shines-in-a-crowded-industry/">&#8220;unique and ingenious&#8221;</a> imaging system, with participation beyond the usual VC suspects.</p>
<p>Baraja&#8217;s lidar uses what the company calls SpectrumScan, letting physics do the hard work of directing the light. By passing its laser through a prism, different wavelengths of light go in different directions — and when it comes back, it takes the same path. Actually it&#8217;s a bit more complicated than that, but if you&#8217;re curious check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/barajas-unique-and-ingenious-take-on-lidar-shines-in-a-crowded-industry/">my article from CES last year</a>, which lays it out in more detail.</p>
<p>The company hasn&#8217;t been lying still since then, even though the most obvious application of lidar — autonomous vehicles — hasn&#8217;t exactly taken off in the meantime. As co-founder and CEO Federico Collarte told me back in 2020 of the lidar industry, &#8220;if you don’t differentiate, you die.&#8221; And Baraja has done so not just with its tech but its approach to the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lidar, it turns out, is actually useful in a lot of industries, but most lidar units contain highly complex mechanical elements that can be affected by heat, cold, and other environmental factors. Not so much Baraja, which has only one moving part (and that very slowly and steadily, somewhere in the optics) and can withstand intense conditions for a long time.</p>
<p>Collarte explained that one of their big customers over the last two years has been the mining industry, and you can imagine why. Creating accurate 3D images of mines is a task that&#8217;s incredibly difficult for humans or ordinary cameras, but practically purpose-built for lidar. That is, if the lidar can withstand the heat, cold, and forces found in mining operations.</p>

<p>&#8220;In mining, the key is reliability and ruggedization,&#8221; Collarte said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had units in mines in the Australian desert for two years. We had one back for RMA — you saw that our units are painted kind of an electric blue — the paint was totally eroded. It was bare metal, but the thing was still working.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the more sensitive bits, the laser and receiver, can be hidden deep in the body of the machine and connected via fiber optic to the &#8220;dumb&#8221; lens and prism elements of the head, the device was able to survive years of scorching sands. Not a claim many lidar makers can make!</p>
<p>The partnership with Hitachi Construction Machinery was successful enough that the company decided to invest.</p>
<p>This strategic investment is part of Collarte&#8217;s plan to diversify its financial backing. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to bring in the type of investors who have a very long timeline — institutional investors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Though venture capital is still part of it, he pointed to new investor HESTA, something like a pension fund, as an example of the kind of backer he was looking for in addition to VCs. That said, previous investors Blackbird Ventures (which led) and Main Sequence Ventures returned for this round as well as some new VCs. The $40M Australian amounts to $31M U.S. — slightly less than its $32M U.S. round A in 2018, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like a down round.</p>

<p>Collarte emphasized the importance of operating as a business and not just as an extended R&amp;D process.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re working just on technology, that&#8217;s fine, but you won&#8217;t have sales and customers today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have revenue and real world applications — we&#8217;re exercising those muscles. We&#8217;re getting good at customer support, installation, warranty, failure modes — it&#8217;s a whole area of the company that needs to be exercised over and above pure R&amp;D.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to mining, shipping is another area where lidar can be exposed to punishing conditions, he noted, saying that a major Australian port was using Baraja units as part of its push towards autonomy.</p>
<p>But R&amp;D is still a huge part of the company&#8217;s plans for the funding. The biggest changes are, in the short term, offering an integrated &#8220;one-box&#8221; system that some vehicle makers and suppliers may find simpler to work with. And in the long term the fundamental architecture of the system will evolve as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We come from a background in telecom, and they&#8217;ve moved from bulk optics [meaning lenses, prisms, and fiber optic bundles] into photonics and integrated circuits. So we&#8217;ve always had that in mind,&#8221; said CTO and co-founder Cibby Pulikkaseril. &#8220;My roadmap is to get these onto chips so that it doesn&#8217;t look any different from any other chips in the vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1932998" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png" alt="" width="1024" height="618" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/baraja-logo.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Collarte pointed out that while miniaturization is difficult for everyone, it&#8217;s especially hard for the scanning mechanism in lidar, which often must be of a certain size and cover a certain arc in order to direct the laser properly. He proudly said they are already well on their way to a solution that is unique to their SpectrumScan method.</p>
<p>The next year, they asserted, will be a major one for Tier 1 suppliers and others racing to level 4 autonomy. Perhaps that&#8217;s why so many lidar companies opted to go public via SPAC in the last one. But that&#8217;s not the plan for Baraja, at least for now.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re keeping an eye on,&#8221; said Collarte. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not in a rush.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the VCs mentioned above and Hitachi Construction Machinery, the following investors joined the round: Regal Funds Management, Perennial Value Management, and InterValley Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pacaso.com/">Pacaso</a>, a less-than-one-year-old startup that is out to give more people a chance at second home ownership, announced Wednesday that it has received $75 million in growth funding at a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Greycroft and Global Founders Capital co-led the $75 million in equity financing, which is notable for a few reasons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For one, the team. Former Zillow executives Austin Allison and (CEO and co-founder) Spencer Rascoff came up with the concept of Pacaso after leaving Zillow together about 18 months ago. (Publicly traded Zillow today has a market cap of $32.9 billion.) The company gives people the ability to purchase shares in, and become co-owners of, a second home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“We realized that owning a second home had been a very impactful luxury in both of our lives. We&#8217;re both fortunate enough to have second homes, and it made a huge difference to us and our friends and family,” Rascoff said. “What we set out to do was to try to democratize access to second homeownership so that it can be something that is not just a luxury available to the 1%, but hopefully it can be available to many tens of millions of other people around the world.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Something else that stands out about this raise is that Pacaso, which just launched in October 2020, has achieved unicorn status faster than any other company, according to an internal company analysis of Crunchbase data.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 top real estate and proptech investors: Cities and offices still have a future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/9-top-real-estate-and-proptech-investors-cities-and-offices-still-have-a-future/embed/#?secret=O4DEbZxoVs" data-secret="O4DEbZxoVs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">“Pacaso is growing incredibly quickly, faster than anything I&#8217;ve never been a part of,” Rascoff told TechCrunch. “And the reason that it&#8217;s growing so quickly is because consumers love the concept, and they love the idea of being able to own a second home at a much less expensive price metric.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to the equity financing announced today, San Francisco-based Pacaso has also secured $1 billion in debt financing. At the time of its launch last fall, the startup had raised $17 million in a Series A led by Maveron, as well as $250 million in debt financing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sukhinder Singh Cassidy and Theresia Gouw of the Acrew Diversify Capital Fund; First American Financial; Shea Ventures; Jeff Wilke, former CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer; and other notable angel investors also participated in the latest financing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With a unique co-ownership model made possible via the creation of a property-specific LLC, the company aims to reduce the cost and hassle of second home ownership. It also gives vacation homeowners an alternative option to renting out their property.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pacaso distinguishes its model from the age-old concept of timeshares, which sell the right to use a fixed amount of time in a condo or hotel. Pacaso aims to bring together a small group of co-owners to purchase a share of a single-family home and &#8220;enjoy ongoing access throughout the year.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way it works is that Pacaso purchases a home either outright or shares in a home. The company then partners with local real estate agents to market the properties. It then sells shares in the home &#8212; from one-eighth of the home to a greater percentage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pacaso holds a brokerage license in more than a dozen top second home markets such as Napa, Lake Tahoe, Palm Springs, Malibu and Park City. Buyers can view curated listings on the startup’s website, which includes active listings, as well as previews of homes under consideration for purchase based on buyer demand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to curating the listings, Pacaso also offers integrated financing, “upscale” interior design, professional property management and proprietary scheduling technology.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129382" style="width: 642px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129382" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2129382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="632" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Master_Bed_7290.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129382" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pacaso</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Since launch, Pacaso says that more than 500,000 people have visited the website and 60,000 “aspiring buyers” have engaged Pacaso to learn more about second home co-ownership. So far, the company has helped about 100 families become co-owners of second homes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Allison estimates that there are about 100 million second homes around the world, with the vast majority of those vacant 10 to 11 months a year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“On a monthly basis, that number is growing very quickly,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company plans to use its new capital in part to expand into new markets &#8212; moving from the west coast to the east coast. It eventually plans to also expand globally &#8212; in Europe and potentially in Mexico and the Caribbean. The debt will go toward purchasing shares of more homes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There are many tens of millions of families who make enough money to where they have some discretionary income and about 75% of them are dreaming about owning a second home,” he said. “But they are either held back by cost or the inability to justify such a purchase. So there’s this massive problem and what we’ve come up with is a really innovative solution, which is co-ownership.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over time, the company hopes to offer homes in a broader price range, including homes with lower price tags, noted Allison.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Greycroft co-founder and partner Dana Settle described Pacaso’s business vitals as “nothing short of momentous.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Pacaso is creating a new category that will dramatically change how people approach buying and owning a second home,” she added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As most venture firms are, Greycroft was also attracted to the caliber of Pacaso’s founding team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a team that knows this market incredibly well and have worked together previously,” Settle told TechCrunch. “When you see how quickly they&#8217;ve gotten up and running it’s literally a testament to that point.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also likened the company to Uber and Airbnb, which also took otherwise underutilized assets and turned them into a business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is another opportunity to do that &#8212; leveraging technology to create more accessibility in a market,” Settle said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To support its expansion, Pacaso has hired Nina Tran to serve as its chief financial officer. Tran took Waypoint Homes public through its merger with Starwood Waypoint and served as its CFO through its sale to Invitation Homes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rascoff has certainly been busy as of late. He&#8217;s also heading up Supernova Partners Acquisition Company, which recently announced it was merging with Offerpad to take that company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/real-estate-tech-startup-offerpad-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-3b-deal/">public</a>. Rascoff is also an investor in Doma, formerly called States Title &#8212; another proptech that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/proptech-startup-states-title-now-doma-going-public-via-spac-in-3b-deal/">going public</a> via a SPAC merger. He&#8217;s also backed a number of startups, including Cheese, a fintech that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/cheese-raises-3-6m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-asian-american-community/">recently launched</a> a digital banking platform that is aimed at primarily serving the Asian-American community, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp&#8217;s planned policy changes aren&#8217;t sailing smoothly in India, the instant messaging service&#8217;s biggest market by users. Indian antitrust body, Competition Commission of India, on Wednesday <a href="https://www.cci.gov.in/sites/default/files/SM01of2021_0.pdf">ordered</a> (PDF) an investigation into WhatsApp&#8217;s privacy policy changes, saying that Facebook-owned service breached local antitrust laws in the guise of a policy update.</p>
<p>The Indian watchdog has ordered nation&#8217;s Director General (DG) to investigate WhatsApp&#8217;s new policy to &#8220;ascertain the full extent, scope and impact of data sharing through involuntary consent of users.&#8221; The Director General has been ordered to complete the investigation and submit the report within 60 days.</p>
<p>In its order, the Indian watchdog said WhatsApp&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/">take-it-or-leave-it</a>&#8221; nature of privacy policy and terms of service &#8220;merit a detailed investigation in view of the market position and market power enjoyed by WhatsApp.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to engaging with the CCI. WhatsApp remains committed to protecting people&#8217;s personal communications with end-to-end encryption and providing transparency about how these new optional business features work,&#8221; said a WhatsApp spokesperson in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the pronounced network effects it enjoys, and the absence of any credible competitor in the instant messaging market in India, WhatsApp appears to be in a position to compromise quality in terms of protection of individualised data and can deem it unnecessary to even retain the user-friendly alternatives such as ‘opt-out’ choices, without the fear of erosion of its user base. Moreover, the users who do not wish to continue with WhatsApp may have to lose their historical data as porting such data from WhatsApp to other competing apps is not only a cumbersome and time consuming process but, as already explained, network effects make it difficult for the users to switch apps. This would enhance and accentuate switching costs for the users who may want to shift to alternatives due to the policy changes,&#8221; the order reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;As per the 2021 update to the privacy policy, a business may give third-party service provider such as Facebook access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. It may be possible that Facebook will condition provision of such services to businesses with a requirement for using the data collected by them. The DG may also investigate these aspects during its investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move on Wednesday follows months long legal battle WhatsApp has been fighting in India over its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">new policy update</a>, which goes into effect in May this year. Last week, the Indian government alleged that WhatsApp’s planned privacy update <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/india-tells-court-to-block-whatsapps-policy-update-says-new-change-violates-laws/">violates local laws on several counts</a>. In a filing to the Delhi High Court, the federal government also asked the court to prevent WhatsApp from rolling out the update in India.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, India’s IT ministry had written to Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, to express its “grave concerns” about the update and its implications and had “called upon to withdraw the proposed changes.”</p>
<p>WhatsApp has been working with New Delhi to allay its concerns since early this year. But it doesn&#8217;t seem that India is buying Facebook&#8217;s explanation. The Indian watchdog in its strongly-worded order said, &#8220;Facebook is a direct and immediate beneficiary of the new updates and in these circumstances, it is egregious that Facebook is feigning ignorance about the potential impact of the updates altogether and avoiding from providing its perspective thereon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Used by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">over 2 billion users</a>, WhatsApp has been sharing some information with parent firm Facebook since 2016. The company, which hasn’t substantially updated its terms of service since, said last year that it will be making some changes to share a set of personal data of users &#8212; such as their phone number and location &#8212; with Facebook.</p>
<p>Through an in-app alert earlier this year, WhatsApp asked users to share their consent for the new terms in January, which prompted an immediate backlash from some users. Following the backlash — which saw tens of millions of users explore competing services such as Signal and Telegram — WhatsApp said it will give users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">three additional months to review its new policy</a>.</p>
<p>With over 450 million monthly active users, India is the biggest market for WhatsApp, and also for its parent firm Facebook. The social juggernaut has doubled down on its bet to turn India into a key market in recent years. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">invested $5.7 billion into Jio Platforms</a>, the largest telecom operator in India, last year. The Indian firm is run by Mukesh Ambani, the richest man in the country.</p>
