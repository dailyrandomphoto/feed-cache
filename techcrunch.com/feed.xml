					<description><![CDATA[The company’s technical assessment technology is a “flight simulator for developers,” that gives candidates a score based on a simulated evaluation of their skills.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In less than a year after raising <a href="https://codesignal.com/blog/codesignal-news/codesignal-announces-25m-series-b-funding/">$25 million in Series B funding</a>, technical assessment company <a href="https://codesignal.com/">CodeSignal</a> announced a $50 million in Series C funding to offer new features for its platform that helps companies make data-driven hiring decisions to find and test engineering talent.</p>
<p>Similar to attracting a big investor lead for its B round — Menlo Ventures — it has partnered with Index Ventures to lead the C round. Menlo participated again and was joined by Headline and A Capital. This round brings CodeSignal’s total fundraising to $87.5 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Tigran Sloyan got the idea for the company from an experience his co-founder and friend Aram Shatakhtsyan had while trying to find an engineering job. Both from Armenia, the two went in different paths for college, with Shatakhtsyan staying in Armenia and Sloyan coming to the U.S. to study at MIT. He then went on to work at Google.</p>
<p>“As companies were recruiting myself and my classmates, Aram was trying to get his resume picked up, but wasn’t getting attention because of where he went to college, even though he was the greatest programmer I had ever known,” Sloyan told TechCrunch. “Hiring talent is the No. 1 problem companies say they have, but here was the best engineer, and no one would bring him in.”</p>
<p>They, along with Sophia Baik, started CodeSignal in 2015 to act as a self-driving interview platform that directly measures skills regardless of a person’s background. Like people needing to take a driver’s test in order to get a license, Sloyan calls the company’s technical assessment technology a “flight simulator for developers,” that gives candidates a simulated evaluation of their skills and comes back with a score and highlighted strengths.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The need by companies to hire engineers has led to CodeSignal growing 3.5 times in revenue year over year and to gather a customer list that includes Brex, Databricks, Facebook, Instacart, Robinhood, Upwork and Zoom.</p>
<p>Sloyan said the company has not yet touched the money it received in its Series B, but wanted to jump at the opportunity to work with Nina Achadjian, partner at Index Ventures, whom he had known for many years since their time together at Google. To work together and for Achadjian to join the company’s board was something “I couldn’t pass up,” Sloyan said.</p>
<p>When Achadjian moved over to venture capital, she helped Sloyan connect to mentors and angel investors while keeping an eye on the company. Hiring engineers is “mission critical” for technology companies, but what became more obvious to her was that engineering functions have become necessary for all companies, Achadjian explained.</p>
<p>While performing due diligence on the space, she saw traditional engineering cultures utilizing CodeSignal, but then would also see nontraditional companies like banks and insurance companies.</p>
<p>“Their traction was undeniable, and many of our portfolio companies were using CodeSignal,” she added. “It is rare to see a company accelerate growth at the stage they are at.”</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Labor statistics estimate there is already a <a href="https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/software-developer-shortage-us#The%20US%20Tech%20Talent%20Shortage%20Statistics%20in%202020">global talent labor shortage of 40 million workers</a>, and that number will grow to over 85 million by 2030. Achadjian says engineering jobs are also expected to increase during that time, and with all of those roles and applicants, vetting candidates will be more important than ever, as will the ability for candidates to apply from wherever they are.</p>
<p>The new funding enabled the company to launch its Integrated Development Environment for candidates to interact with relevant assessment experiences like codes, files and a terminal on a machine that is familiar with them, so that they can showcase their skills, while also being able to preview their application. At the same time, employers are able to assign each candidate the same coding task based on the open position.</p>
<p>In addition, Sloyan intends to triple the company’s headcount over the next couple of months and expand into other use cases for skills assessment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following entries into the newsletter market from tech companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/twitter-is-testing-a-feature-that-puts-users-revue-newsletters-on-their-profiles/">Twitter</a>, Google is now experimenting with newsletters, too. The company&#8217;s internal R&amp;D division, Area 120, has a new project called <a href="https://museletter.area120.google.com/">Museletter</a>, which allows anyone to publish a Google Drive file as a blog or newsletter to their Museletter public profile or to an email list.</p>
<p>The effort would essentially repurpose Google&#8217;s existing document-creation tools as a means of competing with other newsletter platforms, like Substack, Ghost, Revue, and others, which are today attracting a <a href="https://whatsnewinpublishing.com/one-of-the-most-important-tools-available-to-publishers-email-newsletters-are-resurging-says-reuters-institute/">growing</a> audience.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s experiment was spotted this week by sites including <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/14/google-area-120-museletter/">9to5Google</a> and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/15/googles-latest-area-120-experiment-wants-to-help-you-start-a-newsletter/">Android Police</a>.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, an Area 120 spokesperson declined to share further details about Museletter, saying only that it was &#8220;one of the many experiments&#8221; within the R&amp;D group and that &#8220;it&#8217;s still very early.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the Museletter website, however, there is already much that can be learned about the project. The site explains how Google Drive could be monetized by creators in a way that would allow Google&#8217;s newsletter project to differentiate itself from the competition. Not only could newsletters be written in a Google Doc, other productivity apps could also be used to share information with readers. For example, a newsletter creator could offer a paid subscription plan that would allow readers to access their Google Slides. A creator who writes about finance could publish helpful spreadsheets to Google Sheets, which would be available to their subscribers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203725" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203725" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/museletter2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>To make this possible, Museletter publishers would create a public profile on their Google Drive, then publish any Google Drive file directly to it. This provides them with a landing page where they can market their subscriptions and showcase how many different Drive files they&#8217;ve made publically available across Docs, Sheets, and Slides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Creators can also optionally publish to an email list &#8212; including a list brought in from other platforms. The newsletter subscriptions can be free or paid, depending on the creator&#8217;s preferences, but using Museletter itself will be free. Instead, the project aims to monetize with premium features like custom domains, welcome emails, and more.</p>
<p>The platform also promises tools and analytics to engage audiences and track the newsletter&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>While the site doesn&#8217;t mention any plans for advertising, a success in this space could provide Google with a new<a href="https://thefix.media/2021/04/06/newsletters-help-grow-subscriptions-generate-ad-revenue-and-gear-up-for-a-cookie-less-world/"> ad revenue</a> stream &#8212; and one that arrives at a time when the tech giant&#8217;s multi-billion dollar advertising market has a new challenger in the form of Amazon, whose own ad business could <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90631969/amazon-ad-business-growth">eventually challenge</a> the Facebook-Google duopoly.</p>
<p>Google didn&#8217;t say when it plans to launch Museletter, but the website is offering <a href="https://museletter.area120.google.com/signup">a link to a form</a> where users can request early access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ftc/">FTC</a>) has warned apps and devices that collect personal health information must notify consumers if their data is breached or shared with third parties without their permission.</p>
<p>In a 3-2 vote on Wednesday, the FTC agreed on a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-warns-health-apps-connected-device-companies-comply-health">new policy statement</a> to clarify a decade-old 2009 Health Breach Notification Rule, which requires companies handling health records to notify consumers if their data is accessed without permission, such as the result of a breach. This has now been extended to apply to health apps and devices — specifically calling out apps that track fertility data, fitness, and blood glucose — which “too often fail to invest in adequate privacy and data security,” according to FTC chair Lina Khan.</p>
<p>“Digital apps are routinely caught playing fast and loose with user data, leaving users&#8217; sensitive health information susceptible to hacks and breaches,&#8221; said Khan in a statement, pointing to a study published this year in the British Medical Journal that found health apps suffer from “serious problems” ranging from the insecure transmission of user data to the unauthorized sharing of data with advertisers.</p>
<p>There have also been a number of recent high-profile breaches involving health apps in recent years. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/babylon-health/">Babylon Health</a>, a U.K. AI chatbot and telehealth startup, last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/babylon-health-admits-software-error-led-to-patient-data-breach/">suffered a data breach</a> after a “software error” allowed users to access other patients’ video consultations, while period tracking app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/flo-gets-ftc-slap-for-sharing-user-data-when-it-promised-privacy/">Flo was recently found to be sharing users’ health data</a> with third-party analytics and marketing services.</p>
<p>Under the new rule, any company offering health apps or connected fitness devices that collect personal health data must notify consumers if their data has been compromised. However, the rule doesn&#8217;t define a &#8220;data breach&#8221; as just a cybersecurity intrusion; unauthorized access to personal data, including the sharing of information without an individual&#8217;s permission, can also trigger notification obligations.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this rule imposes some measure of accountability on tech firms that abuse our personal information, a more fundamental problem is the commodification of sensitive health information, where companies can use this data to feed behavioral ads or power user analytics,” Khan said.</p>
<p>If companies don&#8217;t comply with the rule, the FTC said it will &#8220;vigorously&#8221; enforce fines of $43,792 per violation per day.</p>
<p>The FTC has been cracking down on privacy violations in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the agency <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">unanimously voted to ban spyware maker SpyFone</a> and its chief executive Scott Zuckerman from the surveillance industry for harvesting mobile data on thousands of people and leaving it on the open internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SOSV this morning announced work on a $50 million HAX facility in Newark, New Jersey focused on growing industrial, healthcare and climate startups. The five-year development plan utilizes $25 million from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.</p>
<p>The facility is set to open in June of 2022, with an eye on early-stage U.S. companies working toward their seed round. SOSV notes that, while HAX&#8217;s earliest focus was on wearables, in more recent years, the accelerator has largely shifted to industrial and healthcare, which currently comprise 70- and 20% of its portfolio, respectively.</p>
<p>“Since 2015, HAX started investing in more industrial &amp; health startups and today make up 90% of our new investments,” HAX Partner Garrett Winther told TechCrunch. “These hard tech startups, at their earliest stages, tend to rely on more deep science R&amp;D, high precision prototyping, and only require one to two of their first product before raising funding. These companies also take up a lot of space, easily filling a room with their equipment and prototypes.”</p>
<p>Newark was chosen for myriad reasons, including proximity to New York City and universities like Princeton and Rutgers. It also, frankly, has more space than, say, Manhattan – which is a clear necessity for industrial startups. That’s a big part of the reason companies like AeroFarms and Bowery have looked toward to the area to host their massive vertical farming facilities.</p>
<p>The fact that the state was willing to put up around half the cost of the project likely didn’t hurt, either. New Jersey no doubt has a vested interest in welcoming hardware startups with open arms. It will be interesting to see what sort of incentives the local governments can offer to help keep them there to avoid the allure of nearby NYC.</p>
<p>“Growing New Jersey’s innovation economy both creates high-quality jobs today and generates opportunities for exponential returns in the future,” NJEDA CEO Tim Sullivan said in a release. “As startups become successful and scale-up in New Jersey, they build buildings, hire more employees, and become anchors for vibrant communities and small-business supply-chains.”</p>
<p>SOSV says the Newark location will effectively operate as a U.S. equivalent to its offices in Shenzhen, China, which afford easy access to the global supply chain. HAX also operates satellites in San Francisco, Tokyo and New York.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">REvil is a solid choice for a villain’s name: R Evil. Revil. Evil and yet fun. I could imagine Black Widow, Hulk and Spider-Man teaming up to topple the leadership of REvil Incorporated.</p>
<p>The criminal gang using the name <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/fujifilm-becomes-the-latest-victim-of-a-network-crippling-ransomware-attack/">REvil may have enabled ransomware attacks</a> on thousands of small businesses worldwide this summer — but the ransomware problem is bigger than REvil, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-big-ransomware-threat-just-disappeared-now-another-one-has-jumped-up-to-fill-the-gap/">LockBit</a> or <a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/2fb2081fc86c334c9155bb205141404f911383a0?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Ftechnology%2Finfamous-darkside-ransomware-reborn-new-cyber-threat&amp;userId=4761224&amp;signature=a4710d264bc941e5">DarkSide</a>. REvil has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57826851">disappeared</a> from the internet, but the ransomware problem persists.</p>
<p>REvil is a symptom, not the cause. I advise Tony Stark and his fellow Avengers to look past any one criminal organization — because there is no evil mastermind. Ransomware is just the latest in the 50,000-year evolution of petty criminals discovering get-rich-quick schemes.</p>
<p>The massive boom in the number of ransomware occurrences arises from the lack of centralized control. More than <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sonicwall-record-304-7-million-ransomware-attacks-eclipse-2020-global-total-in-just-6-months-301343916.html">304 million</a> ransomware attacks hit global businesses last year, with costs surpassing <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/issues/ransomware-attacks?utm_source=GNOM&amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;utm_code=sfzmdz&amp;utm_campaign=1543286+-+Ransomware+Attacks+up+10%2c000+Percent+in+Late+2020&amp;utm_exec=jamu273prd">$178,000 per event</a>. Technology has created a market where countless petty criminals can make good money fast. The best way to fight this kind of threat is with a market-based approach.</p>
<p>The spike in global ransomware attacks reflects a massive “dumbing down” of criminal activity. People looking to make an illicit buck have many more options available to them today than they did even two years ago. Without technical chops, people can steal your data, hold it for ransom and coerce you to pay to get it back. Law enforcement has not yet responded to combat this form of cybercrime, and large, sophisticated criminal networks have likewise not yet figured out how to control the encroaching upstarts.</p>
<p>The spike in ransomware attacks is attributable to the “as a service” economy. In this case, we’re talking about RaaS, or ransomware as a service. This works because each task in the ransomware chain benefits from the improved sophistication enabled by the division of labor and specialization.</p>
<p>Someone finds a vulnerable target. Someone provides bulletproof infrastructure outside of the jurisdiction of responsible law enforcement. Someone provides the malicious code. The players all come together without knowing each other&#8217;s names. No need to meet in person as Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange because the ability to coordinate tasks has become simple. The rapid pace of technological innovation created a decentralized market, enabling amateurs to engage in high-dollar crimes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There’s a gig economy for the underworld just like there is for the legal business world. I’ve built two successful software companies, even though I’m an economist. I use open source software and rent infrastructure via cloud technologies. I operated my first software company for six years before I sought outside capital, and I used that money for marketing and sales more than technology.</p>
<p>This tech advancement is both good and bad. The global economy did better than expected during a global pandemic because technology enabled many people to work from anywhere.</p>
<p>But the illicit markets of crime also benefited. REvil provided a service — a piece of a larger network — and earned a share of proceeds from ransomware attacks committed by others — like Jeff Bezos and Amazon get a share of my company’s revenues for the services they provide to me.</p>
<p>To fight ransomware attacks, appreciate the economics — the markets that enable ransomware — and change the market dynamics. Specifically, do three things:</p>
<h2>1. Analyze the market like a business executive</h2>
<p>Any competitive business thinks about what’s allowing competitors to succeed and how they can outcompete. The person behind a ransomware strike is an entrepreneur or a worker in a firm engaged in cybercrime, so start with good business analytics using data and smart business questions.</p>
<p>Can the crypto technologies that enable the crime also be used to enable entity resolution and deny anonymity/pseudonymity? Can technology undermine a criminal’s ability to recruit, coordinate or move, store and spend the proceeds from criminal activities?</p>
<h2>2. Define victory in market terms</h2>
<p>Doing the analytics to understand competing firms allows one to more clearly see the market for ransomware. Eliminating one “firm” often creates a power vacuum that will be filled by another, provided the market remains the same.</p>
<p>REvil disappeared, but ransomware attacks persist. Victory in market terms means creating markets in which criminals choose not to engage in the activity in the first place. The goal is not to catch criminals, but to deter the crime. Victory against ransomware happens when arrests drop because attempted attacks drop to near zero.</p>
<h2>3. Combat RaaS as an entrepreneur in a competitive market</h2>
<p>To prevent ransomware is to fight against criminal entrepreneurs, so the task requires one to think and fight crime like an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Crime-fighting entrepreneurs require collaboration — networks of government officials, banking professionals and technologists in the private sector across the globe must come together.</p>
<p>Through artificial intelligence and machine learning, the capability to securely share data, information and knowledge while preserving privacy exists. The tools of crime become the tools to combat crime.</p>
<p>No evil mastermind sits in their lair laughing at the chaos inflicted on the economy. Instead, growing numbers of amateurs are finding ways to make money quickly. Tackling the ransomware industry requires the same coordinated focus on the market that enabled amateurs to enter cybercrime in the first place. Iron Man would certainly agree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the darkest hours of the pandemic, millions upon millions of people turned to online gaming as a way to pass time in lockdown and connect with friends they couldn&#8217;t see in person. But a social, cooperative, fun <em>and</em> cross-platform gaming experience is remarkably hard to find — and Elodie Games is here to change that.</p>
<p>Elodie&#8217;s co-founders, Christina Norman and David Banks, are gaming industry vets who both worked on global hit League of Legends at Riot Games. The pair — also partners — left in 2019 to form their own company, announcing their intention in 2020 to build games focusing on co-op, crossplay, and &#8220;endlessly engaging experiences,&#8221; which suggests more open-ended, sandbox play.</p>
<p>The team already numbers 30 (and they&#8217;re hiring), and the game they&#8217;re working on is still something of a mystery; the images on its site are just general ideas, nothing from development. But what they showed behind closed doors was clearly enough to secure a $32.5 million Series A from Galaxy Interactive and a16z, with Brian Cho of Patron and Chris Ovitz from Electric Ant participating as well. The company last raised $5M in 2020 to get the ball rolling and clearly they&#8217;ve put that money to good use.</p>
<p>Norman explained that the main idea is to remove the barriers many gamers have come to accept as inevitable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At the simplest level, we’re designing our game so players have these great experiences more easily, and more frequently,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;This starts with removing friction that stops you from playing with friends in the first place. Most social multiplayer gamers are segmented by platform, time investment, purchases or skill in a way that limits who you can play with, and how you can play with them. While there are examples of how to overcome these limitations individually (Among Us is doing some great stuff for example) progress overall here has been slow and we are excited to speed it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly I can speak personally to even the slightest amount of friction stopping a nascent play session in its tracks as one person had to update their app or OS, or another couldn&#8217;t get the lobby to load, an Android-iOS conflict emerged, and so on. We ended up playing the rather poor games built into video chat apps simply because they worked every time. Even then it depended on the feel of the gathering, and being able to decide collectively what sounds like fun is another aspect of the Elodie ambition.</p>
<p>Making a game cross-platform isn&#8217;t as difficult as it used to be thanks to shared architectures like Unreal and Unity, but it&#8217;s still no cake walk.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;1047 Games raises $100M on the runaway success of its debut title, Splitgate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/1047-games-raises-100m-on-the-runaway-success-of-its-debut-title-splitgate/embed/#?secret=i0RlY6dzxh" data-secret="i0RlY6dzxh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course, modern engine tech helps immensely with making cross-play possible, but it doesn’t make it fun. Traditional approaches to cross-platform development are slow, expensive and repetitive,&#8221; said Banks. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we are building Elodie’s development practices to achieve exceptional cross-play and focusing on what we call the true cross-play experience from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True&#8221; cross-play, one presumes, is a step above the elementary &#8220;Xbox players can play with PC players,&#8221; to the point where the game is actually equally desirable to play on platform. Whether that can really be achieved is a matter of debate, but the proof of the pudding is in the taste, so we&#8217;ll find out when Elodie puts its game out into the wild.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GoPro today announced a new flagship action camera for its lineup, the <a href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero10-black/CHDHX-101-master.html">HERO10 Black</a>. The main update for the camera is a brand new processor inside, called the GP2, which enables big improvements to image quality and video captures, including recording at 5.3K revolution at up to 60 frames per second, 4K video capture bumped to a max of 120 FPS, and 2.7K video at 240 FPS which enables awesome slow-mo capabilities.</p>
<p>The new HERO10 Black also offers better still images, with 23.6 megapixel captures, and better performance in low light. That improved low-light capture applies to video, too, with 3D noise reduction applied so that even nighttime scenes have a lot less grain. The improved processing capabilities of the GP2 chip also mean that using the GoPro interface and software on the camera is generally much snappier, too.</p>
<p>Another new feature made possible by the improved processor is the 4.0 version of HyperSmooth, which is GoPro&#8217;s tech for offering gimbal-like stabilization via software. HyperSmooth was already impressive, and based on our initial testing (a full review will follow soon), it&#8217;s fantastic on this new generation of camera. HERO10 also packs an upgraded horizon levelling system, which locks the horizon even when the camera is tilted up to 45 degrees in either direction.</p>

<p>The GoPro HERO10 includes a front-facing screen as well as a rear touch screen, with better frame rates on the front selfie screen. The new lens cover has a hydrophobic treatment to improve its ability to get wet and shed water, and it works with the existing Media Mod, Display Mod and Light Mod for GoPro cameras. It works as a webcam out of the box, has fast-charging support, and now offers wired content transfers to your smartphone or device in addition to cloud uploading and wireless transfer.</p>
<p>Also returning is GoPro&#8217;s SuperView lens, which offers an even wider angle capture, and which will be available in new 5.3K 30/25/24 FPS capture modes when a firmware update arrives on November 16. That will also delivers support for GoPro&#8217;s Max Lens Mods, as well as the following additional capture modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>5K 4:3 24fps</li>
<li>4K 4:3 30/25/24fps</li>
<li>5.3K 24fps</li>
<li>1080 24fps</li>
</ul>
<p>GoPro&#8217;s HERO10 is available now, priced at $399.98 with a bundled one-year GoPro subscription or for existing subscribers, or you&#8217;ll pay $499.99 without the recurring sub, which will cost $49.99 annually or $4.99 per month after the trial. There&#8217;s a HERO10 Black bundle that includes a Shorty tripod mount, a magnetic swivel clip, an additional battery and a 32GB microSD card for $549 without subscription, or $449 with one. GoPro subscribers can also upgrade to the bundle from their existing camera for a further discounted $399.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will continue to offer both the GoPro HERO9 Black and the HERO8 Black alongside the HERO10, at lower price points, as well as its MAX 360 action camera.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Americans spend more than 90% of each day indoors on average. However, approximately 82% of American homeowners are more interested in renovating their outdoor living spaces than they were prior to the pandemic, based on a recent survey, Outer co-founder and CEO Jiake Liu told TechCrunch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, about 54% of homeowners have made at least one home improvement in the backyard since the outbreak of COVID-19, while millennials, the largest house-buying group now, are willing to take less square feet inside, or even give up a bedroom, to get a little bit of outdoor space, Liu said.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 caused a “flight from density” across the U.S., meaning millions of Americans fled from big cities to suburbs to escape the coronavirus pandemic. This trend has led to more market opportunities in the outdoor entertainment industry. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A Santa Monica-based direct-to-consumers (D2C) outdoor furniture startup company, <a href="https://liveouter.com/">Outer</a>, announced today its $50 million Series B funding to help more people around the globe to bring their lives back outside. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was founded by CEO Liu and Chief Design Officer Terry Lin in 2019. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B round was led by Capital Today’s founder Kathy Xu, with participation from Tribe Capital, C Ventures and Upfront Ventures. Existing investors, including Sequoia Capital China, Mucker Capital, Mantis VC and Reimagined Ventures, also joined in the round.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This fundraising, which comes about eight months after Outer’s $10.5 million Series A round in January, brings its total funding to $65 million.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The fresh funding will be used to cement its position in the outdoor living industry as they develop new sustainable materials, build an eco-friendly supply chain and expand their product offering and community, Liu said. Outer is currently hiring a variety of roles to enter global market this year and will announce a strategic international launch in October, Liu told TechCrunch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We are working on new, eco-friendly fabrics, plastics and concrete to replace the industry standards that currently pollute our environment,” Liu said. The company’s effort in sustainable materials isn’t stopping at recycled plastics but working towards carbon neutrality, and has set its goal of becoming carbon negative in the future, he explained.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Since the beginning, the Outer team has insisted on prioritizing sustainability. Terry and his team have pioneered new fabrics and eco-friendly designs to ensure durability doesn’t come at the expense of environmental responsibility. The team is developing sustainable fabrics, plastics and concrete that will become the new industry gold standard,” said Capital Today’s founder Kathy Xu.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Its unique feature is its <a href="https://liveouter.com/showrooms">Neighborhood Showroom program</a>, allowing shoppers to visit the homes of nearby Outer customers to experience Outer products in more than 1,000 locations in 49 states as of today, which has grown from 50 locations in 13 states in 2019. Outer&#8217;s direct-to-consumers (D2C) business does not require middlemen like distributors, retailers or brick-and-mortar showrooms.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The global furniture market was approximately $17.8 billion in 2018 and is projected to grow to $26.6 billion 2027, Liu said. The U.S. outdoor living market is estimated at $33.4 billion in 2021, based on <a href="https://www.freedoniagroup.com/Outdoor-Living.html">a report by Freedonia</a>.</p>
<p>Outer recently launched the <a href="https://liveouter.com/explore/teak">Teak Collection</a>, <a href="https://liveouter.com/explore/aluminum">Aluminum Collection</a> and <a href="https://liveouter.com/explore/bug-shield-blankets">Bug Shield Blankets</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Outdoor products have long been an afterthought and their poor design has been a serious barrier to time spent outside. Outer’s thoughtful and sustainable products are already changing the way consumers interact with their outdoor spaces,” Xu said, adding that Outer is tackling real consumer problems, from dirty, wet outdoor cushions to pesky mosquito bites, with its solutions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Jiake and his team have taken a product-focused approach to establish Outer as a go-to premium furniture brand &#8212; driving rapid growth and attractive unit economics,” said Tribe Capital partner Sri Pangulur.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.mynd.co"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mynd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that aims to make it easier for people to buy and manage single-family rental properties, announced today it has raised $57.3 million in funding from QED Investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing values the Oakland, California-based company at $807 million, and brings the company’s total raised to $174.9 million since its 2016 inception. Invesco Real Estate led its previous round, a $40 million raise, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/invesco-backs-mynd-to-spend-5-billion-on-single-family-rentals">committed $5 billion</a> to purchase and rent 20,000 single-family homes through Mynd over the next three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doug Brien and Colin Weil started Mynd with the goal of making real estate investing more accessible. The pair has built a platform for investors to find, finance, purchase and manage single-family rental properties &#8212; 100% remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t outsource to partners. We do that all in-house,” Brien told TechCrunch. “We remove the geographical barriers to real estate investment, making it possible to invest in 25 cities from anywhere in the country &#8212; all from the comfort of home through our desktop interface and/or mobile apps.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Mynd manages over 9,000 rental units <a href="https://www.mynd.co/about-us#:~:text=Mynd%20Property%20Management%20provides%20full,San%20Antonio%2C%20Houston%20and%20Tampa.">in 25 markets</a> across the country. The startup plans to expand to 15 additional markets over the next three years including, Indianapolis, Indiana and Memphis, Tennessee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mynd’s tech product is complemented by &#8220;boots on the ground&#8221; people in local markets, improving the speed and clarity of communications that the company can provide to Mynd residents, Brien said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plus it provides total visibility and transparency for our owners around the health of their investments,” he said “Unlike other companies we have our own purpose-built system called OTTO. It’s almost like a ‘Snowflake meets Zendesk’ &#8212; but custom-built for real estate investing and property management.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203492" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203492" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2203492 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="403" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=768,455 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=680,403 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=1536,911 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203492" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mynd</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Mynd added 1,846 homes to the platform. This year, it’s on track to add roughly 8,500 across both retail and institutional — enough to nearly double the total homes managed by Mynd year over year, according to Brien. Invesco is its largest institutional client. On the retail side of its business, it has roughly 4,000 investors using Mynd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that investing in the single-family residential asset class is the best path for building long-term, generational wealth,” he told TechCrunch. “Mynd is committed to democratizing real estate &#8212; making it accessible to a whole new crop of investors who were previously too intimidated and/or were constrained by geography.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic underscored the urgency of what the company was building, he said, as people sought more space to live and work. Renting also became more common as more people wanted increased flexibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mynd plans to use its new capital to continue upgrading its digital platform, which it says is powered by “an extensive proprietary data set.” It also plans to enhance its automated workflow engine, underwriting, mobile applications and omnichannel communications. The startup also plans to keep hiring and expanding into new markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, Mynd has 568 employees, up from 366 a year ago today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QED partner Chuckie Reddy said the Mynd team was “one of the best” his firm had seen in the single-family rental market with a “purpose-built” tech stack designed specifically for such properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have a customized offering that is superior to anything else on the market today,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, QED believes the single-family rental asset class is one of the fastest-growing in the country, “because of how big the housing market is, the need and desire for the product and the tremendous amount of capital formation we have seen since the last financial crisis,” according to Reddy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a shortage of quality, affordable single-family rental housing, and Mynd has technology to manage this asset class,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.self.inc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self Financial,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a fintech company that aims to help consumers build credit and savings at the same time, announced today it has raised $50 million in Series E funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altos Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led the financing, which also included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meritech Capital</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conductive Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and brings the Austin-based startup’s total raised to $127 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, as many fintechs these days, aims to make building credit and savings more accessible, regardless of a person&#8217;s financial history. It requires no hard credit check to get started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been focused on delivering high-quality, low-cost products that help with mainstream credit access,” said Self founder and CEO James Garvey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Self Financial has 200 employees, up from about 80 at the beginning of this year. The startup, which was initially founded in California but relocated to Austin after participating in the Techstars program in the city, plans to do more hiring with its new capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garvey declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying only that Self is going to do “nine figures” of revenue this year, about 2x compared to 2020. Self’s active customer base has more than doubled in the past 12 months to about 1 million today. Over time, it has served more than 2 million customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech&#8217;s flagship product, he said, is basically secured installment loans, or small-dollar loans with a deposit account that has a CD (certificate of deposit) connected to it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After using that product successfully customers can then get access to Self’s Visa credit card.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203473" style="width: 396px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203473" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2203473 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="386" height="309" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg 597w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203473" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Self Financial</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self’s Credit Builder products are issued via its three bank partners. But the company has built its own proprietary core technology platform that Garvey says “powers everything behind the scenes.” The company&#8217;s products are available via iOS and Android, as well as through a desktop application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning this month, Self will allow people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ho hold an H-1B or L 1 work visa or student visa to open Credit Builder accounts, a move Garvey said “opens the door for more people to participate who are new to the U.S. credit system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe everyone should have the opportunity to improve their financial future,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of Self’s longer-term goals include entering the insurance market, as well as the planned launch of another product designed to help give its customers access to credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Credit score is used for a lot of things, and in many states it’s an important factor in determining the cost of auto insurance,” he said. “We’re going to be helping our customers to get access to auto insurance as one of the benefits of a higher credit score.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to hire about 50 to 100 people over the next 12 months, Garvey said. Recently it named Kathleen Leonik to serve as its chief compliance officer. She has previously held leadership positions at Juniper Bank, Barclaycard and, most recently, Mercury Financial. She also worked in compliance at First USA, Bank One and Chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altos Ventures Managing Director Anthony Lee described Self as a pioneer in the increasingly crowded space. This week, TomoCredit, which has the similar goal of helping underrepresented consumers build a credit history, announced it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/kapor-capital-square-co-founder-sam-wen-back-tomocredit-in-its-10m-series-a-funding-round/">raised $10 million</a>. And last week, Varo Bank &#8212; the first  U.S. neobank to be granted a national bank charter &#8212; raised a massive $510 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/varo-bank-raises-510m-at-a-2-5b-valuation/">a Series E funding round</a> at a $2.5 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“James and his team at Self have had a clear mission from day one: to build credit and savings for millions of Americans who are marginalized by the mainstream financial system,” said Lee. “It’s a mission that is going to take decades to realize and we are happy to be there for the journey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Silverton Partners’ Managing Director Morgan Flager, who participated in Self’s Series A-D rounds, Garvey’s passion has been key to its repeated investments in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a founder with a clear and noble vision for solving a critical problem this massive, it is hard to say no as an investor,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm was also drawn to Self’s mission to “lift up” subprime consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of the offers that target subprime consumers are expensive and restrictive,” he said. “Self Financial is unique in that it intends to break this cycle, rather than just profit from it in a different way.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Performance reviews eat up a lot of a manager’s time and are often the most dreaded part of work. <a href="https://www.onloop.com/">OnLoop</a> aims to bring some joy into the process by enabling information-gathering to happen behind the scenes and be easier for hybrid workforces.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based company designed a mobile-first product that consistently gathers employee feedback and goals so that the company has better insights into how both individuals and teams are doing. The feedback is also captured and converted into auto-generated reviews that lay out all of the content collected for managers to then quickly put together a finished product.</p>
<p>The platform was in private beta since January 2021, and after a successful run with 25 companies, OnLoop raised $5.5 million co-led by MassMutual Ventures and Square Peg Capital along with Hustle Fund and a group of angel investors including XA Network, BCG’s Aliza Knox, Uber’s Andrew Macdonald, Ready’s Allen Penn, Google’s Bambos Kaisharis, Ripple’s Brooks Entwistle, Robert Hoyt, Nordstar’s Eddie Lee, Nas Academy’s Alex Dwek and hedge fund managers John Candeto and Keshav Lall.</p>

<p>OnLoop co-founder and CEO Projjal Ghatak spent over three years at Uber and said he saw his fair share of productivity tools, but still struggled to develop his own team as tasks and communication were done differently by each employee.</p>
<p>“This is the one problem that companies consistently complain about — not having the right tool to develop teams,” he added.</p>
<p>As someone who began spending more and more time on his phone, Ghatak wanted his product to be mobile-native and eliminate the need for managers to start from scratch on performance reviews each time. Rather than spend days gathering the information, as the name suggests, OnLoop continuously and automatically captures the data and converts it into a well-written summary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203375" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203375" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203375" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/onloopimage-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="483" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/onloopimage-1.png 2508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/onloopimage-1.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/onloopimage-1.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/onloopimage-1.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/onloopimage-1.png?resize=680,483 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/onloopimage-1.png?resize=1536,1091 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/onloopimage-1.png?resize=2048,1455 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/onloopimage-1.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203375" class="wp-caption-text">OnLoop app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> OnLoop</p></div></p>
<p>Having that continuous loop of information is good for morale, he said. He points to data that shows <a href="https://www.benfanning.com/this-self-reflection-strategy-can-boost-your-productivity-20/">regular self-reflection and feedback increased productivity by 20%</a>, and a Gallup study where only <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/249332/harm-good-truth-performance-reviews.aspx">14% of employees thought their performance reviews inspired them to improve</a>.</p>
<p>“A lot of company culture is set by the leaders, so as they want to drive this culture in their organizations, we are the tool that drives this,” Ghatak said. “Our job is to help educate the teams on how to do that well. We hear time and time again to make it fun and convenient. Teams don’t realize that if you are helping colleagues understand, showing them a light they didn’t have before, it will drive impact.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will be mainly invested into product development and R&amp;D, including expanding product, data and engineering teams. The company will also look at its sales and marketing framework. The company currently has 22 employees.</p>
<p>OnLoop was able to convert some of its early adopters into paying customers and is now focusing on figuring out a scalable way to get the product into the hands of more teams.</p>
<p>Piruze Sabuncu, partner at Square Peg Capital, experienced the pain of performance reviews when she was working in Stripe’s Southeast Asia and Hong Kong region. One of the challenges she faced working with regional teams was that an employee’s direct manager could be located elsewhere, yet work closely with a manager in their respective office.</p>
<p>Square Peg itself uses OnLoop, and Sabuncu said she liked that it is mobile-first and was designed in a way that people didn’t open it up and dread using it.</p>
<p>“Who your manager is, is a big question, but it shouldn’t matter,” she added. “It would still be my duty to be capturing and developing the person even if they were not my direct person. Everyone is talking about remote and hybrid work, and it is not going anywhere — it is here to stay. We believe this is a huge opportunity, a $400 billion market to disrupt, and OnLoop is providing better ways to communicate and give feedback.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/">Tile</a>, the maker of Bluetooth-powered lost item finder beacons and, more recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">a staunch Apple critic</a>, announced today it has raised $40 million in non-dilutive debt financing from Capital IP. The funding will be put towards investment in Tile&#8217;s finding technologies, ahead of the company&#8217;s plan to unveil a new slate of products and features that the company believes will help it to better compete with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">Apple&#8217;s AirTags</a> and further expand its market.</p>
<p>The company has been a longtime leader in the lost item finder space, offering consumers small devices they can attach to items &#8212; like handbags, luggage, bikes, wallets, keys, and more &#8212; which can then be tracked using the Tile smartphone app for iOS or Android. When items go missing, the Tile app leverages Bluetooth to find the items and can make them play a sound. If the items are further afield, Tile taps into its broader <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/blog/what-is-tile-network-community-find-lost-stolen-far-away">finding network</a> consisting of everyone who has the app installed on their phone and other access points. Through this network, Tile is able to automatically and anonymously communicate the lost item&#8217;s location back to its owner through their own Tile app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203454" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203454" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Floral_1080x1080-copy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203454" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile</p></div></p>
<p>Tile has also formed partnerships focused on integrating its finding network into over 40 different third-party devices, including those across audio, travel, wearables, and PC categories. Notable brand <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/partners">partners</a> include HP, Dell, Fitbit, Skullcandy, Away, Xfinity, Plantronics, Sennheiser, Bose, Intel, and others. Tile says it&#8217;s seen 200% year-over-year growth on activations of these devices with its service embedded.</p>
<p>To date, Tile has sold over 40 million devices and has over 425,000 paying customers &#8212; a metric it&#8217;s revealing for the first time. It doesn&#8217;t disclose its total number of users, both free and paid combined, however. During the first half of 2021, Tile says revenues increased by over 50%, but didn&#8217;t provide hard numbers.</p>
<p>While Tile admits that the Covid-19 pandemic had some impacts on international expansions, as some markets have been slower to rebound, it has still seen strong performance outside the U.S., and considers that a continued focus.</p>
<p>The pandemic, however, hasn&#8217;t been Tile&#8217;s only speed bump.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-airtag/">announced</a> its plans to compete with the launch of AirTags, Tile went on record to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/senate-to-call-spotify-match-at-apple-google-antitrust-hearing?sref=gni836kR">call it unfair competition</a>. Unlike Tile devices, Apple&#8217;s products could tap into the iPhone&#8217;s U1 chip to allow for more accurate finding through the use of ultra-wideband technologies available on newer iPhone models. Tile, meanwhile, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">plans</a> for its own ultra-wideband powered device, but hadn&#8217;t been provided the same access. In other words, Apple gave its own lost item finder early, exclusive access to a feature that would allow it to differentiate itself from the competition. (Apple has since announced it&#8217;s making ultra-wideband APIs available to third-party developers, but this access wasn&#8217;t available from day one of AirTag&#8217;s arrival.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092114" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092114" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2092114" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="458" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg 1184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=768,518 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2092114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile internal concept art</p></div></p>
<p>Tile has been vocal on the matter of Apple&#8217;s anti-competitive behavior, having testified in multiple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/17/tile-apple-antitrust-opening-statement/">Congressional</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-apple-tile/tile-says-apples-behavior-is-anticompetitive-and-has-gotten-worse-not-better-idUSKBN21J72V?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29">hearings</a> alongside other Apple critics, like Spotify and Match. As a result of increased regulatory pressure, Apple later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">opened up its Find My network</a> to third-party devices, in an effort to placate Tile and the other rivals its AirTags would disadvantage.</p>
<p>But Tile doesn&#8217;t want to route its customers to Apple&#8217;s first-party app &#8212; it intends to use its own app in order to compete based on its proprietary features and services. Among other things, this includes Tile&#8217;s subscriptions. A base plan is $29.99 per year, offering features like free battery replacement, smart alerts, and location history. A $99.99 per year plan also adds insurance of sorts &#8212; it pays up to $1,000 per year for items it can&#8217;t find. (AirTag doesn&#8217;t do that.)</p>
<p>Despite its many differentiators, Tile faces <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-airtags-3-ways-theyre-better-tile-trackers-3-ways-worse/">steep competition</a> from the ultra-wideband capable AirTags, which have the advantage of tapping into Apple&#8217;s own finding network of potentially hundreds of millions of iPhone owners.</p>
<p>However, Tile CEO CJ Prober &#8212; who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/tile-names-gopro-vet-cj-prober-new-ceo-adds-comcast-as-investor-and-new-product-partner/">joined the company in 2018</a> &#8212; claims AirTag hasn&#8217;t impacted the company&#8217;s revenue or device sales.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t take away from the fact that they&#8217;re making things harder for us,&#8221; he says of Apple. &#8220;We&#8217;re a growing business. We&#8217;re winning the hearts and minds of consumers&#8230; and they&#8217;re competing unfairly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you own the platform, you shouldn&#8217;t be able to identify a category that you want to enter, disadvantage the incumbents in that category, and then advantage yourself &#8212; like they did in our case,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Tile is preparing to announce an upcoming product refresh that may allow it to better take on the AirTag. Presumably, this will include the pre-announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/"> ultra-wideband version of Tile</a>, but the company says full details will be shared next week. Tile may also expand its lineup in other ways that will allow it to better compete based on look and feel, size and shape, and functionality.</p>
<p>Tile&#8217;s last round of funding was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/tile-finds-another-45m-for-its-item-tracking-platform/">$45 million in growth equity</a> in 2019. Now it&#8217;s shifted to debt. In addition to new debt financing, Tile is also refinancing some of its existing debt with this fundraise, it says.</p>
<p>&#8220;My philosophy is it&#8217;s always good to have a mix of debt and equity. So some amount of debt on the balance sheet is good. And it doesn&#8217;t incur dilution to our shareholders,&#8221; Prober says. &#8220;We felt this was the right mix of capital choice for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company chose to work with Capital IP, a group it&#8217;s had a relationship with over the last three years, and who Tile had considered bringing on as an investor. The group has remained interested in Tile and excited about its trajectory, Prober notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to partner with the Tile team as they continue to define and lead the finding category through hardware and software-based innovations,&#8221; said Capital IP’s Managing Partner Riyad Shahjahan, in a statement. &#8220;The impressive revenue growth and fast-climbing subscriber trends underline the value proposition that Tile delivers in a platform-agnostic manner, and were a critical driver in our decision to invest. The Tile team has an ambitious roadmap ahead and we look forward to supporting their entry into new markets and applications to further cement their market leadership,&#8221; he added.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Recruiting for technical roles can be challenging. There are often too many roles to fill, too many or too few candidates to interview and not enough time to get it all done and develop relationships with your key stakeholders: Hiring managers and the executive team.</p>
<p>Working with talent acquisition (TA) leaders and technical recruiters can help companies scalably, accurately and fairly assess potential candidates’ technical skills to fill high-value engineering roles. Technology also offers many advantages that help achieve TA objectives. But in my experience, many TA and HR leaders get frustrated when new tools fail to launch or deliver underwhelming results, because they aren’t adequately adopted, trusted or utilized by end users.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I find that hiring managers are more open-minded to “mechanical” or automated hiring tools if those tools aren’t evaluated on their own, but are evaluated relative to status quo hiring processes.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>All of this leads to technical decision-makers and stakeholders developing a natural skepticism for mechanical or automated hiring tools. If your hiring managers seem doubtful about using tech for hiring, here are three strategies to help them embrace hiring tools.</p>
<h2>Expect skepticism, it&#8217;s natural</h2>
<p>Researchers studying how to make scientific hiring tools more effective have discovered an interesting phenomenon: Human beings are naturally skeptical of tools that outsource our decisions (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1754-9434.2008.00058.x">Highhouse, 2008</a>). Left to our own devices, we are hardwired to trust gut instinct over external data points, especially when developing and nurturing new relationships, including who we work with.</p>
<p>Scientists have offered up a few explanations for this preference of gut over data. Some people consider external, mechanical decision-making aids as less trustworthy because of a lack of familiarity with how they work, or because using them reflects poorly on the decision-maker’s value and worth as a leader or manager.</p>
<p>It could also be because there’s a fear of surrendering control and agency to a tool that doesn’t seem to consider or understand context clues. However, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24041118/">research has shown</a> that people make better choices when using mechanical decision support tools than when either humans or mechanical tools make decisions alone.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its natural language processing platform aids subject-matter experts in finding answers to their questions.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sorcero.com/">Sorcero</a> announced Thursday a $10 million Series A round of funding to continue scaling its medical and technical language intelligence platform.</p>
<p>The latest funding round comes as the company, headquartered in Washington, D.C. and Cambridge, Massachusetts, sees increased demand for its advanced analytics from life sciences and technical companies. Sorcero’s natural language processing platform makes it easier for subject-matter experts to find answers to their questions to aid in better decision making.</p>
<p>CityRock Venture Partners, the growth fund of H/L Ventures, led the round and was joined by new investors Harmonix Fund, Rackhouse, Mighty Capital and Leawood VC, as well as existing investors, Castor Ventures and WorldQuant Ventures. The new investment gives Sorcero a total of $15.7 million in funding since it was founded in 2018.</p>
<p>Prior to starting Sorcero, Dipanwita Das, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch she was working in public policy, a place where scientific content is useful, but often a source of confusion and burden. She thought there had to be a more effective way to make better decisions across the healthcare value chain. That’s when she met co-founders Walter Bender and Richard Graves and started the company.</p>
<p>“Everything is in service of subject-matter experts being faster, better and less prone to errors,” Das said. “Advances of deep learning with accuracy add a lot of transparency. We are used by science affairs and regulatory teams whose jobs it is to collect scientific data and effectively communicate it to a variety of stakeholders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The total addressable market for language intelligence is big — Das estimated it to be $42 billion just for the life sciences sector. Due to the demand, the co-founders have seen the company grow at 324% year over year since 2020, she added.</p>
<p>Raising a Series A enables the company to serve more customers across the life sciences sector. The company will invest in talent in both engineering and on the commercial side. It will also put some funds into Sorcero’s go-to-market strategy to go after other use cases.</p>
<p>In the next 12 to 18 months, a big focus for the company will be scaling into product market fit in the medical affairs and regulatory space and closing new partnerships.</p>
<p>Oliver Libby, partner at CityRock Venture Partners, said Sorcero’s platform “provides the rails for AI solutions for companies” that have traditionally found issues with AI technologies as they try to integrate data sets that are already in existence in order to run analysis effectively on top of that.</p>
<p>Rather than have to build custom technology and connectors, Sorcero is “revolutionizing it, reducing time and increasing accuracy,” and if AI is to have a future, it needs a universal translator that plugs into everything, he said.</p>
<p>“One of the hallmarks in the response to COVID was how quickly the scientific community had to do revolutionary things,” Libby added. “The time to vaccine was almost a miracle of modern science. One of the first things they did was track medical resources and turn them into a hook for pharmaceutical companies. There couldn’t have been a better use case for Sorcero than COVID.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> announced it was buying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/salesforce-steps-into-rpa-buying-servicetrace-and-teaming-it-with-mulesoft/">German RPA vendor Servicetrace</a> last month, it seemed that it might match up well with Mulesoft, the company the CRM giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">bought in 2018 for $6.5 billion</a>. Mulesoft, among other things, helps customers build APIs to legacy systems, while Servicetrace provides a way to add automation to legacy systems. Sure enough, the company announced today, that it&#8217;s planning a new Mulesoft-Servicetrace tool called Mulesoft RPA.</p>
<p>The Servicetrace <a href="https://blogs.mulesoft.com/news/mulesoft-to-acquire-servicetrace/">deal closed on September 2nd</a> and the company isn&#8217;t wasting any time putting it to work wherever it makes sense across the organization &#8212; and the Mulesoft integration is a primary use case. John Kucera, SVP of product management at Salesforce where he leads product automation, says that Mulesoft has API management and integration tooling already, but RPA will add another dimension to those existing capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that many of our customers also need to automate and integrate with disconnected systems, with PDFs, with spreadsheets, but also these legacy systems that don&#8217;t have events or API&#8217;s. And so we wanted to make sure that we can meet our customers where they are, and that we could have this end-to-end, solution to automate these capabilities,&#8221; Kucera told me.</p>
<p>The company will be packaging ServiceTrace as a part of Mulesoft, while blending it with other parts of the Salesforce family of integration tools, as well as other parts of the platform. The Mulesoft RPA tool will live under the Einstein Automate umbrella, but Mulesoft will also sell it as a stand-alone service, so customers can take advantage of it, even if they aren&#8217;t using other parts of the Mulesoft platform or even the broader Salesforce platform. Einstein is the name of Salesforce&#8217;s artificial intelligence capabilities. Although RPA isn&#8217;t really AI, it can become integrated into an AI-fueled workflow like this.</p>

<p>The Mulesoft acquisition always seemed to be about giving Salesforce, a fully cloud company at its core, a way to access on-prem, legacy enterprise systems, allowing customers to reach data wherever it lives. Adding RPA to the mix takes that a step further, enabling companies to build connections to these systems inside their more modern Einstein Automate workflow tooling to systems that previously wouldn&#8217;t have been accessible to the Einstein Automate system.</p>
<p>This is often the case for many large companies, which typically use a mix of newer and often very old systems. Giving them a way to link the two and bring automation across the company could prove quite useful if it truly works as described.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is announcing all of these capabilities at the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/">Dreamforce</a>, its annual customer conference taking place next week. As with many announcements at the conference, this one is designed to let customers know what&#8217;s coming, rather than something that&#8217;s available now (or at least soon). Salesforce RPA is not expected to be ready for general availability until some time in the first half of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://concreit.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concreit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that wants to open real estate investing to a broader group of people, announced today that it has closed $6 million in a seed funding round led by Matrix Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyphen Capital also participated in the round, in addition to individual investors such as Betterment founder and CEO Jon Stein; Andy Liu, partner at Unlock Venture Partners; and investor and advisor Ben Elowitz. Concreit raised the capital at a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $22.5 million post-money valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seattle-based startup also today launched its app, which it claims allows “anyone” to invest in the global private real estate market for as little as $1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lofty claim. But first let’s start with some background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concreit is not the first time that co-founders Sean Hsieh and Jordan Levy have worked together. The pair previously founded and bootstrapped VoIP communications platform Flowroute before </span><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/cloud-based-telecommunications-company-flowroute-acquired-west-corporation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling it to West Corp.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018. Upon the sale of that company, Hsieh and Levy set out to build a company that, in their words, “could help everyday people become more financially secure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hsieh, a second-generation immigrant, worked in his family’s restaurant where they shared the dream of achieving financial freedom through real estate. Similarly, Levy says he grew up watching his parents build a small construction business from scratch. He was intrigued by the idea of passive income through single-family rental homes but became disillusioned with the overhead, risk and hassle of managing one’s own single-family rental investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the duo worked together to design a mobile-first offering that could enable small investors to benefit from real estate “without the burden of making repairs at 2 a.m. on a Saturday.” Enter Concreit. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="o8uvfJcjLp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/">10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/embed/#?secret=o8uvfJcjLp" data-secret="o8uvfJcjLp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, most investors can open a Concreit account and make their first investment in just minutes on their mobile device, the company claims. The company’s free mobile app allows consumers to invest as little as $1 into a fund managed by a team of investment professionals. Withdrawals can be requested at any time through the app and sent upon approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform facilitates weekly earned payouts, automated investments and on-demand withdrawals while compounding earned payouts weekly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After selling Flowroute, Hsieh says he “saw the opportunity to earn a great APR through private real estate investing while gaining less correlation with traditional public stocks or bonds markets,” Hsieh said. “But they were only for the already wealthy or required multiyear commitments of capital. Concreit gives everyone access to a real estate portfolio and the ability to have access to withdrawals when they need them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, the startup wants to make it easy for anyone &#8212; not just the wealthy &#8212; to invest in real estate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concreit, Hsieh said, offers “regular people” the ability to access real estate strategies typically used by large hedge funds and private equity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re seeing a surge of retail demand for alternatives and other ways to invest outside of the public markets and the crypto space for those that value diversification,” Hsieh told TechCrunch.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most other competitors are focused on marketing and selling securities, but we knew in order to be an innovator in this space we had to produce a truly unique experience for our investors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concreit’s platform is designed to be a more connected investment experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew early on that digital natives deserved a whole new real estate investing experience and that it had to be 100x better than just taking traditional real estate investment opportunities and offering them digitally,” Hsieh said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So on the platform side, Concreit has built a cloud-based proprietary securities accounting engine that allows the company to process fractional calculations and pull in a lot of mutual fund practices, applying them toward the “more labor-intensive” private equity markets, with a focus on real estate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve taken a lot of the cloud-architectural work that we&#8217;ve pioneered in the telecommunications space and applied it towards a back-office accounting solution that gives us a competitive edge around what we offer to our investors,” Hsieh said. “This affords the ability to run accounting at a higher frequency, which is how we are able to run weekly dividends, process fractional redemptions and ultimately a more real-time experience for our users.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concreit’s first private REIT fund, focused on passive income, consists of lower-risk fixed-income </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">private market residential and commercial real estate first-lien mortgages. The fund, which the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company says has an annualized return of 5.47%, is managed by a team of industry professionals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has added over 18,000 customers to its platform since it was qualified by the SEC (slightly over a year ago), and doubled its user base in the month of August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ur current users can invest with any dollar amount, no lock-ups, weekly payouts, and an experience that’s as easy &amp; familiar as a savings account,” Hsieh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix’s </span><a href="https://matrixpartners.com/team/dana-stalder/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dana Stalder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who joined Concreit’s board as part of the financing, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concreit has leveled the playing field for real estate investing by making it more accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What Concreit has built is incredibly hard to do from both a technology and regulatory standpoint,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he told TechCrunch. “Alternative asset classes, in particular, have been notoriously closed off to the average consumer, leaving high yield returns exclusively to wealthy investors. “</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">New Zealand-based medtech startup HeartLab has raised $2.45 million in seed funding that it says will help the company expand its AI-powered heart scanning and reporting platform to cardiologists in the United States by early next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">HeartLab provides an end-to-end solution for echocardiograms, the ultrasound tests that doctors use to examine a patient&#8217;s heart structure and function. Not only does the software help sort and analyze ultrasound images to help doctors diagnose cardiovascular disease, but it also streamlines the workflow by generating patient reports for doctors that can then be added to a patient&#8217;s health record.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Will Hewitt, 21, started HeartLab when he was 18 years old studying applied mathematics and statistics at the University of Auckland and working as a researcher at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute. The idea for the startup came to him as he listened to cardiologist, and now co-founder, Patrick Gladding explain how time-consuming and potentially inaccurate it is for doctors to have to review multiple scans manually everyday.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/embed/#?secret=A2aZQWeqV2" data-secret="A2aZQWeqV2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a really repetitive manual task done by a highly trained professional,&#8221; Hewitt told TechCrunch. &#8220;To start with, we just decided to train the AI to do one really small part of the doctor&#8217;s job, which was to look at these scans and generate a couple of different measurements that normally the doctor would have to do themselves,&#8221; said Hewitt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to replicate the tedious process that doctors were doing, HeartLab built its own in-house labeling tool with sonographers that includes step-by-step guides and prompts to collect data on a range of different measurements. Hewitt said this initiative was one of the most valuable efforts of engineering the company has invested in to date because it has lead to cross validation, which is used to test the ability of the machine learning model to predict new data, as well as flag problems like selection bias and overfitting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once HeartLab was able to successfully replicate the scanning process, the company worked to expand its services in a way that would relieve doctors of further admin minutiae so they could spend more time actually treating their patients. Usually, doctors use a software tool that analyzes the images, another that visualizes patterns and another that actually writes up the report, says Hewitt. HeartLab&#8217;s platform, called Pulse, can now condense those processes into one software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Cardiologists and sonographers at four different sites in New Zealand are trialing HeartLab&#8217;s tech now, which is also awaiting regulatory approval from the U.S.&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration. HeartLab anticipates FDA approval of Pulse by the first quarter of 2022, which is when the startup can begin selling the SaaS product.</p>
<p>&#8220;To begin with we want to talk to small and medium clinics over in the U.S.,&#8221; said Hewitt. &#8220;We&#8217;ve actually found that our products are most popular at those clinics because it replaces more software than at a larger clinic. At a larger clinic some of these bits of software they&#8217;ve already had to purchase, versus a smaller clinic, it&#8217;s stuff that they couldn&#8217;t access anyway. So when we get to the states, we want to start shipping mostly to those sorts of users while we work out how to best pitch our value proposition to the larger clinics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hewitt says the funds from this round will also help the startup hire 10 more staff members to join the existing 13-member team based in Auckland. Having more tech talent on board will help HeartLab advance its product offering. At the moment, Pulse is at the point where it sees so many scans and takes so many measurements that it can get through the process quicker than a doctor could on their own and actually pick out patterns that a doctor wouldn&#8217;t see, according to Hewitt. The next step, which a good chunk of the seed funding is going toward, is how to be diagnostic about disease rather than just being able to indicate it.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we actually provide something that normally doctors would have to order another scan for?&#8221; said Hewitt. &#8220;One of the key ideas with AI is you can create mappings from low-resolution images like ultrasounds. How can we try to learn a pattern from an ultrasound that&#8217;s similar to what you might see from an MRI, for example?&#8221;</p>
<p>If HeartLab can figure out how to glean advanced information from an echocardiogram instead of an MRI, it would be able to save hospitals, clinics and patients a lot of money. Each cardiac MRI can cost about <a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2019/01/07/12/42/for-the-fits-the-future-of-cardiovascular-imaging-considerations-for-fits#:~:text=Each%20cardiac%20MRI%20scan%20can,times%20the%20cost%20of%20echocardiography.">$1,000 to $5,000</a>, which is about five times the price of an echocardiogram.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say the biggest challenge for us is, how can we transform from a company that at the moment can deliver products to a few local clinics successfully to actually building a product that scales and delivers a really good experience to lots of users and different hospitals?&#8221; said Hewitt.</p>
<p>Advancements in early diagnostics and imaging tech like HeartLabs&#8217; is causing an increased demand for such tools. As a result, the global <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/12/09/2142533/0/en/AI-Enabled-Medical-Imaging-Solutions-Market-Size-To-Be-Worth-USD-4-720-6-Million-by-2027-Emergen-Research.html">AI-enabled medical imaging solutions market is expected to reach $4.7 billion by 2027</a>. By extending its reach to the U.S., where heart disease is the leading cause of death, HeartLab is poised to take a big piece of that pie.</p>
<p>In total, HeartLab has publicly raised about $3.2 million in funding, which includes a <a href="https://www.hinz.org.nz/news/531115/Health-AI-start-up-raises-1.1m.htm">pre-seed last October</a> of about $800,000 led by Icehouse Ventures with support from Founders Fund, the San Francisco-based VC firm that led the round announced on Thursday. Icehouse Ventures also contributed to the oversubscribed seed round, along with another New Zealand firm Outset Ventures and private investor and CEO of design platform Figma, Dylan Field.</p>
<p>“The use of AI in medicine is reducing pressures on health systems and ultimately saving lives,&#8221; said Founders Fund partner Scott Nolan, who has led investment rounds for three other New Zealand startups, in a statement. &#8220;The HeartLab team has built a really compelling AI-powered platform that doctors love to use.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2019, SoftBank Group International made headlines when it announced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the SoftBank Innovation Fund, which started out with </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-the-innovation-fund-committing-2b-to-invest-in-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $2 billion commitment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to invest in tech startups in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot has changed since then. SoftBank changed the name of the fund to the SoftBank Latin America Fund, or LatAm Fund for short. The Japanese investment conglomerate has dramatically ramped up its investing in the region, and so have a number of other global investors. In fact, venture capitalists poured an estimated $6.2 billion into Latin American startups in the first half of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As evidence of its continued commitment to the region, SoftBank Group announced today that it has added two new managing partners to its LatAm Fund team: Rodrigo Baer and Marco Camhaji. The two will focus on “identifying and supporting” early-stage companies across the Latin American region, SoftBank told TechCrunch exclusively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baer and Camhaji will report to SoftBank Executive President &amp; COO Marcelo Claure, who points out that the firm’s LatAm fund has invested in more than two-thirds of the nearly two dozen </span><a href="https://lavca.org/latin-america-unicorn-leaderboard/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unicorns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently operating in the region. He said that SoftBank is today “one of the largest and most active” technology investors in the region.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move is significant in that the hires represent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an expansion of SoftBank LatAm Fund’s mandate and means that the firm is now backing companies at all stages in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By bringing Baer and Camhaji on board, Claure said in a statement, SoftBank will “be better able to identify high-growth companies and support them at every step of their lifecycle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank describes Baer as one of the pioneers of Brazil’s venture capital industry. He has invested in more than 20 companies since 2010. According to Crunchbase, he co-founded Warehouse Investimentos in 2010, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">where he led deal-sourcing efforts. He joined the investment team of Redpoint eVentures, a LatAm-based early-stage VC fund, in June 2014. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also was previously an engagement manager at McKinsey and worked at Aurora Funds, a healthcare-services focused fund based in the US. He is also active with Endeavor and multiple angel groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to joining SoftBank, Camhaji was a business development principal at Amazon, establishing strategic partnerships with fintechs in Latin America. He also served as the CEO of Adianta, a Brazilian B2B invoice financing company. Previously, Camahji was a founder and partner at Yellow Ventures, making seed investments in technology startups. He was also a partner and CFO of Redpoint eVentures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shu Nyatta, a managing partner at SoftBank who co-leads its $5 billion Latin America Fund, pointed out a dynamic that might seem obvious but is rarely articulated: Technology in LatAm is often more about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">inclusion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">disruption</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>“The vast majority of the population is underserved in almost every category of consumption. Similarly, most businesses are underserved by modern software solutions,” Nyatta told TechCrunch. “There’s so much to build for so many people and businesses. In San Francisco, the venture ecosystem makes life a little better for individuals and businesses who are already living in the future. In LatAm, tech entrepreneurs are building the future for everyone else.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some recent </span><a href="https://www.latinamericafund.com/portfolio"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank investments in the region</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include:</span></p>

</ul>
<p>As global investors continue to flood the region with capital, it&#8217;s clear that SoftBank is getting even more aggressive about backing startups in Latin America. Earlier this week, the firm also announced the launch of the SoftBank Latin America Fund II, its second dedicated private investment fund focused on tech companies located in LatAm, with an initial $3 billion commitment.</p>

The high speed wireless optical link technology originally developed for Loon is currently being used for another moonshot called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-taara-fsoc-internet-alphabet-econet-liquid-telecom-africa-103541990.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Project Taara</a>. In a new <a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/taara-beaming-broadband-across-congo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">blog post</a>, Taara&#8217;s Director of Engineering, Baris Erkmen, has revealed that the initiative&#8217;s wireless optical communications (WOC) links are now beaming high-speed connectivity across the Congo River.</p>
<p>The idea for Taara started when the Loon team successfully used WOC to beam data between Loon balloons that were more than 100 kilometers apart. The team wanted to explore how the technology can be used on the ground. As part of the team&#8217;s exploration on WOC&#8217;s potential applications, they worked on bridging the connectivity gap between Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>The two locations are separated by the Congo River and are only 4.8 kilometers apart. However, internet connectivity costs much, much more in Kinshasa, because providers will have to lay down enough fiber connection to cover 400 kilometers of ground around the river. What Project Taara did was install links that can beam high-speed connectivity from Brazzaville to Kinshasa across the river instead. Within 20 days and with 99.9 percent availability, the links served served nearly 700 TB of data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203651" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203651" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2203651" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed.gif" alt="How Project Taara's optical beaming connectivity works" width="1024" height="819" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2203651" class="wp-caption-text">How Project Taara&#8217;s optical beaming connectivity works.</p></div></p>
<p>Taara&#8217;s WOC links work by seeking each other out and linking their beams of light together to create a high-speed internet connection. It&#8217;s not ideal for use in foggy locations, but Project Taara has developed network planning tools that can estimate WOC availability based on various factors like weather. In the future, the team will be able to use those tools to plan for the locations where Taara&#8217;s technology will work best.</p>
<p>Baris Erkmen, Director of Engineering for Taara, wrote in the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Better tracking accuracy, automated environmental responses and better planning tools are helping Taara&#8217;s links deliver reliable high-speed bandwidth to places that fiber can&#8217;t reach, and helping us connect communities that are cut off from traditional ways of delivering connectivity. We&#8217;re really excited about these advances, and are looking forward to building on them as we continue developing and refining Taara&#8217;s capabilities.&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s said on Thursday it has acquired California-headquartered Tynker, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/tynker-raises-7-1m-to-expand-its-code-teaching-programs-to-new-schools-and-regions/">leading coding platform for K-12 students</a>, the latest in a series of major purchases as the Indian edtech giant attempts to aggressively expand to international markets.</p>
<p>The companies didn’t disclose the terms of the deal, but a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that the Indian firm is spending about $200 million on the acquisition.</p>
<p>Tynker, which counts BBC Learning, Google, Microsoft, Mattel and NASA among its partners, operates an eponymous coding platform. It has amassed over 60 million kids on its platform, Tynker founders told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/15/tynker-a-startup-that-teaches-kids-to-code-now-works-with-robots-drones-and-more/">eight-year-old startup</a> gamifies the learning experience &#8212; using robots and drones, for instance, to help kids visualise complex concepts &#8212; to make it more exciting for them to participate. The startup has partnerships &#8212; and presence in &#8212; over 100,000 schools across 150 nations, said Srinivas Mandyam.</p>
<p>Mandyam, as well as Tynker&#8217;s other co-founders &#8212; Krishna Vedati and Kelvin Chong &#8212; will continue with the firm after the acquisition, they said. Vedati said in an interview that the startups began exploring ways to collaborate earlier this year.</p>
<p>“At Tynker, we believe that kids of all ages should develop the critical thinking skills needed to become the ‘makers of tomorrow’,” said Vedati, who serves as the startup&#8217;s chief executive.</p>
<p>“Our focus is on understanding what kids are passionate about – whether that’s building games, making animations or modding Minecraft – and we then create specific experiences, apps and personalized learning paths to empower them to create with code. We wholeheartedly believe that joining the BYJU’S family can help children on a global level develop the fundamental STEM skills that will serve them well as they progress in school and ultimately help prepare them for careers in both technical and non-technical fields.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Byju Raveendran, founder and chief executive of Byju&#8217;s, told TechCrunch in an interview that Tynker&#8217;s asynchronous offering fits perfectly in Byju&#8217;s current portfolio. India&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">most valuable startup</a> acquired WhiteHat Jr, a coding platform that offers synchronous classes, last year in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">a $300 million deal</a>. &#8220;Tynker&#8217;s offering is complimentary to WhiteHat Jr&#8217;s,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Tynker is the latest firm to be acquired by Byju&#8217;s, which has amassed over 100 million registered users &#8212; about 6.5 million of whom are paid customers &#8212; across the globe. The Bangalore-headquartered startup has this year also acquired Scholr, Aakash Institute, Hashlearn, Epic, and Great Learning for over $2 billion in cash and equity deals. Just last week it revealed that it had also purchased Times Internet-backed Gradeup for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p>Raveendran said that Byju&#8217;s is continuing to explore more merger and acquisition opportunities. These acquisitions are helping Byju&#8217;s aggressively broaden its offerings and tap international markets in more meaningful ways, he said.</p>
<p>On the other side of the business, the Indian edtech giant &#8212; which has raised over $1.5 billion since the pandemic broke last year &#8212; is also beginning to explore an initial public offering. The startup has begun conversations with bankers, some of whom have given the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/">a proposed valuation of up to $50 billion</a>, TechCrunch reported first last month.</p>
<p>Raveendran confirmed that the &#8220;IPO is on the cards,&#8221; but said it&#8217;s too early to comment on a precise timeline.</p>
