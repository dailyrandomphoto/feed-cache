<p>Xwing has scored another win two months after it completed its first gate-to-gate autonomous demonstration flight of a commercial cargo aircraft. The company said Thursday it has raised $40 million at a post-money valuation of $400 million.</p>
<p>The company is setting its sights on expansion – not only tripling its engineering team, but eventually running regular fully unmanned commercial cargo flights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Xwing has been developing a technology stack to convert aircraft, including a widely used Cessna Grand Caravan 208B, to function autonomously. But it’s had to solve a few problems first: “the perception problem, the planning problem and the control problem,” Xwing founder Marc Piette explained to TechCrunch. The company has come up with a whole suite of solutions to solve for these problems, including integrating lidar, radar and cameras on the plane; retrofitting the servomotors that control the rudder, braking and other functions; and ensuring all of these are communicating properly so the plane understands where it is in space and can execute its flight.</p>
<p>The company has already performed close to 200 missions with its AutoFlight system. For all these flights, there’s been a safety pilot on board. In addition, a ground control operator sits in a control center and acts as a go-between from the autonomous aircraft to the human air traffic control operator.</p>
<p>“We don’t anticipate automating [communication with air traffic control], trying to do natural language processing and having a computer make the response to the air traffic controller,” Piette said. “For safety critical applications, we don’t view that as a useful path. . .but what we do, though, is we have a ground operator in our control room that just talks to air traffic control on behalf of the aircraft. So for the air traffic controller, it’s seamless. As far as they&#8217;re concerned, they are just talking to a pilot onboard the aircraft.”</p>

<p>For its autonomous flight activities, the company has authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly under an experimental airworthiness certificate for research and development that was expanded in August of last year to include a special flight permit for optionally piloted aircraft (OPA).</p>
<p>The company is looking to eventually remove the safety pilot, but only once full safety redundancies are in place, Piette added. That includes redundancies across all sensors and computer systems. Fortunately for all of us that fly, commercial aviation safety levels are extremely high. It means a high airworthiness standard for aviation startups. Smaller Class III aircraft like the ones Xwing is targeting must demonstrate a risk of one catastrophic failure per hundred million flight hours.</p>
<p>Xwing’s activities have garnered attention from investors. This most recent funding round was led by Blackhorn Ventures, with participation from ACME Capital, Loup Ventures, R7 Partners, Eniac Ventures, Alven Capital and Array Ventures. Including this round, the company has raised $55 million in total capital.</p>
<p>The autonomous flights are only one part of Xwing’s business activities. It’s also been flying manned commercial cargo operations under a contract with a large logistics company signed December 1.</p>
<p>“We set up what’s effectively an airline,” Piette said. By modifying these aircraft with sensors to collect data, Xwing is able to feed this valuable flight time into a training algorithm, and collect other useful data, such as how often the pilots communicate with air traffic controllers and the types of directions the craft receives.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company will be significantly scaling its workforce over the next 12 months, in addition to increasing its commercial operations in parallel. On the technology side, Xwing is looking to fly autonomous commercial cargo flights, with a safety pilot onboard, under an experimental ticket and exemption from the FAA. The company will likely reach this milestone also within the next twelve months, Piette said. After that, it would look to remove the safety pilot from the aircraft. Even then, the company would still need to get its systems certified to completely remove any constraints on its movements in airspace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tecton.ai/">Tecton</a>, the company that pioneered the notion of <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/">the machine learning feature store</a>, has teamed up with the founder of the open source feature store project called <a href="https://feast.dev/">Feast</a>. Today the company announced the release of version 0.10 of the open source tool.</p>
<p>The feature store is a concept that the Tecton founders came up with when they were engineers at Uber. Shortly thereafter an engineer named Willem Pienaar read the founder&#8217;s Uber blog posts on building a feature store and went to work building Feast as an open source version of the concept.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of Tecton [involved bringing] feature stores to the industry, so we build basically the best in class, enterprise feature store. [&#8230;] Feast is something that Willem created, which I think was inspired by some of the early designs that we published at Uber. And he built Feast and it evolved as kind of like the standard for open source feature stores, and it&#8217;s now part of the Linux Foundation,&#8221; Tecton co-founder and CEO Mike Del Balso explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tecton later hired Pienaar, who is today an engineer at the company where he leads their open source team. While the company did not originally start off with a plan to build an open source product, the two products are closely aligned, and it made sense to bring Pienaar on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;The products are very similar in a lot of ways. So I think there&#8217;s a similarity there that makes this somewhat symbiotic, and there is no explicit convergence necessary. The Tecton product is a superset of what Feast has. So it&#8217;s an enterprise version with a lot more advanced functionality, but at Feast we have a battle-tested feature store that&#8217;s open source,&#8221; Pienaar said.</p>
<p>As we wrote in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/tecton-ai-nabs-35m-series-b-as-it-releases-machine-learning-feature-store/">a December 2020 story</a> on the company&#8217;s $35 million Series B, it describes a feature store as &#8220;an end-to-end machine learning management system that includes the pipelines to transform the data into what are called feature values, then it stores and manages all of that feature data and finally it serves a consistent set of data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Del Balso says that from a business perspective, contributing to the open source feature store exposes his company to a different group of users, and the commercial and open source products can feed off one another as they build the two products.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we really like, and what we feel is very powerful here, is that we&#8217;re deeply in the Feast community and get to learn from all of the interesting use cases [&#8230;] to improve the Tecton product. And similarly, we can use the feedback that we&#8217;re hearing from our enterprise customers to improve the open source project. That&#8217;s the kind of cross learning, and ideally that feedback loop involved there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The plan is for Tecton to continue being a primary contributor with a team inside Tecton dedicated to working on Feast. Today, the company is releasing version 0.10 of the project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.casa-blanca.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casa Blanca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to develop a “Bumble-like app” for finding a home, has raised $2.6 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Hannah Bomze got her real estate license at the age of 18 and worked at Compass and  Douglas Elliman Real Estate before launching Casa Blanca last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She launched the app last October with the goal of matching home buyers and renters with homes using an in-app matchmaking algorithm combined with “expert agents.” Buyers get up to 1% of home purchases back at closing. Similar to dating apps, Casa Blanca’s app is powered by a simple swipe left or right.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samuel Ben-Avraham, a partner and early investor of Kith and an early investor in WeWork, led the round for Casa Blanca, bringing its total raise to date to $4.1 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York-based startup recently launched in the Colorado market and has seen some impressive traction in a short amount of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching the app in October, Casa Blance has “made more than $100M in sales” and is projected to reach $280 million this year between New York and its Denver launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bomze said the app experience will be customized for each city with the goal of creating a personalized experience for each user. Casa Blanca claims to streamline and sort listings based on user preferences and lifestyle priorities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People love that there is one place to book, manage feedback, schedule and communicate with a branded agent for one cohesive experience,” Bomze said. “We have a breadth of users from first time buyers to people using our platform for $15 million listings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike competitors, Casa Blanca applies to a direct-to-consumer model, she pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While our agents are an integral part of the company, they are not responsible for bringing in business and have more organizational support, which allows them to focus on the individual more and creates a better end-to-end experience for the consumer,” Bomze said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casa Blanca currently has over 38 agents in NYC and Colorado, compared to about 15 at this time last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a growth phase and finding a unique opportunity in this climate, in particular, because there are many women exploring new, more flexible job opportunities,” Bomze noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to continue expanding into new markets, nationally and globally; enhancingits technology and scaling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we continue to grow in new markets, the app experience will be curated to each city &#8211; for example, in Colorado you can edit your preferences based on access to ski areas &#8211; to make sure we’re offering a personalized experience for each user,” Bomze said.</span></p>

Existing investors Base10 Partners and Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI-focused VC) also participated. This brings the company’s total financing to $54 million. The company will use the capital raised to accelerate product development. The previous $18M A round was led by Base10 and Google&#8217;s Gradient Ventures 9 months ago.</p>

<p>Launched in 2016, Chili Piper’s software for B2B revenue teams is designed to convert leads into attended meetings. Sales teams can also use it to book demos, increase inbound conversion rates, eliminate manual lead routing, and streamline critical processes around meetings. It&#8217;s used by Intuit, Twilio, Forrester, Spotify, and Gong.</p>
<p>Chili Piper has a number of different tools for businesses to schedule and calendar accountments, but its key USP is in its use by ‘inbound SDR Sales Development Representatives (SDR)’, who are responsible for qualifying inbound sales leads. It’s particularly useful in scheduling calls when customers hit websites ask for a salesperson to call them back.</p>
<p>Nicolas Vandenberghe, CEO, and co-founder of Chili Piper said: “When we started we sold the house and decided to grow the company ourselves. So all the way until 2019 we bootstrapped. Tiger gave us a valuation that we expected to get at the end of this year, which will help us accelerate things much faster, so we couldn&#8217;t refuse it.”</p>
<p>Alina Vandenberghe, CPO, and Co-founder said: “We’re proud to have so many customers scheduling meetings and optimizing their calendars with Chili Piper’s Instant Booker.&#8221;</p>
<p>The husband-and-wife founded company has was fully remote from day one, with 93 employees in 81 cities and 21 countries, long before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global said: “When we met Nicolas and Alina, we were fired up by their product vision and focus on customer happiness.”</p>
<p>TJ Nahigian, Managing Partner at Base10 Partners, added: “We originally invested in Chili Piper because we knew customers needed ways to add fire to how they connected with inbound leads. We’ve been absolutely blown away with the progress over the past year, 2020 has been a step-change for this company as business went remote.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce is booming, but among the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs of online businesses are finding a place to store the items they are selling and dealing with the logistics of operating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler Scriven, Maxwell Bonnie and Paul D’Arrigo co-founded </span><a href="https://www.saltbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to solve that problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio came up with a unique “co-warehousing” model that provides space for small businesses and e-commerce merchants to operate as well as store and ship goods, all under one roof. Beyond the physical offering, Saltbox offers integrated logistics services as well as amenities such as the rental of equipment and packing stations and access to items such as forklifts. There are no leases and tenants have the flexibility to scale up or down based on their needs.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in that sweet spot between co-working and raw warehouse space,” said CEO Scriven, a former Palantir executive and Techstars managing director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltbox opened its first facility &#8212; a 27,000-square-foot location &#8212; in its home base of Atlanta in late 2019, filling it within two months. It recently opened its second facility, a 66,000-square-foot location, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that is currently about 40% occupied. The company plans to end 2021 with eight locations, in particular eyeing the Denver, Seattle and Los Angeles markets. Saltbox has locations slated to come online as large as 110,000 square feet, according to Scriven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was founded on the premise that the need for “co-warehousing and SMB-centric logistics enablement solutions” has become a major problem for many new businesses that rely on online retail platforms to sell their goods, noted Scriven. Many of those companies are limited to self-storage and mini-warehouse facilities for storing their inventory, which can be expensive and inconvenient. </span></p>
<p>Scriven personally met with challenges when starting his own e-commerce business, True Glory Brands, a retailer of multicultural hair and beauty products.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We became aware of the lack of physical workspace for SMBs engaged in commerce,” Scriven told TechCrunch. “If you are in the market looking for 10,000 square feet of industrial warehouse space, you are effectively pushed to the fringes of the real estate ecosystem and then the entrepreneurial ecosystem at large. This is costing companies in significant but untold ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Saltbox has completed a $10.6 million Series A round of financing led by Palo Alto-based Playground Global that included participation from XYZ Venture Capital and proptech-focused Wilshire Lane Partners in addition to existing backers Village Capital and MetaProp. The company plans to use its new capital primarily to expand into new markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s customers are typically SMB e-commerce merchants “generating anywhere from $50,000 to $10 million a year in revenue,” according to Scriven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasizes that the company’s value prop is “quite different” from a traditional flex office/co-working space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our members are reliant upon us to support critical workflows,” Scriven said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides e-commerce occupants, many service-based businesses are users of Saltbox’s offering, he said, such as those providing janitorial services or that need space for physical equipment. The company offers all-inclusive pricing models that include access to loading docks and a photography studio, for example, in addition to utilities and Wi-Fi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company secures its properties with a mix of buying and leasing by partnering with institutional real estate investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These partners are acquiring assets and in most cases, are funding the entirety of capital improvements by entering into management or revenue share agreements to operate those properties,” Scriven said. He said the model is intentionally different from that of “notable flex space operators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have obviously followed those stories very closely and done our best to learn from their experiences,” he added. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Everyone warns you not to build on top of someone else’s platform.</p>
<p>When I first started in VC more than 10 years ago, I was told never to invest in a company building on top of another company’s platform. Dependence on a platform makes you susceptible to failure and caps the return on your investment because you have no control over API access, pricing changes and end-customer data, among other legitimate concerns.</p>
<p>I am sure many of you recall Facebook shutting down its API access back in 2015, or the uproar Apple caused when it decided to change the commission it was charging app developers in 2020.</p>
<p>Put simply, founders can no longer avoid the decision around platform dependency.</p>
<p>Salesforce in many ways paved the way for large enterprise platform companies, being the first dedicated SaaS company to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue supported by its open application development marketplace. Salesforce’s success has given rise to dominant platforms in other verticals, and for founders starting companies, there is no avoiding that platform decision these days.</p>
<p>Some points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 4,000 fintech companies, including several unicorns, have <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/01/plaid-raising-at-15bn-as-employees-pitched-1200-per-share/">built</a> their platforms on top of Plaid.</li>
<li>Recruiters may complain about the cost, but <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/2017-05-05/how-headhunters-use-linkedin-to-find-talented-candidates">95%</a> still utilize LinkedIn.</li>
<li>More than 20,000 companies trust <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a> to be their system of record for customer data.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> powers over 1 million businesses across the globe.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.epic.com/">Epic</a> has the medical records of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/epic/why_epic/">nearly 50%</a> of the U.S. population.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this mean for founders who decide to build on top of another platform?</p>
<h2>Increase speed to market</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.postscript.io/">PostScript</a>, an SMS/MMS marketing platform for commerce brands, built its platform on Shopify, giving it immediate access to over 1 million brands and a direct customer acquisition funnel. That has allowed PostScript to capture 3,500 of its own customers and successfully close a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/postscript-raises-35m-to-give-shopify-stores-sms-superpowers/">$35 million Series B</a> in March 2021.</p>
<h2>Ability to focus on core functionality</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.varomoney.com/">Varo</a>, one of the fastest-growing neobanks, started in 2015 with the principle that a bank could put customers’ interests first and be profitable. But in order to deliver on its mission, it needed to understand where its customers were spending their money. By partnering with Plaid, Varo <a href="https://plaid.com/documents/varo-case-study.pdf">enabled</a> more than 176,000 of its users to connect their Varo account to outside apps and services, allowing Varo to focus on its core mission to provide more relevant financial products and services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the seemingly unending debate around <a href="https://substack.com">Substack</a> has focused on well-known writers with a national profile, the newsletter platform just announced that it will be supporting local (presumably non-famous) journalists through a new program.</p>
<p>The startup described <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/introducing-substack-local-for-a">Substack Local</a> as a $1 million initiative that will fund independent writers creating local news publications. Similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">the Substack Pro program</a>, the company will offer cash advances of up to $100,000, as well as mentorship and &#8220;subsidized access&#8221; to health insurance and design services. In exchange, Substack will take 85% of subscription revenue for a year (its cut goes back to the standard 10% after that).</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0KKTcoM5meemtYYmcPnnXXHk__cDB-2PTDc9VRid_MblpdA/viewform">Applications</a> are due by April 29, with participants selected by a panel of judges with their own Substack publications — Zeynep Tufekci of Insight, Anne Helen Petersen of Culture Study, Dick Tofel of Second Rough Draft and Rachel Larimore, managing editor of The Dispatch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Substack said that through this initiative, it&#8217;s also partnering with New Zealand-based <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz">Stuff</a> to launch two new publications covering under-served regions in the country.</p>

<p>A Substack skeptic might suggest that programs like this are an easy way to drum up positive publicity. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/facebook-local-news-2/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/google-announces-a-journalism-emergency-relief-fund-for-local-newsrooms/">Google</a> have also announced programs to support local news.) In Substack&#8217;s case, this comes after the platform has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">criticized for bankrolling transphobic writers</a> with big advances — just a few days ago, the company revealed that it has recently signed lucrative contracts with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html">transgender writers including Daniel Lavery</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of motivation, the need for more local journalism is real, with news deserts created by <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2018/about-1300-u-s-communities-have-totally-lost-news-coverage-unc-news-desert-study-finds/">the shutdowns and struggles of many local newspapers</a>. If there&#8217;s going to be any hope, it seems more likely to come from new, digitally-focused publications and independent journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a grants program, nor is it inspired by philanthropic intent,&#8221; the company wrote in <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/introducing-substack-local-for-a">a blog post</a>. &#8220;Our goal is to foster an effective business model for independent local news that provides ample room for growth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced this morning it will begin testing a new experience for discovering businesses in its News Feed in the U.S. When live, users to tap on topics they&#8217;re interested in underneath posts and ads in their News Feed in order to explore related content from businesses. The change comes at a time when Facebook has been arguing how Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">App Tracking Transparency</a> update will impact its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">small business customers</a> &#8212; a claim many <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/facebooks-misleading-campaign-against-apples-privacy-policy">have</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sorry-facebook-ios-changes-not-bad-for-small-businesses/">dismissed</a> as misleading, but nevertheless led some <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">mom and pop shops to express concern</a> about the impacts to their ad targeting capabilities, as a result. This new test is an example of how easily Facebook can tweak its News Feed to build out more data on its users, if needed.</p>
<p>The company suggests users may see the change under posts and ads from businesses selling beauty products, fitness or clothing, among other things.</p>
<p>The idea here is that Facebook would direct users to related businesses through a News Feed feature, when they take a specific action to discover related content. This, in turn, could help Facebook create a new set of data on its users, in terms of which users clicked to see more, and what sort of businesses they engaged with, among other things. Over time, it could turn this feature into an ad unit, if desired, where businesses could pay for higher placement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People already discover businesses while scrolling through News Feed, and this will make it easier to discover and consider new businesses they might not have found on their own,&#8221; the company noted in a brief <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-facebook-tools-for-online-marketing">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook didn&#8217;t detail its further plans with the test, but said as it learned from how users interacted with the feature, it will expand the experience to more people and businesses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139153" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139153" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139153" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg 2360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=768,653 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=680,579 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1307 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1743 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139153" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Along with news of the test, Facebook said it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-facebook-business-suite-features-including-stories">will roll out more tools</a> for business owners this month, including the ability to create, publish and schedule Stories to both Facebook and Instagram; make changes and edits to Scheduled Posts; and soon, create and manage Facebook Photos and Albums from Facebook&#8217;s Business Suite. It will also soon add the ability to create and save Facebook and Instagram posts as drafts from the Business Suite mobile app.</p>
<p>Related to the businesses updates, Facebook updated features across ad products focused on connecting businesses with customer leads, including Lead Ads, Call Ads, and Click to Messenger Lead Generations.</p>
<p>Facebook earlier this year announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-redesigns-pages-with-a-more-simplified-layout-and-no-like-button/">a new Facebook Page experience</a> that gave businesses the ability to engage on the social network with their business profile for things like posting, commenting and liking, and access to their own, dedicated News Feed. And it had removed the Like button in favor of focusing on Followers.</p>
<p>It is not a coincidence that Facebook is touting its tools for small businesses at a time when there&#8217;s concern &#8212; much of it loudly shouted by Facebook itself &#8212; that its platform could be less useful to small business owners in the near future, when ad targeting capabilities becomes less precise as users vote &#8216;no&#8217; when Facebook&#8217;s iOS app asks if it can track them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When I&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://www.stationhead.com">Stationhead</a> in the past, I&#8217;ve focused on how the startup aims to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/23/stationhead-on-demand/">bring the personality and interactivity of a live radio broadcast</a> to streaming music. But CEO Ryan Star said his ambitions are broader now: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be the largest social audio platform in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup says it&#8217;s growing quickly, with 100,000 monthly active users — a number that&#8217;s increasing by 65% each month — and 500,000 total users. There are 6,300 hosts on the platform, and they created nearly 2 million live and recorded streams in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p>COO Murray Levison told me that the pandemic has brought more artists to the platform as they look for new ways to reach their fans. For example, Cardi B <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9542786/cardi-b-billion-dollar-woman-aspirations-rihanna/">joined the fan show Bardigangradio last month</a>, prompting 132,000 paid streams of her new single on Apple Music and Spotify during the broadcast. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/stationhead/">Stationhead integrates with both music streaming services</a> — when a DJ cues up a song, it&#8217;s actually playing through your account.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, both Star (who co-founded the company due to his own frustrations as an independent musician) and Levison suggested that playing music is not quite as central to their vision as it used to be. Instead, they said Stationhead is all about live audio broadcasting, with or without music.</p>
<p>From a product perspective, Levison said they&#8217;re trying to build &#8220;the best broadcasting tools for creators and everyday people to use.&#8221; At the same time, he added, &#8220;Music is still at the core of what we’ve built. Just like games are to Twitch, music is our social glue.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1885415" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1885415" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1885415" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?w=680" alt="Ryan Star CEO Photo credit Shervin Lainez" width="680" height="489" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=680,489 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1885415" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shervin Lainez / Stationhead</p></div></p>
<p>While the company emphasizes the live experience (which Levison described as &#8220;the core value prop&#8221;), Stationhead also supports recording shows for listening later, and apparently 50% of users are listening to both live and recorded shows. It has also been beta testing a tipping feature that will allow broadcasters to monetize their shows.</p>
<p>Of course, you can&#8217;t talk about social audio without talking about Clubhouse, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">attracting 2 million active users each week</a> in January, according to CEO Paul Davison. Levison suggested that the buzz around Clubhouse has also benefited Stationhead as potential acquirers and investors get more excited about social audio. And Star argued that the companies are taking very different approaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s in the name Clubhouse, it&#8217;s exclusive,&#8221; Star said. &#8220;It’s about social climbing and getting closer to the stage. [Stationhead is] living in the world where Cardi B was excited to meet her fans. We are for the 99 percent.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.feels-app.com">Feels</a>, a new French startup that wants to change how dating apps work. According to the company, scrolling through photos and reading descriptions tend to be a boring experience. Feels want to improve profiles so that navigating the app feels more like watching TikTok videos or browsing stories.</p>
<p>“For the past 10 years, there’s been little innovation in the industry,” co-founder and CEO Daniel Cheaib told me. “The reason why many people uninstall dating apps is that it’s boring. Profiles all look the same and we feel like we’re browsing a catalog.”</p>
<p>In that case, Cheaib is thinking about Tinder, but also other dating apps that feel like Tinder but aren’t exactly Tinder, such as Bumble, Happn, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Feels’ founding team has spent two years iterating on the app to find out what works and what doesn’t. Now that retention metrics are where they’re supposed to be, the company is now ready to launch more widely.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139135" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139135" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the app Feels" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2139135" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139135" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Feels</p></div></p>
<p>If you want to show interesting content to your users in a dating app, you have to rethink profiles. Arguably, this has been the most difficult part of the development phase. When you install the app, it takes around 15 minutes to create your profile.</p>
<p>At first, only 30% of new users finished the onboarding process. Now, around 75% of new users reach the end of the signup flow.</p>
<p>So what makes a profile on Feels different? In many ways, a profile looks more like a story, or TikTok posts. Users can record videos, add text and stickers, share photos, answer questions and more.</p>
<p>“When you’re done with the onboarding process, you have consistent profiles with people sharing content about them,” Cheaib said.</p>
<p>Like other dating apps, there are many options when it comes to gender identity — you’re not limited to woman or man. You can then say that you want to see all profiles or just some profiles based on various criteria.</p>
<p>After that, you can look at other profiles. Once again, Feels tries to change the basic interaction of dating apps. Most dating apps require you to swipe left or right, or give a thumbs up or a thumbs down. When you think about it, it’s a binary choice that requires a ton of micro decisions.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you don’t have any strong feelings about someone. Or maybe you just want to go to the next profile. And the fact that you have to triage profiles like this leads to a lot negativity, whether it’s conscious or subconscious —&nbsp;you keep rejecting people, after all.</p>
<p>When you’re looking at a profile on Feels, it fills up your entire screen. Videos start playing, you can see what the person likes and who they are in front of a camera. You can react on some content or you can simply move on by swiping up. There’s no heart or like button.</p>
<p>When the startup thought they finally were going somewhere, they raised a $1.3 million funding round (€1.1 million) from a long list of business angels, such as somebody in Atomico’s business angel program, Blaise Matuidi, Eric Besson, René Ricol, Ricardo Pereira , Yohan Benalouane, Nampalys Mendy, Jean Romain Lhomme, Julien Radic and Jean Michel Chami.</p>
<p>Now, Feels plans to attract new users with organic TikTok posts, some TV ads and more. The company wants to reach one million users by the end of the year with a big focus on France for now. There are 100,000 users right now.</p>
<p>When it comes to monetization, Feels started offering a premium subscription to unlock more features. The company is still iterating on that part.</p>
<p>Feels is just getting started in a crowded and competitive industry. Unlike other companies, Feels has invested heavily in its own product before working on user acquisition and paid installs. It’s an ambitious strategy but it has a lot of potential as it could lead to a truly different dating app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Graphic designer Paul Rand once famously said that the public was more familiar with bad design than good design. While he was referring to most of the design in the world being &#8220;bad&#8221;, these days that phrase might take on a second meaning: people typically only notice and talk about (and usually complain about) design when it is ugly, or works badly. Conversely, if it&#8217;s good, and it works, you don&#8217;t hear much.</p>
<p>Today a startup called <a href="https://www.userzoom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UserZoom</a> that has built a platform used by companies like Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Salesforce and many others stay off the bad design radar &#8212; with tools to evaluate their design and identify where and when it doesn&#8217;t work, and how to link it up better with bigger customer experience strategies &#8212; is announcing some significant funding to expand its business.</p>
<p>The company has raised $100 million &#8212; money that CEO and co-founder Alfonso de la Nuez said will be used to continue building its tools and mission to make design as critical to a company&#8217;s mission as sales might be to an e-commerce company. Alongside this, it has made an acquisition, of another experience insights company called EnjoyHQ, to expand its research operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We feel companies are only scratching the surface of what they could be doing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think experience management could become the third system of record, similar to ERP or CRM.&#8221;</p>
<p>This funding is being led by Owl Rock, with other unnamed investors participating. Prior to this, UserZoom raised some $34 million. It is not disclosing valuation, but de la Nuez notes that this latest investment represents a minority stake UserZoom, that the startup is profitable and grew revenues by 40% last year, and that it&#8217;s currently on an annual run rate of $80 million.</p>
<p>De la Nuez and UserZoom are currently based out of Los Gatos in the South Bay Area, but the company actually got its start in Barcelona, Spain, where de la Nuez and his co-founder Xavier Mestres originally ran a more old-school user experience design consulting company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had physical labs, testing sites, were we ran focus groups,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;It was tedious and manual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Years of working like that, and he and Mestres and a third co-founder who has since left the company, Javier Darriba, decided to see how and if they could retool the concept as a piece of software.</p>
<p>Their timing was perfect: It was 2007, the year of the iPhone debut, and the smaller screen of that device, and Apple&#8217;s prowess in nailing design and user experience, suddenly got the tech world (and the rest of the world) thinking about how they, too, could rethink their own digital experiences. You might think of it as an earlier iteration of the kind of digital transformation that people talk about today.</p>
<p>The company was growing in Spain at a time when it was much harder for startups to raise substantial rounds (I wonder if that would still be the case today, with companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/spains-wallapop-raises-191m-at-an-840m-valuation-for-its-classifieds-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wallapop</a> raising huge rounds in recent weeks). so UserZoom made the decision move to California, but Mestres, who is the CTO, still runs the startup&#8217;s engineering, design and customer support teams (100 out of 300 staff in all) out of Barcelona. The cost base of employing tech people in Spain are completely different from the Bay Area, &#8220;and it&#8217;s helped us become profitable,&#8221; de la Nuez said.</p>
<p class="p4">The core of the company&#8217;s product is a platform that runs what it refers to as &#8220;XIM&#8221; (Experience Insights Management), which lets customers test out any digital experience &#8212; be it something on the web, or a phone, or a smartwatch or an interactive voice service, and soon, other interfaces such as automotive. (And it&#8217;s a list that is likely to grow as more hardware and services are built.) It can recruit testers to evaluate design, product interaction, marketing decisions that the company is trying out, and so on.</p>
<p>That testing interface is essentially started as product development begins, the idea being that customers can apply the principle of &#8220;agile development&#8221; as they continue to work on the product, rather than leave all of that to be tested after a product is technically already completed.</p>
<p>As a company users UserZoom, the results of tests can be shared among different stakeholders who can make notes on how product development would work (or wouldn&#8217;t work) with how they are envisioning, say, a new sales strategy or engagement goal. It also helps develop KPIs for customers to determine how and if a design is meeting KPIs.</p>
<p>These can cover not just basic goals like &#8220;more conversions&#8221; or &#8220;less shopping cart abandonment&#8221; or &#8220;opting in to cookies&#8221; but also whether a design is meeting accessibility goals. (As seen with the <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/design/ravelry-rebranding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent controversy around Ravelry</a>, this is indeed a growing issue and one that de la Nuez said will be getting more attention at UserZoom.)</p>
<p>The space of UX and testing to improve it is a pretty crowded and well-funded one, with others in it including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/logrocket-lands-15m-series-b-announces-new-tool-to-track-customer-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LogRocket</a>, <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/about-us/press/press-releases/usertesting-announces-100m-funding-round" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UserTesting</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/contentsquare-series-d/">ContentSquare</a>, companies focusing on specific verticals, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/ab-tasty-raises-40-million-to-optimize-e-commerce-user-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AB Tasty</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/maze-raises-another-15-million-for-its-user-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many others</a>. What&#8217;s giving UserZoom an edge, it seems, is not just its extensive and impressive customer base, but its focus on trying to provide an end-to-end concept of design and experience and how it might fit in with a bigger business strategy.</p>
<p>“In today’s digital economy, the quality of the customer and user experience is the driving factor that helps businesses retain customers and generate increased revenue,” said Pravin Vazirani, managing director at Owl Rock, in a statement. “Despite this, many organizations are still unable to properly extract and manage the potential insights that lie within a customer journey. UserZoom enables companies to harness these insights and drive improved digital experiences.” Andy Lefkarites, an investor at Owl Rock said in a statement, “We see a tremendous market opportunity for UserZoom, which enables companies of all sizes and industries to continually enhance and prioritize their digital experience strategy. We are pleased to be able to support UserZoom with growth capital to enable them to seize that opportunity.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.olist.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace integrator, has raised $23 million in a Series D round extension led by new investor Goldman Sachs Asset Management that brings its total Series D financing to $80 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backer <a href="https://rpev.com.br">Redpoint eventures</a>, which first put money in Olist in 2015, also participated in the latest round. With this latest infusion, Olist has now raised over $126 million since its 2015 inception. This round is reportedly its last before the company plans to go public, according to Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank led the first tranch of Olist’s Series D in November as well as the company’s $46 million Series C in 2019. Valor Capital, Velt Partners, FJ Labs, Península and angel Kevin Efrusy had previously invested in the first tranche of the Series D. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olist connects small businesses to larger product marketplaces to help entrepreneurs sell their products to a larger customer base. The company was founded with the mission of helping small merchants gain market share across the country through a SaaS licensing model to small brick and mortar businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of October 2019, Olist had more than 7,000 customers and used a drop-shipping model to send products directly from stores to clients around the country, allowing them to grow with a capital-light model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Olist says its platform provides tools that support “all the stages of an e-commerce operation” with the goal of helping merchants see “rapid increases in sales volume.” It currently has about 25,000 merchants on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is no doubt benefiting from the pandemic-fueled e-commerce boom taking place all over the world as more people have turned to online shopping. Latin America, in general, has been home to increased e-commerce adoption. The region&#8217;s $85 billion e-commerce market is growing rapidly with projections of it <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As evidence of that, Olist says its revenue tripled to a record number in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the previous year, although it did not provide hard figures. It also reportedly doubled revenue in 2020, according to Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olist Store, the company’s flagship product, gives merchants a way to manage product listings, logistics and store payments. It also offers “a unique sales experience” through channels such as Mercado Livre, B2W and Via Varejo. The product saw a record GMV in the first half of the year, which was up 2.5 times over the same period in the prior year, the company said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Olist launched a new product, Olist Shops, giving users the ability to create a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual showcase “in less than 3 minutes” that also offers payment checkout tools and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">integration with logistics operators. Shops has interfaces in Portuguese, English, and Spanish, and since its launch, it has attracted more than 200,000 users in 180 countries, according to Olist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic has accelerated digitalizing business processes around the world, thus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spurring e-commerce growth in a surprising way,” said Tiago Dalvi, Olist’s founder and CEO, in a written statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to invest in technology and products, pursuing new mergers and acquisitions and boosting its internationalization process. This is on top of two acquisitions Olist made last year — Clickspace and Pax Logistica, which gave Olist entry into the heated logistics space with more than 4,000 registered drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, CFO Eduardo Ferraz said the company is in preliminary discussions with ERPs, retailers, and companies with complementary solutions to its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is why we also decided to expand the investment in our Series D and bring Goldman Sachs as another relevant investor to our cap table,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Castelblanco, managing director and head of Latin America Corporate and Growth Equity Investing for the Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said his firm was impressed with how Olist empowers SMBs to generate more revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tiago and the Olist team are incredibly customer oriented and have created an innovative technological solution for their e-commerce clients,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olist is operating in an increasingly crowded space. In March, we covered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based </span><a href="https://www.nuvemshop.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/nuvemshop-latams-answer-to-shopify-raises-90m-in-accel-led-series-d/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$90 million raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was led by Silicon Valley venture firm Accel. That company has developed an e-commerce platform that aims to allow SMBs and merchants to connect more directly with their consumers. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or a loved one has ever undergone a tumor removal as part of cancer treatment, you’re likely familiar with the period of uncertainty and fear that follows. Will the cancer return, and if so, will the doctors catch it at an early enough stage? <a href="https://c2i-genomics.com/">C2i Genomics</a> has developed software that’s 100x more sensitive in detecting residual disease, and investors are pouncing on the potential. Today, C2i announced a $100 million Series B led by Casdin Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest question in cancer treatment is, ‘Is it working?’ Some patients are getting treatment they don’t benefit from and they are suffering the side effects while other patients are not getting the treatment they need,” said Asaf Zviran, co-founder and CEO of C2i Genomics in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, the main approach to cancer detection post-surgery has been through the use of MRI or X-ray, but neither of those methods gets super accurate until the cancer progresses to a certain point. As a result, a patient’s cancer may return, but it may be a while before doctors are able to catch it. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using C2i’s technology, doctors can order a liquid biopsy, which is essentially a blood draw that looks for DNA. From there they can sequence the entire genome and upload it to the C2i platform. The software then looks at the sequence and identifies faint patterns that indicate the presence of cancer, and can inform if it&#8217;s growing or shrinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C2i is basically providing the software that allows the detection and monitoring of cancer to a global scale. Every lab with a sequencing machine can process samples, upload to the C2i platform and provide detection and monitoring to the patient,” Zviran told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C2i Genomics’ solution is based on research performed at the New York Genome Center (NYGC) and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) by Dr. Zviran, along with Dr. Dan Landau, faculty member at the NYGC and assistant professor of medicine at WCM, who serves as scientific co-founder and member of C2i’s scientific advisory board. The research and findings have been published in the medical journal, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0915-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the product is not FDA-approved yet, it’s already being used in clinical research and drug development research at NYU Langone Health, the National Cancer Center of Singapore, Aarhus University Hospital and Lausanne University Hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When and if approved, New York-based C2i has the potential to drastically change cancer treatment, including in the areas of organ preservation. For example, some people have functional organs, such as the bladder or rectum, removed to prevent cancer from returning, leaving them disabled. But what if the unnecessary surgeries could be avoided? That’s one goal that Zviran and his team have their minds set on achieving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Zviran, this story is personal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started my career very far from cancer and biology, and at the age of 28 I was diagnosed with cancer and I went for surgery and radiation. My father and then both of my in-laws were also diagnosed, and they didn’t survive,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zviran, who today has a PhD in molecular biology, was previously an engineer with the Israeli Defense Force and some private companies. “As an engineer, looking into this experience, it was very alarming to me about the uncertainty on both the patients’ and physicians’ side,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round of funding will be used to accelerate clinical development and commercialization of the company’s C2-Intelligence Platform. Other investors that participated in the round include NFX, Duquesne Family Office, Section 32 (Singapore), iGlobe Partners and Driehaus Capital.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some weeks are slim pickings when it comes to pulling together interesting robotics stories. This is, decidedly, not one of those weeks. In fact, it’s been a bit tough keeping up with the deluge of robotics activity over the past seven days. I’m going to take that very small sample size as purely anecdotal evidence that investment interest in the category is still white hot.</p>
<p>This is another one of those weeks where investment activity really spanned the entire range of robotics. Surgical, fulfilment and agriculture companies all received funding, along with some key partnerships in groceries and food delivery. All of that, plus underwater snake robots! What’s not to like?</p>

<p>We’ll start with this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/memic-raises-96m-for-its-robot-assisted-surgery-platform/">big Series D from Memic</a>. Following its recent FDA authorization (a huge step for any medical robotics company), the surgical robotics company announced a $96 million raise led by Peregrine Ventures and Ceros. The round more than triples the company’s existing funding of $31.8 million. The Hominis platform is currently designed for transvaginal procedures, though the company is looking to expand to additional surgeries.</p>
<p>A much smaller round for a much newer company, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005591/en/Interventional-Robotics-Startup-Moray-Medical-Boosts-Seed-Financing-to-5.7-Million">Moray Media just announced</a> a $5.7 million seed – a $3 million increase in the round it had reported earlier this year. The company’s Coral system is being designed for transcatheter mitral valve repair. Like many of these systems, the end goal is increasing the efficacy of procedures across a broad range of different operator skill sets.</p>
<p>Per co-founder and CEO Mark Barrish:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our Coral platform is designed to empower interventionalists at all skill levels not only to carry out these procedures but also to do so in a cost-efficient manner, with the goal of making certain that millions of additional sick patients who cannot be currently treated will get the life-saving intervention they need.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the warehouse/fulfillment side, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/mit-startup-pickle-raises-5-75m-for-its-package-picking-robot/">MIT startup Pickle</a> came out of stealth this week, telling TechCrunch that it raised $5.75 million. Silly pun name aside (not to mention a robot called “Dill”), the company says its tech is capable of 1,600 box picks per hour, an impressive number it claims is “double the speed of any competitors.”</p>
<p>As the seed round suggests, we’re still in quite early stages here. Still, it all seems to have come together quite quickly for the company. It’s opening up preorders on its picking system in June and expects to start shipping in early 2022.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gj92BsqF5Vo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Speaking of picking systems, RightHand Robotics <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/12/2208314/0/en/RightHand-Robotics-Introduces-Next-Generation-RightPick-3-Item-handling-Robot-System-at-ProMatDX.html">announced its third-gen robot</a>. The autonomous system is designed to be faster and pick a wider range of products than its predecessor. The former is certainly a high bar. Speed has long been one of the company’s standouts. The increase is due, in part, to a faster GPU capable of processing data at 6x the speed.</p>

<p>Two stories worth highlighting this week about robotics reaching a wider audience through service partnerships. On Monday, pizza giant Domino’s announced that it would be rolling out (so to speak) robotic delivery via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/dominos-nuro-to-begin-autonomous-pizza-deliveries-in-houston/">a partnership with Nuro</a>. Customers in Houston can get a pie delivered by the company’s R2 robot. Those buying pizza from the chain’s Woodland Heights location can actually specially request the &#8216;bot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138621" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138621" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2138621 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2138621" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Kroger</p></div></p>
<p>Supermarket chain Kroger, meanwhile, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/kroger-launches-its-first-ocado-powered-shed-a-massive-robot-filled-fulfillment-center-in-ohio/?tpcc=ECTW2020">finally delivering on a deal with Ocado</a>, opening a massive warehouse just outside of Cincinnati. The company says the 375,000-square-foot space will employ 1,000 robots alongside 400 human workers. The location will service around 20 brick-and-mortar stores in the area.</p>
<p>On the acquisitions side, indoor farming company AppHarvest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/appharvest-buys-ag-robotics-firm-root-ai/">announced its intent to buy Root AI</a>. The $60 million deal finds AppHarvest picking up the Boston-based robotics startup with the intention of gaining access to the data gathering functionality of its crop harvesting tech.</p>

<p>“Farming as we’ve known it is broken because of the increasing number of variables such as extreme weather, droughts, fire and contamination by animals that make our food system unreliable,” AppHarvest founder and CEO Jonathan Webb said. &#8220;Indoor farming solves for many of those challenges, and the data gathered can exponentially deliver more insights that help us predict and control crop quality and yield.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seattle-based Carbon Robotics this week <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com/">announced a massive weeding robot</a>. The Autonomous Weeder uses computer vision and lasers to get rid of some 100,000 weeds an hour. That certainly seems to fall under the “dull” distinction, and probably a nice win for farmers looking to eliminate undesired plants without the use of herbicides.</p>

<p>On the research side, it’s always fun to see when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/cmu-teaches-its-snake-robot-to-swim/">CMU figures out new uses</a> for its long-standing snake robot. Seems like each time I visit the campus, they’ve cooked up something new, but I’m a little sad not to have seen the project’s newfangled swimming abilities in person. The team is looking to deploy the tech for inspections on hard to reach underwater surfaces like submarines and the bottoms of boats.</p>

He said yes, but soon realized that creating a message that could satisfy a majority of players was a “struggle throughout the process.”</p>
<p>While the class did pretty well, Kasparov found it “a little bit annoying” that he had to downplay concepts and stick to a specific structure. So, now, Kasparov is launching a platform he says has been several years in the making:<a href="https://kasparovchess.com/"> Kasparovchess.</a></p>
<p>Kasparovchess will be a platform in which legendary chess players will have free reign to share tips and tricks with players from various levels. Financed by private investors, and media conglomerate Vivendi, the company declined to disclose its total capital raised to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform, produced by Vivendi, includes documentaries, podcasts, articles and interviews between experts and known players in the chess community. Moe than 1,000 videos have been recorded to date, Kasparov said. Beyond content, Kasparovchess will have an exclusive Discord server attached to it and playing zones.</p>
<p>In many ways, it’s a vertical-specific version of the chess MasterClass he did years ago, with a big focus on community and variety. MasterClass, which is <a href="https://www.axios.com/masterclass-new-funding-25-billion-valuation-f75521cd-3a85-4215-b4fa-c2ae48da9765.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">reportedly raising funding</a> that would value it at $2.5 billion, has been a leader in the “edutainment” space, which monetizes off of documentary-style entertainment. One of the unicorn’s biggest characteristics, as Kasparov alluded to earlier, is that it has to appeal to a wide audience so subscribers can hop from one class to another. Within the same month, a user could go from a Kasparovchess class to general pontifications from RuPaul on self expression. The more classes that MasterClass can get you to take, the longer you’ll keep your subscription.</p>

<p>MasterClass might consider its broad view as a differentiator, but it&#8217;s clear that Kasparov views it as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Kasparovchess has a monthly or yearly subscription of $13.99 or $119.99, respectively. The majority of lessons from experts and retrospective analysis on games you’ve played sit behind the paywall. The premium product also grants users access to a database of 50,000 manually created puzzles that allows players to train certain skills. The product will be available to the public by the end of month.</p>
<p>A popular competitor already exists: Chess.com. It’s a chess server, forum and networking site that launched in 2005, with premium subscription that ranges between $5 a month or $29 a year. Kasparovchess is significantly more expensive.</p>
<p>Kasparov says his biggest differentiator will be a focus on community. The long-term goal of Kasparovchess is to connect global chess communities with each other, unearth prodigies that might not have access otherwise and give others access to his experiences. He thinks that remote education during the pandemic has shown the need to have more interactive solutions, beyond buzzy promises.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s time to actually switch from what we&#8217;re teaching to how students can apply it,” he said. “And that helps us indirectly because chess has been recognized for centuries as a nexus for intelligence and creativity.”</p>
<p>Kasparov became the youngest world chess champion in 1985. He retired from public chess in 2005, and has since launched a foundation to help children have access to chess worldwide. Most recently, he helped advise for &#8220;Queen’s Gambit,&#8221; a show about a chess prodigy that became Netflix’s most-watched scripted limited series to date on the platform. The show was so ubiquitously popular that sales for chess boards soon skyrocketed.</p>
<p>“I was so happy because it was the first time where we could see chess as a positive factor,” he said. “We had so many years with chess being seen as potential destruction and something that could push kids to the dark area of psychological instability.”</p>
<p>The freshness of this message mixed with an uptick in remote education has given Kasparov confidence that his years-long project is finally ready to launch.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about teaching the game, or playing the game, or debating the game,” he said. Instead, he hopes people who come to the platform focus on the culture of chess, its survival and its seemingly timeless power.</p>

<p>SK Inc., the South Korean global conglomerate, and a range of other investors also participated.</p>
<p>While this is Polestar&#8217;s first external round, the company&#8217;s comments suggest it won&#8217;t be its last. Polestar said Thursday that the growing market for electric vehicles coupled with advancements in technology that have made EVs more economical have attracted investors. Polestar added that <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">it is in ongoing discussions with global investors about possible additional fund raising.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our new investors have recognized that Polestar offers an alluring combination of established industrial and technological capability alongside superlative growth potential as the global auto industry goes electric,&#8221; Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.</p>
<p>The new capital will diversify&#8217;s Polestar&#8217;s funding structure and &#8220;deepens the pool of resources available to accelerate product development and technological capabilities ahead of launching several ground-breaking cars in the coming years,&#8221; the company said in its announcement.</p>

<p>Polestar was once a high-performance brand under Volvo Cars. In 2017, the company was recast as an <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/volvos-polestar-is-now-its-own-company-focused-on-performance-evs/" data-ylk="slk:electric performance brand" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">electric performance brand</a> aimed at producing exciting and fun-to-drive electric vehicles — a niche that Tesla was the first to fill and has dominated ever since. Polestar is jointly owned by Volvo Car Group and Zhejiang Geely Holding of China. Volvo was acquired by Geely in 2010.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Polestar has opened a manufacturing facility in China, built a global sales and distribution operation, and launched two vehicles, the Polestar 1 and the all-electric Polestar 2.</p>
<p>The company is adding its lineup, announcing this week that it will produce two additional versions of the Polestar 2 EV with lower base prices.</p>
<p>One new variant will be a new single motor Polestar 2 that retains the 78 kWh battery of the dual motor model, and delivers an estimated EPA range of about 260 miles. Polestar offers the Plus Pack, which extends the range up to 10%. The single motor Polestar 2 will arrive in North America at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Polestar said it will also a more simply configured dual motor version. The dual motor Polestar 2 has estimated EPA range of 240 miles, and can go even further on a charge when fitted with the new Plus Pack.</p>
<p>The company also announced grander ambitions to build the first climate-neutral car by 2030. That climate neutral badge won&#8217;t be earned throough carbon offsets, but by fundamentally change the way the new EV is made, Polestar said, including rethinking every piece of the supply chain, from materials sourcing through to manufacturing, and even by making the vehicle more energy efficient.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pearpop, the marketplace for social collaborations between the teeming hordes of musicians, craftspeople, chefs, clowns, diarists, dancers, artists, actors, acrobats, aspiring celebrities and actual celebrities, has raised $16 million in funding that includes what seems like half of Hollywood, along with Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six venture firm and Bessemer Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The funding was actually split between a $6 million seed funding round co-led by Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary&#8217;s Sound Ventures and Slow Ventures, with participation from Atelier Ventures and Chapter One Ventures and a $10 million additional investment led by Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six with participation from Bessemer.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/pearpop-lets-tiktok-celebrities-monetize-by-sharing-shoutouts-and-screentime-with-fans/">TechCrunch first covered pearpop last year</a> and there&#8217;s no denying that the startup is on to something. It basically takes Cameo&#8217;s celebrity marketplace for private shout-outs and makes it public. Allowing social media personalities to boost their followers by paying more popular personalities to shout out, duet, or comment on their posts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’ve invested in pearpop because it’s been on my mind for a while that the creator economy has resulted in a lot of not equitable outcomes for creators. Where i talked about the missing middle class of the creator economy,&#8221; said Li Jin, the founder of Atelier Ventures and author of a critical piece on creator economics, &#8220;<a href="https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class">The creator economy needs a middle class</a>&#8220;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I saw pearpop I felt like there was a really big potential for pearpop to be the one of the creators of the creative middle class. They’ve introduced this mechanism by which larger creators can help smaller creators and everyone has something of value to offer something to everyone else in the ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Jin discovered pearpop through the TechCrunch piece, she said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">You wrote that article and then i reached out to the team,&#8221; said Jin.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;PearPop lets TikTok celebrities monetize by sharing shout-outs and screen time with fans&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/pearpop-lets-tiktok-celebrities-monetize-by-sharing-shoutouts-and-screentime-with-fans/embed/#?secret=sSPiUH64PB" data-secret="sSPiUH64PB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">The idea was so appealing, it brought in a slew of musicians, athletes, actors and entertainers, including: Abel Makkonen (The Weeknd), Amy Schumer, The Chainsmokers, Diddy, Gary Vaynerchuk, Griffin Johnson, Josh Richards, Kevin Durant (Thirty 5 Ventures), Kevin Hart (HartBeat Ventures), Mark Cuban, Marshmello, Moe Shalizi, Michael Gruen (Animal Capital), MrBeast (Night Media Ventures), Rich Miner (Android co-founder) and Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Pearpop has the potential to benefit all social media platforms by delivering new users and engagement, while simultaneously leveling the playing field of opportunity for creators,” said Alexis Ohanian, Founder, Seven Seven Six, in a statement. “The company has created a revolutionary new marketplace model that is set to completely reimagine how we think of social media monetization. As both a social media founder and an investor, I’m excited for what’s to come with pearpop.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Already Heidi Klum, Loren Gray, Snoop Dogg, and Tony Hawk have gotten paid to appear in social media posts from aspiring auteurs on the social media platform TikTok.</p>
<p>Using the platform is relatively simple. A social media user (for now, that means just TikTok) sends a post that exists on their social feed and requests that another social media user interacts with it in some way &#8212; either commenting, posting a video in response, or adding a sound. If the request seems okay, or &#8220;on brand&#8221;, then the person who accepts the request performs the prescribed action.</p>
<p>Pearpop takes a 25% cut of all transactions with the social media user who&#8217;s performing the task getting the other 75%.</p>
<p>The company wouldn&#8217;t comment on revenue numbers, except to say that it&#8217;s on track to bring in seven figures this year.</p>
<p>Users on the platform set their prices and determine which kinds of services they&#8217;re willing to provide to boost the social media posts of their contractors.</p>
<p>Prices range anywhere from $5 to $10,000 depending on the size of a user&#8217;s following and the type of request that&#8217;s being made. Right now, the most requested personality on the marketplace is the TikTok star, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annabananaxdddd?lang=en">Anna Banana.</a></p>
<p>These kinds of transactions do have impacts. The company said that personalities on the platform were able to increase their follower count with the service. For instance, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@leahsvoboda?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/@leahsvoboda?lang%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618578461069000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFCk2NzGs4o-S6Knl9_qZ9FJFYm5g">Leah Svoboda</a> went from 20K to 141K followers, after a pearpop duet with<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annabananaxdddd?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/@annabananaxdddd?lang%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618578461069000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHpZrLOaLwm6Q-G-F3OSG31umaI7g"> Anna Shumate</a>.</p>
<p>If this all makes you feel like you&#8217;ve tripped and fallen through a Black Mirror into a dystopian hellscape where everything and every interaction is a commodity to be mined for money, well&#8230; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnlPtaPxXfc">that&#8217;s life</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What I appreciate most about pearpop is the control it gives me as a creator,” said Anna Shumate, TikTok influencer @annabananaxdddd. “The platform allows me to post what I want and when I want. My followers still love my content because it’s authentic and true to me, which is what sets pearpop apart from all of the other opportunities on social media.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Talent agencies, too, see the draw. Early adopters include Talent X, Get Engaged, and Next Step Talent and The Fuel Injector, which has added its entire roster of talent to pearpop, which includes Kody Antle, Brooke Monk and Harry Raftus, the company said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The initial concept came out of an obvious gap within the space: no marketplace existed for creators of all sizes to monetize through simple, authentic collaborations that are mutually beneficial,” said Cole Mason, co-founder &amp; CEO, pearpop.  “It soon became clear that this was a product that people had been waiting for, as thousands of people rely on our platform today to gain full control of their social capital for the first time starting with TikTok.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We hope you can make <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-detroit">our virtual meetup in Detroit today</a>. The event is free, features a pitch-off with Detroit startups, a talk regarding StockX, and a panel with Detroit VCs on best practices when fundraising.</p>
<p>This event is the second in TechCrunch&#8217;s new series, City Spotlights where TechCrunch focuses on an area to highlight successes and bring light to the growing area. Last month we were in Miami and soon we&#8217;re going to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s event features talks on how to get hired at a startup and a fireside chat with two local investors: Jonathan Triest from <a href="https://www.ludlowventures.com">Ludlow Ventures</a>, and Patti Glaza from <a href="https://investdetroit.vc">Invest Detroit Ventures</a>. Both are key players in the local area and have a lot to share regarding the best way to raise cash in and out of Detroit. Following the chat with these investors, Ryan Landau, founder of <a href="https://www.purpose.jobs">Purpose Jobs</a>, is speaking on startup hiring practices and trends in the Midwest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dan Gilbert loves his hometown of Detroit. He loves it so much that the billionaire founder of what would eventually become the mortgage lender Quicken Loans has poured at least $2.5 billion into rehabilitating buildings in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>He has also invested in many companies that are now tenants in those buildings, along with the restaurants and retailers that have made the scene far livelier than before Gilbert began his campaign to reestablish Detroit as one of the most important cities in the country.</p>
<p>We had a chance to talk with Gilbert, a father of five whose other notable interests include the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/stockx-raises-275m-series-e-valuing-the-retailer-at-2-8b/">highly valued</a> e-commerce marketplace <a href="https://stockx.com/">StockX</a>, which he co-founded in 2015, and the Cleveland Cavaliers NBA team, which he acquired &#8212; along with their arena in downtown Cleveland &#8212; for a reported <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/2005/01/04/cavaliers-their-arena-are-sold-for-375-million/5d94fc46-fbd1-4a4c-b17f-d8b817157d6f/">$375 million</a> in 2005.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He shared why Detroit should be top of mind for founders from across the U.S. We also talked a bit about sports and why he chose a traditional IPO path for Rocket Companies, the parent company of Quicken that he <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/rocket-companies-stock-price-first-day-public-trading-ipo-quicken-2020-8-1029479642">took public</a> in August of last year. Excerpts from that conversation follow.</p>
<p><strong>TC: As a native Clevelander and longtime Cavs fan, I&#8217;m curious about your connection to Cleveland.</strong></p>
<p>DG: When the Cavs came up for sale in 2005 or 2004, the banker who was selling them called us up because our group had made an attempt at the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team, and they thought we may want to buy the team. And the seller at the time [businessman Gordon Gund] wanted a very simple, non-complex process with one buyer. So they called us up, and we decided to do it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Well, you got us<a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2018/05/28/cleveland-cavaliers-nba-championship-count"> back in the game</a>, so to speak, so thank you. In the meantime, you&#8217;ve obviously been very focused on Detroit, where you grew up and went to college. What&#8217;s the case for Detroit over other Midwestern cities?</strong></p>
<p>DG: First of all, one of the metrics that companies use when they decide on a city is how many people they can reach within a five-hour drive, because they figure that talent within that five-hour circumference is willing to drive in or at least explore that city. And there are 60 million people within five hours of Detroit, including in Chicago, Toronto, all of Michigan, all of Ohio, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh &#8212; I could go on and on.</p>
<p>The same is true of universities. There are something like 30 major universities within a five-hour drive, including the University of Michigan, Michigan State, Wayne State, Carnegie Mellon and Ohio State, and those are just the bigger schools. There are also a bunch of great schools in Canada that specialize in software development. Collectively, that&#8217;s a huge advantage when it comes to tapping into possible talent.</p>
<p>Detroit has had so many decades of bad PR that it&#8217;s hard to get over that image without seeing it for yourself, but once you spend two hours here, you get it. You feel the energy. You feel the passion. You see the young people.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you think Detroit is better suited for companies of a certain size? Things are changing quickly but there&#8217;s a learning curve in some cities regarding the specific needs of startups. I talked with Drive Capital in Columbus recently, and they said they&#8217;d had to do a lot to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/">educate landlords</a>. Of course, you&#8217;re among the biggest landlords in Detroit. </strong></p>
<p>DG: That&#8217;s a really great insight from Drive. At this point, Detroit is home to both [big and small companies]. We first moved around 1,400 people from the suburbs into downtown Detroit in the summer of 2010 and we now have more than 20,000 people at this tech company, which Quicken Loans clearly is. And [that kind of hub] allows you to create an ecosystem of people and ideas that interest VCs, so that&#8217;s become one part of it.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Two ex-Sequoia VCs:  The most &#8216;compelling emerging market&#8217; may be America, outside of Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/embed/#?secret=qRSdwITQcD" data-secret="qRSdwITQcD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We control a couple million square feet of real estate ourselves, but then we have another four or five million square feet that we&#8217;re building or that&#8217;s already bought, so we can accommodate startups and be flexible around their growth. But on top of that, we have three locations in downtown Detroit that companies like Pinterest and Snap have used; you&#8217;ve got existing big tech companies with locations here like Amazon, which has an engineering office with more than 500 people downtown, and Google, which has a 50,000-square-foot office, and Microsoft, which has 50,000 square feet in the same building I&#8217;m in. So it&#8217;s not just the startup scene.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are there enough venture dollars in Detroit to support what you&#8217;re trying to build? The Drive team also talked about missing opportunities because they don&#8217;t have the bandwidth to fund everything they are seeing. They need backup. Do you?</strong></p>
<p>DG: Certain VCs have discovered us. Ron Conway of SV Angel, for example, fell in love with Detroit a couple of years ago and he has exposed us to everybody in his network. He has invested in a lot of our deals here. And there are others. Google Ventures and Battery Ventures came in early. DST Global, General Atlantic, GGV Capital, Altimeter, Whale Rock Capital, Tiger Global have put money into startups here.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of a new thing for us. Quicken Loans just went public after 35 years, and we never really raised much VC money because we never had to because of our cash flow. So it&#8217;s a little bit of a new thing for us with StockX; we never really had a startup blow up that suddenly. But every brick in the wall helps.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Speaking of StockX, its tagline is the &#8220;stock market of things.&#8221; Might one of those things be non-fungible tokens at some point? A lot of people are suddenly buying and selling digital items.</strong></p>
<p>DG: Like <a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/">NBA Top Shot</a>? We love that model. We have some similar models that we&#8217;re working on right now. We&#8217;re in research and development on some things that are very close to it. I have four teenagers out of five kids at home, and I can tell you that&#8217;s definitely the hot thing right now.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What is the next step for StockX? Is it an IPO?</strong></p>
<p>DG: I think the next step for StockX will probably be an IPO. It&#8217;s just a matter of when. Probably sometime in 2022. I&#8217;m not saying anything official here; I&#8217;m just saying there&#8217;s a good chance it will.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have strong feelings about traditional IPOs versus other ways that companies are going public? You took Quicken public through a traditional IPO. Another Detroit-based mortgage company, United Wholesale Mortgage, more recently took the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/is-anything-too-big-to-be-spacd/">SPAC route</a> instead.</strong></p>

<p>DG: I think [a StockX offering] would probably be traditional only because, to be honest with you, I don&#8217;t know much about the complications and all the details of trying to do it a different way. We had success with Quicken Loans, so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re coming off of.</p>
