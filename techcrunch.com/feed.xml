										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Texas court has authorized an FBI operation to &#8220;copy and remove&#8221; backdoors from hundreds of Microsoft Exchange email servers in the United States, months after hackers used <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">four previously undiscovered vulnerabilities</a> to attack thousands of networks.</p>
<p>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft">announced the operation</a> on Tuesday, which it described as &#8220;successful.&#8221; It&#8217;s believed this is the first known case of the FBI effectively cleaning up private networks following a cyberattack.</p>
<p>In March, Microsoft discovered a new China state-sponsored hacking group — Hafnium — targeting Exchange servers run from company networks. The four vulnerabilities when chained together allowed the hackers to break into a vulnerable Exchange server and steal its contents. Microsoft fixed the vulnerabilities but the patches did not close the backdoors from the servers that had already been breached. Within days, other hacking groups began hitting vulnerable servers with the same flaws to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/hackers-exchange-servers-ransomware/">deploy ransomware</a>.</p>
<p>The number of infected servers dropped as patches were applied. But hundreds of Exchange servers remained vulnerable because the backdoors are difficult to find and eliminate, the Justice Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This operation removed one early hacking group’s remaining web shells which could have been used to maintain and escalate persistent, unauthorized access to U.S. networks,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;The FBI conducted the removal by issuing a command through the web shell to the server, which was designed to cause the server to delete only the web shell (identified by its unique file path).&#8221;</p>
<p>The FBI said it&#8217;s attempting to contact owners of servers from which it removed the backdoors by email.</p>
<p>Assistant attorney general John C. Demers said the operation &#8220;demonstrates the Department’s commitment to disrupt hacking activity using all of our legal tools, not just prosecutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Justice Department also said the operation only removed the backdoors, but did not patch the vulnerabilities exploited by the hackers to begin with or remove any malware left behind.</p>
<p>Neither the FBI nor the Justice Department commented by press time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify wants to have a bigger presence in your car, Apple hints at iPad-centric announcements and Microsoft&#8217;s new Surface Laptop goes on sale. This is your Daily Crunch for April 13, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Spotify unveils an in-car entertainment system</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/spotify-launches-an-in-car-entertainment-system-car-thing/">Spotify&#8217;s new device</a> is the oddly (but memorably!) named Car Thing. While there are plenty of other ways to listen to Spotify while driving, the company said this will provide a &#8220;more seamless&#8221; and personalized experience. Car Thing includes a touchscreen, a navigation knob, voice control and preset buttons to access your favorite music, podcasts and playlists.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is actually an updated version of an in-car device that Spotify started testing a couple years ago. While Spotify is now making Car Thing available more broadly, it sounds like the company still views this as a bit of an experiment — during this limited U.S. release, it&#8217;s available for free, with users just paying for the cost of shipping.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase, the American cryptocurrency trading giant, has set a reference price for its direct listing at <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-reference-price-set-250-205421091.html">$250 per share</a>. According to the company&#8217;s most recent SEC filing, it has a fully diluted share count of 261.3 million, giving the company a valuation of $65.3 billion. Using a simple share count of 196,760,122 provided in its most recent S-1/A filing, Coinbase would be worth a slimmer $49.2 billion.</p>
<p>Regardless of which share count is used to calculate the company&#8217;s valuation, its new worth is miles above its final private price set in 2018 when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/">was worth $8 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Immediate chatter following the company&#8217;s direct listing reference price was that the price could be low. While Coinbase will not suffer usual venture capital censure if its shares quickly appreciate as it is not selling stock in its flotation, it would still be slightly humorous if its set reference price was merely a reference to an overly conservative estimate of its worth.</p>
<p>Its private backers are in for a bonanza either way. Around four years ago in 2017 Coinbase was worth just $1.6 billion, according to Crunchbase data. For investors in that round, let alone its earlier fundraises, the valuation implied by a $250 per-share price represents a multiple of around 40x from the price that they paid.</p>
<p>The Coinbase direct listing was turbocharged recently when the company provided a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">first-look at its Q1 2021 performance</a>. As TechCrunch reported at the time, the company&#8217;s recent growth was impressive, with revenue scaling from $585.1 million in Q4 2020, to $1.8 billion in the first three months of this year. The new numbers set an already-hot company&#8217;s public debut on fire.</p>
<p>Place your bets now concerning where Coinbase might open, and how high its value may rise. It&#8217;s going to be quite the show.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are about to be a lot of antitrust bills taking aim at Big Tech, and here&#8217;s one more. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) rolled out <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-introduces-trust-busting-twenty-first-century-act-plan-bust-anti-competitive-big">a new bill this week</a> that would take some severe measures to rein in Big Tech&#8217;s power, blocking mergers and acquisitions outright.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Trust-Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act&#8221; would ban any acquisitions by companies with a market cap of more than $100 billion, including vertical mergers. The bill also proposes changes that would dramatically heighten the financial pain for companies caught engaging in anti-competitive behavior, forcing any company that loses an antirust suit to forfeit profits made through those business practices.</p>
<p>At its core, Hawley&#8217;s legislation would snip some of the red tape around antitrust enforcement by amending the Sherman Act, which made monopolies illegal, and the Clayton Act, which expanded the scope of illegal anti-competitive behavior. The idea is to make it easier for the FTC and other regulators to deem a company&#8217;s behavior anti-competitive — a key criticism of the outdated antitrust rules that haven&#8217;t kept pace with the realities of the tech industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bill isn&#8217;t likely to get too far in a Democratic Senate, but it&#8217;s not insignificant. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who chairs the Senate&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">proposed legislation earlier this year</a> that would also create barriers for dominant companies with a habit of scooping up their competitors. Klobuchar&#8217;s own ideas for curtailing Big Tech&#8217;s power similarly focus on reforming the antitrust laws that have shaped U.S. business for more than a century.</p>
<p><object data="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/The%20Trust-Busting%20for%20the%20Twenty-First%20Century%20Act.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="800"><p><a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/The%20Trust-Busting%20for%20the%20Twenty-First%20Century%20Act.pdf">Click to access The%20Trust-Busting%20for%20the%20Twenty-First%20Century%20Act.pdf</a></p></object></p>
<p>The Republican bill may have some overlap with Democratic proposals, but it still hits some familiar notes from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">Trump era of hyperpartisan Big Tech criticism</a>. Hawley slams &#8220;woke mega-corporations&#8221; in Silicon Valley for exercising too much power over the information and products that Americans consume. While Democrats naturally don&#8217;t share that critique, Hawley&#8217;s bill makes it clear that antitrust reform targeting Big Tech is one policy area where both political parties could align on the ends, even if they don&#8217;t see eye to eye on the why.</p>
<p>Hawley&#8217;s bill is the latest, but it won&#8217;t be the last. Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), who spearheads tech antitrust efforts in the House, previously announced his own plans to introduce <a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html">a flurry of antitrust reform bills</a> rather than one sweeping piece of legislation. Those bills, which will be more narrowly targeted to make them difficult for tech lobbyists to defeat, are due out in May.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Risk and compliance startup LogicGate has confirmed a data breach. But unless you&#8217;re a customer, you probably didn&#8217;t hear about it.</p>
<p>An email sent by LogicGate to customers earlier this month said on February 23 an unauthorized third party obtained credentials to its Amazon Web Services-hosted cloud storage servers storing customer backup files for its flagship platform Risk Cloud, which helps companies to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/one-cmos-journey-with-risk-management-and-compliance/">identify and manage</a> their risk and compliance with data protection and security standards. LogicGate says its Risk Cloud can also help find security vulnerabilities before they are exploited by malicious hackers.</p>
<p>The credentials &#8220;appear to have been used by an unauthorized third party to decrypt particular files stored in AWS S3 buckets in the LogicGate Risk Cloud backup environment,&#8221; the email read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only data uploaded to your Risk Cloud environment on or prior to February 23, 2021, would have been included in that backup file. Further, to the extent you have stored attachments in the Risk Cloud, we did not identify decrypt events associated with such attachments,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>LogicGate did not say how the AWS credentials were compromised. An email update sent by LogicGate last Friday said the company anticipates finding the root cause of the incident by this week.</p>
<p>But LogicGate has not made any public statement about the breach. It&#8217;s also not clear if the company contacted all of its customers or only those whose data was accessed. LogicGate counts Capco, SoFi and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City as customers.</p>
<p>We sent a list of questions, including how many customers were affected and if the company has alerted U.S. state authorities as required by state data breach notification laws. When reached, LogicGate chief executive Matt Kunkel confirmed the breach but declined to comment citing an ongoing investigation. &#8220;We believe it&#8217;s best to communicate developments directly to our customers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kunkel would not say, when asked, if the attacker also exfiltrated the decrypted customer data from its servers.</p>
<p>Data breach notification laws vary by state, but companies that fail to report security incidents can face heavy fines. Under Europe&#8217;s GDPR rules, companies can face fines of up to 4% of their annual turnover for violations.</p>
<p>In December, LogicGate secured $8.75 million in fresh funding, totaling more than $40 million since it launched in 2015.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To uncover some basic truths about building products, we spoke to three entrepreneurs who have each built more than one company.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before a startup can achieve product-market fit, founders must first listen to their customers, build what they require and fashion a business plan that makes the whole enterprise worthwhile. The numbers will tell the true story, but when it happens, you&#8217;ll feel it in your bones because sales will be good, customers will happy and revenue will growing.</p>
<p>Reaching that tipping point can be a slog, especially for first-time founders. To uncover some basic truths about building products, we spoke to three entrepreneurs who have each built more than one company:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pouyansalehi/">Pouyan Salehi</a>, CEO and co-founder, Scratchpad</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramiessaid/">Rami Essaid</a>, CEO and founder,  Finmark</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meloneewise/">Melonee Wise</a>, CEO and co-founder, Fetch Robotics</li>
</ul>
<h2>Find out what your customers want — and build it</h2>
<p>First-time founders often try to build the product they think the market wants. That&#8217;s what Scratchpad co-founder Salehi did when he founded his previous startup PersistIQ. Before launching his latest venture, he took a different approach: Instead of plowing ahead with a product and adjusting after he got in front of customers, he decided to step back and figure out what his customers needed first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tactically what we did differently at Scratchpad is we tried to be much more deliberate up front. And what that looked like was [ … ] to not start with building, even though the product is such an important part, but really step back and understand what we are doing here in the first place,&#8221; he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The snake robot has been something of an institution in the Carnegie Mellon robotics labs. Every time I visit the school, the biomimetic robot has seemingly learned a new trick. This week, the school announced <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/cmus-snakebot-goes-swim">it has added swimming to the list</a>.</p>
<p>Testing actually began last month in one of CMU’s pools, with the snake robot outfitted with new housing designed for underwater navigation. Work on the project began last July. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised that we made this robot work as fast as we did,&#8221; professor Howie Choset said in a release tied to the announcement. “The secret is the modularity and the people working on this technology at CMU.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2137910" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HUMRS-video.2021-04-13-13_41_47.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Hardened Underwater Modular Robot Snake (HUMRS) was developed with a grant from the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing (ARM) Institute.</p>
<p>In its terrestrial version, the snake robot is notable for its ability to squeeze into tight spaces like pipes, which might otherwise be inaccessible for other more standard robotic form factors. Underwater, it serves a similar function. The project finds the team eyeing Defense Department usage &#8212; specifically the ability to inspect submarines, ships and other watercraft to detect damage.</p>

<p>Other nonmilitary applications include inspections for rigs and tanks, along with underwater pipes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook confirmed it&#8217;s testing a video speed-dating app called Sparked, after the app&#8217;s website was spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381511/facebook-video-speed-dating-npe-team-sparked-feature">The Verge</a>. Unlike dating app giants such as Tinder, Sparked users don&#8217;t swipe on people they like or direct message others. Instead, they cycle through a series of short video dates during an event to make connections with others. The product itself is being developed by Facebook&#8217;s internal R&amp;D group, the NPE Team, but had not been officially announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sparked is an early experiment by New Product Experimentation,&#8221; a spokesperson for Facebook&#8217;s NPE Team confirmed to TechCrunch. &#8220;We’re exploring how video-first speed dating can help people find love online.&#8221;</p>
<p>They also characterized the app as undergoing a &#8220;small, external beta test&#8221; designed to generate insights about how video dating could work, in order to improve people&#8217;s experiences with Facebook products. The app is not currently live on app stores, only the web.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sparked is, however, preparing to test the experience at a Chicago Date Night event on Wednesday, The Verge&#8217;s report noted.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137897" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137897" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137897" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-1.32.34-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="355" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-1.32.34-PM.jpg 2746w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-1.32.34-PM.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-1.32.34-PM.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-1.32.34-PM.jpg?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-1.32.34-PM.jpg?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-1.32.34-PM.jpg?resize=1536,802 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-1.32.34-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1069 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-1.32.34-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137897" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>During the sign-up process, Sparked tells users to &#8220;be kind,&#8221; &#8220;keep this a safe space&#8221; and &#8220;show up.&#8221; A walkthrough of how the app works explains that participants will meet face to face during a series of four-minute video dates, which they can then follow up with a 10-minute date if all goes well. They can additionally choose to exchange contact info, like phone numbers, emails or Instagram handles.</p>
<p>Facebook, of course, already offers a dating app product, Facebook Dating.</p>
<p>That experience, which takes place inside Facebook itself, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/how-facebook-dating-works/">first launched in 2018</a> outside the U.S., and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/facebook-dating-launches-in-the-u-s-adds-instagram-integration/">arrived in the U.S. the following year</a>. In the early days of the pandemic, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/facebook-to-launch-virtual-dating-over-messenger/">announced</a> it would roll out a sort of virtual dating experience that leveraged Messenger for video chats &#8212; a move that came at a time when many other dating apps in the market also turned to video to serve users under lockdowns. These video experiences could potentially compete with Sparked, unless the new product&#8217;s goal is to become another option inside Facebook Dating itself.</p>

<p>Despite the potential reach, Facebook&#8217;s success in the dating market is not guaranteed, some analysts have <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-just-beefed-up-its-dating-service-heres-why-success-against-tinder-and-bumble-isnt-guaranteed-warns-this-analyst-11603366220">warned</a>. People don&#8217;t think of Facebook as a place to go meet partners, and the dating product today is still separated from the main Facebook app for privacy purposes. That means it can&#8217;t fully leverage Facebook&#8217;s network effects to gain traction, as users in this case may not want their friends and family to know about their dating plans.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s competition in dating is fierce, too. Even the pandemic didn&#8217;t slow down the dating app giants, like Match Group or newly IPO&#8217;d Bumble. Tinder&#8217;s direct revenues <a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1256696/match-group-mtch-q4-earnings-and-revenues-increase-yy">increased</a> 18% year-over-year to $1.4 billion in 2020, Match Group reported, for instance. Direct revenues from the company&#8217;s non-Tinder brands collectively increased 16%. And Bumble <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/bumble-bmbl-earnings-q4-2020.html">topped its revenue estimates</a> in its first quarter as a public company, pulling in $165.6 million in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Facebook, on the other hand, has remained fairly quiet about its dating efforts. Though the company cited over 1.5 billion matches in the 20 countries it&#8217;s live, a &#8220;match&#8221; doesn&#8217;t indicate a successful pairing &#8212; in fact, that sort of result may not be measured. But it&#8217;s early days for the product, which only rolled out to European markets <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/facebook-dating-expands-to-europe/">this past fall</a>.</p>
<p>The NPE Team&#8217;s experiment in speed dating could ultimately help to inform Facebook of what sort of new experiences a dating app user may want to use, and how.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t say if or when Sparked would roll out more broadly.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hydrogen is capturing the attention of governments and private sector players, fueled by new tech, global green energy legislation and post-pandemic “green recovery” schemes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hydrogen — the magical gas that Jules Verne predicted in 1874 would one day be used as fuel — has long struggled to get the attention it deserves. Discovered 400 years ago, its trajectory has seen it mostly mired in obscurity, punctuated by a few explosive moments, but never really fulfilling its potential.</p>
<p>Now in 2021, the world may be ready for hydrogen.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Hydrogen is not an energy source, but an energy carrier — one with exceptional long-duration energy storage capabilities, which makes it a complement to weather-dependent energies like solar and wind.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This gas is capturing the attention of governments and private sector players, fueled by new tech, global green energy legislation, post-pandemic “green recovery” schemes and the growing consensus that action must be taken to combat climate change.</p>
<p>Joan Ogden, professor emeritus at UC Davis, started researching hydrogen in 1985 — at the time considered “pretty fringy, crazy stuff.” She’s seen industries and governments inquisitively poke at hydrogen over the years, then move on. This new, more intense focus feels different, she said.</p>
<p>The funding activity in France is one illustration of what is happening throughout Europe and beyond. “Back in 2018, the hydrogen strategy in France was €100 million — a joke,” Sabrine Skiker, the EU policy manager for land transport at Hydrogen Europe, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “I mean, a joke compared to what we have now. Now we have a strategy that foresees <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/plan-relance-tout-comprendre-a-l-hydrogene-sur-lequel-l-executif-mise-2-milliards-20200903">€7.2 billion.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>The European Clean Hydrogen Alliance forecasts public and private sectors will invest <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/policy/european-clean-hydrogen-alliance_en">€430 billion in hydrogen</a> in the continent by 2030 in a massive push to meet emissions targets. Globally, the hydrogen generation industry is expected to grow to $201 billion by 2025 from $130 billion in 2020 at a CAGR of 9.2%, according to <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/hydrogen-generation-market-494.html">research from Markets and Markets</a><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/policy/european-clean-hydrogen-alliance_en"> published this year</a>. This growth is expected to lead to advancements across multiple sectors including transportation, petroleum refining, steel manufacturing and fertilizer production. There are 228 large-scale hydrogen projects in various stages of development today — mostly in Europe, Asia and Australia.</p>
<h2>Hydrogen breakdown</h2>
<p>When the word “hydrogen” is uttered today, the average non-insider’s mind likely gravitates toward transportation — cars, buses, maybe trains or 18-wheelers, all powered by the gas.</p>
<p>But hydrogen is, and does, a lot of things, and a better understanding of its other roles — and challenges within those roles — is necessary to its success in transportation.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is already being heavily used in petroleum refineries and by manufacturers of steel, chemicals, ammonia fertilizers and biofuels. It’s also blended into natural gas for delivery through pipelines.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EV1i1ICB4T"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/ev-charging-stations-biofuels-the-hydrogen-transition-and-chemicals-are-pillars-of-shells-climate-plan/">EV charging stations, biofuels, the hydrogen transition and chemicals are pillars of Shell&#8217;s climate plan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EV charging stations, biofuels, the hydrogen transition and chemicals are pillars of Shell&#8217;s climate plan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/ev-charging-stations-biofuels-the-hydrogen-transition-and-chemicals-are-pillars-of-shells-climate-plan/embed/#?secret=EV1i1ICB4T" data-secret="EV1i1ICB4T" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Hydrogen is not an energy source, but an energy <i>carrier</i> — one with exceptional long-duration energy storage capabilities, which makes it a complement to weather-dependent energies like solar and wind. Storage is critical to the growth of renewable energy, and greater use of hydrogen in renewable energy storage can drive the cost of both down.</p>
<p>However, 95% of hydrogen produced is derived from fossil fuels — mostly through a process called <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-natural-gas-reforming">steam-methane reforming</a> (SMR). Little of it is produced via electrolysis, which uses electricity to split hydrogen and oxygen. Even less is created from renewable energy. Thus, not all hydrogen is created equal. Grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuels with emissions, and blue hydrogen is made from non-renewable sources whose carbon emissions are captured and sequestered or transformed. Green hydrogen is made from renewable energy.</p>
<h2>Where the action is</h2>
<p>The global fuel cell vehicle market is hit or miss. There are about <a href="https://cafcp.org/by_the_numbers">10,000 FCVs</a> in the U.S., with most of them in California — and sales are stalling. Only 937 FCVs were sold in the entire country in 2020, less than half the number sold in 2019. California has 44 hydrogen refueling stations and about as many in the works, but a lack of refueling infrastructure outside of the state isn’t helping American adoption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startup Alley — the very name conjures up images of early-stage startups demonstrating game-changing products, platforms and services to thousands of Disrupt attendees and industry influencers. It’s where you’ll find envelope pushing and boundary breaking going down.</p>
<p>If you’re busy shoving envelopes and busting down boundaries, don’t miss your chance to exhibit in Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleysuperearlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. But here’s the thing &#8212; we’re limiting the number of exhibitors this year, and Startup Alley spots are filling up fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleysuperearlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Apply for Startup Alley</a> now to secure your place. <strong>Budget-friendly tip:</strong> Grab your Startup Alley Pass for just $199 — but that deal expires on <strong>May 13 at 11:59 p.m. (PDT)</strong>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Startup Alley will still have plenty of amazing companies. But we want to showcase the very best and give those exhibiting companies the focused exposure they so richly deserve.</p>
<p>What can you expect when you exhibit in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleysuperearlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Startup Alley</a> this year? For starters, high visibility. Every exhibiting startup gets two minutes to pitch to a global audience during featured breakout feedback sessions. Disrupt attendees include all kinds of influencers — investors, tech icons, the media — and potential customers.</p>
<p>You’ll receive two lists that define opportunity — press and investors. Pitch your story to members of the press and increase your brand exposure. Schedule meetings with investors to explore funding options or to get feedback on your startup.</p>
<p>“Disrupt is a great avenue to network with potential investors. It carries a lot of street cred and talking about our CEO’s experience pitching in Startup Alley helps us make those connections and start important conversations.” — Jessica McLean, Director of Marketing and Communications, Infinite-Compute.</p>
<p>You’ll also have a shot to be featured in one of the many Startup Alley Crawls. Every tech category will have its own one-hour crawl. The TechCrunch team will interview a select number of exhibiting founders within each category live from the Disrupt stage.</p>
<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more. You just might be one of only two exhibiting startups chosen as a Startup Battlefield Wild Card selection. The TechCrunch editorial team makes that call, and the anointed ones will participate in the legendary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> pitch competition for a chance to win the $100,000 prize. Win or lose, Startup Battlefield is a solid launchpad.</p>
<p>And here’s a big reason not only to exhibit, but to get your <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleysuperearlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Startup Alley</a> pass ASAP. TechCrunch will choose 50 exhibiting startups to participate in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Startup Alley+</a>. That cohort will see benefits kick in at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage</a> in July — before Disrupt even begins. We’re talking founder masterclasses, pitch-offs at Extra Crunch Live and very warm introductions to top, relevant investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23. Push those envelopes, break those boundaries and don’t miss your chance to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">exhibit in Startup Alley</a>. Don’t forget: Tickets are limited this year and the early-bird price ends on <strong>May 13 at 11:59 p.m. (PDT)</strong>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Grab is going public via a SPAC, so let's talk through key points from the investor deck — we'll discuss growth, segment profitability, aggregate costs and COVID-19.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As expected, Southeast Asian superapp Grab is <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/grab-go-public-in-partnership-with-altimeter/">going public</a> via a SPAC.</p>
<p>The combination, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/the-station-the-biggest-spac-ever-and-reading-the-micromobility-permit-tea-leaves/">TechCrunch discussed over the weekend</a>, will value Grab on an equity basis at $39.6 billion and will provide around $4.5 billion in cash, $4 billion of which will come in the form of a private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Altimeter Capital is putting up $750 million in the PIPE — fitting, as Grab is merging with one of Altimeter&#8217;s SPACs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Ride-sharing is a profitable business for Grab, though the segment did take a pandemic-induced whacking.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Grab, which provides ride-hailing, payments and food delivery, will trade under the ticker symbol &#8220;GRAB&#8221; on Nasdaq when the deal closes. The announcement comes a day after Uber told its investors it was seeing recovery in certain transactions, including ride-hailing and delivery.</p>
<p>Uber also told the investing public that it&#8217;s still on track to reach adjusted EBITDA profitability in Q4 2021. The American ride-hailing giant did a surprising amount of work clearing brush for the Grab deal. Extra Crunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ride-hailings-profitability-promise-is-in-its-final-countdown/">examined Uber&#8217;s ramp toward profitability yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s talk through several key points from Grab&#8217;s SPAC investor deck. We&#8217;ll discuss growth, segment profitability, aggregate costs and COVID-19, among other factors. You can read along in the presentation <a href="https://assets.grab.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ir/investor-presentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2>How harshly did COVID-19 impact the business?</h2>
<p>The impact on Grab&#8217;s operations from COVID-19 resembles what happened to Uber in that the company&#8217;s deliveries business had a stellar 2020, while its ride-hailing business did not.</p>
<p>From a high level, Grab&#8217;s gross merchandise volume (GMV) was essentially flat from 2019 to 2020, rising from $12.2 billion to $12.5 billion. However, the company did manage to greatly boost its adjusted net revenue over the same period, which rose from $1 billion to $1.6 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

At the beginning of April, Clubhouse said it would give a &#8220;small test group&#8221; of creators the ability to accept payments from their fans and supporters through the social audio app. These donations go 100% to the creators, Clubhouse noted at the time. Though tests began with just 1,000 users, Clubhouse this weekend rolled out payments to another 60,000-plus users in the U.S., the company said during its Town Hall weekly event. And it expects to have payments roll out to everyone over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a fast pace of development for an app that&#8217;s now being challenged on all sides from companies including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/twitter-spaces-to-launch-publicly-next-month-may-include-spaces-only-tweets/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-30/spotify-acquires-locker-room-and-announces-plans-for-a-new-live-audio-experience/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://in.mashable.com/tech/21515/reddit-is-secretly-exploring-a-clubhouse-like-voice-chat-feature">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a> and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>. By making payments more quickly available, Clubhouse could potentially better retain its top creators who could otherwise be influenced to jump ship for a rival app with a broader reach.</p>
<p>During Clubhouse&#8217;s Town Hall event, co-founder Paul Davison noted that another 66,000 creators gained the ability to receive payments this weekend, following the launch of the original test. To send a payment, users can visit a creator&#8217;s profile, then tap on the button at the bottom that says &#8220;Send Money.&#8221; This will launch a screen that suggests amounts like $5, $10 or $20, or you can fill in your own amount. The feature is being powered by Stripe and currently requires a debit or credit card to work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2137842" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137842" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2137842" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_8899.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_8899.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_8899.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_8899.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_8899.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_8899.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_8899.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_8899.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_8899.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137842" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Davison again noted that creators will receive the full amount users send, while the fees paid on transactions will go to its partner Stripe to cover the payment processing fees. He added, too, that users should not send Clubhouse team members like himself payments, even though their profiles include the feature. Though he didn&#8217;t say why &#8212; only noting that all such donations would be given to charity &#8212; the reason has to do with how in-app purchases work on the App Store.</p>
<p>Apple a couple of years ago <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-and-tencent-reach-deal-to-let-wechat-users-dole-out-tips-1516018849">carved out an exception to its rules</a> around commissions on in-app purchases in those cases where the business wasn&#8217;t profiting in any way from the donations or tips being sent to creators using the app. That&#8217;s why Clubhouse has stressed that it doesn&#8217;t take a cut of creator revenue at this time and why it&#8217;s emphasizing that it doesn&#8217;t keep any donations sent its way, either.</p>
<p>The company also cleared up some rumors around who would first gain access to payments, noting that users didn&#8217;t have a start a &#8220;club&#8221; on Clubhouse in order to be considered. Instead, Davison said the app was prioritizing those users who had been recently active and who didn&#8217;t have any violations. But otherwise, the initial testers have been a largely random sampling.</p>

<p>In-app payments are only one of the avenues Clubhouse plans to explore to generate revenue both for creators and, longer-term, for itself. The company is also considering features like subscriptions for creators and clubs, ticketed events and brand deals.</p>
<p>Clubhouse also offered an update on plans for its Creator First program. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">last month announced the program,</a> which will help creators get their first shows off the ground with Clubhouse&#8217;s help. Selected creators will receive equipment, get promotional and marketing support, and receive help with booking guests and even income.</p>
<p>To date, Clubhouse has fielded over 5,000 submissions from interested users. To narrow down the field, the company said it will host a &#8220;pilot season&#8221; of sorts beginning April 23, where 60 yet-to-be-announced creators will debut shows at a pace of one episode over a three-week period. The Creator First program participants will then be selected based on feedback from a panel of judges and the Clubhouse community. Those initial 60 finalists will be announced April 23, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple only dropped info about WWDC two weeks back, but the company just announced another event &#8212; this one happening much sooner. After Siri spilled the beans this morning, the company has officially confirmed its next event for April 20. Invites for its &#8220;Spring Loaded&#8221; event went out just now, sporting what appears to be a doodle drawn on an iPad.</p>
<p>Of course, the assistant’s earlier suggestion that the event is being held at “Apple Park in Cupertino” was only true from a certain point of view, to quote a famous space wizard. It’s 2021, after all, and everything still very much happens online, which means some snazzily edited drone shots of the Spaceship Apple.</p>
<p>As for what this all means from a product perspective, all signs appear to point to new iPads. Specifically, the company is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display">rumored to be releasing</a> a 12.9-inch version of the Pro, sporting a Mini LED, improved cameras and faster chips in-line with what we&#8217;ve seen on recent Macs. Continued supply constraints, however, could present an issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another long-standing rumor is the arrival of AirTags. Yes, we’ve heard that one before, but the company just laid the groundwork for some big Find My improvements. Along with opening the app to other companies, the company announced a bunch of third-party hardware sporting the tech. The list includes the Chipolo ONE Spot, which beats Apple to the punch as the first device tag to use the tech.</p>
<p>The event kicks off 10 a.m. PT. We’ll (virtually) see you there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlassian&#8217;s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> is an extremely powerful issue tracking and project management tool, but it&#8217;s not the world&#8217;s most intuitive piece of software. Spreadsheets, on the other hand, are pretty much the de facto standard for managing virtually anything in a business. It&#8217;s maybe no surprise then that there are already a couple of tools on the market that bring a spreadsheet-like view of your projects to Jira or <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220382/jira-cloud-for-google-sheets-official?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview">connect it</a> to services like Google Sheets.</p>
<p>The latest entrant in this field is <a href="https://jxl.app/">JXL Spreadsheets for Jira</a> (and specifically Jira Cloud), which was founded by two ex-Atlassian employees, Daniel Franz and Hannes Obweger. And in what has become a bit of a trend, Atlassian Ventures invested in JXL earlier this year.</p>
<p>Franz <a href="https://goodnews.click/">built the Good News news reader</a> before joining Atlassian, while his co-founder previously founded Radiant Minds Software, the makers of Portfolio for Jira, which was acquired by Atlassian.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2137767" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137767" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137767" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jql-composer-bar.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2137767" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> JXL</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Jira is so successful because it is awesome,&#8221; Franz told me. &#8220;It is so versatile. It&#8217;s highly customizable. I&#8217;ve seen people in my time who are doing anything and everything with it. Working with customers [at Atlassian] &#8212; at some point, you didn&#8217;t get surprised anymore, but what the people can do and track with Jira is amazing. But no one would rock up and say, &#8216;hey, Jira is very pleasant and easy to use.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>As Franz noted, by default, Jira takes a very opinionated view of how people should use it. But that also means that users often end up exporting their issues to create reports and visualizations, for example. But if they make any changes to this data, it never flows back into Jira. No matter how you feel about spreadsheets, they do work for many people and are highly flexible. Even Atlassian would likely agree because the new <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/work-management">Jira Work Management</a>, which is currently in beta, comes with a spreadsheet-like view and Trello, too, recently went this way when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/atlassian-launches-a-whole-new-trello/">launched</a> a major update earlier this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137766" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137766" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137766" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2137766" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> JXL</p></div></p>
<p>Over the course of its three-month beta, the JXL team saw how its users ended up building everything from cross-project portfolio management to sprint planning, backlog maintenance, timesheets and inventory management on top of its service. Indeed, Franz tells me that the team already has some large customers, with one of them having a 7,000-seat license.</p>
<p>Pricing for JXL seems quite reasonable, starting at $1 flat for teams with up to 10 users. Larger teams pay per user/month, with prices that go down to $0.45/user/month for licenses with over 5,000 seats. There is also a free trial.</p>
<p>One of the reasons the company can offer this kind of pricing is because it only needs a very simple backend. None of a customer&#8217;s data sits on JXL&#8217;s servers. Instead, it sits right on top of Jira&#8217;s APIs, which in turn also means that changes are synced back and forth in real time.</p>
<p>JXL is now available in the <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Marketplace</a> and the team is actively hiring as it looks to build out its product (and put its new funding to work).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is set to send a payload to the moon in 2023, using its larger (and infrequently used) Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. The mission will fly a lander <a href="https://www.astrobotic.com/2021/4/13/astrobotic-space-x">built by space startup Astrobotic</a>, which itself will be carrying NASA&#8217;s VIPER, or Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (this is the agency that loves torturing language to come up with fun acronyms, after all).</p>
<p>The launch is currently set for later in the year, and this would be Falcon Heavy&#8217;s first moon mission if all goes to plan. It will not, however, be SpaceX&#8217;s first lunar outing, as the company has booked missions to launch lunar landers as early as 2022 on behalf of both Masten and Intuitive Machines. Those would both employ Falcon 9 rockets, however, at least according to current mission specs. Also, all of the above timelines so far exist only on paper, and in the business of space, delays and schedule shifts are far from unusual.</p>
<p>This mission is an important one for all involved, however, so they&#8217;re likely to prioritize its execution. For NASA, it&#8217;s a key mission in its longer-term goals for Artemis, the program through which it seeks to return humans to the moon, and eventually establish a more permanent scientific presence there both in orbit and on the surface. Part of establishing a surface station will rely on using in-situ resources, of which water would be a hugely important one.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Astrobotic last year won the contract to deliver VIPER on behalf of NASA. The mission profile includes landing the payload on the lunar South Pole, which is the intended target landing area for NASA&#8217;s Artemis missions involving human astronauts. The lander Astrobotic is sending for this task is its Griffin model, which is a larger craft than its Peregrine lander, giving it the extra space required to carry the VIPER, and making it necessary to use SpaceX&#8217;s heavier lift Falcon Heavy launch vehicle.</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s ambitious target of landing astronauts back on the moon by 2024 is in flux as the new administration looks at timelines and budgets, but it still seems committed to making use of public-private partnerships to pave the way, whenever it does attain that goal. This first Griffin mission, along with an earlier planned Peregrine landing, are part of NASA&#8217;s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which sought private sector partners to build and deliver lunar landers with NASA as one customer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In light of the Microsoft-Nuance deal, we dug into the AI venture capital market. What’s happening on the startup side in the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) space?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">huge purchase</a> of health tech AI company Nuance led the technology news cycle this week. The $19.7 billion transaction is Microsoft’s second-largest to date, only beaten by its purchase of LinkedIn some years ago.</p>
<p>For the AI space, the sale is a coup. Nuance was already a public company, but to see Microsoft offer a firm premium over its public-market value demonstrates the value that AI technology can have to wealthy companies. For startups working in the AI space, the Nuance deal is good news; the value of AI revenue was repriced by the acquisition’s announcement &#8212; and for the better.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-goes-all-in-on-healthcare-with-19-7b-nuance-acquisition/">light of the megadeal</a>, The Exchange dug into the AI venture capital market. What’s happening on the startup side of the coin in the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) space?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, the password management service that competes with the likes of <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> and <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a>, today announced a major push beyond the basics of password management and into the infrastructure secrets management space. To do so, the company has acquired secrets management service <a href="https://secrethub.io/">SecretHub</a> and is now launching its new 1Password Secrets Automation service.</p>
<p>1Password did not disclose the price of the acquisition. According to CrunchBase, Netherlands-based SecretHub never raised any institutional funding ahead of today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>For companies like 1Password, moving into the enterprise space &#8212; and managing corporate credentials, API tokens, keys and certificates for individual users and their increasingly complex infrastructure services &#8212;  seems like a natural move. And with the combination of 1Password and its new Secrets Automation service, businesses can use a single tool that covers them, from managing their employee&#8217;s passwords to handling infrastructure secrets. 1Password is currently in use by more then 80,000 businesses worldwide, and a lot of these are surely potential users of its Secrets Automation service, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Companies need to protect their infrastructure secrets as much if not more than their employees’ passwords,&#8221; said Jeff Shiner, CEO of <span class="il">1Password</span>. &#8220;With <span class="il">1Password</span> and Secrets Automation, there is a single source of truth to secure, manage and orchestrate all of your business secrets. We are the first company to bring both human and machine secrets together in a significant and easy-to-use way.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the acquisition and new service, 1Password also today announced a new partnership with GitHub. &#8220;We&#8217;re partnering with <span class="il">1Password</span> because their cross-platform solution will make life easier for developers and security teams alike,&#8221; said Dana Lawson, VP of partner engineering and development at GitHub, the largest and most advanced development platform in the world. &#8220;With the upcoming GitHub and <span class="il">1Password</span> Secrets Automation integration, teams will be able to fully automate all of their infrastructure secrets, with full peace of mind that they are safe and secure.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After his last startup, Framed Data, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/14/square-brings-on-the-team-behind-framed-data-a-predictive-analytics-startup/">acquired by Square</a>, Thomson Nguyen began exploring new ideas. While an entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner Perkins, Nguyen interviewed hundreds of small business owners and realized that many pay hundreds of dollars in fees to maintain a business checking account. “Most small businesses are low margin, high cash flow, so they don’t have $4,000 just laying around,” Nguyen told TechCrunch. “We found in our analysis that micro-SMBs actually end up paying on average $450 in overdraft fees a year.”</p>
<p>Nguyen’s new startup <a href="https://www.hatchcard.com/">Hatch</a> recently launched its first two products and announced today it has secured a total of $20 million in funding from investors like Kleiner Perkins, Foundation Capital, SVB and Plaid’s founders. The fintech’s Hatch Business Checking accounts cost $10 a month, don’t charge non-sufficient funds (NSF) or overdraft fees and include cashback offers. Eligible account holders can also enroll in Hatch Cover, which covers overdrafts up to $100, or apply for lines of credit.</p>
<p>Some of Hatch’s customers have hundreds of employees, but Nguyen said the startup primarily focuses on businesses with up to 20 people. Many are run by only one person, who might be setting up a business account for the first time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hatch draws on Nguyen’s professional and personal backgrounds. Framed Data, a predictive analytics company, was acquired by Square in 2016. He worked as Square Capital’s head of data science before becoming an entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner Perkins in 2018, focusing on fintech and machine learning problems. As a child of immigrants, Nguyen saw firsthand the challenges small businesses can face.</p>

<p>“During my time at Kleiner, the goal was to think about what other problems I wanted to solve. I definitely wanted to solve additional problems within small businesses. I think a lot of what I appreciate about Square’s mission of economic empowerment for small businesses also really resonated with my own family story,” he said. “My parents immigrated here from Vietnam after the war and were like so many immigrants to the States to start small businesses. Figuring out how to use whatever talents I had to try to make it easier to start small businesses was definitely something I wanted to pursue.”</p>
<p>Hatch’s <a href="https://www.hatchcard.com/about">leadership team</a>, including alumni of fintech companies and major financial institutions like Square, Stripe, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan, talked to small business owners, and found that recent immigrants or people without credit histories were paying the majority of bank fees. The startup raised a $5 million seed round from Kleiner Perkins, Abstract Ventures and former Square executive Gokul Rajaram in January 2019, then a $14 million Series A round from Foundation Capital, SVB and Plaid founders William Hockey and Zack Perret in February 2020.</p>

<p>Hatch Business Checking began rolling out in January and currently has 4,000 users. The company’s inception coincided with an especially brutal time for many small business owners, as they <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/30/17656">weathered the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic impact</a> and navigated the process of getting government aid through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.</p>
<p>“Initially I was a little worried, but as I was talking to all of our small business customers and even as I was doing these interviews, I realized that amidst a global pandemic, it’s been humbling to see the grit and perseverance of small business owners trying to innovate and learn,” Nguyen said.</p>
<p>For example, some of Hatch’s users are restaurants that hadn’t done deliveries before, but quickly signed up for multiple on-demand platforms like Postmates or Uber Eats. Others include accountants and lawyers who figured out how to move their practices online.</p>
<p>Hatch serves businesses in a wide range of sectors, including first-time entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“There’s been this interesting trend of sole proprietors and individual creators who maybe had a side hustle, and after they were laid off during COVID, they decided, okay, I’m going start a small business,” Nguyen said. “Through our research, that’s actually how a lot of small businesses think of themselves, not as Thomson Tacos LLC for example, but just as myself, as Thomson, a person who is running this business.”</p>
<p>The startup uses machine learning to automate Hatch Business Checking’s online sign-up process and its know your customer (KYC) and know your business (KYB) requirements. This includes confirming business incorporation paperwork, social security or employer ID numbers and regulatory compliance like Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) checks. Hatch can approve applications in less than five minutes. Once that process is complete, customers get a Mastercard virtual number and can link external bank accounts. Hatch also uses machine learning for real-time fraud and risk monitoring.</p>
<p>Nguyen said Hatch launched its overdraft coverage program because “we found it is a really great way for folks to get themselves out of a bind, finish the point sale and then top up their account later.”</p>
<p>If a business with a Hatch Business Checking account needs more working capital, it can apply for a Hatch Business Line of Credit, or loans between $200 to $5,000 at an APR of 18% to 24%. Hatch does not do hard credit checks and sees the credit lines as an alternative to the payday lenders or check cashers that customers without a FICO score or subprime ratings often use.</p>
<p>To screen loan applicants, Hatch uses information from their Business Checking accounts, including activity from connected point-of-sale systems. This allows Hatch to see real-time data and forecast a business’ potential forward revenue. It also enables the company to approve credit lines in as little as two hours.</p>
<p>“A hard credit check is actually quite difficult for recent immigrants or Americans who had trouble in their recent history. If you declare bankruptcy, it takes seven years to get it struck off your credit history,” said Nguyen. “To us, I think the more important factors are whether you actually have a business and whether that business is growing. We have a couple of examples of folks who declared bankruptcy three or four years ago, but they have a business that is booming and growing, and we’re happy to underwrite or originate that line of credit for them.”</p>
<p>But he emphasizes that Hatch, a signatory of the <a href="http://www.borrowersbillofrights.org/">Small Business Owner’s Bill of Rights</a>, does not see lending as a permanent solution and will not encourage its users to take on unnecessary debt.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Despite the pandemic, small business optimism persists&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/despite-the-pandemic-small-business-optimism-persists/embed/#?secret=aYI7dy9GKT" data-secret="aYI7dy9GKT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“I think the reason we feel so strongly about this is that we want to win when our customers win,” Nguyen said. “If all we did was lending, then you would almost have a misalignment of incentives where you want to encourage lending retention. Given our business bank accounts and our revenue model, which is $10 a month and debit interchange, we really win when the business continues to exist. So for us, it’s almost a matter of building that financial independence for our customers.”</p>
<p>Hatch currently covers overdrafts and credit lines with its own balance sheet. “Because we’re using machine learning data to understand our own risk position, the main focus right now is to understand how businesses grow and model those products accordingly,” said Nguyen.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, Kleiner Perkins partner Ilya Fushman told TechCrunch, “Small businesses account for nearly half of all economic activity in the U.S., but are often hamstrung by the banking ecosystem today. Hatch is democratizing access to the financial resources that small businesses need to start out and grow. Thomson and team are already working with thousands of SMBs and are uniquely suited with the technology and industry expertise to help them grow with the financial resources they need to be successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his statement about Foundation Capital’s investment, partner Charles Moldow said, “Our view at Foundation Capital is that the next phase of financial innovation is confluence: a coming together of lending and mobile banking. Hatch is a breaker wave of this movement for small businesses. That Thomson and his team were able to so rapidly stand up the only full-solution, mobile-first bank offering for SMBs is a testament to what they can and will accomplish.”</p>
<p>Since Hatch’s Series A, it has grown its team from eight people to 48, hiring remotely during the pandemic. Its plan is to expand its Business Checking accounts and continue building products for the estimated 40 million small businesses in the United States.</p>
<p>“When I think of the future products we can provide, it really centers around how do we make sure that a small business succeeds in starting up correctly and efficiently, and scaling their business,” said Nguyen. “Sometimes that’s financial products like our business accounts. Potentially, it could be software products that help you actually start that business. So there’s a wealth of different ideas and directions in which we can take Hatch.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook&#8217;s self-styled &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; (FOB) has announced an operational change that looks intended to respond to criticism of the limits of the self-regulatory content-moderation decision review body: It says it&#8217;s started accepting requests from users to review decisions to leave content up on Facebook and Instagram.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s self-styled &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; (FOB) has <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/267806285017646-the-oversight-board-is-accepting-user-appeals-to-remove-content-from-facebook-and-instagram/">announced</a> an operational change that looks intended to respond to criticism of the limits of the self-regulatory content-moderation decision review body: It says it&#8217;s started accepting requests from users to review decisions to leave content up on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>The move expands the FOB&#8217;s remit beyond reviewing (and mostly reversing) content takedowns &#8212; an arbitrary limit that critics said aligns it with the economic incentives of its parent entity, given that Facebook&#8217;s business benefits from increased engagement with content (and outrageous content drives clicks and makes eyeballs stick).</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, users have been able to appeal content to the Board which they think should be <i>restored</i> to Facebook or Instagram. Now, users can also appeal content to the Board which they think should be <i>removed</i> from Facebook or Instagram,&#8221; the FOB writes, adding that it will &#8220;use its independent judgment to decide what to leave up and what to take down&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our decisions will be binding on Facebook,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The ability to request an appeal on content Facebook wouldn&#8217;t take down has been added across all markets, per Facebook. But <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/users-can-now-appeal-content-left-up-on-facebook-or-instagram-to-the-oversight-board/">the tech giant said</a> it will take some &#8220;weeks&#8221; for all users to get access as it said it&#8217;s rolling out the feature &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in waves to ensure stability of the product experience&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>While the FOB can now get individual pieces of content taken down from Facebook/Instagram &#8212; i.e. if the Board believes it&#8217;s justified in reversing an earlier decision by the company <em>not</em> to remove content &#8212; it cannot make Facebook adopt any associated suggestions vis-à-vis its content moderation policies generally.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Facebook has never said it will be bound by the FOB&#8217;s policy recommendations; only by the final decision made per review.</p>
<p>That in turn limits the FOB&#8217;s ability to influence the shape of the tech giant&#8217;s approach to speech policing. And indeed the whole effort remains inextricably bound to Facebook, which devised and structured the FOB &#8212; writing the Board&#8217;s charter and bylaws, and hand picking the first cohort of members. The company thus continues to exert inescapable pull on the strings linking its self-regulatory vehicle to its lucrative people-profiling and ad-targeting empire.</p>
<p>The FOB getting the ability to review content &#8220;keep ups&#8221; (if we can call them that) is also essentially irrelevant when you consider the ocean of content Facebook has ensured the Board <em>won&#8217;t</em> have any say in moderating &#8212; because its limited resources/man-power mean it can only ever consider a fantastically tiny subset of cases referred to it for review.</p>
<p>For an oversight body to provide a meaningful limit on Facebook&#8217;s power it would need to have considerably more meaty (i.e. legal) powers; be able to freely range across all aspects of Facebook&#8217;s business (not just review user generated content); and be truly independent of the adtech mothership &#8212; as well as having meaningful powers of enforcement and sanction.</p>
<p>So, in other words, it needs to be a public body, functioning in the public interest.</p>

<p>Instead, while Facebook applies its army of in-house lawyers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">fight <em>actual</em> democratic regulatory oversight and compliance</a>, it has splashed out to fashion this bespoke bureaucracy that can align with its speech interests &#8212; handpicking a handful of external experts to pay to perform a content review cameo in its crisis PR drama.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, then, the FOB has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/facebooks-oversight-body-overturns-four-takedowns-and-issues-a-slew-of-policy-tweaks/">mostly moved the needle in a speech-maximizing direction</a> so far &#8212; while expressing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/facebooks-oversight-board-already-a-bit-frustrated-and-it-hasnt-made-a-call-on-trump-ban-yet/">some frustration</a> at the limited deck of cards Facebook has dealt it.</p>
<p>Most notably, the Board still has a decision pending on whether to reverse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">Facebook&#8217;s indefinitely ban</a> on former U.S. President Donald Trump. If it reverses that decision Facebook users won&#8217;t have any recourse to appeal the restoration of Trump&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>The only available route would, presumably, be for users to report future Trump content to Facebook for violating its policies &#8212; and if Facebook refuses to take that stuff down, users could try to request an FOB review. But, again, there&#8217;s no guarantee the FOB will accept any such review requests. (Indeed, if the board chooses to reinstate Trump that may make it harder for it to accept requests to review Trump content, at least in the short term (in the interests of keeping a diverse case file, so&#8230; ).</p>

<h2>How to ask for a review after content isn&#8217;t removed</h2>
<p>To request the FOB review a piece of content that&#8217;s been left up a user of Facebook/Instagram first has to report the content to Facebook/Instagram.</p>
<p>If the company decides to keep the content up Facebook says the reporting person will receive an Oversight Board Reference ID (a 10-character string that begins with &#8220;FB&#8221;) in their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/support/?helpref=faq_content">Support Inbox</a> &#8212; which they can use to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/346366453115924">appeal its &#8220;no takedown&#8221; decision to the Oversight Board</a>.</p>
<p>There are several hoops to jump through to make an appeal: Following on-screen instructions Facebook says the user will be taken to the <a class="_5dwo _9fua" href="https://www.oversightboard.com/login/">Oversight Board website</a> where they need to log in with the account to which the reference ID was issued.</p>
<p>They will then be asked to provide responses to a number of questions about their reasons for reporting the content (to &#8220;help the board understand why you think Facebook made the wrong decision&#8221;).</p>
<p class="_9fu7">Once an appeal has been submitted, the Oversight Board will decide whether or not to review it. The board only selects a certain number of &#8220;eligible appeals&#8221; to review; and Facebook has not disclosed the proportion of requests the Board accepts for review vs submissions it receives &#8212; per case or on aggregate. So how much chance of submission success any user has for any given piece of content is an unknown (and probably unknowable) quantity.</p>
<p>Users who have submitted an appeal against content that was left up can check the status of their appeal via the FOB&#8217;s website &#8212; again by logging in and <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">using the reference ID.</span></p>
<p>A further limitation is time, as Facebook notes there&#8217;s a time limit on appealing decisions to the FOB.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Bear in mind that there is a time limit on appealing decisions to the Oversight Board. Once the window to appeal a decision has expired, you will no longer be able to submit it,&#8221; it writes in its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/346366453115924">Help Center</a>, without specifying how long users have to get their appeal in (we asked Facebook to confirm this and it&#8217;s 15 days). </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might think that a startup whose primary customers are tourism bureaus would have had a pretty rough 2020, but CEO Monir Parikh said <a href="https://bandwango.com">Bandwango</a>&#8216;s customer base more than doubled in the past year, growing from 75 to 200.</p>
<p>In Parikh&#8217;s words, the Murray, Utah-based startup has built a platform called the Destination Experience Engine which is designed for &#8220;connecting businesses with communities.&#8221; That means bringing together offers from local restaurants, retailers, wineries, breweries, state parks and more into package deals — such as the <a href="https://bandwango.com/newport-beach-dine-pass-case-study/">Newport Beach Dine Pass</a> and the <a href="https://www.traveliowa.com/getinspireddetails/get-your-iowa-state-park-passport/418/">Travel Iowa State Passport</a> — which are then sold by tourism bureaus.</p>
<p>Obviously, the pandemic dealt a big blow to tourism, but in response, many of these organizations shifted focus to deals that could entice locals to support nearby businesses and attractions. Parikh predicted that even after the pandemic, tourism bureaus will continue to understand that &#8220;local-focused tourism is going to be part of the mix of what we do — locals are your ambassadors, they are the best organic marketing channel.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plus, Parikh said that as new privacy regulations make it harder to collect data about online visitors, it&#8217;s becoming more challenging for tourism bureaus &#8220;to prove to their funders that they&#8217;re having an economic impact.&#8221; So where bureaus were content in the past to advertise deals and then link out to other sites where customers could make the actual purchases, selling the deals themselves has become a new way to prove their worth.</p>

<p>With last year&#8217;s growth, Bandwango has raised $3.1 million in seed funding led by Next Frontier Capital, with participation from Kickstart, Signal Peak Ventures, SaaS Ventures and Ocean Azul Partners. (The startup had previously raised only $700,000 in funding.)</p>
<p>Parikh said that until now, Bandwango has been a largely full-service option. The selling point, after all, is that the tourism bureaus already &#8220;have great relationships with these local businesses,&#8221; but the startup can handle the hard work of &#8220;trying to wrangle 200 of their local businesses&#8221; to offer deals and accept those deals in-store.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Even amid the pandemic, this newly funded travel startup is tackling the stodgy timeshare market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/even-amid-the-pandemic-this-newly-funded-travel-startup-is-tackling-the-stodgy-timeshare-market/embed/#?secret=5bAOVzvoMf" data-secret="5bAOVzvoMf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Our mantra is: We become your back office,&#8221; he added. But with the new funding, he wants the startup to build a self-serve product as well. &#8220;What I say to my team is that a 90-year-old grandmother, as well as 12-year-old teenager, should be able to come into our platform and say, &#8216;I want to create a local savings program or an ale trail&#8217; and do it end-to-end, without our assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Bandwango is currently focused on providing a white-label solution to its customers (rather than building a consumer deal destination of its own), Parikh said it will eventually distribute these deals more broadly by creating its own &#8220;private label brands.&#8221;</p>
