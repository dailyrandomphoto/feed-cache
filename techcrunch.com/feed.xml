										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we think about getting access to an application, we tend to focus on the authentication side &#8212; granting or denying people (or devices) entry. But there is another piece to this, and that&#8217;s authorization. This is related to what you can do once you are inside the application, and <a href="https://www.osohq.com/">Oso</a>, an early stage startup, has created an open source library for developers to make it easier to build authorization in their applications.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced an $8.2 million Series A led by Sequoia with participation from SV Angel, Company Ventures, Highland Capital and numerous angel investors. When combined with a $2.7 million seed round from 2019, it brings the total raised to $10.9 million.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Graham Neray says that developers have benefited from tools like Stripe and Twilio to normalize the use of third-party APIs to offload parts of the application that aren&#8217;t core to the value prop. Oso does the same thing, except for authorization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We help developers to speed up their authorization roadmaps by up to 4x, and the way that we do that is by providing this library, which comes with pre-built integrations, guides and an underlying policy language,&#8221; Neray explained.</p>
<p>He says that authorization is a misunderstood concept, and as though to confirm this, when I tried to explain Oso to a colleague, his first thought was that it is an Okta competitor. It&#8217;s not. As Neray explains authorization and authentication are related, but are in fact different and require a different set of tools.</p>
<p>While tools like Okta grant you access, authorization determines what buttons can you click, what pages, can you see, what data can you access. Most developers handle this manually by writing the authorization code themselves, linking it to Active Directory (or a similar tool) and fashioning a permissions matrix. Oso&#8217;s goal is to remove that burden and provide a set of tools to abstract away most of the complexity.</p>
<p>The tool is open source and the startup is concentrating on building a community of users for now to build developer interest. Over time, they fully intend to build a commercial company on top of that, but are still thinking about how that will look.</p>

<p>For now,Â  the company, which launched in 2018, has 9 employees with plans to triple over the next 18 months. Naray and co-founder and CTO Sam Scott are thinking carefully about how to build a diverse, inclusive and equitable company as they grow. That means hiring from underrepresented groups, treating them fairly and making them feel like they belong. Naray says at this point, he is doing all of the hiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;I make a concerted effort to ensure that our pipeline is as diverse as I want the team to be &#8212; full stop &#8212; and that&#8217;s the only way to do it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He adds that while building a diverse workforce is the morally right thing to do for him and his co-founder, there is also a practical business side to this too. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to build an echo chamber with people from the same background, the same thought process and all the same upbringing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When the company can return to the office, the plan is to have a home base, but let folks work where they want and how they want. &#8220;The plan is we will have an office in New York, and we will have remote team members. So in one form or another it will be hybrid,&#8221; Naray said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LA and Bangalore-based space startup <a href="https://pixxel.space">Pixxel</a> has closed a $7.3 million seed round, including newly committed capital from Techstars, Omnivore VC and more. The company has also announced a new product focus: Hyperspectral imaging. It aims to provide that imaging at the highest resolution commercially available, via a small satellite constellation that will provide 24-hour, global coverage once it&#8217;s fully operational.</p>
<p>Pixxel&#8217;s funding today is an extension of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/indias-first-earth-imaging-satellite-startup-raises-5-million-first-launch-planned-for-later-this-year/">$5 million it announced it had raised back in August of last year</a>. At the time, the startup had only revealed that it was focusing on Earth imaging,, and it&#8217;s unveiling its specific pursuit of hyperspectral imaging for the first time today. Hyperspectral imaging uses far more light frequencies than the much more commonly-used multispectral imaging used in satellite observation today, allowing for unprecedented insight and detection of previously invisible issues, including migration of pest insect populations in agriculture, or observing gas leaks and other ecological threats.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126194" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2EAD168D-82D2-45E6-923D-E2440C957F3B.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126194" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2126194" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2EAD168D-82D2-45E6-923D-E2440C957F3B.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2EAD168D-82D2-45E6-923D-E2440C957F3B.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2EAD168D-82D2-45E6-923D-E2440C957F3B.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2EAD168D-82D2-45E6-923D-E2440C957F3B.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2EAD168D-82D2-45E6-923D-E2440C957F3B.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126194" class="wp-caption-text">Standard multispectral imaging (left) vs. hyperspectral imaging (right)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We started with analyzing existing satellite images, and what we could do with this immediately,&#8221; explained Pixxel co-founder and CEO Awais Ahmed in an interview. &#8220;We realized that in most cases, it was not able to even see certain problems or issues that we wanted to solve â for example, we wanted to be able to look at air pollution and water pollution levels. But to be able to do that there were no commercial satellites that would enable us to do that, or even open source satellite data at the resolution that would enable us to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The potential of hyperspectral imaging on Earth, across a range of sectors, is huge, according to Ahmed, but Pixxel&#8217;s long-term vision is all about empowering a future commercial space sector to make the most of in-space resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started looking at space as a sector for us to be able to work in, and we realized that what we wanted to do was to be able to enable people to take resources from space to use in space,&#8221; Ahmed said. That included asteroid mining, for example, and when we investigated that, we found hyperspectral imaging was the imaging tech that would enable us to map these asteroids as to whether they contain these metal or these minerals. So that knowledge sort of transferred to this more short-term problem that we were looking at solving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the reason that Pixxel&#8217;s founders couldn&#8217;t find existing available hyperspectral imaging at the resolutions they needed was that as a technology, it has previously been restricted to internal governmental use through regulation. The U.S. recently opened up the ability for commercial entities to pursue very high-resolution hyperspectral imaging for use on the private market, effectively because they realized that these technical capabilities were becoming available in other international markets anyway.Â Ahmed told me that the main blocker was still technical, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we were to build a camera like this even two or three years ago, it would not have been possible because of the miniaturized sensors, the optics, etc.,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The advances that have happened only happened very recently, so it&#8217;s also the fact that this the right time to take it from the scientific domain to the commercial domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pixxel now aims to have its first hyperspectral imaging satellite launched and operating on orbit within the next few months, and it will then continue to launch additional satellites after that once it&#8217;s able to test and evaluate the performance of its first spacecraft in an actual operating environment.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back toÂ <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunchâs venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down and focus on a single topic, or theme. This is our sweet spot: going beyond definitions and into the dirty and deep impact of how a phenomenon could impact startups and tech. We are hoping to explore more than answer, and debate more than agree.</p>
<p>This week we&#8217;re riffing on the impending Y Combinator demo day class, all hailing from the Winter 2021 cohort. As we stated on the show, we&#8217;re not saying that these are the only startups worth looking at. They&#8217;re simply the startups from the batch that TechCrunch has already covered, as well as some crowdsourced favorites.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a brief rundown of the show, bucketed by market choice, loosely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Startups serving startups:</strong> The largest group of startups in our rundown, we chatted about <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a>, which is building HR software for Southeast Asia (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/briohr-raises-1-3m-ahead-of-y-combinators-demo-day/">here</a>), <a href="https://firstbase.io/en">Firstbase</a>, which is building a remote-work onboarding service (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/">here</a>), <a href="https://contentfly.com/">ContentFly</a>, which wants to use a hybrid of computer and human intelligence to provide writing services, <a href="https://www.runway.team/">Runway</a>, which wants to help companies better manage app rollouts (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/rent-the-runways-first-ios-team-launches-runway-an-easier-way-to-coordinate-app-releases/">here</a>), and <a href="https://mono.co/">Mono</a>, which is building a Plaid for Africa (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Marketplaces:</strong> Here we found two companies to discuss, the first being Providence&#8217;s own <a href="https://pangea.app/">Pangea</a>, and <a href="https://queenly.com/">Queenly</a>. Pangea (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/yc-backed-pangea-discusses-growth-fundraising-ahead-of-demo-day/">here</a>), is building a freelance marketplace for digitally-savvy college kids and small businesses, while Queenly is a marketplace for formalwearÂ (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Space:Â </strong>Alex demanded that we include <a href="https://www.albedo.space/">Albedo</a>, which is aiming to launch a satellite constellation to improve imaging of the planet using low-orbit flight paths.</li>
<li><strong>Biotech:Â </strong>And then there were two biotech companies. The first, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/23610">Pipe|Bio</a> does big data management for drug development, and <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/23522">Nuntius Therapeutics</a>, which is working on delivering &#8220;large genetic payloads into the correct cells.&#8221; Which sounds cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual Demo Day is happening next Tuesday, so TechCrunch and Extra Crunch will be all over day-of coverage as per usual. Talk then!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook this morning announced it will increase the penalties against its rule-breaking Facebook Groups and their members, alongside other changes designed to reduce the visibility of groups&#8217; potentially harmful content. The company says it will now remove civic and political groups from its recommendations in markets outside the U.S., and will further restrict the reach of groups and members who continue to violate its rules.</p>
<p>The changes follow what has been a steady, but slow and sometimes ineffective crackdown on Facebook Groups that produce and share harmful, polarizing or even dangerous content.</p>
<p>Ahead of the U.S. elections, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/facebook-tries-to-clean-up-groups-with-new-policies/">Facebook implemented a series of new rules</a> designed to penalize those who violated its Community Standards or spread misinformation via Facebook Groups. These rules largely assigned more responsibility to Groups themselves, and penalized individuals who broke rules. Facebook also stopped recommending health groups, to push users to official sources for health information, including for information about Covid-19.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This January, Facebook made a more significant move against potentially dangerous groups. It announced it would remove civic and political groups, as well as newly created groups, from its recommendations in the U.S. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-will-stop-recommending-political-groups-permanently.html">following the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol</a> on Jan. 6, 2021. (Previously, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/facebook-group-recommendations-election/">had temporarily limited these groups</a> ahead of the U.S. elections.)</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knew-calls-for-violence-plagued-groups-now-plans-overhaul-11612131374">The WSJ reported when this policy became permanent</a>, Facebook&#8217;s internal research had found that Facebook groups in the U.S. were polarizing users and inflaming the calls for violence that spread after the elections. The researchers said roughly 70% of the top 100 most active civic Facebook Groups in the U.S. had issues with hate, misinformation, bullying and harassment that should make them non-recommendable, leading to the January 2021 crackdown.</p>
<p>Today, that same policy is being rolled out to Facebook&#8217;s global user base, not just Facebook U.S. users.</p>
<p>That means in addition to health groups, users worldwide won&#8217;t be &#8220;recommended&#8221; civic or political groups when browsing Facebook. It&#8217;s important, however, to note that recommendations are only one of many ways users find Facebook Groups. Users can also find them in search, through links people post, through invites and friends&#8217; private messages.</p>
<p>In addition, Facebook says groups that have gotten in trouble for violating Facebook&#8217;s rules will now be shown lower in recommendations &#8212; a sort of downranking penalty Facebook often uses to reduce the visibility of News Feed content.</p>
<p>The company will also increase the penalties against rule-violating groups and their individual members through a variety of other enforcement actions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126022" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126022" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126022" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-5.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-5.png 2808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-5.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-5.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-5.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-5.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-5.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-5.png?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-5.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126022" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>For example, users who attempt to join groups that have a history of breaking Facebook&#8217;s Community Standards will be alerted to the the group&#8217;s violations through a warning message (shown above), which may cause the user to reconsider joining.</p>
<p>The rule-violating groups will have their invite notifications limited, and current members will begin to see less of the groups&#8217; content in their News Feed, as the content will be shown further down. These groups will also be demoted in Facebook&#8217;s recommendations.</p>
<p>When a group hosts a substantial number of members who have violated Facebook policies or participated in other groups that were shut down for Facebook Community Standards violations, the group itself will have to temporarily approve all members&#8217; new posts. And if the admin or moderator repeatedly approves rule-breaking content, Facebook will then take the entire group down.</p>
<p>This rule aims to address problems around groups that re-form after being banned, only to restart their bad behavior unchecked.</p>
<p>The final change being announced today applies to group members.</p>
<p>When someone has repeated violations in Facebook Groups, they&#8217;ll be temporarily stopped from posting or commenting in any group, won&#8217;t be allowed to invite others to join groups, and won&#8217;t be able to create new groups. This measure aims to slow down the reach of bad actors, Facebook says.</p>
<p>The new policies give Facebook a way to more transparently document a group&#8217;s bad behavior that led to its final shutdown. This &#8220;paper trail,&#8221; of sorts, also helps Facebook duck accusations of bias when it comes to its enforcement actions &#8212;Â  a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/05/918520692/facebook-keeps-data-secret-letting-conservative-bias-claims-persist">charge often raised by Facebook critics</a> on the right, who believe social networks are biased against conservatives.</p>
<p>But the problem with these policies is that they&#8217;re still ultimately hand slaps for those who break Facebook&#8217;s rules &#8212; not all that different from what users today jokingly refer to as &#8220;<a href="https://insights.commentsold.com/what-is-facebook-jail-why-is-it-happening">Facebook jail</a>&#8220;. When individuals or Facebook Pages violate Facebook&#8217;s Community Standards, they&#8217;re temporarily prevented from interacting on the site or using specific features. Facebook is now trying to replicate that formula, with modifications, for Facebook Groups and their members.</p>
<p>There are other issues, as well. For one, these rules rely on Facebook to actually enforce them, and it&#8217;s unclear how well it will be able to do so. For another, they ignore one of the key means of group discovery: search. Facebook claims it downranks low-quality results here, but results of its efforts are decidedly mixed.</p>
<p>For example, though Facebook made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/">sweeping statements about banning QAnon content</a> across its platform in a misinformation crackdown last fall, it&#8217;s still possible to search for and find QAnon-adjacent content &#8212; like groups that aren&#8217;t <em>titled</em> QAnon but cater to QAnon-styled &#8220;patriots&#8221; and conspiracies).</p>
<p>Similarly, searches for terms like &#8220;antivax&#8221; or &#8220;covid hoax,&#8221; can also direct users to problematic groups &#8212; like the one for people who &#8220;aren&#8217;t anti-vax in general,&#8221; but are &#8220;just anti-RNA,&#8221; the group&#8217;s title explains; or the &#8220;parents against vaccines&#8221; group; or the &#8220;vaccine haters&#8221; group that proposes it&#8217;s spreading the &#8220;REAL vaccine information.&#8221; (We surfaced these on Tuesday, ahead of Facebook&#8217;s announcement.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cleary, these are not official health resources, and would not otherwise be recommended per Facebook policies &#8212; but are easy to surface through Facebook search. The company, however, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/vaccine_discouragement">takes</a> <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/combatting-vaccine-misinformation/">stronger</a> <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/addressing-movements-and-organizations-tied-to-violence/">measures</a> <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims">against</a> Covid-19 and Covid vaccine misinformation &#8212; it says it will remove Pages, groups, and accounts that repeatedly shared debunked claims, and otherwise downranks them.</p>
<p>Facebook, to be clear, <em>is</em> fully capable of using stronger technical means of blocking access to content.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">banned &#8220;stop the steal&#8221; and other conspiracies</a> following the U.S. elections, for example. And even today, a search for &#8220;stop the steal&#8221; groups simply returns a blank page saying no results were found.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126215" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126215" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126215" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-12.55.29-PM-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-12.55.29-PM-1.jpg 1315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-12.55.29-PM-1.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-12.55.29-PM-1.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-12.55.29-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,464 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-12.55.29-PM-1.jpg?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-12.55.29-PM-1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126215" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook fully blocks &#8220;stop the steal&#8221;</p></div></p>
<p>So why should a search for a banned topic like &#8220;QAnon&#8221; return anything at all?</p>
<p>Why should &#8220;covid hoax?&#8221; (see below)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126212" style="width: 678px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126212" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-9.39.57-AM.jpg?w=668" alt="" width="668" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-9.39.57-AM.jpg 1434w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-9.39.57-AM.jpg?resize=147,150 147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-9.39.57-AM.jpg?resize=295,300 295w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-9.39.57-AM.jpg?resize=768,782 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-9.39.57-AM.jpg?resize=668,680 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-9.39.57-AM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-9.39.57-AM.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-9.39.57-AM.jpg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126212" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Facebook group search results for &#8220;covid hoax&#8221;</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Facebook wanted to broaden its list of problematic search terms, and return blank pages for other types of harmful content, it could. In fact, if it wanted to maintain a block list of URLs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites">that are known to spread false information,</a> it could do that, too. It could prevent users from re-sharing any post that included those links. It could make those posts default to non-public. It could flag users who violate its rules repeatedly, or some subset of those rules, as users who no longer get to set their posts to public&#8230;ever.</p>
<p>In other words, Facebook could do many, many things if it truly wanted to have a significant impact on the spread misinformation, toxicity, polarizing and otherwise harmful content on its platform. Instead, it continues inching forward with temporary punishments and those that are often only aimed at &#8220;repeated&#8221; violations, such as the ones announced today. These are, arguably, more penalties than it had before &#8212; but also maybe not enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse, the buzzy but still invite only social audio app that&#8217;s popular with the Silicon Valley technorati, is being investigated by France&#8217;s privacy watchdog.</p>
<p>The CNIL <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/la-cnil-ouvre-une-enquete-sur-lapplication-clubhouse">announced today</a> it&#8217;s opened an investigation into Clubhouse following a complaint and after it got some initial responses back from Alpha Exploration Co., the U.S.-based company behind the app.</p>
<p>It also points to a <a href="https://actions.sumofus.org/a/clubhouse-cette-application-qui-sait-tout-de-vous">petition</a> that&#8217;s circulating in France with over 10,000 signatures &#8212; calling for regulatory intervention.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The regulator says it&#8217;s confirmed that Clubhouse&#8217;s owner is not established anywhere in the European Union &#8212; which means the app can be investigated by any EU DPA that receives a complaint or has its own concerns about EU citizens&#8217; data.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/german-regulator-voices-privacy-concerns-over-clubhouse-app">Last month</a> the Hamburg privacy regulator also raised concerns over Clubhouse, saying they&#8217;d asked the app for more information on how it protects the privacy of European users and their contacts.</p>
<p>In the EU, cross border data protection cases involving tech giants typically avoid this scenario as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes a mechanism that funnels complaints via a lead data supervisor &#8212; aka the national agency where the business is established in the EU.</p>
<p>This &#8216;one-stop-shop&#8217; (OSS) already has had the effect of slowing down GDPR enforcement against giants like Facebook, which have established their regional HQ in Ireland. But there is a further risk of a regulatory moat effect that benefits &#8216;big tech&#8217; if the OSS is combined with swifter unilateral privacy enforcement against newcomers like Clubhouse (which currently fall outside the OSS).</p>
<p>France&#8217;s watchdog has certainly demonstrated a willingness to move fast and enforce the rules against tech giants like Google and Amazon when unencumbered by the OSS &#8212; recently issuing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">fines over cookie consent issues in excess of $160M</a>, for example. It also hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">Google with a GDPR fine of $57M in 2019</a> before the tech giant moved the jurisdiction of regional users to Ireland.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s no reason why the CNIL won&#8217;t show similar alacrity in its probe of Clubhouse. (Although in its press note today it does write that European DPAs are &#8220;communicating with each other on this matter, in order to exchange information and ensure consistent application of the GDPR&#8221;.)</p>
<p>Privacy concerns that have been attached to Clubhouse include that it uploads users&#8217; phone book contacts &#8212; using the harvested phone numbers to build a usage graph so it can display how many &#8216;friends&#8217; a non-user has on the service at the point when the user is being asked to select which of their contacts to invite to the service.</p>
<p>The petition to CNIL also claims Clubhouse&#8217;s &#8220;secret database&#8221; of users&#8217; contacts may be sold to third parties.</p>
<p>&#8220;For years, lawmakers have not dared to attack Facebook for sucking up our data. Our democracies are paying a heavy price today,&#8221; the authors of the petition also write. &#8220;Clubhouse hopes we haven&#8217;t learned anything from Facebook&#8217;s methods and that its questionable practices will go unnoticed. But the German privacy agency has already accused the company of violating EU law. Now we need regulators in other countries to follow suit and put pressure on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="">If thousands of you ask the CNIL to enforce the law, we can put an end to this blatant violation of our private lives. It is also an opportunity to send a strong message to the tech giants: </span>our data is ours and no one else&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.notion.so/Privacy-Policy-cd4b415950204a46819478b31f6ce14f">privacy policy, Clubhouse</a>&#8216;s owner writes that the &#8220;Company does not sell your Personal Data&#8221; &#8212; but does list a wide ranging number of reasons why it may &#8220;share&#8221; user data with third parties, including for &#8220;advertising and marketing services&#8221;, among many other listed reasons.</p>
<p>Clubhouse has been contacted for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.copy.ai/">Copy.ai</a>, a startup building AI-powered copywriting tools for business customers, announced a $2.9 million round this morning. The investment was led by Craft Ventures. Other investors took part in the deal, including smaller checks from <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/17/atelier-ventures-wants-to-bring-more-influencers-and-creators-into-venture-capital/">Li Jin&#8217;s newly-formed Atelier Ventures</a>, and Sequoia.</p>
<p>The startup is notable for a few reasons. First for its model of building in public. I initially heard of the company through its <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulYacoubian/status/1366460168637190145">monthly updates</a> that it posts on Twitter. Thanks to that, I can tell you that Copy.ai generated monthly recurring revenue (MRR) of $53,600. That figure, up 46% from January, works out to annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $643,200.</p>
<p>Copy.ai also shares usage numbers, and, humorously, the number of Twitter followers that its founder <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulYacoubian">Paul Yacoubian</a> picked up in the last month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is also worth watching because it is part of a growing cohort of companies building atop GPT-3, what its progenitor the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">OpenAI project describes</a> as an &#8220;autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters.&#8221; More generally, it&#8217;s a piece of AI that can generate words.</p>
<p>Some investors are rather bullish on startups using the technology. Recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/4-ways-startups-will-drive-gpt-3-adoption-in-2021/">on TechCrunch</a>, for example, Madrona&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-mcilwain-692522/">Matt McIlwain</a> wrote that &#8220;the introduction of GPT-3 in 2020 was a tipping point for artificial intelligence&#8221; that will lead to &#8220;the launch of a thousand new startups and applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far that&#8217;s holding up. Not only has Copy.ai managed to find early in-market traction, TechCrunch has covered a number of other startups busy leveraging GPT-3, including <a href="https://www.othersideai.com/">OthersideAi</a> which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/othersideai-raises-2-6m-to-let-gpt-3-write-your-emails-for-you/">raised $2.6 million back in November of 2020</a>, and an &#8220;AI Dungeon-maker&#8221; called <a href="https://latitude.io/">Latitude</a> that also employs GPT-3 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/latitude-seed-funding/">raised $3.3 million this February</a>.</p>
<p>But enough about its cohort. Let&#8217;s get into how Copy.ai got built.</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Before founding Copy.ai, Yacoubian was an investor and, it seems, a tinkerer. He played with GPT-3 predecessor GPT-2 when it came out, telling TechCrunch in an interview that he discovered that the tool generated lots of &#8220;nonsense,&#8221; with the occasional &#8220;flash of brilliance.&#8221; GPT-3 proved even better in his view, providing something akin to a &#8220;50x&#8221; improvement on the generation that came before it.</p>
<p>Leaning on Twitter as a distribution method &#8212; Copy.ai uses Twitter as distribution channel, hence its reporting on social media metrics &#8212; Yacoubian and his co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/chris__lu?lang=en">Chris Lu</a> launched a few different draft-projects using GPT-3. Simplify.so did text condensing, a slackbot was built but never made it to the outside world, and taglines.ai was put together to help companies come up with slogans.</p>
<p>That last one found early traction, generating around 700 sign-ups in two days. That was enough of a user base, the co-founders decided, to begin monetizing their tool. Then they decided that the initial could be extended to other writing use cases, helping people with myriad distinct writing projects. Copy.ai was formed out of that concept.</p>
<p>The product can now generate text for blogs and products and headlines and the like, based on user-provided word inputs.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s odd and nearly antithetical to your humble servant as a writer is that Copy.ai doesn&#8217;t want to save you word count, per se. Instead, it generates a number of possible text results that the customer then chooses from. Recall the flashes of brilliance that Yacoubian said GPT-2 could generate? GPT-3 is even better, giving users of Copy.ai even better possible text formulations for their needs. And then the human-in-the-loop plays the editor role, choosing which they want the most and, I presume, tweaking from there.</p>
<p>When it was released back in October of 2020, Copy.ai snagged 2,000 sign-ups in its first two days. Then investors started reaching out.</p>
<p>Quitting their day jobs, Copy.ai became a full-time affair. The unorthodox startup also put together an unorthodox round, raising from what Yacoubian described as &#8220;as many people as [they] could.&#8221; That wound up being 80 people, give or take.</p>
<p>The round was raised as a capped SAFE, the Y Combinator-favored investing instrument that allows startups to accrete capital from external sources without a formal pricing; instead, SAFEs are often &#8220;capped&#8221; at a maximum valuation. Copy.ai raised its cap as its fundraising process trundled along.</p>
<p>David Sacks, founder of Craft Ventures, told TechCrunch that he thinks that &#8220;natural language generation powered by AI is going to change the way that marketing teams write copy,&#8221; adding that amongst startups it is &#8220;rare to see such strong bottom-up adoption in so short a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am honestly a bit excited to see what Copy.ai can do, not because I will use its product &#8212; it&#8217;s notÂ <em>precisely</em> in my wheelhouse &#8212; but because I am rather excited about GPT-3 as a technology. And the startup is an in-market experiment regarding AI and writing. Two things I care quite a lot about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Victories notwithstanding, the 2020 election blew up many of the assumptions Democrats have long held about the American electorate.In Florida, Arizona and elsewhere, Latino voters broke for Trump in unexpected numbers, upending conventional wisdom that the growing Spanish-speaking population will reliably vote the same way â and vote blue. Polling again failed to capture contours of races around the country, proving that pollsters&#8217; inability to predict Trump&#8217;s 2016 win wasn&#8217;t a fluke. And with all eyes on Texas, Georgia flipped blue for the first time in two decades.</p>
<p>Tatenda Musapatike, a former political ad specialist at Facebook who left the company in 2019 to lead civic engagement campaigns, believes that the relative tabula rasa in American politics right now is an opportunity to double down on expanding the electorate.</p>
<p>This month, Musapatike is leaving her role directing campaigns at the <a href="https://www.axios.com/democrats-digital-campaign-donald-trump-acronym-45c6165d-0dcc-45b6-a9de-8651d50a888a.html">Democratic nonprofit Acronym</a> to launch the Voter Formation Project, a 501(c)3 laser-focused on reaching Black and brown first-time voters using every trick in the digital toolbox.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One answer to Trump&#8217;s surprise win in 2016, Acronym emerged as a nonprofit strategy group aiming to lay a Democratic digital groundwork that could match or surpass Republican digital campaigns.</p>
<p>The group stumbled in 2020 when an untested and probably ill-advised vote tabulation app <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/5/21123009/acronym-tara-mcgowan-shadow-app-iowa-caucus-results">delayed results in the Iowa caucuses</a>, creating chaos and casting doubt on the Democratic party&#8217;s technical prowess. The app was created by Shadow, a tech company<a href="https://twitter.com/anotheracronym/status/1085934845942026241?lang=en"> Acronym acquired the year prior</a> but then scrambled to distance itself from.</p>
<p>But Acronym had a lot of irons in the fire. One of those was a 2019 voter drive called the <a href="https://www.anotheracronym.org/peoples-power-grab/">&#8220;People&#8217;s Power Grab&#8221;</a> led by Musapatike that mobilized unregistered voters of color in eight states including <a href="https://www.peoplespowergrab.org/about">Arizona, Florida and Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>With the Voter Formation Project, Musapatike can both extend and hone the same work. And with Georgia as a proof-of-concept and major legislative voting rights reform on the table, the political stakes of that mission are clearer than ever.</p>
<p>Musapatike is well-positioned for the task at hand. Prior to her work on voter outreach at Acronym, she spent three and a half years at Facebook working with progressive super PACs and nonprofits on their digital ad campaigns. (Mired in myriad political controversies following the 2016 U.S. election, including accusations that the company gave the Trump campaign special treatment, Facebook <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-scale-back-embeds-political-campaigns-n911701">dissolved those teams</a>.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126266" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126266" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2126266 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oter-formation-project-tatenda.jpg?w=680" alt="Tatenda Musapatike" width="680" height="603" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oter-formation-project-tatenda.jpg 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oter-formation-project-tatenda.jpg?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oter-formation-project-tatenda.jpg?resize=300,266 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oter-formation-project-tatenda.jpg?resize=680,603 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oter-formation-project-tatenda.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126266" class="wp-caption-text">Tatenda Musapatike of the Voter Formation Project</p></div></p>
<p>Musapatike told TechCrunch that the Voter Formation Project will fill an existing gap for digital-only voter outreach in at least a few ways. For one, it will be the first digital-only operation helmed by a Black woman in the space. Its mission is also uniquely targeted and the organization will be looking to raise at least $4 million this year to make it happen.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited about the sea change that we&#8217;re seeing in terms of valuing the work, and trusting Black women to do the work,&#8221; Musapatike said.</span></p>
<p>Practically, the Voter Formation Project will look like a lot of digital advertising. Musapatike believes that by embracing the chaos of so many upended assumptions, she can reach more first time voters from communities of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oftentimes, I think a lot of groups that do digital work predominantly focus on either young people or individual communities of color,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re really focused on the digital piece, and then targeting people of color to figure out what works for our different communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it won&#8217;t all be ads. Musapatike expects digital advertising to be half of the fledgling group&#8217;s budget in its first year, but also emphasizes the need for digital training and education for other voter outreach programs, particularly smaller ones at the state level and other organizations with more traditional in-person operations that lack the resources for deep digital expertise.</p>
<p>The final piece is advertising tech that the organization developed to guide new voters through getting registered and creating a plan to vote, keeping track of them along the way so they can be re-targeted if they don&#8217;t complete the process.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Vote.org founder launches VoteAmerica, a nonprofit using tech tools to help Americans vote by mail&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/voteamerica-launch-debra-cleaver-vote-org/embed/#?secret=X747Wl7oY1" data-secret="X747Wl7oY1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Around the time she was leaving Facebook, Musapatike started thinking about how ad operations targeting first-time voters were stuck repeating the same patterns.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw the same type of assumptions about what moved people, what inspired people, what got people to register being repeated,&#8221; Musapatike said. &#8220;I rarely had the opportunity to see really different and experimental thought coming to campaigns. And I wanted to be able to run the campaigns that I dreamed about in my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>One example is the belief that ads seeking to register new voters should look kind of dry and official, like they might have come from the government itself.</p>
<p>Her teams ran tests of &#8220;official-looking&#8221; ads against what she calls &#8220;culturally relevant&#8221; ads that looked like organic content anyone might run into on social media, with a careful eye to be sure the people featured in the more modern ads looked and spoke like the communities being targeted. They found that the official-looking ads indeed resonated more with older voters, but younger people of color were much more likely to register to vote when targeted with the culturally relevant ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so that said to us we need to do a lot more digging into what works for who, and not necessarily say that same tactic works for everyone, because we just don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true or not,&#8221; Musapatike said.</p>
<p>Democrats could wait patiently for for shifting demographics to move the country left â or they could get experimental in order to tap into a powerful well of potential votes sitting out in the open. Pockets of unregistered voters are particularly concentrated in the South, and the Voter Formation Project names Texas and Virginia as two states of particular interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are places where we have failed in elections that are occurring either at the municipal or the state level,&#8221; Musapatike said, pointing out that while the South appears to skew heavily conservative, it&#8217;s also the region most afflicted by efforts to disenfranchise voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;For that we are running programs in states where there are disproportionately fewer people of color voting compared to their older, whiter counterparts,&#8221; Musapatike said. &#8220;Because once those people have access to voting, it could change the outcomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if she has any qualms about pumping advertising dollars into a social media platforms that are known to amplify voter suppression efforts and other strains of political misinformation, Musapatike was crystal clear. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t believe in bringing a knife to a gunfight,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In the 2020 presidential race, Democrats prevailed by around 12,000 votes in Georgia. For state and local elections, even small bumps in the voting population can have a huge impact. To that end, from day one, the Voter Formation Project is setting out with a measurable goal: to register and mobilize half a million voters before the 2022 midterm elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;When there are a significant amount of people who don&#8217;t have access to the ballot box, [elections] are no longer a fair contest of ideas,&#8221; Musapatike said. &#8220;It becomes a game of suppression, which is not what the United States is about.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is the default Q&amp;A site for programmers (though the overall <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> network goes well beyond helping you answer your basic PHP questions). But over the course of the last year and a half, with its new CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar coming on board, the company has also kickstarted its SaaS business with a new focus on its StackOverflow for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams">Teams product</a>. Teams offers businesses something akin to a private Stack Overflow for managing and sharing knowledge across a company. Until now, Teams was only available through a paid subscription (or a time-gated trial), but starting today, Stack Overflow will move to a freemium model with a perpetually free plan.</p>
<p>As Chandrasekar told me ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, Stack Overflow&#8217;s $85 million Series E funding round this summer was all about Teams and accelerating its SaaS growth. &#8220;We wanted to double down on Teams,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that is very much &#8212; as we transform into a product-led SaaS company from our foundation of the community and the public platform &#8212; that&#8217;s a huge, huge focus.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126076" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126076" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2126076" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png" alt="" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126076" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stack Overflow</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like so many products in this space, Stack Overflow for Teams experienced rapid growth in 2020. Its annual recurring revenue grew 72% last year, the company tells me, and it added over 1,500 Teams customers, including 70 that opted for its high-end Enterprise tier. Teams customers now include the likes of Box, Microsoft, Bloomberg, Instacart and Zapier.</p>
<p>The new freemium offering will be limited to 50 seats, but for the most part, it&#8217;s quite a fully-featured solution, with support for all of the core Teams features. It also includes support for the service&#8217;s ChatOps integrations with Slack and Microsoft Teams (side note: maybe there are too many products with the name &#8216;Teams&#8217; right now?). The free service does not include support for single sign-on solutions, though. You&#8217;ll need the basic paid plan for that. And while the enterprise tier is SOC II certified and runs on single-tenant instances, that&#8217;s not the case for the free, basic and business tiers.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Unqork, we use <span class="il">Stack</span> <span class="il">Overflow</span> for <span class="il">Teams</span> and its Slack integration to empower our creators to learn from each other in a productive way and to support our clients building solutions on top of our platform,&#8221; said Olga Gomonova, head of enablement at Unqork. &#8220;Since implementing <span class="il">Stack</span> <span class="il">Overflow</span> for <span class="il">Teams</span> for internal and external use cases, we&#8217;ve been able to reduce the time to respond to client and internal questions from 60 to 30 minutes, and have been able to onboard new hires faster as our company grows.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126077" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126077" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2126077" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png" alt="" width="1024" height="722" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png 2540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png?resize=768,542 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png?resize=680,480 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png?resize=1536,1084 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png?resize=2048,1445 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stack-overflow-for-teams-question.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stack Overflow</p></div></p>
<p>Some of the missing features, however, are access to Stack Overflow for Teams&#8217; <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams/features/articles">Articles</a> format for longer-form content and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/06/introducing-collections-on-stack-overflow-for-teams/">Collections</a>, a feature that allows users to group together sets of similar questions that can be used for an onboarding workflow or in place of a traditional FAQ document, for example. Stack Overflow CPO Teresa Dietrich tells me that the company has seen over 50% adoption of Articles since its launch inÂ  <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/08/10/stack-overflow-for-teams-articles-content-collaboration-knowledge/">August 2020</a>. The company also recently introduced a private feedback option for Teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that, unlike on the public Q&amp;A sites, people weren&#8217;t comfortable giving downvotes to content on the Teams product until we introduced private feedback,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So now they give feedback to the content writer in a private way that says it&#8217;s incomplete, it&#8217;s out of date, or it&#8217;s wrong. And then they can put text around that feedback and only the owner of that content sees it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The freemium offering has been in the works for a while. As Chandrasekar and Dietrich both noted, the company removed the credit card requirement to get started with the 30-day Teams trial that had been in place before. &#8220;We realized through that experience, that it was actually not enough time to allow companies to create a community internally and that&#8217;s basically what we&#8217;re trying to do,&#8221; Chandrasekar said. &#8220;So that was a huge learning for us to say it didn&#8217;t make a lot of sense for us to keep a free trial that was timeboxed. And that really expanded to just make it free for life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dietrich added that before launching this free offering, the company also wanted to make sure that it had optimized its onboarding flow for these free users as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Policybazaar has raised $75 million as the Indian online insurance platform looks to expand its presence in UAE and Middle East.</p>
<p>Sarbvir Singh, chief executive of PolicyBazaar, told TechCrunch that the startup had raised $75 million, but didnât elaborate. Falcon Edge Capital led the new tranche of investment in the Indian startup, which has raised about $630 million to date, according to research firm Tracxn.</p>
<p>The 12-year-old startup, which counts SoftBank Groupâs Vision Fund and Tiger Global among its investors, is among <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/paytm-vijay-shekhar-sharma-to-acquire-raheja-qbe-for-76m/">a handful of startups that is attempting to upend Indiaâs insurance market</a>, which is largely commanded by state and bank-backed insurers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Policybazaar serves as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/indias-policybazaar-raises-200m-led-by-softbanks-vision-fund/">an aggregator that allows users to compare and buy policies</a> &#8212; across categories including life, health, travel, auto, and property &#8212; from dozens of insurers on its website without having to go through conventional agents.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126229" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126229" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2126229 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126229" class="wp-caption-text">A screengrab of Policybazaar website</p></div></p>
<p>In India only a fraction of the nationâs 1.3 billion people currently have access to insurance and some analysts say that digital firms could prove crucial in bringing these services to the masses. According to rating agency ICRA, insurance products had reached less than 3% of the population as of 2017.</p>
<p>An average Indian makes about $2,100 in a year, according to World Bank. ICRA estimated that of those Indians who had purchased an insurance product, they were spending less than $50 on it in 2017.</p>
<p>In a recent report, analysts at Bernstein estimated that Policybazaar commands 90% of share in the online insurance distribution market. The platform also sells loans, credit cards, and mutual funds. The startup says it sells over a million policies a month.</p>
<p>&#8220;India has an under-penetrated insurance market. Within the under-penetrated landscape, digital distribution through web-aggregators like Policybazaar forms &lt;1% of the industry. This offers a large headroom for growth,&#8221; Bernstein analystsÂ wrote to clients.</p>
<p>The startup, which is working on an initial public offering <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/policybazaar-com-ipo-in-12-15-months-parent-firm-gets-capital-boost-from-bay-capital/articleshow/81314872.cms">slated for next year</a>, said it will use the fresh investment to expand its presence across the UAE and Middle East regions.</p>
<p>âPolicyBazaar has shown stellar innovation, execution, and relentlessness in establishing itself as the market leader in online insurance aggregation in India. We believe the playbook it has established over the last 10 years in being the most efficient sales channel for insurance manufacturers, can act as a catalyst to gain market leadership in the GCC,â said Navroz Udwadia, co-founder of Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the first time, Pinduoduo has surpassed Alibaba in annual active users, marking the Chinese e-commerce upstart&#8217;s meteoric rise over the course of five years.</p>
<p>The milestone also indicates Pinduoduo has overcome the early stereotype that it was an app for users in China&#8217;s less developed, low-tier cities. Pinduoduo made its name by removing intermediary distributors and selling cheap fruits and daily items, but it has gradually diversified its offerings to be all-encompassing, like heavily discounted iPhones.</p>
<p>The company went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/pinduoduo-is-raising-over-1-billion/">public on NASDAQ</a> in 2018 and counts Tencent as a major shareholder and partner. It recorded 788 million annual active users in 2020, according to its Q4 earnings report that just came out. Alibaba lagged slightly behind at <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210202.pdf">779 million</a> active users through the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of monthly active users, though, Alibaba enjoyed a great lead at 902 million in December. Pinduoduo&#8217;s MAU of the month was 720 million.</p>
<p>Both companies still have room to grow as China had 989 million internet users as of 2020, according to a <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/pdf/web/viewer.html?file=http://www.cac.gov.cn/rootimages/uploadimg/1613923424818332/1613923424818332.pdf?filepath=ZBWvETi1XzcBKtOIkqelkJJ4Vn5uw9ZthCXJtWLSr0nQACMKH6Ejiw/UpdBYAwmsV5if6BYGd60xaZUMhKPZmjEjTcORl73kmCTdYOvdSjs=&amp;fText=%E7%AC%AC47%E6%AC%A1%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%E7%8A%B6%E5%86%B5%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A-0203%EF%BC%88%E6%89%93%E5%8D%B0%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90%EF%BC%89">report</a> from the country&#8217;s top cyberspace authority.</p>
<p>Alibaba, founded 21 years ago, was ahead of Pinduoduo in revenue by a wide margin, partly because of a larger transaction volume and a thriving cloud computing business. Alibaba ended the December quarter with 221 billion yuan or $33.88 billion in revenue, compared to Pinduoduo&#8217;s 26.55 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Farm produce remains at the core of Pinduoduo, which was founded by ex-Googler Colin Huang. Huang today stepped down as chairman of the company and will devote his time to research in the food and life sciences, which Pinduoduo believes could drive future growth of its &#8220;agriculture platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinduoduo doesn&#8217;t just want to bring produce from farmers to urban consumers. In recent years, it has also thrown itself into agri-tech by piloting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/">AI-powered farms</a> and training farmers to be savvy online vendors. These strategies are in line with Beijing&#8217;s push to boost China&#8217;s rural economy, which affects the lives of hundreds of millions.</p>

<p>The e-commerce upstart has a big goal: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/pinduoduo-145-billion-farm-produce-2025/">selling $145 billion</a> worth of agricultural products annually by 2025. It seems to be on track. The firm&#8217;s gross merchant volume, an e-commerce metric for transactions, from agricultural products doubled to more than 270 billion yuan or $41.5 billion in 2020. Its marketplace boasted 12 million farmers selling directly to consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinduoduo started with agricultural products,&#8221; says Chen Lei, current chairman and CEO at Pinduoduo, in a statement. &#8220;[W]e hope that Pinduoduo can one day become the largest grocer in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>While selling grocery isn&#8217;t as lucrative as, say, electronics, it could be an effective way for user acquisition as the cost of trying out fruits sold on Pinduoduo is relatively low.</p>
<p>As the firm pursues its agricultural dream, it has yet to turn profitable. Pinduoduo&#8217;s net loss shrank to 1.38 billion yuan or $210.9 million in the quarter, compared with 1.75 billion yuan in the same quarter of 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in December, <a href="http://www.swellenergy.com">Swell Energy</a> said it would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/residential-renewable-energy-developer-swell-is-raising-450-million-for-distributed-power-projects-in-three-states/">raising $450 million to support the development of distributed power projects in three states</a>. Now, with the announcement of a deal between the venture-backed startup and New York City&#8217;s utility, ConEd, industry watchers can get a glimpse of what those projects may look like.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company has a new residential solar plus energy storage program for homeowners in Queens that&#8217;s going to be rolled out in partnership with ConEd.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a project that will create solar-powered home batteries for eligible ConEd customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New York is actually targeting the rollout of 3 gigawatts of installed energy storage capacity by 2030 with a goal of moving the entire state&#8217;s electricity grid to zero emissions by 2040.</p>
<p>With the ConEd project, the city is hoping to create backup power for customers in Queens that they can tap independently of the energy grid&#8217;s own resources, which should free up power for customers that don&#8217;t have the energy storage tech.</p>
<div>Homeowners that participate in the project may qualify for incentives that lower the cost of the systems, <a href="http://www.swellenergy.com/Queens">which are initially being offered</a> to residents ofÂ Forest Park, Glendale, Hunters Point, Long Island City, Maspeth, Middle Village, Ridgewood, Sunnyside, and parts of adjacent neighborhoods in Queens.</div>
<div></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Residential renewable energy developer Swell is raising $450 million for distributed power projects in three states&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/residential-renewable-energy-developer-swell-is-raising-450-million-for-distributed-power-projects-in-three-states/embed/#?secret=FX2wVuDNcT" data-secret="FX2wVuDNcT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The New York virtual power plant differs from other initiatives from Swell in that it provides available capacity to specific distribution circuits on the grid to reduce customer demand on circuits during network overload periods, according to a Swell spokesperson.</p>
<p>With the virtual power plant, ConEd won&#8217;t need to build out new transmission and distribution infrastructure, but can still ensure network reliability. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s called a &#8220;non-wires solution&#8221; to the demand problem, Swell&#8217;s spokesperson said.</p>
<p>By contrast, the company&#8217;s Hawaii projects provide system-level capacity and frequency regulation and the California program with Southern California Edison, provide demand-response capacity for baseload energy management and overall load growth in the area where they&#8217;re operating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unagi, the startup behind the portable, design-centric electric scooters, is launching its subscription service to six more U.S. cities in an expansion fueled by $10.5 million in funding.</p>
<p>The startup, launched in late 2018 by former Beats Music CEO <span style="font-weight: 400;">David Hyman and Mog co-founder, said Wednesday it is bringing its subscription service to Austin, Miami, Nashville, Phoenix, San Francisco and Seattle. Unagi will also be expanding its service in New York and L.A. metropolitan regions, including all five NYC boroughs, Long Island, Westchester and Northern New Jersey, as well as the Westside, Southeast L.A., the San Fernando Valley and Orange County.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All together, these areas represent a market of about 30 million potential consumers. The Series A funding round is led by the Ecosystem Integrity Fund with participation from Menlo Ventures, Broadway Angels and Gaingels, among others.Â </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion comes just six months after theÂ <span style="font-weight: 400;">commercial scooter company and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/unagi-the-iphone-of-scooters-now-has-a-subscription-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">piloted its âAll-Accessâ subscription service in New York City and Los Angeles</span></a>.</p>
<p>Unagi might not be the only scooter company to ever offer a subscription service. It is quickly becoming the best known and the one with the biggest reach in the United States. <a href="https://rent.bird.co/">Bird</a> launched a similar offering in 2019, but has gone quiet about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/unagi-scooter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed by TechCrunch as the âiPhone of scootersâ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a couple of years ago, Unagi is offering its Model One electric scooter with a dual motor for $49 per month. The aim is to make the scooters accessible to a wider populace that might not want to shell out the $990 to own one outright. Sales of the sleek, sturdy and incredibly lightweight scooters have skewed heavily towards men over 35 years of age, according to Hyman. Unagiâs subscription service, on the other hand, caters more towards the Millennial yuppie who likes nice things but doesnât like commitment.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOur market is purely urban, and our internal corporate mantra is: If you canât carry our scooter up a three-story walk up, then itâs not something we want to do,â Hyman told TechCrunch. âI think thereâs a generation of consumers that prefer access over ownership and donât want the responsibility and the maintenance concerns.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the same generation that grew up on kick scooters and thus intuitively know how to ride the scooters theyâre seeing on the street, which partially explains some of the mighty success e-scooters have seen in recent years, said Hyman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global electric scooter market is expected to grow around 8% per year over the next decade, </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/electric-scooters-market#:~:text=b.-,The%20global%20electric%20scooters%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD,USD%2020.0%20billion%20in%202020.&amp;text=The%20global%20electric%20scooters%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20grow%20at,USD%2042.0%20billion%20by%202030."><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching $42 billion by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Based on </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-electric-scooter-ownership-unagi-manifesto-david-hyman/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research conducted by Unagi and Berkeley Haas School of Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hyman predicts sharing will account for a third of the total e-scooter market, with ownership and subscription taking up the remainder. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said the subscription model is more attractive than the shared model because it doesnât entail hunting for an available scooter, or wondering if the last rider coughed Rona germs all over it once you do find it.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unagi&#8217;s pitch is to create a hassle-free experience with upfront pricing and the ability to cancel a subscription anytime. The monthly fee covers the cost of maintenance and insurance for lost, stolen or damaged scooters. There are some stipulations though. Customers are locked into a three-month minimum and have to pay a $50 set up fee.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyman said he thinks itâll take some time for the subscription model to ramp up, but once it does, it will be Unagiâs primary revenue driver. From 2019 to 2020, Unagi grew 450% with demand for subscription scooters in the pilot cities going âoff the charts,â according to Hyman, but he declined to provide numbers for scaling those charts.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âI actually think the pandemic only hurt us because one of the primary use cases for our product is commuting,â said Hyman in response to a query about an eventual plateau of e-scooter craze if a vaccinated populace gets back to its regular commuting styles.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âIn a city, the vast majority of peopleâs rides are under three miles, and having a portable electric scooter just kills everything,â he said. âItâs so much easier to carry around and you donât have to worry about locking it up outside, donât have to worry about theft or carrying it up to your apartment or on the subways.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scooters weigh about 26 pounds and can balance on either wheel when folded. On a single charge, they can take you eight to 15 miles, depending on your weight and whether youâre cruising on one motor or blasting past the clunky ride-share scooters with both motors.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subscription model here works well alongside e-scooter sales because it allows for scooters to be repurposed. Subscribers arenât guaranteed new scooters. Theyâre more likely to get one thatâs certified pre-owned. And because Unagi is committed to building with high-end materials, the company says regular maintenance keeps scooters alive for an expected three to five years.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyman, who has a track record of creating subscription business models, like the MOG music subscription that eventually turned into Apple Music, has personal reasons for offering Hardware as a Service in the form of electric scooters. He lived in Amsterdam for three years, where biking is far more commonplace than driving.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âConsidering how many commutes are under three miles, the fact that there are so many cars in cities is ridiculous,â said Hyman. âWe are hell-bent on getting cars out of cities.â</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://octoml.ai/">OctoML</a>, a Seattle-based startup that offers a machine learning acceleration platform build on top of the open-source <a href="https://tvm.apache.org/">Apache TVM compiler framework project</a>, today announced that it has raised a $28 million Series B funding round led by Addition. Previous investors <span style="font-weight: 400;">Madrona Venture Group and Amplify Partners also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $47 million. The company last raised in April 2020, when it announced its $15 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/octoml-raises-15m-to-make-optimizing-ml-models-easier/">Series A round led by Amplify</a>.Â </span></p>
<p>The promise of OctoML, which was founded by the team that also created TVM, is that developers can bring their models to its platform and the service will automatically optimize that model&#8217;s performance for any given cloud or edge device.</p>
<p>As Brazil-born OctoML co-founder and CEO Luis Ceze told me, since raising its Series A round, the company started onboarding some early adopters to its &#8216;Octomizer&#8217; SaaS platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2126083" style="width: 373px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126083" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2126083" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?w=680" alt="" width="363" height="363" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png 738w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126083" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OctoML</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still in early access, but we are we have close to 1,000 early access sign-ups on the waitlist,&#8221; Ceze said. &#8220;That was a pretty strong signal for us to end up taking this [funding]. The Series B was pre-emptive. We were planning on starting to raise money right about now. We had barely started spending our Series A money &#8212; we still had a lot of that left. But since we saw this growth and we had more paying customers than we anticipated, there were a lot of signals like, &#8216;hey, now we can accelerate the go-to-market machinery, build a customer success team and continue expanding the engineering team to build new features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ceze tells me that the team also saw strong growth signals in the overall community around the TVM project (with about 1,000 people attending its virtual conference <a href="https://tvmconf.org/">last year</a>). As for its customer base (and companies on its waitlist), Ceze says it represents a wide range of verticals that range from defense contractors to financial services and life science companies, automotive firms and startups in a variety of fields.</p>
<p>Recently, OctoML also launched support for the Apple M1 chip &#8212; and saw <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146436/0/en/OctoML-Announces-Faster-Machine-Learning-Model-Inferencing-on-Apple-s-New-M1-Than-Apple-s-Core-ML-4-Provides.html">very good performance from that</a>.</p>
<p>The company has also formed partnerships with industry heavyweights like Microsoft (which is also a customer), Qualcomm and AMD to build out the open-source components and optimize its service for an even wider range of models (and larger ones, too).</p>
<p>On the engineering side, Ceze tells me that the team is looking at not just optimizing and tuning models but also the training process. Training ML models can quickly become costly and any service that can speed up that process leads to direct savings for its users &#8212; which in turn makes OctoML an easier sell. The plan here, Ceze tells me, is to offer an end-to-end solution where people can optimize their ML training and the resulting models and then push their models out to their preferred platform. Right now, its users still have to take the artifact that the Octomizer creates and deploy that themselves, but deployment support is on OctoML&#8217;s roadmap.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we first met Luis and the OctoML team, we knew they were poised to transform the way ML teams deploy their machine learning models,&#8221; said Lee Fixel, founder of Addition. &#8220;They have the vision, the talent and the technology to drive ML transformation across every major enterprise. They launched Octomizer six months ago and itâs already becoming the go-to solution developers and data scientists use to maximize ML model performance. We look forward to supporting the companyâs continued growth.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In recent years, the publicly traded observability service New Relic started adding more machine learning-based tools to its platform for AI-assisted incident response when things don&#8217;t quite go as planned. Today, it is expanding this feature set with the launch of a number of new capabilities for what it calls its &#8220;New Relic Applied Intelligence Service.&#8221;</p>
<p>This expansion includes an anomaly detection service that is even available for free users, the ability to group alerts from multiple tools when the models think it&#8217;s a single issue that is triggering all of these alerts and new ML-based root cause analysis to help eliminate some of the guesswork when problems occur. Also new (and in public beta) is New Relic&#8217;s ability to detect patterns and outliers in log data that is stored in the company&#8217;s data platform.</p>
<p>The main idea here, New Relic&#8217;s director of product marketing Michael Olson told me, is to make it easier for companies of all sizes to reap the benefits of AI-enhanced ops.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2125954" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125954" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125954" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png" alt="" width="1024" height="503" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png 3360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=768,378 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=1536,755 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=2048,1007 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125954" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> New Relic</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been about a year since we introduced our first set of AIops capabilities with New Relic Applied Intelligence to the market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;During that time, we&#8217;ve seen significant growth in adoption of AIops capabilities through New Relic. But one of the things that we&#8217;ve heard from organizations that have yet to foray into adopting AIops capabilities as part of their incident response practice is that they often find that things like steep learning curves and long implementation and training times &#8212; and sometimes lack of confidence, or knowledge of AI and machine learning &#8212; often stand in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new platform should be able to detect emerging problems in real time &#8212; without the team having to pre-configure alerts. And when it does so, it&#8217;ll smartly group all of the alerts from New Relic and other tools together to cut down on the alert noise and let engineers focus on the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of an alert storm when a problem occurs across multiple tools, engineers get one actionable issue with alerts automatically grouped based on things like time and frequency, based on the context that they can read in the alert messages. And then now with this launch, we&#8217;re also able to look at relationship data across your systems to intelligently group and correlate alerts,&#8221; Olson explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125955" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125955" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125955" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png" alt="" width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png 3486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=1536,1073 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=2048,1431 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125955" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> New Relic</p></div></p>
<p>Maybe the highlight for the ops teams that will use these new features, though, is New Relic&#8217;s ability to pinpoint the probable root cause of a problem. As Guy Fighel, the general manager of applied intelligence and vice president of product engineering at New Relic, told me, the idea here is not to replace humans but to augment teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide a non-black-box experience for teams to craft the decisions and correlation and logic based on their own knowledge and infuse the system with their own knowledge,&#8221; Fighel noted. &#8220;So you can get very specific based on your environment and needs. And so because of that and because we see a lot of data coming from different tools &#8212; all going into New Relic One as the data platform &#8212; our probable root cause is very accurate. Having said that, it is still a <em>probable</em> root cause. So although we are opinionated about it, we will never tell you, &#8216;hey, go fix that, because we&#8217;re 100% sure that&#8217;s the case.&#8217; You&#8217;re the human, you&#8217;re in control.&#8221;</p>

<p>The AI system also asks users for feedback, so that the model gets refined with every new incident, too.</p>
<p>Fighel tells me that New Relic&#8217;s tools rely on a variety of statistical analysis methods and machine learning models. Some of those are unique to individual users while others are used across the company&#8217;s user base.Â He also stressed that all of the engineers who worked on this project have a background in site reliability engineering &#8212; so they are intimately familiar with the problems in this space.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s launch, New Relic is also adding a new integration with PagerDuty and other incident management tools so that the state of a given issue can be synchronized bi-directionally between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to meet our customers where they are and really be data source agnostic and enable customers to pull in data from any source, where we can then enrich that data, reduce noise and ultimately help our customers solve problems faster,&#8221; said Olson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.digitail.io">Digitail</a>, a cloud service for veterinary surgeries and customers, has raised $2.5M in a Seed round led by <a href="https://byfounders.vc/">byFounders</a> and Gradient Ventures (Googleâs AI fund), joined by Partech and a series of angels including as Dr. Ivan Zakharenkov (Smartflow). The startup was already backed (pre-seed round in 2019) by Fast Track Malmo. Digitail is currently used by 2,000 veterinarians in 16 countries.</p>
<p>Digitail  says its âall-in-oneâ practice management system for animal hospitals and veterinary practices âhelps vets simplify their workflow, drive automation, and engage with pet parents, even when they are not at the practice.â</p>
<p>For pet owners Digital had a <a href="http://pet.digitail.io/">Health Card for pets</a>, a customer app that is directly connected to the PIMS and acts as a digital ID for the pets. This holds the pet&#8217;s medical history, and allows the owner to communicate with the vet through the in-app chat, book their next appointment, and store any other important information about their pet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founders are Sebastian Gabor (CEO and co-founder), Ruxandra Pui (CPO and co-founder). They are joined by Alexandru Gheorghita, DVM, in-house veterinarian specialist.</p>
<p>Gabor said in a statement: âPet care is still being run like in the 90s. Because of the lack of a holistic vision and approach, there is no data unification and no collaboration between the key players of the industry. As a result, vets still need to rely on outdated tools while collaboration and innovation is stopped.â</p>
<p>Competitors include <a href="http://Rhapsody.vet">Rhapsody.vet</a> which has raised an $8M Series A, <a href="http://ezyvet.com">Ezyvet</a>, and <a href="http://hippomanager.com">Hippo Manager</a>, among others. But Digitail says its all-in-one approach has an edge on the others.</p>
<p>According to some estimates, some 39% of pet owners in the United States are millennials. Digitail is thus finding business among veterinarians surfing a new generation of customers who expect to be able to make bookings and arrangements with their vet via an app. Just as with apps aimed at doctorâs surgeries, Digitailâs platform handles that incoming customer data and also allows the surgery to run. The pet care industry is predicted to reach a value of $200 billion by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tel Aviv-based <a href="https://vulcan.io/">Vulcan Cyber</a>, a cybersecurity startup that helps businesses prioritize and fix security vulnerabilities, today announced that it has raised a $21 million Series B funding round led by Dawn Capital. Wipro Ventures and existing investors YL Ventures and Ten Eleven Ventures also participated in this round. The company says it will use the new funding to roll out new remediation solutions and launch a free risk-based vulnerability management platform under the <a href="https://vulcan.io/lp/vulcan-free">Vulcan Free</a> monicker.</p>
<p>With this new round, Vulcan Cyber&#8217;s total funding to date is now $35 million. The company says it saw 500% growth in annual recurring revenue and new customer account metrics in 2020, with each user typically having between 10 and 100 users on the platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125900" style="width: 308px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125900" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2125900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png" alt="" width="298" height="97" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png 461w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png?resize=300,98 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125900" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vulcan Cyber</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s emphasis has always been on not just warning its customers about potential vulnerabilities but also helping them prioritize them based on the severity of the risk and the threat to a company&#8217;s business assets. Security teams, after all, are often overwhelmed by alerts and not every vulnerability a scanner represents is a high-priority risk for a business. The promise of Vulcan Cyber&#8217;s platform is that it helps these teams figure out where to best focus their resources.</p>
<p>While the funding is the headline news today, Vulcan&#8217;s new free offering is also worth a closer look.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Cyber</span>security pros have used open-source vulnerability scanners like Nessus for almost two decades. More recently, vulnerability management programs have used risk-based vulnerability management tools to prioritize scan results to determine specific risk to the business and focus the remediation effort. <u></u><u></u>The scan and prioritize functions are fundamental, necessary elements of any mature remediation program,&#8221; Yaniv Bar-Dayan,Â <span class="il">Vulcan</span>Â <span class="il">Cyber&#8217;s</span> CEO and co-founder said about the new free offering. &#8220;But now the industry has a free vulnerability prioritization engine to complement the scanners. This round of funding allows us to provide the <span class="il">Vulcan</span>Â Free service to theÂ <span class="il">cyber</span>security industry to help businesses achieveÂ <span class="il">cyber</span> hygiene. This move shifts the economics of our market and will push CISOs and CIOs to dedicate more budget and resources not just on simple scan and prioritize paper pushing, but on driving actual remediation outcomes. We hope this will help the industry get fix done more effectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this new free offering, Vulcan&#8217;s freemium portfolio now includes Vulcan Free, which provides some of the company&#8217;s core prioritization and vulnerability management features, and its existing free vulnerability intelligence database.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Existing remote desktop solutions like LogMeIn and TeamViewer can be complicated to set up and use, and can feel dated. A new startup called <a href="https://cohere.so/">Cohere</a>, now backed by $3.1 million in seed funding, aims to improve on the remote desktop and screen-sharing experience. With Cohere&#8217;s technology, businesses can help customers in seconds by taking instant control of their screen without any downloads or setup on the customer&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>That ease-of-use has already gained the startup over 50 paying customers for its product, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2020 winner Canix</a>, CopyAI, Ramp and others. It also signed its first enterprise client with Podium.</p>
<p>Cohere&#8217;s three co-founders, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunyu-lin/">Yunyu Lin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-hf-wang/">Jason Wang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-gs/">Rahul Sengottuvelu</a>, first met while attending Duke University. Lin later left to work for <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/a-new-corporate-card-ramp-secures-30m-for-money-saving-company-credit-programs/">corporate card startup Ramp,</a> but the others graduated during the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bXqrVwm1aw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/">And the winner of Startup Battlefield at Disrupt 2020 isâ¦ Canix</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;And the winner of Startup Battlefield at Disrupt 2020 isâ¦ Canix&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/embed/#?secret=bXqrVwm1aw" data-secret="bXqrVwm1aw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The idea for Cohere actually emerged during the pandemic, during a hackathon focused on remote work. The team won the event and decided to take their project to Y Combinator for further development.</p>
<p>Essentially, Cohere is designed to make it easier for teams, whether small founders or large enterprises, to help solve their customers&#8217; issues. Instead of requiring a software download or complicated install process, customers can just click a button on a website to allow remote control of their screen. This can save time, as the support person on the other end doesn&#8217;t have to ask a million questions about which screen the customer is on or what they see, or direct them where to click &#8212; they can just take over.</p>
<p>&#8220;It lets you see what people are seeing just like that, with no setup,&#8221; says Sengottuvelu. &#8220;You can just show them &#8212; just like you&#8217;re sitting next to them.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125882" style="width: 1802px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125882" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2125882 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png" alt="" width="1792" height="1003" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png 1792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125882" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cohere</p></div></p>
<p>But what makes Cohere different is it&#8217;s not a full remote desktop solution where the person on the other end is taking over someone&#8217;s computer &#8212; the service instead only forwards the contents of the individual web page the person is currently viewing. The application developer, that is, can only view what a user is doing on their own website. They can&#8217;t switch tabs or minimize the browser to poke around in the user&#8217;s PC more broadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t operate on the pixel level, like a normal screen share does, where they take a picture of your screen 60 times a second and try to send it over the wire,&#8221; explains Lin.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s technology itself is based on capturing the web page&#8217;s state &#8212; a picture of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">DOM</a>, so to speak, for those who understand the terminology. It then leverages things like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObservers</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebSockets">WebSockets</a> to make it possible to quickly see changes to the web pages in real time. Cohere also spent time to make sure it works with a range of web technologies and frameworks, including React, Iframe, Canvas, Vue, Angular and others. In time, it wants to expand support to more platforms and technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We capture the content of the page,&#8221; Lin says. &#8220;So, we are able to selectively filter out sensitive information like credit card info, passwords or Social Security numbers &#8212; any personally identifiable information,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125881" style="width: 1802px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125881" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2125881 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png" alt="" width="1792" height="1004" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png 1792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=1536,861 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125881" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cohere</p></div></p>
<p>The remote viewer also can&#8217;t take control until the user accepts, and then the user can boot them at any time with a click of an &#8220;X&#8221; button at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://cohere.so/security">these security controls</a>, Cohere is SOC 2 Type 1, GDPR and CCPA compliant.</p>
<p>At present, Cohere works on both desktop and mobile browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. And it&#8217;s designed to be integrated with a business&#8217;s existing tools, like Zendesk, Slack, Salesforce and Intercom, with more to come.</p>
<p>While the product to some extent competes with older remote desktop apps, its newer Cohere Replay feature allows businesses to go back in time to view their customer sessions retroactively.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125884" style="width: 1802px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125884" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2125884 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png" alt="" width="1792" height="1002" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png 1792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=1536,859 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125884" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cohere</p></div></p>
<p>Because the product is limited to web apps and is not a full remote desktop solution it tends to be used primarily for things like customer support and user onboarding. Early-stage startups have also used it as they give tours to their first customers and learn from how the customers use the product in real time.</p>
<p>The paid service begins at $49 per user per month and is $39 for larger teams.</p>
<p>Cohere first launched around seven months ago, during its Y Combinator batch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now raised $3.1 million in seed funding, led by Initialized Capital. Other investors in the round include Y Combinator, BoxGroup, Soma Capital, Shrug Capital, Chapter One and various angels like Zach Perret, Elad Gil, Naval Ravikant, Eric Wu, Prasanna Sankaranarayanan, Eric Glyman, Jack Altman, Todd Goldberg, Rahul Vohra, Karim Atiyeh, Vivek Sodera, Dan Romero, Shrav Mehta and Oscar Hong.</p>
<p>New York-based Cohere, currently consisting only of the three co-founders, will use the additional funds to hire in sales, engineering and product. It will also devote some capital to building out the enterprise sales process, and expand its integrations and use cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://payfit.com/en/">PayFit</a> has raised a $107 million series D funding round (â¬90 million). Eurazeo Growth and Bpifranceâs Large Venture fund are leading todayâs round. Existing investors Accel, Frst and Xavier Niel are participating once again.</p>
<p>PayFit has been building a payroll and HR software-as-a-service platform. It lets you manage your payroll from a web browser and automate as many steps as possible. For instance, you can configure automate payslip generation, export your payroll data to your accounting software and get a list of payments you need to make when it comes to pensions, health insurance, etc.</p>
<p>Given that itâs a software-as-a-service platform, everything remains up to date. For instance, if there are some regulatory changes that require some adjustments, PayFit can update its platform so that you remain compliant from day one without having to think about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over time, the startup has expanded beyond payroll to tackle a bigger chunk of the HR stack. Each employee gets its own PayFit login to access their payslips. But the company doesnât stop there as you can request time off and enter how much time youâve worked this week if youâre paid on an hourly basis. PayFit automatically notifies the manager for approval.</p>
<p>PayFit can also become your central repository for expenses and receipts. The company already has everyoneâs bank information, which makes it easier to transfer money back to an employee for a cash expense.</p>
<p>Employees can also view the companyâs directory and management chain from PayFit. The HR department can set up an onboarding flow in PayFit so that employees can request a computer, a badge, and enter personal information as soon as they join the company.</p>
<p>If you work for a big company that uses something like Workday, all of this probably sounds familiar. But PayFit targets small and medium companies that donât want to sign expensive contracts with enterprise companies. It has attracted 5,000 clients that employ 100,000 employees overall â thatâs an average of 20 employees per company. Some of the biggest clients include Revolut, Starling Bank and Treatwell.</p>
<p>The company is currently live in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the U.K. It currently has 550 employees and it plans to hire another 250 employees in 2021 to support its growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of us are working in distributed environments these days, and in the best scenarios, it might actually have improved rather than impeded our productivity. Today, a company that has built technology that taps into that concept as it applies to computing is announcing a large round of funding to boost its growth after a strong year of business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.incredibuild.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incredibuild</a>, an Israeli startup that provides a way for organizations to implement distributed computing architecture to speed up the processing needed for intensive tasks like software development by tapping into a company&#8217;s network of idle CPUs, has picked up $140 million in funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Startup&#8221; might be overstating what Incredibuild is: yes it&#8217;s a privately backed tech company, but it has been around since 2000, and although it counts substantial companies like gaming giants Epic (the company behind Fortnite), Microsoft and Nintendo, as well as Amazon, Citibank, Adobe, Disney, Intel and Samsung among its 800 customers, it&#8217;s been somewhat quiet and under the radar.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will be using the funding to continue building out its technology and its business model to apply to a wider range of enterprises and use cases.</p>
<p>CEO Tami Mazel Shachar said in an interview that the key concept that Incredibuild created was an efficient way of tapping CPU power in a network of computers regardless of whether they are on-premises or in the cloud. That technology is priced on a per-use basis but implementing it, Shachar said, brings down a company&#8217;s overall computing and equipment costs, and can speed up builds by 8X.</p>
<p>As you can see <a href="https://www.incredibuild.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, you Incredibuild not available to punters in easy-to-understand tiers: you need to get in touch with the company to sign up. The plan will be to device and list new pricing tiers, including a freemium tier to bring in more and smaller developer teams.</p>
<p>This round of financing is the first substantial outside investment made in the company since it was picked up by private equity firm Fortissimo in 2018. It comes from a single backer, Insight Partners, and represents a partial spinning out of the business, effectively back into startup mode. From what we understand, Incredibuild was already generating a lot of cash &#8212; hence no big fundraising history &#8212; and while it is not disclosing its valuation now, we understand from reliable sources that it is between $300 million and $400 million.</p>
<p>Incredibuild was started by two engineers, Uri Mishol and Uri Shaham, who first thought of the concept of speeding up software development processing through a distributed model when they were still in the Israeli army, working in the special forces and finding the processing times for their work to be much too slow, even on the most advanced machines (both are no longer actively involved in the company although both support it, Shachar said).</p>
<p>The company found early traction with games companies, whose heavy use of media required lots of code processing; longer term other companies that deal in with graphics, AR, VR, artificial intelligence and other work-intensive loads came to the company as well.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a number of other solutions being built to speed up workloads, from improving processors on devices, through to other devops and workload plays such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/continuous-delivery-pioneer-circleci-scores-100m-series-e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/cloudbees-raises-62m-for-its-devops-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudBees</a>, and many more. Nor is distributed computing a new concept: it&#8217;s the basis of a lot of peer-to-peer architectures such as those devised early on by the likes of BitTorrent, and it&#8217;s equally something that has been taken up by the blockchain community.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Shachar told me that Incredibuild itself does not own any patents on what it has built.</p>
<p>&#8220;The barriers are in the technology itself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At the end of the day, the IP is in how good we do what we do. It would take many years to try to copy what we have built and we are building on those hooks more now.&#8221; It&#8217;s also adding in more integrations to improve and expand on all of the use cases for its technology.</p>
<p>For now, the basic idea is predicated on networks of computers that are idle within a specific team of users, and there are no plans for bringing that concept into a wider network of users as you might find in P2P networking models. The privacy issues, for one thing, are a non-starter, Shachar noted.</p>
<p>But, she hinted that there are some concepts in the works to improve processing power using its technology for some of its current partners&#8217; customers. It&#8217;s interesting to remember that Microsoft, owner of Azure, and Amazon, owner of AWS, are both in Incredibuild&#8217;s client list. Watch this space.</p>
<p>Insight is notable for its other investments in DevOps &#8212; its portfolio includes both containerization leader Docker and JFrog &#8212; and so it will also be interesting to see whether we see more alignment with these.</p>
<p>âWe firmly believe that Incredibuild has built a crucial technology for any business that wants to develop better software, radically faster,â said Teddie Wardi, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. âWith our long history of investing in the development ecosystem, we are confident that Incredibuild will continue to innovate and build upon their recent momentum.âÂ  Both Wardi and MD Lonne Jaffe as well as senior associate Brad Fiedler are joining Incredibuildâs board.</p>
<p>Fortissimo is staying on as a shareholder in the company.</p>
<p>âFortissimo bought Incredibuild in 2018 with belief in the enormous potential of distributed processing,â said Yoav Hineman, Partner at Fortissimo Capital and board member of Incredibuild, in a statement. âThe investment by Insight Partners is a great milestone in delivering unparalleled acceleration for software developers.â</p>
