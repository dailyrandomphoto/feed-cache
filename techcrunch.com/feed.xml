										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon appears to have rowed back from a public threat to end support for Visa payments in the UK in a dispute over payment fees.</p>
<p>The ecommerce giant sent an email to users of Amazon.co.uk today informing them that the &#8220;expected change&#8221; &#8212; which was due to take place on January 19 &#8212; will not now take place on that day.</p>
<p>Although it is still not clear if the two companies have come to sustained terms on fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The expected change regarding the use of Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on January 19. We are working closely with Visa on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk,&#8221; Amazon writes in the email sent to UK users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice,&#8221; it goes on, adding: &#8220;Until then, you can continue to use Visa credit cards, debit cards, Mastercard, American Express, and Eurocard as you do today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Amazon and Visa confirmed the development &#8212; but did not offer any further detail.</p>
<p>Amazon declined to provide any comment beyond its brief statement to users that nothing is changing for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While a Visa spokesperson also did not elaborate on what &#8220;potential solutions&#8221; might mean in practice &#8212; implying that negotiations on fees are ongoing in a statement in which it writes: “Amazon customers can continue to use Visa cards on Amazon.co.uk after January 19 while we work closely together to reach an agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an earlier email to UK users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/amazon-says-it-will-stop-accepting-uk-issued-visa-credit-cards-on-january-19th/">late last year</a>, Amazon had blamed high payment fees charged by Visa for credit card transactions for ending support for Visa payments &#8212; warning Brits to make alternative arrangements for paying for their purchases on Amazon.co.uk.</p>
<p>Its very public mass email had looked like an attempt to leverage its market power to extract better terms from Visa.</p>
<p>Whether that worked to convince Visa to reduce its credit card fees or whether Amazon has just decided to step back from the brink of causing major disruption to UK shoppers is unclear.</p>
<p>If the latter, Amazon had already caused UK users who rely on Visa-based payment methods months of uncertainty over whether they would be able to continue making purchases on its site in the near future.</p>
<p>Back in November, Visa described it as disappointing that Amazon &#8220;is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future&#8221;, as it put it then, also arguing &#8220;when consumer choice is limited, nobody wins&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time, Visa had said it was working towards a resolution with Amazon to ensure Visa cardholders can keep on using their UK-issued Visa credit cards on its website.</p>
<p>Months later talks apparently continue &#8212; just without a looming public deadline for Amazon to stop accepting UK-issued Visa cards.</p>
<p>Rising fees for Visa transactions on Amazon.co.uk have been linked to the UK&#8217;s departure from the European Union &#8212; as Brexit removed the cap on fees that can be charged on transactions between the UK and the European Economic Area/EU.</p>
<p>But the issue also likely involves the specifics of how Amazon structures its UK business &#8212; since it bills UK customers via an EU-based entity, shifting revenue booked via its UK website to its European HQ in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>A report covered by <a href="https://www.cityam.com/amazon-transfers-8-2bn-of-uk-revenue-to-luxembourg-report-says/">City AM</a> last August suggested this corporate structure has enabled Amazon to evade paying considerably higher sums in UK tax. However it looks like the same &#8216;profits shifting&#8217; structure costs (or, well, has costed&#8230; ) Amazon considerably more in Visa &#8216;taxes&#8217; than it would like to pay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian startup INDmoney has raised $75 million in a new round as it attempts to build a super finance app to become a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for people’s investments and expenses, a top executive said on Monday.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, Steadview Capital, and Dragoneer co-led the startup’s $75 million Series D funding, said Ashish Kashyap, founder and chief executive of <a href="https://www.indmoney.com">INDmoney</a>, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup, which is valued at about $600 million in the new round, is working to raise another $10 million from a fund, said Kashyap, who is also personally investing in the new round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258474" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>INDmoney, which has offices in Gurugram and Bengaluru, has raised $133 million to date. Much of the capital it has raised over the years is still in the bank, he said.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, INDmoney started its journey as a wealth management app, helping users track their investments and expenses and set financial goals by using machine learning. But soon, it expanded its offerings to allow users to make those investments and expenses on the app itself &#8212; at zero commission. The startup, which has amassed over 3.5 million users, enables its members to invest in mutual funds, bonds and stocks. (INDmoney also offers US-listed stocks on the app.)</p>
<p>“We evolved INDmoney through a lot of amazing insights that consumers’ problems with finances are not at the individual level, but at a family level,” he said in the interview.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258489" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258489" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2258489 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="713" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=150,134 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=300,267 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=768,684 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=680,606 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258489" class="wp-caption-text">Prior to starting INDmoney, Ashish Kashyap co-founded Ibibo and PayU. (Image credits: INDmoney)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which works with banks and non-banking financial institutions, is planning to further expand its product stack to offer lending and card to customers, said Kashyap, who previously co-founded travel ticketing firm Ibibo and financial services giant PayU.</p>
<p>INDmoney is catering to the &#8220;mass affluent&#8221; demographic in the age range of 21 to 45, he said. The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to make deeper inroads in the market and win more customers, he said. &#8220;We have already invested a lot in machine learning, which powers our robo advisor, and research and development. A lot of the new capital will go into broadening our technology,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Millions of Indians are beginning to make investments for the first time in their lives, thanks to the proliferation of modern investment apps such as INDmoney, Jar, and Dhan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steadview has been especially impressed with the INDmoney team’s ambition and execution towards building India’s premier digital bank, redefining how people build financial security with a user-friendly, easy-to-use, mobile-native platform,&#8221; said Ravi Mehta, founder of Steadview Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We couldn’t be more excited to continue supporting Ashish and team’s remarkable vision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another regulatory brick in the wall for Apple: The iPhone maker agreed this weekend to changes to its App Store in the Netherlands focused on dating apps, agreeing to allow local developers of dating apps to be able to offer non-Apple based payments (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-complies-with-dutch-watchdog-ruling-payment-options-netherlands-2022-01-15/">Reuters</a>).</p>
<p>In December, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/summary-decision-abuse-dominant-position-apple">found</a> Apple in breach of national competition rules &#8212; ordering it to adjust what it described as &#8220;unreasonable conditions&#8221; in the App Store that apply to dating app providers.</p>
<p>Apple had been facing the threat of a financial penalty if it failed to make changes by the weekend.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258440" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tech giant went to court to seek an injunction against the order last month, including seeking to prevent the regulator from publishing its decision and applying for a temporary suspension of the order.</p>
<p>However, in a December <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBROT:2021:12851&amp;showbutton=true">ruling</a>, the court largely rejected Apple&#8217;s arguments &#8212; giving the company until January 15 to comply with the order to let dating app providers offer alternative payment options to their users.</p>
<p>&#8220;The case concerns the conditions Apple imposes on dating app providers if they want to sell digital content in their apps (such as &#8216;superlikes&#8217; and &#8216;boosts&#8217;). Those conditions mean, among other things, that payments from consumers must be made to Apple as a so-called commission agent of the dating app providers using certain software (the IAP API) that Apple has built into its iOS operating system. The dating app providers may not use any other payment settlement method and may not refer to another payment method in their apps,&#8221; the Rotterdam Court wrote [translated from Dutch using machine translation] at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to this part of the conditions, the preliminary relief judge follows the position of ACM that with these conditions Apple is abusing its dominant position in the market for app store services for dating app providers. Apple&#8217;s arguments that it would not have an economic dominant position and that the conditions are necessary are not successful.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Mzh9hmSpo9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">Europe charges Apple with antitrust breach, citing Spotify App Store complaint</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe charges Apple with antitrust breach, citing Spotify App Store complaint&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/embed/#?secret=Mzh9hmSpo9" data-secret="Mzh9hmSpo9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The ruling means that Apple must allow dating app providers for their dating apps that they offer or want to offer in the Dutch Store Front of the App Store to choose which party they have to settle payments for digital content and services sold within the app, and that those dating app providers may refer to payment systems outside the app for in-app purchases,&#8221; the court added, giving Apple a six weeks grace before the financial penalty for continued non-compliance would apply.</p>
<p>In the event, Apple has chosen compliance &#8212; while it continues to fight to overturn the order in the courts.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">statement</a> late Friday, ahead of the court-amended deadline to comply, Apple informed developers of the change to how it operates its store in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It also confirmed it is appealing the ACM ruling, laying out its case that the changes risk degrading the user experience and could create risks for user privacy and security &#8212; with Apple writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court. We’re concerned these changes could compromise the user experience, and create new threats to user privacy and data security. In the meantime, we are obligated to make the mandated changes which we’re launching today and we will provide further information shortly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the statement Apple also takes great care to warn local developers that if they take up the option to include non-Apple payment options in their apps there will be a reduction in the services Apple can provide their users as a result &#8212; while also emphasizing that app makers can choose to continue to use its in-app payment system without the need for any changes to how they operate.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the relevant chunk of text:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To comply with the ACM’s order, we’re introducing two optional new entitlements exclusively applicable to dating apps on the Netherlands App Store that provide additional payment processing options for users. Dating app developers who want to continue using Apple’s in-app purchase system may do so and no further action is needed. Before considering applying for one of these entitlements, it’s important to understand that some App Store features that you may use won’t be available to your customers, in part because we cannot validate the security and safety of payments that take place outside of the App Store’s private and secure payment system. Because Apple will not be directly aware of purchases made using alternative methods, Apple will not be able to assist users with refunds, purchase history, subscription management, and other issues encountered when purchasing digital goods and services through these alternative purchasing methods. You will be responsible for addressing such issues with customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>An Apple spokesman confirmed to TechCrunch that the restrictions on local dating apps that offer users non-Apple based payment methods for in-app purchases relate to refunds, subscription management and similar services &#8212; pointing to the portion of the statement where it underscores how app users will be on their own if purchasing digital goods from a developer that&#8217;s taking payment via non-Apple infrastructure.</p>
<p>In additional information to local dating app developers, Apple further emphasizes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It will be your responsibility to assist your users if questions or issues arise stemming from alternative payment options. Because Apple will not be directly aware of purchases made using alternative methods, Apple will not be able to assist users with refunds, payment history, subscription management, and other issues encountered when purchasing digital goods and services through these alternative purchasing methods. You will be responsible for addressing such issues with customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple&#8217;s spokesman confirmed that developers who choose not use <span class="il">Apple</span>’s In-App Purchase (IAP) technology can either link out or use a third-party payment method within the app &#8212; pointing to further information it has provided developers <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642498540822000&amp;usg=AOvVaw16WQPbgn-c-B_aOouxmKyD">here</a><span style="color: #1d1d1f;">.</span></p>
<p>It does not appear that local developers switching away from Apple&#8217;s IAP tech will be able to access entirely commission-free payments, however.</p>
<p>In information provided to developers, Apple also notes [emphasis ours]: &#8220;Consistent with the ACM’s order, dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider <em>will pay Apple a commission on transactions</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s spokesman declined to provide any additional details about this &#8212; such as whether the commission Apple will charge on any non-Apple/third party payments is lower than its standard IAP commission. But presumably it is. (Or, well, <a href="https://twitter.com/GeradinLaw/status/1483010194519072771">maybe not</a>&#8230;)</p>
<p>On its website the company further notes that &#8220;more information on all aspects of the entitlements will be available shortly&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Big Tech&#8217;s Big Antitrust Reckoning</h2>
<p>While this regulator-enforced change only applies to iOS developers in the Netherlands &#8212; and only to dating apps &#8212; it offers a taster of additional App Store rule changes that could follow as European regulators continue to dial up their attention on how Apple operates the store after years of complaints over its &#8220;tax&#8221; on in-app payments.</p>
<p>A number of competition regulators in Asia have also targeted Apple over in-app payments &#8212; and, earlier this month in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-to-allow-third-party-app-payment-options-in-south-korea/">South Korea</a>, Apple agreed to let local devs use third party payment options in their apps following a law banning payment mandates.</p>

<p>In Europe, the App Store remains under close antitrust scrutiny across the region &#8212; with open investigations by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/">the European Commission</a> (which issued a formal charge focused on the music streaming market<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/"> last April</a>) and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)</a>, to name two.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">begun its own Apple App Store probe this summer</a>.</p>
<p>A major mobile market study &#8212; looking at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/uks-cma-opens-market-study-into-apple-googles-mobile-duopoly/">Apple and Google&#8217;s duopoly control of the ecosystem</a> &#8212; by the UK&#8217;s CMA is also ongoing. But in a preliminary finding in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/cma-mobile-ecosystem-market-study/">December</a> the regulator gave a heavy hint that enforcement is coming &#8212; highlighting in-app payments as a concern, with the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">CMA suggesting that current approaches by Apple and Google could be contributing to higher prices for consumers and squeezing competition.</span></p>
<p>The UK is in the process of reforming digital competition law to create a new ex ante &#8212; and explicitly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition</a> &#8212; regime that will apply to the most powerful platforms, aka those judged to have so-called &#8216;strategic market status&#8217;.</p>
<p>Whether Apple meets the bar of that future law remains to be seen but the company is already in the CMA&#8217;s crosshairs &#8212; and enforcements could be on the horizon as a result of the investigation the regulator started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">last March </a>to consider whether Apple imposes &#8220;unfair or anti-competitive terms on developers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Similar legislative reforms targeting Big Tech are in train in the EU &#8212; where lawmakers are busy hashing out the fine details of the Digital Markets Act.</p>
<p>The Commission proposed the regulation at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">the end of 2020</a>, suggesting a fixed set of operational requirements on gatekeeping Internet giants &#8212; coupled with centralized enforcement to avoid regulatory capture and enforcement bottlenecks &#8212; which means the biggest tech companies are facing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/"> far tighter limits</a> on how they can do business in the EU in the near future.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s FCO, meanwhile, already has ex ante powers to smack tech giants &#8212; with so-called paramount market significance in its case. And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/germany-fco-google-decision/">earlier this month</a>, Google was the first tech giant to get a taster of its more alacritous antitrust action, as the FCO confirmed it meets the legal threshold for special powers to kick in. Soon after, Google made an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/google-news-showcase-fco-offers/"> offer of operational commitments</a> related to how it operates News Showcase, one of its products that remains under FCO probe.</p>
<p>The German regulator is, similarly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">in the process of deciding if Apple&#8217;s business meets the operational bar</a> for faster antitrust enforcement. So a pipeline of enforcements looks likely.</p>
<p>In a set of further competition-related enforcements, France has also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">going after Google hard on the news front</a> &#8212; hitting the company with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">a massive fine last summer</a>. Its antitrust regulator has leveraged a pan-EU update to digital copyright law to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/google-france-antitrust-news-litigation-settlement-offer/">extract local operational commitments</a> soon after the update was transposed into national law.</p>
<p>Also recently, France&#8217;s antitrust watchdog has obtained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">a series of commitments from Google around adtech</a>, following another bevvy of complaints.</p>
<p>As has the UK&#8217;s CMA &#8212; which is busy forcing Google to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">reshape its plans around Privacy Sandbox</a>. In that case the tech giant has offered to make the commitments global if the UK regulator accepts them.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: Big Tech&#8217;s operational room for manoeuvre is shrinking fast as regulators around the world up their interventions and get smarter about joint working, digital market analysis and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>The only silver lining for the biggest beasts of tech is perhaps that talk of breaking up platform empires has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">dialled back</a> in regions like Europe.</p>
<p>Tighter regulation appears to be the preference for Europe&#8217;s competition regulators &#8212; likely as it&#8217;s seen as a more realistic (and faster) route for reshapeing the local market impact of US Internet giants.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to major structural remedies that could see tech empires drastically reshaped, US giants now have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">plenty of problems</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">on home turf</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s call to foster semiconductor independence has sent investors chasing after chip startups of all sorts. Moffett AI, a Shenzhen-based chip design company, has received a fresh Series A injection. The company did not disclose the exact amount, only saying that the proceeds were in the &#8220;several tens of millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round was led by <a href="https://en.stonevc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoStone Capital</a> and the <a href="http://www.gbahomeland.com/lists/about.html?l=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greater Bay Area Homeland Development Fund</a>, a financial vehicle set up to support startups in the GBA economic zone, which is China&#8217;s grand project to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen and several other cities in the southern province of Guangdong.</p>
<p>Other investors in the Series A financing include <a href="http://www.chinacopower.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Co-Power</a>, <a href="http://www.grandchncap.com/">Grand China Capital</a>, and Shenzhen Angel Fund of Funds, a strategic fund set up by Shenzhen&#8217;s municipal government to &#8220;hunt down the next Huawei, Tencent and DJI.&#8221; Moffett&#8217;s last round from March 2020 closed at 100 million yuan (around $16 million).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258408" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>From autonomous driving vehicles to video streaming recommendations, artificial intelligence has become an essential part of our digital life. The skyrocketing demand for AI capabilities has put a strain on computing performance, so companies that provide AI acceleration, such as Moffett and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foxconn-backed Kneron</a>, become coveted.</p>
<p>Moffett vows that its AI chips differentiate by using a technology called &#8220;<a href="http://www.moffettai.com/aboutus.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparsification</a>&#8220;, a process that prunes redundant information from neural network models and ultimately leads to faster processing. The startup plans to spend its new funding on expanding the &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; of partners and clients that use its sparse technologies and mass-producing its first chip, Antoum, which is manufacturered by TSMC.</p>
<p>The startup claims that its chip has a sparsity rate of 32x, which makes its processing power 5-10 times higher than that of &#8220;international flagship products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Headquartered in Shenzhen, Moffett also keeps R&amp;D teams in Beijing, Shanghai and Silicon Valley, where it was founded in 2018. The startup is run by a group of AI research scientists from Carnegie Mellon University and semiconductor veterans from Intel, Qualcomm, Marvel and Oracle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms can include anxiety, chronic boredom, impulsiveness, trouble concentrating, controlling anger, and even depression. But ADHD sufferers can face lengthy waiting periods for assessment and prohibitively expensive treatments.</p>
<p>Now a startup, which launched in 2020, hopes to address this by pouring the knowledge of a team of clinicians and coaches into an app with a guided program to address ADHD symptoms. To help, <a href="http://www.getinflow.io">Inflow</a> claims to enable users to implement Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) coping strategies into their daily lives.</p>
<p>In 2020 InFlow raised $680K from Rhythm VC and angel investors. It’s now raised $2.3M in seed funding in a round led by London-based <a href="https://www.hoxtonventures.com/">Hoxton Ventures</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A former grade of Y Combinator 21’s batch, Inflow also drew in participation from US-based <a href="https://route66ventures.com">Route 66 Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Several prominent angel investors are also backing the company, including the founders of addiction digital clinic Quit Genius (Yusuf Sherwani, Maroof Ahmed, Sarim Siddiqui), and the CEO of legal services chatbot DoNotPay, Joshua Browder.</p>
<p>However, it must be pointed out that the app has yet to go through any independent clinical trial, although the company says this is in the pipeline later this year.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8220;In preparation for a clinical trial we’ve done a usability and feasibility study with the University of Richmond in the US with Dr. Laura Knouse. It did a pre and post symptom and impairment assessment which has been submitted to the journal of attention disorders.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2020 by Seb Isaacs, Levi Epstein (formerly Product Manager at Babylon Health), and ADHD expert Dr. George Sachs, Inflow will use the funding to expand its team and roll out additional tools and services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258123" style="width: 709px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258123" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png" alt="InFlow app" width="699" height="1141" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2258123" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png 699w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258123" class="wp-caption-text">InFlow app</p></div></p>
<p>InFlow competes in an ADHD app market populated by the likes of apps like SimpleMind Pro, Brain Focus and Focus@Will, but, in truth, most apps are simply touted as productivity apps that might be adapted for use by those with ADHD.</p>
<p>How Inflow works is that users complete short daily exercises and challenges to develop healthy habits, learn skills, practice ADHD-specific mindfulness techniques, learn about their neurological differences, and reframe negative thoughts, says the company.</p>
<p>InFlow claims it is being downloaded over 15k times every month.</p>
<p>Co-founder Seb Isaacs said: “We knew we could simplify the ADHD care process and reach millions of underserved people living with ADHD. Inflow can offer immediate, affordable, and on-demand support in ways our burdened mental health system simply cannot. There’s no waitlist, no need for a referral, no complicated intake process.”</p>
<p>Hussein Kanji, Partner at Hoxton Ventures, added: “It’s been a privilege to watch Inflow deliver on its mission to see every person with ADHD thrive.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">nCore Games has raised $10 million in a new financing round as the top Indian gaming firm gears up to launch web3 offerings, its top executives said Monday.</p>
<p>Animoca Brands and Galaxy Interactive, two high-profile investors in the crypto space, led the funding. Polygon, a popular layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution, and Hyperedge Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Scores of angel investors including Amitabh Singhal, Sandeep Nailwal, Kanwaljit Bombra, Sohil Chand, Ashish Chand, Ram Madhvani, Rakesh Kaul, Mannan Adenwala, Sanjay Narang, Taj Haslani, Kristian Segerstrale, Sanjay Gondal, Vedant Baali, Kartik Prabhakara, Peter Leung, Yashraj Akashi and Akshay Chaturvedi also invested in the round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258426" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>nCore Games houses a number of gaming studios including Studio nCore, Dot9 Games, and IceSpice. Its portfolio includes multiplayer action-title Fau-G and Pro Cricket Mobile that have garnered tens of millions of downloads.</p>
<p>The startup plans to launch and invest in more games this year, said Vishal Gondal, co-founder of nCore Games, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>But the bigger focus with the funding is expansion into the metaverse, he said. nCore Games is evaluating launching its own NFTs and tokens and may do so in the next few months, he said.</p>
<p>India has emerged as one of the largest mobile games markets globally by download counts. PUBG Mobile, before it was banned by New Delhi, had amassed over 50 million monthly active users in India. But gaming firms have struggled to efficiently monetize this user base because of low-penetration of in-app purchases and small ticket advertising dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The growth of gaming in India is already undeniable and the market is poised to take another huge leap forward,&#8221; said Sam Englebardt, General Partner at Galaxy Interactive, in a statement.</p>
<p>Gondal, an industry gaming veteran who sold his previous venture to Disney, said there&#8217;s a shift in the gaming economy, especially in the developing markets where firms have largely relied on advertisement to generate revenue. He cited the popularity of Axie Infinity in the Philippines, a market similar to India where in-app purchase revenue is not high.</p>
<p>Drawing parallels between India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, Gondal said he is optimistic that web3 offerings that have made inroads in several categories and in many markets will prove popular with gaming in India. Gondal said web3 is positioned to enable the right incentive structure to all stakeholders.</p>
<p>“Currently when you’re playing a game, the maximum upside for you was to become part of some community. Now while you’re playing the game, you also have the chance to own the value of the game,” he said.</p>
<p>Tejraj Parab, the chief executive of IceSpice, said nCore Games is eyeing making a universal token that all of its games as well as those of the partner firms will provide to the community. The startup is also hoping to make its technology available to other game developers to leverage, he said.</p>
<p>Dayanidhi MG, the chief executive of Studio nCore, said, &#8220;we are excited to embrace the emerging trends and technologies in the company of global leaders and highly successful funds, companies and veterans to take nCore to the next level with exponential growth.”</p>
<p>Web3 is beginning to gain traction in India. Indian startup Faze, backed by Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India, last year partnered with ICC, the global governing body of cricket, to launch NFTs for cricketers. The startup is currently holding talks to raise a new financing round from Insight Partners, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Several Bollywood celebrities have also partnered with firms to launch their own NFTs.</p>
<p>&#8220;nCORE Games was started by experienced gaming industry professionals with strong pedigrees. This is one of our most promising investments in India, which has a large gaming market with a massive growth potential,&#8221; said Yat Siu, the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, in a statement. &#8220;nCORE Games has the right team to leverage blockchain and NFTs in games to deliver digital property rights to players, and we look forward to many successful products as we move toward a global open metaverse.&#8221;</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Cash flow is a major pain point for small businesses in Africa. Long payment cycles, which can take 30-90 days after services or products have been rendered, and little or no capital, of which <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zuzana-Brixiova-Schwidrowski/publication/345177624_Access_to_finance_among_small_and_medium-sized_enterprises_and_job_creation_in_Africa/links/5fa3e40f299bf10f73251ec9/Access-to-finance-among-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-and-job-creation-in-Africa.pdf?origin=publication_detail">research says</a> 85% of African small and medium businesses are subject to, are the main culprits of cash flow issues.</p>
<p>Many startups are solving these problems for African SMBs in one form or another, and the demand for their services has seen Ghanaian startup <a href="https://float.africa/">Float</a> pick up a significant round of funding. The fintech which provides credit lines for businesses has raised $17 million, funding that it will be using to bolster its offerings and expand geographically.</p>
<p>The seed round was a mix of $7 million equity and $10 million debt. While <a href="https://www.caurisfinance.com/">Cauris</a> provided debt financing, Tiger Global and JAM Fund, the investment firm of Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen co-led the equity bit. Other VC firms involved in the equity round include Kinfolk, Soma Capital, Ingressive Capital and Magic Fund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258224" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A couple of angel investors also took part: Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, Sandy Kory of Horizon Partners, Ramp founders Karim Atiyeh and Eric Glyman, Gregory Rockson of mPharma and Dutchie founders Zach Lipson and Ross Lipson.</p>
<p>CEO <a href="https://gh.linkedin.com/in/jesseaholmes">Jesse Ghansah</a> started the company, formerly known as Swipe, with <a href="https://gh.linkedin.com/in/barima-effah-adjei-7498ab1bb">Barima Effah</a> in 2020, and following its rebrand as Float, went live with its product in June 2021. The idea for the YC-backed Ghanaian fintech came during the chief executive’s time at OMG Digital, a media company he founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/10/omg-digital-africa/">that also got into YC</a>, in 2016.</p>
<p>“We needed credit and proceeded to get an overdraft from a long-term partner bank where we had transacted more than $100,000. But the bank wanted us to deposit 100% collateral in cash before they could give the overdraft,” the two-time YC founder told TechCrunch in a June interview.</p>
<p>“I also remember taking money from loan sharks with ridiculous interest rates, sometimes as high as 20% a month, to meet payroll. That threw me into solving those problems with Float.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s an identical problem for more than 51% of 44 million formal SMBs in sub-Saharan Africa who say they need more finance than they can access to grow their businesses, per <a href="https://pressroom.ifc.org/all/pages/PressDetail.aspx?ID=17513">research</a>. Float provides credit to some of these businesses that find it challenging to get from traditional banks.</p>
<p>In addition to flexible credit lines for businesses to cover cash flow gaps, Float also has software tools for businesses to manage accounts and wallets in one dashboard, as well as automate bills, vendor or supplier payments and invoice collections. The company aims to serve as the “financial operating system” for Africa’s small and medium businesses.</p>
<p>Other features on the platform include invoice advance, opening a business account, payment links, managing budgets and spend cards.</p>
<p>The company has also introduced some more features recently: revenue advances and instant payouts. With the latter, Float wants small businesses to use its platform to tap into their revenues instantly instead of using gateways, which take days to settle. Its invoice factoring helps businesses with outstanding invoices get cash advances.</p>
<p>Ghansah stated all these features provide different forms of credit for various industries and verticals across the continent.</p>
<p>“The big challenge is that credit needs of businesses are very different. The credit needs of retail are very different from the credit needs of a services business, or the credit needs of agriculture, business or pharmaceutical or medical supplies businesses,” said the chief executive.</p>
<p>“So we are trying to dig deep into which credit products work for certain verticals. And so that’s what we’ve been working on so far.”</p>
<p>In the seven months since Float’s launch, the cash flow management and spend platform has onboarded hundreds of businesses in a wide range of industries &#8212; retail and manufacturing, fintech, e-commerce, media and health.</p>
<p>Float has also hit $10 million in credit spend and cash advances to businesses in that time. The company claims to have seen its payment transaction (invoicing and vendor payments) volume, in eight figures, increase 26x.</p>

<p>Float isn’t the only African fintech newcomer with plans to be the “operating system” for small and medium businesses in the region. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/nigerias-prospa-gets-3-8m-pre-seed-to-offer-small-businesses-banking-and-software-services/">Prospa</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/ventures-platform-hustle-fund-back-nigerian-fintech-brass-in-1-7m-round/">Brass</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/uzoma-dozies-sparkle-raises-3-1m-for-personal-business-neobank-play-in-nigeria/">Sparkle</a> are a few of these startups that provide financial and cash flow support and software services to businesses.</p>
<p>Each company claims not to see the others as competition; first, they believe the market is big enough for all parties to coexist. Second, there’s a feeling of superiority in their products &#8212; though they won’t say this publicly.</p>
<p>For Float, it prides itself on giving businesses access to financial and software services simultaneously. And then in providing readily available flexible and short duration working capital instead of outright expensive loans.</p>
<p>“I think that a part of how we differentiate ourselves is just how flexible our credit is, in terms of the speed of access, how quickly you can draw down on credit,” said Ghansah. “And then, like it’s flexible in terms of how you can just take it out for a day and then repay the next day, for example.”</p>
<p>Float, present in Ghana and Nigeria, intends to use this new capital to set up entities in Kenya and South Africa by Q2 as soon as it gets licenses to operate, Ghansah said on the call.</p>
<p>The company will also use the investment to improve its cash management platform and launch new credit products tailored to specific business verticals and industries.</p>
<p>“Float set out on a mission to provide more cash flow and liquidity for millions of businesses across the continent to help them grow and reach their true potential,” said the chief executive in a statement.</p>
<p>“With this new funding, we will continue to refine both our credit and software products to deliver the best experiences for our fast-growing customer base. We are excited to be the growth partner of choice for businesses in Africa.”<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Customer service tickets tend to fall into the same few buckets — returns, refunds or quality control questions. Not only are these repetitive, but it leaves little time for customer engagement on more complex requests, like relaying information on products or helping a customer find the best product for them.</p>
<p>Maja Schaefer and Matt Ciolek, co-founders of <a href="https://getzowie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zowie</a>, believe much of that repetitive work can be automated. They founded the company in 2019, blending their experiences of working with an e-commerce startup on both the product development and customer survey sides.</p>
<p>“We realized that customer service was not being solved by existing solutions because their implementation was so hard,” CEO Schaefer told TechCrunch. “It would take months to implement and then end up being hard to maintain.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258136" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They proposed to a client chatbots as a solution for repeatable work, and after being tasked with building those in a matter of weeks, they had the idea for Zowie.</p>
<p>Using AI-powered chatbots for customer service is not new. In the past year, we saw companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/forethought-nabs-65m-series-c-to-improve-customer-service-with-ai/">Forethought</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/heyday-seed-funding-2/">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cognigy-raises-44m-to-scale-its-enterprise-focused-conversational-ai-platform/">Cognigy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/landbot-closes-8m-series-a-for-its-no-code-chatbot-builder/">Landbot</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/no-code-tool-maker-heyflow-nabs-6m-to-fix-your-customer-conversions/">Heyflow</a> announce funding in this area.</p>
<p>However, Schaefer says some competitors require the company to input responses and other workflow information into the tool. Instead, Zowie’s Zowie X1 technology does the job of automating the request workflows specific to a product or brand from the very beginning. The company can analyze data in minutes and tell a customer the percentage of support tickets Zowie can support, in some cases 50%.</p>
<p>Schaefer estimates the chatbots free up about two hours per agent per day, leaving them open to take on questions not answered by the chatbot, resolve more complicated issues and turn more support into sales. On average, customers are able to realize up to 45% more sales, she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After experiencing its revenue tripling between 2020 and 2021, the company decided to go after a round of funding, raising $5 million in a seed round led by Gradient Ventures and 10xFounders, with participation from Lattice CEO Jack Altman, Giesswein CEO Markus Giesswein and returning investor Inovo Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The company is working with about 100 customers, including Giesswein. She expects to use the funding on product development, marketing, sales and growth of the commercial team in the United States and across North America. Zowie has 36 employees currently and the plan is to double the team this year.</p>
<p>Some of the product features the company is looking to expand include automation across as many channels as possible, from websites to email to Whatsapp, and to enable features on the sales side so they can navigate through the customer journey.</p>
<p>Darian Shirazi, general partner at Gradient Ventures, says his firm was attracted to Zowie, in part by its significant revenue traction in a short period of time and the business that the founders are building.</p>
<p>“One of the differentiations we saw when looking at Zowie was that it was the first AI chatbot for e-commerce that generates your knowledge base,” he said. “Others have to provide the knowledge base to answer the questions, and some companies don&#8217;t have time to do that. We’d been looking in the chatbot space, and no one has done it well for e-commerce, which is a massive vertical.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barcelona-based <a href="https://www.payflow.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Payflow</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">YC-backed</a> salary-advance fintech with ambitions to evolve into a neobank, has banked a $9.1 million Series A funding round &#8212; bringing its total raised since January 2020, when the business was founded, to $13.6M.</p>
<p>Investors in the round include a mix of national and international funds, including Spain&#8217;s Seaya Ventures, a new backer of Payflow and Cathay Innovation via its C. Entrepreneurs Fund, which are co-leading the round; with participation from Force Over Mass Capital, Y Combinator and Rebel Fund.</p>
<p>The startup sells a salary-advance service to employers to offer their staff &#8212; charging companies a commission for the tech rather than levying a fee on users to withdraw a portion of their salary early (as some other salary startups do).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257966" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Payflow says the model has won it friends in works councils and labor unions.</p>
<p>It also touts it as a differentiating feature vs other salary advance startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;We differentiate from other pay-on-demand companies because we have never charged an employee for using the service (we are the first true employee benefit, fully paid by the company),&#8221; says co-founder Avinash Sukhwani.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Payflow] is free for users and it will always be the case,&#8221; adds co-founder Benoît Menardo. &#8220;Our vision is to provide the first true employee benefit for blue collar workers and we believe that if the employee has to pay for it, it’s not a real perk.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among users it notes a high uptake &#8212; with a 40% download rate on average, and rates as high as 90% for some of its clients &#8212; which it claims is 5-10x higher than other on-demand salary platforms and other social benefits.</p>
<p>Its approach also appears to be checking the right boxes for employers, too &#8212; with 175+ clients signed up already (covering 100,000 users).</p>
<p>It operates a SaaS business model, charging employers a tiered fee depending on the number of employees using the product.</p>
<p>Payflow is targeting the product at large corporate clients. it says customers span all industries but &#8212; as you might expect &#8212; it says take-up it&#8217;s highest among blue collar workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cater to all industries, from restaurants to startups to hospitals, but uptake is best amongst blue collar workers,&#8221; says Sukhwani.</p>
<p>A salary advance may help lower income workers avoid getting into debt if they are able to access wages more often than once per month, such as to pay an unexpected bill. At the same time, there may be some risks related to instant access to wages which could encourage a negative financial spiral &#8212; say if the employee spends their wages immediately they&#8217;re earned and arrives at the end of the month with no money.</p>
<p>Asked about this, Payflow says it makes a &#8220;safety limit&#8221; available in its employer dashboard &#8220;in case they want to restrict usage&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most companies set this limit to around 50%, so that employees always receive at least the remaining 50% of their salary in the monthly paycheck,&#8221; says Menardo, adding: &#8220;That allows them to ensure there is enough leftover for rent and other essential monthly expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Series A funding is earmarked for expanding Payflow&#8217;s international footprint.</p>
<p>It is also planning to spend on product dev to fuel its goal of evolving into a neobank.</p>
<p>Some neobanks are going the other way of course &#8212; and bolting on salary advance as an additional feature to their offerings (see, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/revolut-introduces-salary-advance-feature-in-the-uk/">Revolut</a>).</p>
<p>In fintech the startup game can boil down to different strategies and approaches to maximize customer onboarding &#8212; after which, and with strong enough traction, there&#8217;s the chance to upsell users of a popular feature on more fully fledged banking services, funded by earlier feature success.</p>
<p>The upshot is fintech competition may be very dynamic.</p>
<p>Although a particular cohort of users may be more loyal and less likely to switch than others &#8212; and if such a demographic can be upsold on banking services via a sticky enough feature which gets them to know a startup service and inculcates loyalty that might make for a low churn banking customer base for cross-selling a full suite of services for years to come. Or, well, that&#8217;s the fintech dream.</p>
<p>On the product dev side Payflow is developing a &#8220;super app&#8221; to start to expand its feature set.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2022, two features [will be added] that strengthen the b2b value proposition through bringing financial wellness to blue collar employees,&#8221; says Menardo. &#8220;Later on, by developing many b2c features [the plan for the app is] essentially turning into a neobank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Payflow isn&#8217;t disclosing a timeline for evolving its salary advance SaaS business into a direct-to-consumer neobank but Menardo implies it wants to grow its customer base by more than 10x, noting: &#8220;This concept is especially powerful once we have millions of users.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan to launch our first d2c feature before the end of this year,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also hoping to get a good chunk of growth out of its home market where it plans to double down and spend $3M of the fresh funding to consolidate the market &#8212; with a goal of growing its customer base 5x in Spain.</p>
<p>On the market expansion front Payflow is planning to launch into two more markets outside Spain, in addition to Chile and Columbia where it is already offering a service.</p>
<p>Its expansion will be focused on Europe and LatAm.</p>
<p>Currently, it has pilots running in Italy and Portugal. It also says it&#8217;s planning to open one more market in LatAm this year &#8212; so it looks like it will grow from three markets (currently) to five in total during 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based legaltech startup <a href="https://juro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juro</a> has grabbed $23 million in Series B funding for its browser-based contract automation platform. In total the startup has raised $31.5M since being founded back in 2016.</p>
<p>Investors in the Series B are Eight Roads, which led the round &#8212; plus existing investors Union Square Ventures, Point Nine Capital, Seedcamp and Taavet Hinrikus (Wise/TransferWise co-founder).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Eight Roads’ partner, Alston Zecha, joins </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Juro</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8216;s board.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256076" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Juro says its annual recurring revenue has tripled year-on-year. And while it&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation at this round it says it&#8217;s increased more than 5x.</p>
<p>It is finally disclosing customers numbers &#8212; saying some 6,000 companies are using its platform, including the likes of Deliveroo, Cazoo, Trustpilot and TheRealReal, with users spread across 85+ countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we work with more than 20 unicorn-valuation scale-ups,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Richard Mabey. &#8220;These companies often process very high volumes of contracts, which is where we really help. But more traditional enterprises like Reach plc have also adopted <span class="il">Juro</span> fully, so we anticipate more enterprise demand during 2022.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has focused on disrupting the use of legacy tools like Word and PDFs for contracts &#8212; offering a dedicated, browser-based contract builder platform, rather than merely creating a cloud-based work flow for moving files around.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are challenging the notion that contracts need to be static files at all,&#8221; Mabey tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We do this by bringing those contracts out of Word and into a custom-built, browser-native editor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This editor is highly modular and integrates seamlessly into a company&#8217;s tech stack,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;250,000 contracts were processed in this way last year and for certain use cases it can be magic (we have an NPS of 72).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the same way that developers use GitHub or designers use Figma to collaborate, in <span class="il">Juro</span> you can process contracts from creation through to signature without ever leaving your browser. In this regard, we really see our main competition as MS Word.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest tranche of funding will go on market expansion in the US and Europe, further investment into the product and for an exec hiring drive to support the planned scaling.</p>
<p>The startup has offices in London and Riga, as well as a growing &#8220;remote hub&#8221; &#8212; and says it is hiring in all locations.</p>
<p>Mabey says its priorities on the recruitment side are to hire a VP of marketing and VP of engineering.</p>
<p><span class="il">&#8220;Juro</span>&#8216;s core strength is in contract creation and we will double down here,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We are the only platform with a browser-native editor specifically designed for contracts. A lot of our efforts will go towards this, along with developing new integrations into this editor (e.g. CRM systems).</p>
<p>&#8220;For customers, this means one unified experience for creating, approving, negotiating, signing and managing contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on Juro&#8217;s Series B in a statement, Eight Roads&#8217; Zecha, added: &#8220;Until <span class="il">Juro</span>, there hasn’t been an all-in-one platform which automates contracts and provides frictionless integrations with clients’ workflows. <span class="il">Juro</span> is used by legal, sales, HR and other teams at some of Europe’s best high-growth companies including many in Eight Roads’ portfolio. It has market-leading customer satisfaction scores plus the highest employee satisfaction score we’ve seen at a scaleup. We are thrilled to partner with Richard, Pavel and the <span class="il">Juro</span> team.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.asaak.com/">Asaak</a>, a Ugandan asset financing startup, has secured $30 million in pre-Series A equity and debt funding. The round saw the participation of new and existing investors including Resolute Ventures, Social Capital, HOF Capital, Founders Factory Africa, End Poverty Make Trillions, Decentralized VC and a number of angel investors.</p>
<p>Asaak offers motorbike financing to operators, who are often locked out by formal banking institutions due to stringent security requirements comprising income history and regular account activity.</p>
<p>The startup works with a number of partners including mobility and e-commerce platforms to make motorcycle ownership easier for the riders&#8211; who earn a living by operating motorcycle taxis (bodaboda), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/zembo-nabs-3-4-million-from-toyota-dob-equity-and-infraco-africa-to-grow-its-motorcycle-startup-in-uganda/">a popular mode of transport across Africa, and especially in major cities like Kampala</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258414" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Through Asaak, bodaboda operators are now able to own the motorcycles they ride, compared to previously when most of them were either employed by bike owners, or were renting or leasing the motorcycles.</p>
<p>“Asaak is unlocking mobility-based work, which literally moves the economy forward and creates upward mobility for these individuals. Bodaboda riders are the lifeblood of Africa, moving people and cargo from home to school to work. They just need access to motorcycles which leads them to better income opportunities and makes them able to provide for their families,” Asaak co-founder and chief business officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanterrill/">Dylan Terrill</a> told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Other members of the founding team include <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-leontiev/">Anthony Leontiev</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eegwalu/?originalSubdomain=ug">Edward Egwalu</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kksattar/">Kaivan Sattar</a>.</p>
<p>Asaak approves riders for motorcycle financing using behavioral and financial data like their earnings, trips made and their ratings from platforms like Bolt, Jumia, Safeboda and Uber.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Using rider data from these platforms, Asaak creates a credit score of the borrowers. Borrowers can also use the Asaak app or physically visit their branches to know if they qualify for the financing. Drivers usually receive motorcycle financing (about $1,500 worth of credit) within three days of signing up, and pay an interest of between 1 to 4% depending on their credit score.</p>
<p>“The more confident that we are with the data that we have to make a lending decision, the less the other requirements they would need to have. We&#8217;re trying to make it as easy as possible for people to get loans. But in some cases, yes, it&#8217;s necessary (to have a guarantor) and it makes sense from a lending perspective,” said Terrill.</p>
<p>Asaak, which started operations in Soroti Uganda in 2016, pivoted to motorcycle financing in 2019 after a period of lending to farmers then SMEs. The startup has so far financed the purchase of 5,000 motorcycles, and has also started providing smartphones and fuel financing to the operators.</p>
<p>“By financing these types of assets, we&#8217;re not just creating a pathway to vehicle ownership, which is good in itself, but we&#8217;re creating a stable source of income because of the reliance of drivers throughout the countries that we are in.”</p>
<p>They are also working with Samsung to drive smartphone ownership among motorcycle taxi operators. Last month, the company announced another partnership with Untapped Global, an investment company focussing on emerging markets to provide financing for more than 2,000 motorcycles over the next one year.</p>
<p>Today, the startup has also partnered with Standard Bank, headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa and with a presence in 20 countries across the continent, to offer financial services to millions of workers (like motorcycle taxi operators) in the informal sector through the startup’s proprietary digital loan origination system. Through this partnership Asaak customers will also have access to tailored services encompassing both finance and insurance.</p>
<p>“While we often underestimate the power of the boda-boda (motorcycle transport) in Africa, in many circumstances, it is an ambulance, a pharmacist, and a chef &#8211; it brings you everything you need. It takes children to school, it brings people to job interviews, it provides livelihoods for hundreds of millions of Africans,&#8221; said Stanbic Bank, Standard Bank&#8217;s operation in Uganda, head of direct digital and e-commerce Aaron Akampa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, this is new ground for Standard Bank &#8211; we haven’t partnered with any other players in this space on the continent yet &#8211; it’s the first time we are creating a partnership like this and we can’t wait to see what is ahead,” said Akampa.</p>
<p>The partnership with the bank comes as Asaak plans to enter six new markets in Africa in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tado.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tado</a>, the German smart home startup that specializes in thermostats and <a href="https://www.tado.com/gb-en/press-releases/awattar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more recently</a> moved into flexible &#8220;time of use&#8221; energy tariffs based on loadshifting technology, is today announcing the next step in its life as a business. It&#8217;s going public by way of a SPAC deal.</p>
<p>GFJ ESG Acquisition, a German SPAC entity focused specifically on sustainable technologies, said it will combine with tado and list the new company on the Frankfurt exchange. GFJ and tado are now working on the PIPE transaction, which when completed is expected to value tado at €450 million ($514 million at today&#8217;s rates). The new business will continue to trade as tado.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for tado said it is not disclosing how much it plans to raise in the listing, nor when the listing is expected to happen, except that it will likely be in the first half of 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The move comes swiftly on the heels of two big developments for tado. Last week, tado <a href="https://www.tado.com/gb-en/press-releases/awattar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired aWATTar</a> (yes that is how the company styles its name&#8230;) to expand from energy consumption hardware inside the home, to software to better manage energy consumption and costs based both on how the customer uses energy, and how pricing varies depending on the fluctuations of that energy source (which can include renewable sources like solar and wind, as well as more traditional channels).</p>
<p>Also, in May, tado raised <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c83efa11-b183-4b02-a55d-bb485a370625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$46 million</a>. At the time, the company said this would be its last round before a listing, and that&#8217;s what is playing out now. Altogether the company had raised just shy of $159 million, with an impressive list of investors, including Amazon, Siemens and Telefonica. Its valuation in those private rounds was considerably lower than the €450 million it expects to achieve with its market cap at listing: it was around $255 million according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/53848-54/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>.</p>
<p>The deal is notable because it will be one of the first big green tech startups in Europe to go public. Tado&#8217;s bigger goal is to build services to help manage energy use in and end-to-end system, starting at the power grid and terminating with consumers, in their homes. That business has taken two different turns so far. It first started as a maker of smart thermostats, and business that has now sold some 2 million devices. Then, tado diversified into energy tariff and managing use is catapulting the company into a wider business based on big data, predictive analytics and harnessing the wider and very fragmented markets of renewable energy and energy hardware systems.</p>
<p>The company today says that it has sold more than 2 million smart thermostats, and its energy-management technology connects some 400,000 buildings and households in 20 countries, with more than 7 gigawatts of energy capacity under management. Its works with some 18,000 systems from 900 OEMs, and claims that customers using its load-balancing technology save an average of 22% on heating costs annually.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As concerns about climate change continue to become ever-more urgent, and services for consumers to make choices to reduce greenhouse emissions become more readily available and affordable, a new window of opportunity has opened up for green tech and clean tech companies. This listing underscores how one of them feels now confident enough in that traction to make the leap into being publicly traded to grow further.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The entire team at tado is extremely proud to partner up with GFJ,&#8221; said Toon Bouten, CEO of tado, in a statement. &#8220;We share the same convictions and the same passion for environmental technologies. And we are determined to jointly help our customers save money and reduce their ecological footprint. Together, we are in a great position to create a more sustainable energy future.”</p>
<p>When the deal is closed, Bouten will step down as the head of the company, with Oliver Kaltner (who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverkaltner/?originalSubdomain=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lists his current role</a> as President of office solutions provider Room) will be taking on a role as CEO, with Christian Deilmann as CPO and Johannes Schwarz as CTO. Emanuel Eibach will remain CFO. Gisbert Rühl shall become chairman of the supervisory board. Josef Brunner, Petr Míkovec, Toon Bouten and Maximilian Mayer shall also join the supervisory board.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both GFJ and tado are determined to turn up the heat on fighting against climate change in a smart way. tado already is a market leader in the very spirit of a new wave of green tech companies,&#8221; added Gisbert Rühl, CEO of GFJ. &#8220;We are excited to bring in capital and expertise to help them grow even stronger and foster their technology development. Around 21% of energy consumption in the EU is used for heating and cooling private housing alone. If the EU and Germany want to fulfil their commitment to becoming the world&#8217;s first climate-neutral economy by 2050, there is no alternative to decarbonising the housing sector.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">tado, as a public business, will gain a new level of transparency to the market, which will be good for the wider green tech industry as a whole. For now, the company is projecting that it will be making more than €500 million in annual revenues in three years, by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Misty has had a hell of a journey of it. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/sphero-spinoff-misty-robotics-gets-11-5-mil-to-create-a-mainstream-robot-for-the-home/">raising $11.5 million from Foundry and Venrock</a>, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/misty-is-crowfunding-its-personal-robot/">crowdfunding its personal robot</a>, the company hit a series of challenges. Today, Swedish social robotics company <a href="https://furhatrobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Furhat Robotics</a> is offering the beleaguered startup a gentle landing in what the Swedish company says is an all-cash deal. Furhat is tight-lipped about the financial details of the deal, but tells TechCrunch that the acquisition was designed to give Furhat a leg up on the hardware side, allowing it to leverage its social robotics software on new platforms.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://furhatrobotics.com/blog/whats-in-a-name-the-story-behind-furhat-robotics">curiously named</a> Furhat Robotics is planning to keep Misty Robotics&#8217; Colorado home as the base for its U.S. operations, and is keeping eight of the most senior staff members of the company as it is finding ways to integrate the two technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re keeping the senior team; the head of operations, engineering, business development, and senior software developers are joining us, &#8221; says CEO and co-founder of Furhat Robotics, Samer Al Moubayed. &#8220;Misty has done a great job in building a very scalable production operation, building the products by <a href="https://www.jetta.com.hk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a well-known partner</a> in China.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258226" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The companies claim they are operating from a &#8220;unified vision&#8221;, and say that Furhat Robotics will continue to support the Misty Robotics brand, helping develop and expand the product range, as well as integrating Furhat and Misty features to enhance future social robots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acquisitions in the world of social robotics are very rare. This might be the first time this happens in history, actually. It&#8217;s just a very early stage of the industry,&#8221; says Al Moubayed. &#8220;This company spun out of Spiro. What&#8217;s very unique about the robot is that it might look like a toy, but it&#8217;s very likable, very approachable. And yet, it&#8217;s extremely advanced. What Misty Robotics succeeded at, is they put the best technologies available in the world in a very likable robot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Furhat team suggests that its own product &#8212; a robot with a rear-projected animated face on it &#8212; is great for social robots that need to have an adult personality, such as airports, train stations or medical applications. What Misty adds to the mix is something that is far more extensible, and can be more expressive with its little arms and facial expression. Nonetheless, the Furhat team explains that while the two robots look very different, they have a lot in common, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, Misty is the piece that is that was missing. It helps us access a larger market focusing on education, for example,&#8221; explains Al Moubayed, exploring how the acquisition came about. &#8220;The technologies are very similar, but Misty is great at the hardware front, and we are very strong on software. Instead of building a new robot for educational use, Furhat decided to start looking for another solution.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Furhat Robotics is a true pioneer in its field,&#8221; commented founder and head of Product at Misty Robotics, Ian Bernstein. &#8220;We are joining forces to bring the future of robotic applications into the present and the combination of our specialties means that we will see even more incredible real-life applications of this amazing technology in the near future. Social robots are already playing a significant role in our lives, and by applying our combined expertise to solve real-world issues, the sky truly is the limit.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supply chain logistics &#8212; getting components and eventually finished products from A to B to C &#8212; is one of the most critical parts of running a business, not least because it is one of the most complex, involving dozens of companies, hundreds of combinations and permutations, accounting for world events outside of your business, a lot of people hours to figure it all out. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.the7bridges.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7bridges</a> that is aiming to simplify that by way of an AI-based automation platform &#8212; it ingests a company&#8217;s supply chain, operating and logistics data to present a user with optimized recommendations for how to move goods &#8212; is announcing $17 million in new funding, a sign of the demand in the market to address and fix how supply chains work.</p>
<p><a href="https://eightroads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eight Roads</a>, the investment firm backed by Fidelity, is leading the round for London-based 7bridges, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/with-two-new-funds-localglobe-has-more-latitude-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Globe</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/crane-a-new-early-stage-london-vc-focused-on-intelligent-enterprise-startups-raises-90m-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enterprise VC Crane</a>, which both invested in 7bridges&#8217; seed round in 2020, are also participating. Shipping behemoth Maersk, by way of its fund Maersk Growth, is also in the round as a strategic backer: Maersk will be working with 7bridges to integrate its logistics and shipping data into 7bridges to help Maersk customers manage their logistics more easily. Valuation is not being disclosed. 7 bridges has raised just over $20 million to date.</p>
<p>This Series A is coming after a strong couple of years of growth for 7bridges, which today provides tools to around 20 large multinational companies. As companies like Amazon have abundantly demonstrated, having a well-run logistics supply chain can be huge competitive edge. Philip Ashton, 7bridges&#8217; CEO who co-founded the company with Matei Beremski (CTO), said that this concept was already driving decent interest for 7bridges. Then Covid-19 happened.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic presented a moment of realization for those companies that still had their heads in the sand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Having an adaptive supply chain is a business-saving issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crux of the challenge (and opportunity) that 7bridges is addressing stems both from how supply chain business models have evolved over the years, and also world events. Supply chains and the movement of goods are two extremely fragmented spaces, made even more the case in the last couple of years. Covid-19 completely disrupted how many partners in a company&#8217;s supply chain operated (if they continued operating at all).</p>
<p>At the same time, Covid-19 led to massive surges in demand for many businesses &#8212; most obviously in areas like e-commerce but also any business that found itself getting squeezed as a result of disruptions elsewhere (eg a pharmaceutical company seeing more orders for drugs in part because others are making less, or just because people became more anxious for their health).</p>
<p>Typically a company might work with upwards of 30 different suppliers in the normal course of business, from those supplying components through to companies that might ship parts or all of your product around the world. Those partners typically will work within their own data silos, and some are far from embarking on their so-called &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; journeys. That is, there are a surprising number of companies in the wider world of business still using older, analogue, paper-based systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All the disruptions and older ways of doing things add up to huge inefficiencies. 7bridges cites data from McKinsey that estimates that 50% of logistics spend goes to waste, falling through the gaps in companies&#8217; models. At the same time, apparently there is an appetite to invest more to fix this: some 85% of supply chain executives said inefficiencies in their current systems were &#8220;a cause for concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of these factors were some of what contributed to Maersk investing. “The last two years have drawn supply chains directly into the commercial spotlight,&#8221; said Oliver Finch, investment partner at Maersk Growth, in a statement. &#8220;There is an urgent need to innovate in the sector and maintain access to goods we rely on. 7bridges have developed a novel technology solution to digitalise the design, management and optimization of supply chains. 7bridges will enable a wider range of businesses to better harness the power of data and AI to support commercial decision-making. We believe 7bridges has the potential to address a largely unmet market need and significantly improve companies’ supply chains.”</p>
<p>Indeed, with AI and automation making their way into every aspect of how business gets done nowadays, it was a no-brainer that a company would come along to build a platform to bring all of this together.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that others hadn&#8217;t tried before, but Beremski and Ashton said that a number of factors meant that efforts didn&#8217;t get off the ground: either the timing in the market wasn&#8217;t right (a critical mass would not come on board), or the technology still wasn&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies had a crack at this 15 or 20 years ago, but awareness and technology just didn&#8217;t match up,&#8221; Ashton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now there are more compute resources, and the level of machine learning, the maturity of the systems and reinforcement learning and mathematical optimization, have really only emerged in the last three or four years,&#8221; added Beremski. &#8220;Logistics is going through a digital transformation, which means that all the services within it are now available through APIs and are just more accessible.&#8221; All that makes building a system like 7bridges&#8217;, and getting customers on board, much more of a reality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also helped that there have been a wave of other tech startups emerging to tackle other aspects of the logistics equation, plotting a course for more evolution in the space. They&#8217;ve included the likes of Flexport, Zencargo; a massive wave of last-mile delivery startups; ERP companies like Xentral; and those focusing on digitizing and defragmenting manufacturing capacity such as Xometry. All of these have laid the groundwork for yet more companies to come along and tackle other aspects in the space.</p>
<p>“Almost every shipper is facing significant supply chain challenges from rising costs and a changing regulatory environment, and lack the tools and know-how to navigate them,&#8221; said Davor Hebel, managing partner and head of Eight Roads in Europe, in a statement. &#8220;7bridges is creating a new category of value optimization software for logistics which has historically only been a service available to the largest shippers from consultants. We are incredibly excited to partner with the 7bridges team as they look to scale the business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.exotec.com/en/home/">Exotec</a> has raised a $335 million Series D round in a new round of funding led by Goldman Sachs’ Growth Equity business. Following today’s investment, the company has reached a valuation of $2 billion.</p>
<p>Exotec sells a complete end-to-end solution to turn a regular warehouse into a partially automated logistics platform. It’s a hardware and software solution that replaces some human tasks.</p>
<p>83North and Dell Technologies Capital also participated in the funding round. Previous Exotec investors include Bpifrance, Iris Capital, 360 Capital Partners and Breega. Some of them, such as Breega, Bpifrance&#8217;s Large Venture fund and Iris Capital, invested once again.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258014" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The key component of the Exotec system is called the Skypods. These low-profile robots roam the floor autonomously. When they’re next to the right rack, they can go up the rack to pick up a bin and then go down with the right bin. This is particularly useful to increase the storage density of a warehouse as you can store products a few meters above ground.</p>
<p>The Skypod then caries the bin to a picking station so that human operators can pick up the right product in the bin. The robot can then go back to the racks and put back the bin on a shelf.</p>
<p>In that scenario, humans don’t have to roam the warehouse anymore. They can focus on picking, packing and making sure products go in and out of the warehouse. When it comes to adding new products, new shelves and new Skypods, Exotec tries to be as flexible as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to add new racks, you can expand your infrastructure without starting from scratch again. Similarly, Exotec lets you add more Skypods in the system. And when you receive a delivery of products, Exotec relies once again on its Skypods to store products in the fulfillment center.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>From Skypods to Skypickers</h2>
<p>With its standardized bin system, Exotec can store several products in a single bin. There might be 18 products in that bin but customers want one, two or three products in that bin — most likely they don&#8217;t want the entire bin. That’s why Exotec can’t simply empty small bins in a bigger bin to put together an order.</p>
<p>The startup has created new robots to remove humans from one more step of the ordering process. Exotec customers can now use Skypickers to automatically pick goods from an inventory bin and put them in a ready-to-ship bin.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbZhrjB3U0I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“Following the most significant supply chain disruptions of the modern era, there’s only room left for innovation,” co-founder and CEO Romain Moulin said in a statement. “While the entire logistics sector is fraught with uncertainty, one of the most prevalent challenges is ongoing labor shortages. Exotec pioneers a new path: elegant collaboration between human and robot workers that delivers warehouse productivity in a lasting, far more sustainable way.”</p>
<p>Exotec has always positioned its product as a service that can’t replace humans altogether. An Exotec warehouse is run by a combination of humans and robots. With the Skypickers though, the startup is positioning itself as a logistics advantage in a tight labor market.</p>
<p>Following today’s funding round, the startup plans to hire 500 engineers by 2025 and continue its push in North America. It has recently signed eight large customers in the region, such as Gap and Geodis. Decathlon is also using Exotec in its Montreal fulfillment center.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>Among many of the entrepreneur catchphrases out there, the one that annoys me the most is: “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” The phrase may be meant to make people with imposter syndrome remember the importance of a simple cold emails, but it often comes off as a rebranded way to remind people that exclusive networks rule the world.</p>
<p>Which is why I’m hoping that this is the year that a back channeling social media platform actually takes off. At its best, back channeling can help someone without a Stanford stamp of approval get vouched for, and subsequently bet on. The process can also help stop predatory investors from winning deals.The process’s impact is clear, but the incentives for all parties to participate are slightly misaligned. Some investors still scoff at the idea that their portfolio companies may be asked to review what it’s like to work with them; similarly, founders are surprised when stories, not Cultureamp surveys, are where honest feedback truly lives. Why? In a world where due diligence is evolving to be somewhat flippant in the early stage, back channeling is simultaneously going from a deep conversation about strengths and weaknesses to a thumbs up or thumbs down affair.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258167" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Plus, beyond the surface level banter, some of the most powerful people in tech today have their eggs in many, many baskets &#8211; meaning that those who want to or could speak critically of them can either be financially (or emotionally) restricted in saying this.</p>
<p>My pitch? We finally get a trustworthy platform in which back channeling can occur in an accessible and fair way. An anonymous, private subreddit for founders already exists in so many different forms, but I’d love to see an app that widens access so that anyone can vet a proposed value add.</p>
<p>For more of my take, check out this TechCrunch+ column that I did with my Equity co-hosts Alex Wilhelm and Mary Ann Azevedo:<b data-stringify-type="bold"> </b><b data-stringify-type="bold"><a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">3 views on how due diligence will change in 2022.</a></b><a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true"> </a>We also recorded a podcast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/would-you-marry-your-investors/">if you prefer the newsletter for your ears route</a>, instead.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about Wordle, future revenues as a business model and why I think Y Combinator is reading my text messages. As always, you can follow my thoughts on Twitter <a class="c-link" href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">@nmasc_</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>A word on Wordle</b></p>
<p>The creator behind the app on everyone&#8217;s mind, and not on anyone&#8217;s app store, chatted with TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/">about the underdog rise of Wordle. </a>The game, in which users guess a five-letter word in six tries, grew from fewer than 1,000 players to 2 million players in weeks.</p>

<p><b>Here’s what to know: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Owen Williams explains, Wordle’s nostalgic feel isn’t loved by all. The game is being </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/wordle-is-being-punished-by-app-stores-for-choosing-the-open-web/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">punished by app stores for choosing the open web</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here’s how he puts it in his latest column for TechCrunch:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wordle is facing a threat we haven’t seen play out yet: the game’s developer is essentially being punished by app stores for choosing to build using open web technologies, rather than a native app. Not only is this type of behavior allowed by the Apple App Store, there’s little recourse—because as far as Apple is concerned, Wordle doesn’t exist, given it wasn’t built a native app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There’s no way for a developer of a fully functional, capable web app like Wordle to claim their name in the App Store, nor is there a way for them to list their website to get users to the right place and defend themselves from copycats. Google actually does allow developers to upload some kinds of progressive web apps to the Play Store, though at time of writing Wardle doesn’t appear to have chosen to do this. If he wanted to defend his game on the Play Store when a clone does appear there, he’d at least have a choice to do so.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer love, a fickle thing:</span></p>

<p><b>And the startup of the week is…</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arc! The SaaS-friendly fintech platform emerged from stealth this week with $150 million in debt</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">financing and $11 million in seed funding with a Stripe partnership. As our own Mary Ann reports, “Arc is building what it describes as ‘a community of premium software companies’ that gives SaaS startups a way to borrow, save and spend all on a single tech platform.”</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s what to know</b><strong>: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/the-friends-with-benefits-of-the-financial-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we discussed in Equity this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Arc is one of those startups &#8212; similar to Brex &#8212; that couldn’t have existed 20, even 10, years ago. The company is entirely betting its own revenue on the future assumed revenue of other startups, which is a statement of the maturation of this once scrappy SaaS scene. </span></p>

<p><b>Is Y Combinator reading my texts?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, I wrote a newsletter on how accelerators need a refresh on what they consider a ‘value-add service.’ Then, days later, Y </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/startup-accelerators-definition-of-value-add-is-due-for-a-refresh/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combinator announced that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is increasing its check size, and ownership stake, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in its accelerator companies. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">My argument then, and now, is that accelerators will need to offer more than they ever have in the past to stay competitive; and YC’s new check shows they want to get more aggressive in the same swing. </span></p>
<p><b>Here’s what to know: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the somewhat expected change, it was controversial among seed-stage investors &#8211; who saw the move as more competitive than complementary to the broader early-stage ecosystem.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. App Annie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">says</a> global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year-over-year to reach $295 billion.</p>
<p>In addition, consumers are spending more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257967" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apps aren&#8217;t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue, App Annie<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/"> noted</a>. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p>Krafton, the developer behind PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds,&#8221; and the maker of PUBG Mobile, last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">No. 6 top-grossing</a> mobile game on a global basis, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/pubg-mobile-maker-krafton-sues-apple-google-and-rival-game-developer-garena-over-clones/">is suing the app stores and a rival game maker, Garena</a>, over copyright infringement involving Garena Online&#8217;s Free Fire games. The lawsuit alleges Garena&#8217;s games copy numerous aspects of its own, including its opening, its game structure and play, the combination and selection of weapons, armor and unique objects, locations and the overall color schemes, materials and textures. Google&#8217;s YouTube is also named in the lawsuit for hosting videos of the infringing material.</p>
<p>Garena has responded to the lawsuit saying, &#8220;Krafton&#8217;s claims are groundless.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit aims to prove that Garena&#8217;s games &#8212; Free Fire and Free Fire MAX &#8212; aren&#8217;t just another variation on the battle royale format, but are legally infringing on Krafton&#8217;s copyright. This could get complicated as PUBG Battlegrounds itself was built using a combination of in-house work and third-party store-bought assets, the company has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8qu07m/brendan_greene_wants_to_kill_me/e0ma17n/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in the past.</p>
<p>Krafton has often defended its gaming empire, having more recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-mobile-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-10-million-after-losing-lawsuit/1100-6499405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a lawsuit against cheaters.</a> PUBG also previously settled <a href="https://smcarthurlaw.com/pubg-netease-settle-battle-royale-copyright-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copyright claims with NetEase</a>, also over PUBG clones, but had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17509114/pubg-fortnite-lawsuit-copyright-dropped" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a similar suit</a> with Epic Games over Fortnite in 2018.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this case is that Krafton is looking to hold the app stores accountable for their roles, too. This comes at a time when Apple and Google&#8217;s power over their platforms is weakening under threat of regulation and, in some cases, new laws. There&#8217;s a very real question in the air right now about how the tech giants get to choose which apps appear on their stores, how those apps operate and how much money they deserve for hosting the apps. Krafton&#8217;s suit aims to make the app stores responsible for decisions that cut into its bottom line &#8212; like hosting rip-offs. But the company has to first prove that its popular game has, in fact, been cloned. And that&#8217;s for the court to decide.</p>
<h3>Apple will have to allow third-party payments in South Korea</h3>
<p><em>A big loss for Apple&#8230;or is it?</em> A decision by the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-to-allow-third-party-app-payment-options-in-south-korea/">will require Apple</a> to support third-party payment options in iOS apps for the first time in any market. But the change won&#8217;t necessarily mean developers get to keep all their in-app purchase revenue for themselves. When Google outlined its plans to comply with the new law in November, it said it would reduce the developer&#8217;s service fee by 4% if they were using an outside payment system. For example, a developer paying a 15% commission would now pay 11%. That&#8217;s better than it was before, but not what developers may want. The KCC said it will talk with Apple about its own compliance plans and iron out the details, including fee structures and when the plan will go into effect.</p>
<p>The law is an example of how well-intended legislation can go wrong as the platform makers can still argue they deserve a sizable commission for hosting the apps on their marketplaces, not just processing their payments.</p>
<p>A better way to open up to third-party payments is by getting a legislative body, regulator or court to rule that iOS apps can link to their own websites where users can pay for subscriptions, purchases and other services outside the App Store. This is effectively what Epic Games won the right to do in its lawsuit with Apple, but Apple appealed the decision and the required changes were put on hold.</p>
<h3>Fortnite returns to iOS&#8230;kind of!</h3>

<p>Epic Games has been engaged in a legal battle with Apple over its removal of Fortnite from the App Store and Epic&#8217;s allegations of Apple&#8217;s anti-competitive behavior. As a result of the ongoing litigation, Apple hasn&#8217;t allowed Fortnite to return to iOS &#8212; even if the company promised to &#8220;behave&#8221; and play by the current App Store rules. But now, it seems, Fortnite may have found a workaround. If the workaround actually works!</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/fortnite-ios-app-store-cloud-gaming/">has launched its game</a> on Nvidia&#8217;s game streaming service GeForce Now, which will allow mobile users on both iOS and Android to play a touch-control version via the web browser. The game, which is only in beta testing, for the time being, is different from the version that streams through GeForce Now to Android users. That <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881796/fortnite-ios-nvidia-geforce-now-game-streaming-epic-apple?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one is a streamed copy</a> of the desktop game, while the iOS version is optimized for mobile devices. Fortnite is accepting beta sign-ups with plans to open up to select members in January. If the company gets the game functional on iOS, it could make an interesting twist to Epic&#8217;s antitrust claims, as it would prove the App Store isn&#8217;t the only path for game makers to serve iOS users.</p>

<li><strong>Apple has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-paid-out-around-60-billion-to-app-store-developers-in-2021/">paid out $60 billion</a> to App Store developers in 2021,</strong> according to new data shared by the company. This refers to the amount of money developers have made on its platform, less the App Store fees. In previous years, it was easier to figure out how much Apple&#8217;s cut was, but now individual apps may pay different percentages if they&#8217;re subscription apps in year one or two, or a participant in a dedicated program that offers fee reduction, like those offered to news publishers or small businesses.</li>

On iPad, 57% of all new devices released in past four years run iPadOS 15.</li>

<li><strong>Apple wiped the Wordle clones from the App Store.</strong> Wordle, an indie word game app that runs on the web, has been having a moment. The app was originally built as a side project by Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, who loves word games. But Wordle has been growing in popularity, recently landing it a high-profile article <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by The New York Times</a>. (You can read TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/">founder interview here</a>.) That soon led to several developers looking to cash in on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/wordle-is-being-punished-by-app-stores-for-choosing-the-open-web/">the app&#8217;s lack of an App Store presence</a>. One even <a href="https://kotaku.com/tech-dude-rips-off-wordle-angers-internet-1848341422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on Twitter about how many downloads his iOS version was getting. In response, Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/apple-removes-wordle-apps-after-user-confusion-stokes-downloads?sref=gni836kR">began</a> pulling down the copycat apps from the App Store &#8212; an interesting decision given that Wordle itself appears to be inspired by an <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10368251/Wordle-bears-striking-resemblance-1980s-game-favourite-LINGO.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old TV game show</a>, and not an original idea.

<li><strong>Tumblr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/tumblr-sensitive-content-toggle-ios-app-store/">added a sensitive content toggle</a> on iOS to comply with the App Store guidelines.</strong> The company&#8217;s app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/">kept being rejected</a> by reviewers over the app&#8217;s content. The toggle opts users out of seeing sensitive content by default &#8212; which is mature content, but not the same as adult content (eg. sex and pornography).</li>

<li><strong>TikTok saw $2.3 billion in consumer spending in 2021, </strong>a figure that&#8217;s up 77% year-over-year, <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-2021-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> Sensor Tower. The app pulled in $824.4 million in Q4 2021 alone, more than double the same time a year ago. The U.S. is TikTok&#8217;s No. 2 revenue driver behind China.</li>

Signal had integrated with MobileCoin, boosting the adoption of the cryptocurrency.

The app allows studios to review their content on an Apple TV prior to publication.</li>
<li><strong>A music app called AmpMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/music-app-ampme-lowers-pricing-after-accused-of-being-an-app-store-scammer/">lowered its pricing</a> after a well-known critic called it out as a scammer.</strong> The app was offering an unseemly $10 per week subscription for the app that syncs music between devices and was earning between $13-15 million per year. But the app was also committing fraud as it was plagued by fake reviews that doled out five-star ratings and praise. After news articles were published, the app maker lowered the pricing to $5/week and blamed the fake reviews on &#8220;outside consultants.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/netflix-raised-its-prices-again/">hiked</a> its U.S. and Canadian prices by $1-$2.</strong> The standard plan in the U.S. now costs $15.49 up from $13.99 per month.</li>

<li><strong>A year-end report from Sensor Tower helps provide a look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/how-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-adapted-to-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-2021/">how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped the app economy</a> in 2021.</strong> Travel apps and transportation apps can still see growth ebb and flow amid COVID surges, but other app categories have either normalized or achieved their new normal. For instance, business app growth was still more than double pre-pandemic levels in 2021, and medical apps continue to see high usage.</li>
<li><strong>German police used a COVID contact-tracing app to track down witnesses to a potential crime,</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/13/german-covid-contact-tracing-app-luca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post reported.</a> The move is being criticized by privacy advocates who have argued that these systems could end up being used for non-public health purposes.

<h3>Travel &amp; Transportation</h3>

<li><strong>Uber is facing competition from the government&#8217;s own taxi app as it tries to make inroads in Brazil,</strong> according to a report <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/uber-brazil-government-taxi-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Rest of World</a>. Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s Taxi.Rio app has caught up to Uber&#8217;s technology and charges less, leading to users ditching Uber for taxis.</li>
<li><strong>Uber also quietly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877023/uber-apple-watch-app-discontinued" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped support for the Apple Watch</a>,</strong> as its watchOS app now directs users to switch to the app on their iPhone. The app likely didn&#8217;t have much adoption, as it&#8217;s easier to order an Uber from a bigger screen. Plus, an app can still send notifications to an Apple Watch even if it doesn&#8217;t offer a native Watch app.</li>

Take-Two says the merger will make it one of the largest gaming companies overall, as it will result in $6.1 billion in 12-month Pro-forma net bookings.

<p>A widget-maker called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1600525061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Locket</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/locket-an-app-for-sharing-photos-to-friends-homescreens-hits-the-top-of-the-app-store/">went viral for its clever app</a> that lets you share photos to your friends&#8217; homescreens. The app popped up to the top of the App Store charts in recent days, as users delighted in how it turned Apple’s widget system — typically used to showcase information like news, weather, inspirational quotes or photos from your own iPhone’s gallery — into a private social networking platform of sorts. Founder Matt Moss, a former WWDC student scholarship winner and recent UC Santa Barbara grad, said the idea for the app began as a side project he built for his girlfriend. But after friends said they also wanted in, he decided to publish it to the App Store.</p>
<p>The app launched on New Year’s Day and has now seen more than 2 million users sign up, according to Moss. On Sunday, Locket became the No. 1 app overall on the U.S. App Store, per <a href="https://apptopia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apptopia’s</a> app store data, and had become the No. 1 Social Networking app the day prior. Apptopia reports only seeing around 1 million global installs so far, however, with about 31% from the U.S., as of earlier this week.</p>

Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Welcome to the weekend! We made it. Barely, I think, given how tired everyone sounds on the phone and over on Twitter. But we beat the working days back all the same, which means we get to lean back and enjoy ourselves for a minute. Yes, we’re talking crypto today. Rejoice!</p>
<p><strong>The race to fund crypto’s future sure is expensive </strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258166" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I’m impressed with the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase-ventures/recent_investments">pace at which Coinbase has invested capital</a> into other companies in the larger blockchain market. It’s a smart move, as the public U.S. company can disburse comparatively small sums (when stacked next to its revenue base) and buy both ownership and information access in startups, providing it with early-warning data regarding what’s popping. Given that Coinbase is an obvious incumbent – and gatekeeper, to some degree – in the crypto market, its investments make sense.</p>
<p>But there’s investing, and there’s <em>investing</em>. And it appears that the newly announced FTX fund is something more aggressive than what Coinbase has managed, despite its pretty quick cadence of deals.</p>
<p>FTX’s fund crypto will total some $2 billion <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-ftx-sets-up-2-billion-venture-fund-11642163402?mod=djemalertNEWS">and, per interviews</a>, could be disbursed <em>just this year</em>. That’s a wild pace of investment, perhaps one reminiscent of <a href="https://www.axios.com/crypto-investor-katie-haun-leave-andreessen-horowitz-e11aa2f2-6ad9-4b27-abb4-b44e461174ec.html">how quickly a16z put its recent $2.2 billion crypto fund to work</a>.</p>
<p>A few questions:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ol>
<li>Why does the crypto market need this much money when its user base is pretty small compared to the larger Internet?</li>
<li>Why are we using so much fiat to finance crypto?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are interlinked questions. They sum to a simple confusion of mine regarding why it’s so hard to build things in the crypto market that are useful. Coinbase and FTX exist toward the edges of the crypto world, shuttling money back and forth from the traditional economy and what could be its future. That they are investing is smart, but the amount of money they are willing to invest, along with what traditional venture capitalists are also lobbing at blockchain startups, has me somewhat confused – what’s it all being spent on?</p>
<p>The two major blockchains are established, and hardly new (Ethereum was thought up in 2013 and launched in 2015; the Bitcoin whitepaper came out in <em>2008</em>); stablecoins exist and have a number of well, stable players; and a bunch of capital has gone to NFT marketplaces and a few crypto games. Some of which have even built modest player bases. But it feels a bit concentrated when we compare the amount of money flowing into the space to what we can see in terms of usable outcomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1w6r1v3pjg15s/Where-Did-VC-Money-Go-in-2021-Crypto-Startups">Institutional Investor reports</a> that $32.8 billion in total was invested into “crypto and blockchain technology businesses” last year. Perhaps a lot of stuff built by that money is coming out soon that will blow us away, but now well north of a decade after Bitcoin said, “Hello, world,” I still don’t use any blockchain-powered apps or services day to day. Unless I am tinkering with one part of the crypto world for research purposes, of course.</p>
<p>And I spend more time online than I want to admit! Perhaps the new FTX fund will bring the mass-market blockchain product to market that isn’t merely another vehicle for speculation. Let’s wait and see, I suppose.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">“Raising money is catastrophically challenging for female founders, and even harder for Black female founders.”</p>
<p>It’s a bold, even damning statement — one I made in a recent discussion speculating what’s to come in 2022 for women leading startups, like myself.</p>
<p>As one of a few Black female CEOs in the developer tools space, I’m often asked to comment on big, collective social issues centered in tech. It’s a lot to carry, but I realize the value to all of us in raising these issues, and my voice, when I can. Still, while I’d like to be able to offer decisive answers, I’ve got a lot of questions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Tech innovation &lt; social progress</h2>
<p>In the world of technology, we thirst to be a part of the next digital product that benefits from first-mover status and shapes what’s to come at an industry level. This is especially relevant in regard to seeking capital. And while we’ve witnessed some impressive transformations in the developer tools space, with VC-backed funding following suit, sometimes I worry we’re at risk of conflating technological growth for the social progress we really need. Women are still behind. Why?</p>
<p>There are some great female developer founders, like Nora Jones of Jeli, Window Snyder of Thistle Technologies, Edith Harbaugh of Launch Darkly, and Jean Yang of Akita Software, to name a few. There are also some amazing female angels and VCs. These are women I look to as leaders in the industry — those overcoming the barriers of either giving or seeking funding while remaining authentic to who they are.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Limited partners should back more female VCs, and funds should offer women the same graces and latitude that are given to men.							<cite>Shanea Leven</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Despite those of us trying to make a name for ourselves in dev tools, the reality is the dev tools space is led predominately by white men. For those of us who don’t meet those gender and racial criteria, simply thriving requires more attention to detail, energy and time than is often sustainable.</p>
<p>We need to level-set, acknowledging the current ways in which women must fight to thrive. We need to ask some tough questions.</p>
<h2>The fight to be taken seriously</h2>
<p>We want to be able to fundraise from other people that look like us, right? But many female investors are fighting just as hard to be taken seriously as the female founders they want to support. If we’re all facing the same social constraint — fighting to prove our legitimacy — we’re probably maintaining the same aversion to risk.</p>
<p>This creates an invalidating cycle in which female investors take fewer risks, particularly in regard to investing in female founders, and garner fewer funds than their male counterparts. How can we break this cycle?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Limited partners should back more female VCs, and funds should offer women the same graces and latitude that are given to men. Female VCs should be promoted to partnerships, where they will be able to write meaningful checks quickly.</p>
<p>I’ve personally witnessed the extraordinary results of empowered female angels and VCs connecting with others to support female founders; the community and sense of sisterhood they inspire have the potential to change the industry. This is what we need to latch on to and scale.</p>
<h2>The fight to overcome ingrained psychological barriers</h2>
<p>Today, there exists a widespread belief that women are less aggressive in the process of confirming a round, both as founders and VCs. As a female founder, I’ve been told male counterparts are capable of committing larger funds, faster — that women appear to be more risk-averse, often moving slower through the process and requesting less.</p>
<p>So, what’s causing the pause among women? It’s likely the most obvious answer: We are, in fact, facing a greater risk of rejection in the funding process. We also tend to have fewer connections into the VC community, where the “rules of VC” — what to do, say, and how to act — are often confusing and counterintuitive. Nothing like the clear guidelines on writing a good piece of code.</p>
<h2>The fight against the numbers</h2>
<p>Imagine you have 1,000 potential investors and only 10% of them focus on companies offering technologies like yours. Then, just 2% of them invest in companies at your stage and 5% of those share your same philosophies — and you’re only able to access yet another percentage of those. Now, imagine you’re stepping into those discussions with the understanding that we are ultimately people pitching to people, so you must “click” in an often all-too-brief interaction.</p>
<p>You’ll be committed in business to this investor for the next decade or more. So, while you’re attempting to navigate the numbers — the odds against you — you’re also trying to figure out a VC&#8217;s history, personality and perspectives. How have they been burned before? Can we be empathic to their businesses of the past and assure them our business is a worthy investment … all in 30 minutes or less?</p>
<h2>So, how can women successfully fight for funding?</h2>
<p>The simple answer: We cannot do it alone. Like most professional endeavors, seeking funding is ideally bolstered by a social network. While I wish I could say women intrinsically have everything they need to excel in the world of venture capital, I believe we require allies and support beyond basic networking and spanning gender and race.</p>
<p>We need everyone who has a stake in the game to join the fight for women, with focused attention on the challenges encountered by women of color. We must acknowledge the potential danger to female founders and investors in working from a survival mindset and provide them the coaching and guidance they need to step into funding discussions practiced, prepared and able to speak on behalf of a company with greater strength.</p>
<p>Said simply, we need to trust in the ability and potential of women on both ends of the deal, with no strings attached.</p>
<p>And so, my final question to founders and investors everywhere: Are you willing to join our fight?</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 14, 2022! I suppose that this has been the week of Wordle, in that everyone and their dog are tweeting their scores and results. A small bit of camaraderie for those of you out there who are not good at the game: I am also trash. And since I still get paid to write, I refuse to connect “Good at Wordle” with “Good at words!” – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p>P.S. Speaking of words, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/the-friends-with-benefits-of-the-financial-world/">the Equity team had a heck of a good time this week</a>, in case you wanted a chatty dive through recent startup happenings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/online-checkout-bolt-decacorn/">Bolt raises $355M as the online checkout war continues</a>: Bolt (not <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/bolt-raises-709m-at-an-8-4b-valuation-to-expand-its-transportation-and-food-delivery-super-app/">this Bolt</a></em>) has raised a huge new round of capital that pushes its valuation to $11 billion. Bolt provides an online checkout solution for other companies. It competes, variously, with Fast and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-40b-valuation/">Checkout.com, which just raised $1 billion at a $40 billion valuation</a>. You can argue that there is separation between the players in terms of where they sit in the world of online payments and checkout, but the overlap appears increasingly material between the competitors. (Just about one year ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/">we called the online check market a war</a>; the battle continues.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/jan-6-tech-subpoenas-insurrection/">Major tech companies subpoenaed by Congress</a>: As an investigation into the January 6 insurrection continues here in the U.S., major tech companies are being caught up in the hunt for answers. YouTube (Alphabet), Facebook and Instagram (Meta), Reddit, and Twitter appear to be in the line of fire.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/nft-volume-daos-and-the-curious-case-of-looksrare/">All that glitters is not legit trading volume</a>: As the market for non-fungible tokens – digital signatures on the blockchain that often point to assets stored on the traditional web, like images – heats up, we’re tracking the various exchanges where trading takes place. What we’ve most recently learned is that not all trading volume may be what it first appears.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/daasity-investing-15m-in-data-so-consumer-brands-can-do-more-with-it/">Daasity raises $15M to help companies leverage e-comm data</a>: Daasity is a startup that helps customers aggregate their information from various e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Shopify, etc.), “analyze it and push it to marketing channels to optimize customer experiences based on insights from a historical performance,” TechCrunch writes. The company’s new funding round was a Series A, led by VMG Catalyst.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/evage-raises-28m-to-be-a-driving-force-in-indias-commercial-ev-revolution/">Commercial EVs for the Indian market</a>: Amazon is working with a number of companies on EVs for its global delivery network, one of which is EVage. The Indian company just raised $28 million for an electric truck-van-box that I must admit is rather fetching – provided you are the sort of person who enjoys brutalist architecture.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/vangst-ropes-in-19-million-more-to-place-employees-with-work-in-the-growing-cannabis-industry/">The cannabis labor market is growing startups</a>: TechCrunch notes in this story that there are labor platforms being built to help particular industries hire. The healthcare market has a few, for example. And now the cannabis industry as well, thanks to Vangst, which just raised a $19 million Series B.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regulation is often decried as a hurdle to innovation in most parts of the developing world.</p>
<p>But in Brazil, the Central Bank is being hailed by investors and fintech founders alike as a tailwind for bringing banking to the masses.</p>
<p>“The open banking initiatives adopted by Brazil’s Central Bank are absolutely tailwinds for fintech innovation,” Costanoa Ventures’ Amy Cheetham told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an in-depth market analysis, Anna Heim explores Brazilian fintech’s growth in the wake of Brazil’s open banking initiatives and how insurtech is also poised to take advantage.</p>

<h2><strong>Big Tech Inc.</strong></h2>
<p>Today we have a grip of transit-themed Big Tech news, followed by, what else, some European legal news involving a major U.S. tech company!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/2021-robotaxi-china/">Self-driving taxis work to merge onto the fast lane in China</a>: Our own Rita Liao did everyone a favor by writing up a deep dive into the self-driving taxi market in China. As she writes, it does seem that every week “news arrives that another major player has gotten the green light to launch a new pilot program or a small-scale service” in the country. What do the individual news events add up to? Find out!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/j-b-hunt-will-be-waymos-first-self-driving-freight-customer/">And speaking of self-driving cars</a>: Waymo and J.B. Hunt, a trucking company, are turning their pilot into a long-term program. There is a shortage of truck drivers in the U.S., meaning that trucks that can get along without help could be a big deal in the nation.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/bentley-motors-blends-tech-and-coachbuilding-in-the-2022-continental-gt-speed/">Here’s a review of a car that no one at TechCrunch can afford</a>: Let me be clear, I want a Bentley Continental GT Speed. I would also settle for a standard Bentley Continental. The fact that Kirsten Korosec, our enterprising transportation editor, got to test one is jealousy-inspiring. On the factual front, if you have more than a quarter-million dollars laying around and need 12 cylinders, this is perhaps the car for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/uk-class-action-lodged-against-meta-seeks-3-1bn-for-breach-of-competition-law/">Meta faces class-action lawsuit in the U.K</a>.: A class-action lawsuit filed with the U.K.’s Competition Appeal Tribunal in London wants to dock the U.S. social networking giant some $3.1 billion for abuse of its in-market power in the U.K. Let’s see if this goes anywhere.</li>
