										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese robotaxi startup Pony.ai has been given permission by California regulators to pilot its autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver behind the wheel in three cities.</p>
<p>While dozens of companies &#8212; 55 in all &#8212; have active permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver, it&#8217;s far less common to receive permission for driverless vehicles. Pony is the eighth company to be issued a driverless testing permit in the state, a list that includes Chinese companies AutoX, Baidu and WeRide as well as U.S. businesses Cruise, Nuro, Waymo and Zoox. Only Nuro has been granted a so-called deployment permit, which allows it to operate commercially.</p>
<p>The permit issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates automated vehicle testing, expands upon Pony&#8217;s existing activity in the state. Pony.ai has been allowed to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers since 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Under the permit, Pony.ai will be able to test six autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets within Fremont, Milpitas and Irvine. There are constraints to the permit. The vehiclesÂ are designed to operate on roads with posted speed limits not exceeding 45 miles per hour in clear weather and light precipitation. Testing will initially occur in Fremont and Milpitas weekdays between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Companies that receive these driverless permits have to provide evidence of insurance or a bond equal to $5 million and follow several other rules, such as training remote operators on the technology. Driverless testing permit holders must also report to the DMV within 10 days any collisions involving a driverless test vehicle and submit an annual report of disengagements, according to the DMV.</p>

<p>Pony.ai, which was founded in 2016 by former Baidu developers James Peng and Lou Tiancheng, has landed a number of partners and investors in its relatively short existence. Last November, the company said its valuation had reached $5.3 billion following a fresh injection of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation/">$267 million in funding</a>. The company, which operates in China and California, has raised more than $1 billion since its founding, including $400 million from Toyota. Pony has several partnerships or collaborations with automakers and suppliers, including Bosch, Hyundai and Toyota.</p>
<p>Pony is building what it describes as an agnostic virtual driver for all sizes of vehicles, from small cars to large trucks, and to operate on both ridesharing and logistics (delivery) service networks. The company said back in 2019 that it was working with OEMs and suppliers to apply its automated technology to the long-haul trucking market. But it&#8217;s perhaps best known for its effort around robotaxis.</p>
<p>Pony has tested ridesharing in Fremont and Irvine, California and Guangzhou, China. In 2019, a fleet of electric, autonomous Hyundai Kona crossovers equipped with a self-driving system from Pony.ai and Via&#8217;s ride-hailing platform began shuttling customers on public roads. The robotaxi service, called BotRide, wasn&#8217;t a driverless service, as there was a human safety driver behind the wheel at all times. The BotRide pilot concluded in January 2020.</p>
<p>The company then started operating a public robotaxi service called PonyPilot in the Irvine area. Pony shifted that robotaxi service from shuttling people to packages as the COVID-19 pandemic swept through the world. In April, Pony.ai announced it had partnered with e-commerce platform Yamibuy to provide autonomous last-mile delivery service to customers in Irvine. The new delivery service was launched to provide additional capacity to address the surge of online orders triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, Pony.ai said at the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple CEO Tim Cook took his first turn in the witness chair this morning in what is probably the most anticipated testimony of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. But rather than a fiery condemnation of Epic&#8217;s shenanigans and allegations, Cook offered a mild, carefully tended ignorance that left many of the lawsuit&#8217;s key questions unanswered, or unanswerable.</p>
<p>This anticlimax may not make for exciting reporting, but it could serve to defang the dangerous, if somewhat dubious, argument that Apple&#8217;s App Store <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">amounts to a monopoly</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bqaPwIrd43"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/epic-cries-monopoly-as-apple-details-secret-project-liberty-effort-to-provoke-fortnite-ban/">Epic cries monopoly as Apple details secret &#8216;Project Liberty&#8217; effort to provoke &#8216;Fortnite&#8217; ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Epic cries monopoly as Apple details secret &#8216;Project Liberty&#8217; effort to provoke &#8216;Fortnite&#8217; ban&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/epic-cries-monopoly-as-apple-details-secret-project-liberty-effort-to-provoke-fortnite-ban/embed/#?secret=bqaPwIrd43" data-secret="bqaPwIrd43" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After being called by Apple&#8217;s own attorneys, Cook took the stand, Law360&#8217;s Dorothy Atkins, one of two media members allowed in the court, reported in her <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1395748658436444163">comprehensive live tweeting of the testimony</a>. The quotes from Cook are as reported and not to be considered verbatim; the court transcript will follow when the document is compiled and public. Incidentally, Atkins&#8217; stage-setting descriptions are appealing and humanizing, though Epic CEO Tim Sweeney comes off as a bit weird:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sweeney is sitting at Epic&#39;s counsel table looking down at his pen. His lawyer Gary Bornstein sporadically whispers in his ear. Cook seems relaxed, legs crossed. Just turned to someone sitting next took him, said something and then laughed.</p>
<p>&mdash; these trying times. (@doratki) <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1395755380693557248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The questioning of Cook by his own company&#8217;s counsel was gentle and directed at reiterating the reasons why Apple&#8217;s App Store is superior and sufficient for iOS users, while also asserting the presence of stiff competition. He admitted to a handful of conflicts with developers, such as differing priorities or needing to improve discovery, but said the company works constantly to retain developers and users.</p>
<p>The faÃ§ade of innocent ignorance began when he was asked about Apple&#8217;s R&amp;D numbers â $15-20 billion annually for the last three years. Specifically, he said that Apple couldn&#8217;t estimate how much of that money was directed toward the App Store, because &#8220;we don&#8217;t allocate like that,&#8221; i.e. research budgets for individual products aren&#8217;t broken out from the rest.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&#8217;t sound right, does it? A company like Apple knows down to the penny how much it spends on its products and research. Even if it can&#8217;t be perfectly broken down â an advance in MacOS code may play into a feature on the App Store â the company must know to some extent how its resources are being deployed and to what effect. The differences between a conservative and liberal estimation of the App Store&#8217;s R&amp;D allocation might be large, in the hundreds of millions perhaps, but make no mistake, those estimations are almost certainly being made internally. To do otherwise would be folly.</p>
<p>But because the numbers are not publicly declared and broken down, and because they are likely to be somewhat fuzzy, Cook can say truthfully that there&#8217;s no single number like (to invent an amount) &#8220;App Store R&amp;D was $500 million in 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not having a hard number removes a potential foothold for Epic, which could use it either way: If it&#8217;s big, they&#8217;re protecting their golden goose (enforcing market power). If it&#8217;s small, they&#8217;re just collecting the eggs (collecting rent via market power). Apple&#8217;s only winning move is not to play, so Cook plays dumb and consequently Epic&#8217;s argument looks like speculation (and, as Apple would argue, fabulation).</p>
<p>He then deployed a similar strategy of starving the competition with a preemptive shrug about profits. He only addressed total net sales, which were about $275 billion at a 21% profit margin, saying Apple does not evaluate the App Store&#8217;s income as a standalone business.</p>
<p>Certainly it is arguable that the App Store is very much a tightly integrated component of a larger business structure. But the idea that it cannot be assessed as a standalone business is ludicrous. It is again nearly certain that it, like all of Apple&#8217;s divisions and product lines, is dissected and reported internally in excruciating detail. But again it is just plausible that for legal purposes it is not straightforward enough to say &#8220;the income and profits of the App Store are such and such,&#8221; thus denying Epic its datum.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3Um55RqSgP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/apple-app-store-customers-spent-1-8b-over-the-week-of-christmas-set-a-spending-record-on-new-years-day/">Apple App Store customers spent $1.8B over the week of Christmas, set a spending record on New Year&#8217;s Day</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple App Store customers spent $1.8B over the week of Christmas, set a spending record on New Year&#8217;s Day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/apple-app-store-customers-spent-1-8b-over-the-week-of-christmas-set-a-spending-record-on-new-years-day/embed/#?secret=3Um55RqSgP" data-secret="3Um55RqSgP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However, the point is important enough that Epic thought it warranted independent investigation. And among the first things Epic&#8217;s attorney brought up, when the witness was turned over to him, was the testimony from earlier in the trial by an expert witness that Apple&#8217;s App Store operating margins were around 79%.</p>
<p>It was not in Apple&#8217;s interest to confirm or deny these numbers, and Cook again pleaded ignorance. The mask slipped a tiny bit, however, when Epic&#8217;s attorney asked Cook to break down the confidential income numbers that combined the Mac and iOS App Stores. While Apple objected to this, saying it was privileged information and could only be divulged in a closed court, Cook offered that the iOS numbers are &#8220;a lot larger&#8221; than the Mac numbers.</p>
<p>What we see here is another piece of financial sleight-of-hand. By mixing the iOS and Mac income Apple gets to muddy the waters of how much money is made and spent in and on them. Epic&#8217;s attempt to unmix them was not successful, but the judge is no fool â she sees the same things Epic does, but just as dimly. Apple is attempting to deny Epic a legal victory even at the cost of looking rather shadowy and manipulative.</p>
<p>This was further demonstrated when Cook was asked about Apple&#8217;s deal with Google that keeps the search engine as the default on iOS. Cook said he didn&#8217;t remember the specific numbers.</p>
<p>If the CEO of one of the biggest tech companies in the world told you they forgot the specifics of a multibillion-dollar, decade-long deal with one of the other biggest tech companies in the world, would you believe them?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u5p0QyLkTn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/onering/">Apple search crawler activity could signal a Google competitor, or a bid to make Siri a one-stop shop</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple search crawler activity could signal a Google competitor, or a bid to make Siri a one-stop shop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/onering/embed/#?secret=u5p0QyLkTn" data-secret="u5p0QyLkTn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Little of the remaining testimony shed light on anything. Cook discussed the complexities of operating in places like China where local laws have technical and policy repercussions, and minimized the assertion that Apple had expanded the scope of in-app purchases and from which transactions the company gets a 30% cut. A bit more testimony will take place in a closed court, but we likely won&#8217;t hear about it as it will concern confidential information.</p>
<p>The trial, which is winding down, has held few surprises; both sides laid out their arguments at the start, and much of this will come down to the judge&#8217;s interpretation of the facts. There were no dramatic surprise witnesses or smoking guns â it&#8217;s simply a novel argument about what constitutes monopolistic behavior. Apple is adamant that competition is present and fierce in Android, and that in the gaming world it competes with Windows and consoles as well.</p>
<p>It seems almost inevitable that whatever the judgment is, the case will be appealed and brought to a higher court, but that judgment will also be a strong indicator of how well Epic&#8217;s arguments (and Apple&#8217;s obfuscations) have been received. That said, Epic and other critics of Apple&#8217;s App Store fees, which are immensely profitable however the company chooses to obscure it, have arguably already accomplished their goals. Apple&#8217;s lowered 15% fee for the first million dollars is plainly a response to developer unrest and bad press, and now it is put in the position of defending how the sausage gets made.</p>
<p>Tarnishing Apple&#8217;s anodized aluminum tower was always at least partly the intent, and win or lose Epic may feel it has gotten its money&#8217;s worth. Besides, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">the rematch in Europe</a> is yet to come.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We have a monthly company book club at our company. Itâs in the evening and our whole team attends (yes, weâre really into book clubs), so it made sense that a few minutes before our book club on the evening of April 20, a team member let us all know that heâd be missing it.</p>
<p>He lives in Minnesota, the verdict for the trial of Derek Chauvin was about to be announced, and the atmosphere was tense. He wasnât able to focus and was giving the rest of the team a heads up on Slack that heâd be absent. There were a few thumbs up emojis and then we started the book club.</p>
<p>A few days later, I was talking with our executive team and several of them mentioned that people on their teams had brought up the book club situation. Something felt off about it. Should we have canceled it? Reminded everyone that they were free to take personal time for whatever reason? No one had the right answer, but it felt like an opportunity to reflect and arrive at a more thoughtful approach, which is especially important as our team rapidly grows and we continue to be remote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This past year, weâve had so many moments when a massively important event is happening as we work, entering our collective conscience and forcing us to acknowledge that the boundary between work and life is thin and porous. Companies are grappling with how, or whether, to talk about these events with their teams.</p>
<p>Most companies have taken the view that to develop an inclusive company, there has to be space for whatâs happening in the world. A few have gone in the opposite direction, saying companies should exist separate and apart from âpolitics,â which is an admittedly fuzzy term.</p>
<p>Iâm familiar with the âshut up do your jobâ mentality because I spent years in the Army. About a political issue, for example, salty soldiers would say things like, âIf the Army wanted you to have an opinion, they would have issued one to you.â (Side note: There were still plenty of opinions.)</p>
<p>But thatâs not how I think about company-building. I believe that our âwork selvesâ and whatâs going on in the world are inextricably connected. And while I donât know exactly how to navigate the choppy waters, this recent experience helped my team crystallize a few lessons.</p>
<h2>Make space for when &#8220;politics&#8221; impacts your team</h2>
<p>Months ago, I was listening to âThe Dailyâ while getting ready for work. The episode was about the murder of Vanessa Guillen, an Army soldier who had been the victim of sexual harassment while in uniform. It was heartbreaking to hear her mother talk about how the Army had failed Vanessa. I cried. My own experiences in uniform came flooding back and I needed to take time that morning to think and write. I moved around some things on my schedule and didnât start the workday until I was ready.</p>

	</p>
<p>I needed time that morning. I do not think itâs the role of a company to dictate what is and is not an acceptable reason to need personal time. Instead, a company should hire smart, motivated people and give them a framework to help them make the right decisions.</p>
<p>Our working framework (and I say âworkingâ because culture building, for us, is a work in progress) is borrowed heavily from Netflix: It&#8217;s the dual concepts of freedom and responsibility. Ethena employees have the freedom to take time off for whatever reason and they donât need to give a justification to managers. They also have the responsibility to do their jobs well. If theyâll be missing a meeting, they need to ensure there is coverage, for example.</p>
<h2>Listen when colleagues tell you somethingâs wrong</h2>
<p>While the founder mythology is strong, CTO Anne Solmssen and I donât subscribe to it. We believe that two things can be true: We are smart, driven and resourceful founders and we are better with our team. We hire the smartest people we can find precisely because we want them to make our company better.</p>
<p>We have weekly feedback meetings between direct reports and the feedback is always bilateral, meaning managers get feedback from their direct reports. Feedback Fridays are where issues tend to surface first. Iâm so glad there are pressure release valves for feedback, especially with a remote team, because otherwise I sit in a bubble thinking everything is fine, when it isn&#8217;t. Iâm also glad we built feedback early into our culture because itâs incredibly hard to bolt it on later.</p>
<p>An important but often neglected part of listening to employee feedback is being honest about how decisions get made. For example, my co-founder and I want to hear dissent and criticism because it makes us better. But listening intently is different than being a direct democracy. As the CEO, I make decisions; I just want them to be as informed and inclusive as possible.</p>
<h2>Invest early in people ops</h2>
<p>We didnât have a proactive approach to attendance at our recent company book club in part because we donât yet have a people operations leader. Our team is about 20 employees and rapidly growing. Weâve prioritized a people ops hire because itâs a crucial function and if we donât invest in it early, weâll continue to have issues fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Yes, co-founders should be personally invested in company culture, but people ops is a craft and requires expertise. Experienced people ops leaders have lots of practice navigating complex issues. (Side note: Weâre <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/ethena">hiring</a> for many roles, including people ops. If youâd like to be part of a company that intentionally invests in company culture, come work with us.)</p>
<p>I want to build a highly functional team where everyone can bring themselves to work and excuse themselves when they need a minute. Iâm undeniably making mistakes along the way, but the best way to learn about where we stumble is to let our smart and capable team tell us, listen when they do and be intentional in building our company culture.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2016, more than 20 years after Amazonâs founding and 10 years since Shopify launched, it would have been easy to assume e-commerce penetration (the percentage of total retail spend where the goods were bought and sold online) would be over 50%.</p>
<p>But what we found was shocking: The U.S. was only approximately 8% penetrated &#8212; only 8% for arguably the most advanced economy in the world!</p>
<p>Weâve had a close eye on the rate of e-commerce penetration globally ever since. Despite e-commerce growth skyrocketing over the past year, the reality is the U.S. has still only reached an e-commerce penetration rate of around 17%. During the last 18 months, weâve closed the gap to South Korea and Chinaâs e-commerce penetration of more than 25%, but there is still much progress to be made.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155862" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155862" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2155862 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="897" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=1536,861 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155862" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Accel</p></div></p>
<p>Itâs clear that we are still in the early days of this megatrend and it is our strong conviction that it is inevitable that we will get to a point where at least half of every retail dollar is spent online over the next decade.</p>
<p>Below are five key predictions for what this road to further penetration will hold.</p>
<h2>D2C retail will accelerate as merchants seek independence</h2>
<p>Marketplaces have forged the path for e-commerce adoption among merchants of all sizes. They have raised significant capital and made the necessary investments in payments and logistics infrastructure, often subsidizing the consumer experience with free shipping or discounts to get them comfortable buying online.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The balance of power has shifted toward merchants, who previously didnât have the picks and shovels to build their own e-commerce capabilities.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In recent years, merchants have pursued options aside from these marketplace aggregators. They have sought independence, opting to pay 5%-10% of their gross merchandise value (GMV) on their own technology infrastructure rather than paying the <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200336920">6% to 45% (average of about 15%) in marketplace fees</a>. Most importantly, they have prioritized owning the relationship with their end customers, given that customer loyalty and lifetime value is becoming ever more important in a hypercompetitive online market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itâs hard enough to talk about your feelings to a person; Jo Aggarwal, the founder and CEO of Wysa, is hoping youâll find it easier to confide in a robot. Or, put more specifically, âemotionally intelligentâ artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa is an AI-powered mental health app designed by Touchkin eServices, Aggarwalâs company that currently maintains headquarters in Bangalore, Boston and London. Wysa is something like a chatbot that can respond with words of affirmation, or guide a user through one of 150 different therapeutic techniques.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa is Aggarwalâs second venture. The first was an elder care company that failed to find market fit, she says. Aggarwal found herself falling into a deep depression, from which, she says, the idea of Wysa was born in 2016.Â </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Wysa became one of 17 apps in the </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/assistant-investments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Assistant Investment Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in May, closed a </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wysas-ai-guided-mental-health-140000132.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding round of $5.5 million led by Bostonâs W Health Ventures, the Google Assistant Investment Program, pi Ventures and Kae Capital.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa has raised a total of $9 million in funding, says Aggarwal, and the company has 60 full-time employees and about three million users.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate goal, she says, is not to diagnose mental health conditions. Wysa is largely aimed at people who just want to vent. Most Wysa users are there to improve their sleep, anxiety or relationships, she says.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOut of the 3 million people that use Wysa, we find that only about 10% actually need a medical diagnosis,â says Aggarwal. If a userâs conversations with Wysa equate with high scores on traditional depression questionnaires like the </span><a href="https://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9#:~:text=Depression%20Severity%3A%200%2D4%20none,of%2088%25%20for%20major%20depression."><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHQ-9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the anxiety disorder questionnaire </span><a href="https://adaa.org/sites/default/files/GAD-7_Anxiety-updated_0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GAD-7</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wysa will suggest talking to a human therapist.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, you donât need to have a clinical mental health diagnosis to benefit from therapy.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa isnât intended to be a replacement, says Aggarwal (whether users view it as a replacement remains to be seen), but an additional tool that a user can interact with on a daily basis.Â </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âSixty percent of the people who come and talk to Wysa need to feel heard and validated, but if theyâre given techniques of self help, they can actually work on it themselves and feel better,â Aggarwal continues.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysaâs approach has been refined through conversations with users and through input from therapists, says Aggarwal.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, while having a conversation with a user, Wysa will first categorize their statements and then assign a type of therapy, like cognitive behavioral therapy or acceptance and commitment therapy, based on those responses. It would then select a line of questioning or therapeutic technique written ahead of time by a therapist and begin to converse with the user.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa, says Aggarwal, has been gleaning its own insights from more than 100 million conversations that have unfolded this way.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âTake for instance a situation where you&#8217;re angry at somebody else. Originally our therapists would come up with a technique called the empty chair technique where youâre trying to look at it from the other personâs perspective. We found that when a person felt powerless or there were trust issues, like teens and parents, the techniques the therapists were giving werenât actually working,â she says.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThere are 10,000 people facing trust issues who are actually refusing to do the empty chair exercise. So we have to find another way of helping them. These insights have built Wysa.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Wysa has been refined in the field, research institutions have played a role in Wysaâs ongoing development. Pediatricians at the University of Cincinnati helped </span><a href="https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/n20935374/uc-cincinnati-childrens-team-up-to-create-app-to-combat-covid-19-anxiety.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop a module</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically targeted toward COVID-19 anxiety. There are also ongoing studies of Wysaâs ability to help people cope with mental health consequences from chronic pain, arthritis and diabetes at The Washington University in St. Louis and The University of New Brunswick.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Wysa has had several tests in the real world. In 2020, the </span><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/community/new-emotionally-intelligent-chatbot-to-help-singaporeans-stressed-by-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">government of Singapore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> licensed Wysa, and provided the service for free to help cope with the emotional fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Wysa is also offered through the health insurance company Aetna </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a <a href="https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/b2b-partnerships/aetna-international-announces-mental-health-partnership-with-wysa">supplement</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Aetnaâs Employee Assistance Program.Â </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 strategies for building a digital health unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/4-strategies-for-building-a-digital-health-unicorn/embed/#?secret=BYz25rqler" data-secret="BYz25rqler" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest concern about mental health apps, naturally, is that they might accidentally trigger an incident, or mistake signs of self harm. To address this, the U.K.âs National Health Service (NHS) offers specific compliance standards. Wysa is compliant with the NHSâ </span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0129-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-manufacture-of-health-it-systems"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DCB0129 standard for clinical safety,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the </span><a href="https://demoday.hartfordinsurtechhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Wysa-HIH-2020-One-Pager.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first AI-based mental health app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to earn the distinction.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet those guidelines, Wysa appointed a clinical safety officer, and was required to create âescalation pathsâ for people who show signs of self harm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa, says Aggarwal, is also designed to flag responses to self-harm, abuse, suicidal thoughts or trauma. If a userâs responses fall into those categories Wysa will prompt the user to call a crisis line. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., the Wysa app that anyone can download, says Aggarwal, fits the </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136939/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDAâs definition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a general wellness app or a âlow risk device.â Thatâs relevant because, during the pandemic, the FDA has </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136939/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created guidance to accelerate distribution of</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these apps.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Wysa may not perfectly categorize each personâs response. A </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46507900"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, noted that the app didnât appear to appreciate the severity of a proposed underage sexual encounter. Wysa responded by updating the app to handle more instances of coercive sex.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggarwal also notes that Wysa contains a manual list of sentences, often containing slang, that they know the AI wonât catch or accurately categorize as harmful on its own. Those are manually updated to ensure that Wysa responds appropriately. âOur rule is that [the response] can be 80%, appropriate, but 0% triggering,â she says.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the immediate future, Aggarwal says the goal is to become a full-stack service. Rather than having to refer patients who do receive a diagnosis to Employee Assistant Programs (as the Aetna partnership might) or outside therapists, Wysa aims to build out its own network of mental health suppliers.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the tech side theyâre planning expansion into Spanish, and will start investigating a voice-based system based on guidance from the Google Assistant Investment Fund.Â </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The relationship between Spotify and Apple has beenâ¦understandably contentious at times. After all, Apple runs the streaming serviceâs biggest competitor. At the end of the day though, the Apple Watch and Spotify maintain the No. 1 spot in their respective categories by a wide margin. And playing nice ultimately benefits a wide swath of users in that overlapping Venn diagram.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-21/enjoy-more-ways-than-ever-to-use-spotify-on-your-apple-watch-now-with-downloads/">Spotify announced</a> that itâs finally bringing to the smartwatch whatâs no doubt been one of its most requested features. Starting today, Premium subscribers can download music and podcasts to the wearable for offline listening. That means users will be able to leave their phone at home when they go for a jog.</p>
<p>The new feature works more or less like standard downloading and sharing. Users click the three ellipses next to an album, playlist or podcast and click âDownload to Apple Watch.â Once downloaded, green arrows will populate next to the title. With headphones paired, youâll be able to stream directly from the watch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung has already offered the feature on some of the competition, including Samsungâs Galaxy Watch line. The service is also coming to Google Wear OS watches soon, per an announcement at I/O. Apple Music, of course, has offered offline listening on the Watch for a while, as has Pandora. Deezer also beat Spotify to the popular wearable by a matter of days.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This morning, we're looking at the Jam City deal to merge with DPCM Capital. Jam City is a bit like Zynga, but unless you are a mobile-gaming aficionado, you might not have heard of it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While it would be nice to write about something other than yet another tech company looking to list via a SPAC, the deals keep dropping, so our more traditional fare of covering startup trends will remain on hold for at least one day more.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re looking at the <a href="https://assets.jamcity.com/20210520025438/JAM-CITY-SPAC-RELEASE_FINAL_APPROVED.pdf">Jam City deal to merge with DPCM Capital</a>. Jam City is a bit like Zynga, but unless you are a mobile-gaming aficionado, you might not have heard of it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.Â  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>You likely have not heard of DPCM Capital, either, but you know more about it than you&#8217;d think.</p>
<p>As Jam City notes in a release, the SPAC is &#8220;led by Emil Michael.&#8221; Michael is most famous for his time at Uber, where he served as chief business officer. He left the firm, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/technology/uber-travis-kalanick-emil-michael.html">The New York Times wrote in 2014</a>, after a board-called &#8220;investigation into [the company&#8217;s] culture and business practices&#8221; led to a &#8220;recommendation for Mr. Michael to exit Uber.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s the gentleman who floated the idea of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists#.pyxybkpAy">funding a team to &#8220;dig up dirt&#8221; on Uber&#8217;s &#8220;critics in the media,&#8221;</a> as BuzzFeed News reported in late 2014.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995213" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Regardless, we&#8217;re not here to go back through Uber and its various cultural messes. We&#8217;re here to dig into the <a href="https://jamcity.com/wp-content/uploads/Jam-City-Investor-Presentation-210519.pdf">Jam City SPAC deck</a> to see if the company is similar to Zynga. Why do we want to know that? Because Zynga has done great in recent quarters, including posting<a href="https://investor.zynga.com/static-files/7003004d-9d35-4aba-af6e-ce812cb84d5d">Â record revenue and bookings</a> in the first three months of 2021.</p>
<p>With lots of folks stuck at home in the last year, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990#:~:text=Global%20videogame%20revenue%20is%20expected,North%20American%20sports%20industries%20combined.">gaming has done well in aggregate</a>. And mobile gaming is a huge chunk of the larger gaming world.</p>
<p>More broadly, why do we care about Jam City&#8217;s SPAC transaction? Because the mobile gaming concern has raised more than $300 million, including a $145 million round in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/consolidation-is-coming-to-gaming-and-jam-city-raises-145-million-to-capitalize-on-it/">that TechCrunch covered here</a>.</p>
<p>The company attracted capital from Austin Ventures, Netmarble, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan Chase while private, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jam-city/company_financials">per Crunchbase</a>, so we&#8217;re very curious if Jam City has enjoyed a Zynga-like last few years and how it&#8217;s being valued as part of the SPAC deal. Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Jam City&#8217;s SPAC transaction</h2>
<p>When Jam City raised that huge 2019 round, co-founder and CEO Chris DeWolfe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/consolidation-is-coming-to-gaming-and-jam-city-raises-145-million-to-capitalize-on-it/">said that the</a> &#8220;global mobile games market [is] consolidating.&#8221; At the time, the company intended to use some of its new funding to acquire other mobile gaming companies.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers are facing further pressure to step in and do something about lackadaisical enforcement of the bloc&#8217;s flagship data protection regime after the European Parliament voted yesterday to back a call urging the Commission to start an infringement proceeding against Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) for not &#8220;properly enforcing&#8221; the regulation.</p>
<p>The Commission and the DPC have been contacted for comment on the parliament&#8217;s call.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">Last summer</a> the Commission&#8217;s own two-year review of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) highlighted a lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement &#8212; but commissioners were keener to point out the positives, lauding the regulation as a &#8220;global reference point&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s now nearly three years since the regulation begun being applied and criticism over weak enforcement is getting harder for the EU&#8217;s executive to ignore.</p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0256_EN.pdf">resolution</a> &#8212; which, while non-legally binding, fires a strong political message across the Commission&#8217;s bow &#8212; singles out the DPC for specific criticism given its outsized role in enforcement of the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It&#8217;s the lead supervisory authority for complaints brought against the many big tech companies which choose to site their regional headquarters in the country (on account of its corporate-friendly tax system).</span></p>
<p>The text of the resolution expresses &#8220;deep concern&#8221; over the DPC&#8217;s failure to reach a decision on a number of complaints against breaches of the GDPR filed the day it came into application, on May 25, 2018 &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">against Facebook and Google</a> &#8212; and criticises the Irish data watchdog for interpreting &#8220;without delay&#8221; in Article 60(3) of the GDPR &#8220;contrary to the legislatorsâ intention â as longer than a matter of months&#8221;, as they put it.</p>
<p>To date the DPC has only reached a final decision on one cross-border GDPR case &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">against Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The parliament also says it&#8217;s &#8220;concerned about the lack of tech specialists working for the DPC and their use of outdated systems&#8221; (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/brave-accuses-european-governments-of-gdpr-resourcing-failure/">Brave also flagged last year</a>) &#8212; as well as criticizing the watchdog&#8217;s handling of a complaint originally brought by privacy campaigner Max Schrems years before the GDPR came into application, which relates to the clash between EU privacy rights and U.S. surveillance laws, and which still hasn&#8217;t resulted in a decision.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s approach to handling Schrems&#8217; 2013 complaint led to a 2018 referral to the CJEU &#8212; which in turn led to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">landmark Schrems II judgement last summer</a> invalidating the flagship EU-U.S. data transfer arrangement, Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>That ruling did not outlaw alternative data transfer mechanisms but made it clear that EU DPAs have an obligation to step in and suspend data transfers if Europeans&#8217; information is being taken to a third country that does not have essentially equivalent protections to those they have under EU law &#8212; thereby putting the ball back in the DPC&#8217;s court on the Schrems complaint.</p>
<p>The Irish regulator then sent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">a preliminary order to Facebook to suspend its data transfers</a> and the tech giant responded by filing for a judicial review of the DPC&#8217;s processes. However, the Irish High Court rejected Facebook&#8217;s petition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/">last week</a>. And a stay on the DPC&#8217;s investigation was lifted yesterday &#8212; so the DPC&#8217;s process of reaching a decision on the Facebook data flows complaint has started moving again.</p>
<p>A final decision could still take several months more, though &#8212; as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">we&#8217;ve reported before</a> &#8212; as the DPC&#8217;s draft decision will also need to be put to the other EU DPAs for review and the chance to object.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers face their final countdown&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/embed/#?secret=L4DBdUgUEl" data-secret="L4DBdUgUEl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s resolution states that it &#8220;is worried that supervisory authorities have not taken proactive steps under Article 61 and 66 of the GDPR to force the DPC to comply with its obligations under the GDPR&#8221;, and &#8212; in more general remarks on the enforcement of GDPR around international data transfers &#8212; it states that it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is concerned about the insufficient level of enforcement of the GDPR, particularly in the area of international transfers; expresses concerns at the lack of prioritisation and overall scrutiny by national supervisory authorities with regard to personal data transfers to third countries, despite the significant CJEU case law developments over the past five years; deplores the absence of meaningful decisions and corrective measures in this regard, and urges the EDPB [European Data Protection Board] and national supervisory authorities to include personal data transfers as part of their audit, compliance and enforcement strategies; points out that harmonised binding administrative procedures on the representation of data subjects and admissibility are needed to provide legal certainty and deal with crossborder complaints;</p></blockquote>
<p>The knotty, multi-year saga of Schrems&#8217; Facebook data-flows complaint, as played out via the procedural twists of the DPC and Facebook&#8217;s lawyers&#8217; delaying tactics, illustrates the multi-layered legal, political and commercial complexities bound up with data flows out of the EU (post-Snowden&#8217;s 2013 revelations of U.S. mass surveillance programs) &#8212; not to mention the staggering challenge for EU data subjects to actually exercise the rights they have on paper. But these intersecting issues around international data flows do seem to be finally coming to a head, in the wake of the Schrems II CJEU ruling.</p>
<p>The clock is now ticking for the issuing of major data suspension orders by EU data protection agencies, with Facebook&#8217;s business first in the firing line.</p>
<p>Other U.S.-based services that are &#8212; similarly &#8212; subject to the U.S.&#8217; FISA regime (and also move EU users data over the pond for processing; and whose businesses are such they cannot shield user data via &#8220;zero access&#8221; encryption architecture) are equally at risk of receiving an order to shut down their EU-U.S. data-pipes. Or else having to shift data processing for these users inside the EU.</p>
<p>U.S.-based services aren&#8217;t the only ones facing increasing legal uncertainty, either.</p>
<p>The U.K., post-Brexit, is also classed as a third country (in EU law terms). And in a separate <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0262_EN.html">resolution</a> today the parliament adopted a text on the U.K. adequacy agreement, granted earlier this year by the Commission, which raises objections to the arrangement &#8212; including by flagging a lack of GDPR enforcement in the U.K. as problematic.</p>
<p>On that front the parliament highlights how adtech complaints filed with the ICO have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">failed to yield a decision</a>. (It writes that it&#8217;s concerned &#8220;non-enforcement is a structural problem&#8221; in the U.K. &#8212; which it suggests has left &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a large number of data protection law breaches&#8230; [un]remedied&#8221;.)</span></p>
<p>It also calls out the U.K.&#8217;s surveillance regime, questioning its compatibility with the CJEU&#8217;s requirements for essential equivalence &#8212; while also raising concerns about the risk that the U.K. could undermine protections on EU citizens data via onward transfers to jurisdictions the EU does not have an adequacy agreement with, among other objections.</p>
<p>The Commission put a four-year lifespan on the U.K.&#8217;s adequacy deal &#8212; meaning there will be another major review ahead of any continuation of the arrangement in 2025.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a far cry from the &#8220;hands-off&#8221; 15 years the EU-U.S. &#8220;Safe Harbor&#8221; agreement stood for, before a Schrems challenge finally led to the CJEU striking it down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">back in 2015</a>. So the takeaway here is that data deals that allow for people&#8217;s information to leave Europe aren&#8217;t going to be allowed to stand unchecked for years; close scrutiny and legal accountability are now firmly up front &#8212; and will remain in the frame going forward.</p>
<p>The global nature of the internet and the ease with which data can digitally flow across borders of course brings huge benefits for businesses &#8212; but the resulting interplay between different legal regimes is leading to increasing levels of legal uncertainty for companies seeking to take people&#8217;s data across borders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/embed/#?secret=ogSWOIcPDk" data-secret="ogSWOIcPDk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the EU&#8217;s case, the issue is that data protection is regulated within the bloc and these laws require that protection stays with people&#8217;s information, no matter where it goes. So if the data flows to countries that do not offer the same safeguards &#8212; be that the U.S. or indeed China or India (or even the U.K.) &#8212; then that risk is that it can&#8217;t, legally, be taken there.</p>
<p>How to resolve this clash, between data protection laws based on individual privacy rights and data access mandates driven by national security priorities, has no easy answers.</p>
<p>For the U.S., and for the transatlantic data flows between the EU and the U.S., the Commission has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">warned there will be no quick fix</a> this time &#8212; as happened when it slapped a sticking plaster atop the invalidated Safe Harbor, hailing a new &#8220;Privacy Shield&#8221; regime; only for the CJEU to blast that out of the water for much the same reasons a few years later. (The parliament resolution is particularly withering in its assessment of the Commission&#8217;s historic missteps there.)</p>
<p>For a fix to stick, major reform of U.S. surveillance law is going to be needed. And the Commission appears to have accepted that&#8217;s not going to come overnight, so it seems to be trying to brace businesses for turbulence&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">On EU-US transfers,  I am in close contact with <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="ðºð¸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> authorities to find future-proof solutions.

<p>&mdash; Didier Reynders (@dreynders) <a href="https://twitter.com/dreynders/status/1395354545081962502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s resolution on Schrems II also makes it clear that it expects DPAs to step in and cut off risky data flows &#8212; with MEPs writing that &#8220;if no arrangement with the U.S. is swiftly found which guarantees an essentially equivalent and therefore adequate level of protection to that provided by the GDPR and the Charter, that these transfers will be suspended until the situation is resolved&#8221;.</p>
<p>So if DPAs fail to do this &#8212; and if Ireland keeps dragging its feet on closing out the Schrems complaint &#8212; they should expect more resolutions to be blasted at them from the parliament.</p>
<p>MEPs emphasize the need for any future EU-U.S. data transfer agreement &#8220;to address the problems identified by the Court ruling in a sustainable manner&#8221; &#8212; pointing out that &#8220;no contract between companies can provide protection from indiscriminate access by intelligence authorities to the content of electronic communications, nor can any contract between companies provide sufficient legal remedies against mass surveillance&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This requires a reform of US surveillance laws and practices with a view to ensuring that access of US security authorities to data transferred from the EU is limited to what is necessary and proportionate, and that European data subjects have access to effective judicial redress before US courts,&#8221; the parliament adds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still true that businesses may be able to legally move EU personal data out of the bloc. Even, potentially, to the U.S. &#8212; depending on the type of business; the data itself; and additional safeguards that could be applied.</p>
<p>However, for data-mining companies like Facebook &#8212; which are subject to FISA and whose businesses rely on accessing people&#8217;s data &#8212; then achieving essential equivalence with EU privacy protections looks, well, essentially impossible.</p>
<p>And while the parliament hasn&#8217;t made an explicit call in the resolution for Facebook&#8217;s EU data flows to be cut off that is the clear implication of it urging infringement proceedings against the DPC (and deploring &#8220;the absence of meaningful decisions and corrective measures&#8221; in the area of international transfers).</p>
<p>The parliament also states in the resolution that it wants to see &#8220;solid mechanisms compliant with the CJEU judgement&#8221; set out &#8212; for the benefit of businesses with the chance to legally move data out of the EU &#8212; saying, for example, that the<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Commission&#8217;s proposal for a template for Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) should &#8220;duly take into account all the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">relevant recommendations of the EDPB</a>&#8220;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also says it supports theÂ </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">creation of a tool box of supplementary measures for such businesses to choose from &#8212; in areas like security and data protection certification; encryption safeguards; and pseudonymisation &#8212; so long as the measures included are accepted by regulators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also wants to see publicly available resources on the relevant legislation of the EUâs main trading partners to help businesses that have the possibility of being able to legally move data out of the bloc get guidance to help them do so with compliance.</span></p>
<p>The overarching message here is that businesses should buckle up for disruption of cross-border data flows &#8212; and tool up for compliance, where possible.</p>
<p>In another segment of the resolution, for example, the parliament calls on the Commission to &#8220;analyse the situation of cloud providers falling under section 702 of the FISA who transfers data using SCCs&#8221; &#8212; going on to suggest that support for European alternatives to U.S. cloud providers may be needed to plug &#8220;gaps in the protection of data of European citizens transferred to the United States&#8221; and &#8212; in a more blatant push for digital sovereignty &#8212; &#8220;reduce the dependence of the Union in storage capacities vis-Ã -vis third countries and to strengthen the Unionâs strategic autonomy in terms of data management and protection&#8221;.</p>

<p>Thereâs latent demand for life insurance currently unaddressed by much of the financial services industry, and embedded finance can be the solution.

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Connecting consumers with products they need through channels they already know and trust is both a massive revenue opportunity and a social good, providing financial resilience to families at a time when they need it most.</p>
<h2>Why bundle life insurance?</h2>
<p>The concept of digitally bundling financial products in a packaged offering to a customer is certainly not new â but it is for the life insurance space.</p>
<p>Embedded finance uses technology and operations infrastructure to offer products and services through entities that may not be financial institutions at all. Think of embedded finance like on-demand shopping; customers benefit from both the transaction (buying financial protection for their families) and the convenience it provides (from whatever platform they are currently engaging with).</p>
<p>Similar to how <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/shopping-on-amazon-saves-you-over-75-hours-a-year-jeff-bezos/story/436816.html">Amazon saves shoppers 75 hours a year</a>, bundling life insurance gives consumers back time in their day and can improve their financial health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap yesterday announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest iteration of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses</a>, and today the company revealed a bit more news: it is also acquiring the startup that supplied the technology that helps power them. The Snapchat parent is snapping up <a href="https://enhancedworld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WaveOptics</a>, an AR startup that makes the waveguides and projectors used in AR glasses. These overlay virtual images on top of the views of the real world someone wearing the glasses can see, and Snap worked with WaveOptics to build its latest version of Spectacles.</p>
<p>The deal was first reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447150/snap-waveoptics-acquisition-500m-spectacles-waveguides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a>, and a spokesperson for Snap directly confirmed the details to TechCrunch. Snap is paying over $500 million for the startup, in a cash-and-stock deal. The first half of that will be coming in the form of stock when the deal officially closes, and the remainder will be payable in cash or stock in two years.</p>
<p>This is a big leap for WaveOptics, which had raised around $65 million in funding from investors that included Bosch, Octopus Ventures and a host of individuals, from Stan Boland (veteran entrepreneur in the UK, most recently at FiveAI) and Ambarish Mitra (the co-founder of early AR startup Blippar). PitchBook estimates that its most recent valuation <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/107674-03/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was only around $105 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WaveOptics was founded in Oxford, and from what we know it will continue to be based in the UK.</p>
<p>We have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/waveoptics-which-makes-waveguide-based-optics-tech-for-ar-nabs-16m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covering the company since its earliest days</a>, when it displayed some very interesting, early, and ahead-of-its-time technology: waveguides based on hologram physics and photonic crystals. The important and key thing is that its tech drastically compresses size and load of the hardware needed to process and display images, meaning a much wider and more flexible range of form factors for AR hardware based on WaveOptics tech.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether WaveOptics will continue to work with other parties post-deal, but it seems that one obvious advantage for Snap would be making the startup&#8217;s technology exclusive to itself.</p>
<p>Snap has been on something of an acquisition march in recent times &#8212; it&#8217;s made at least three other purchases of startups since January, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fit Analytics</a> for an AR-fuelled move into e-commerce, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/snap-has-acquired-pixel8earth-a-3d-mapping-developer-for-7-6m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixel8Earth</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/snap-acquires-streetcred/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StreetCred</a> for its mapping tools.</p>
<p>This deal, however, marks Snap&#8217;s biggest acquisition to date in terms of valuation. That is not only a mark of the premium price that foundational artificial intelligence tech continues to command &#8212; in addition to the team of scientists that built WaveOptics, it also has 12 filed and in-progress patents &#8212; but also Snap&#8217;s financial and, frankly, existential commitment to having a seat at the table when it comes not just to social apps that use AR, but hardware, and being at the centre of not just using the tech, but setting the pace and agenda for how and where that will play out.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s been a tenacious and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/28/why-snapchat-spectacles-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not always rewarding place</a> for it to be, but the company &#8212; which has long described itself as a &#8220;camera company&#8221; &#8212; has kept hardware in the mix as an essential component for its future strategy.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back toÂ <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunchâs venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week was good fun not only because we had the whole team together to record, but also because we are still basking in theÂ <em>endless glory</em> of our winning a Webby earlier this week. Frankly we are still shocked. But happy-shocked, like when you get a new toy and it is covered in static electricity.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, we had a packed show with much, much left on the floor as we tried to shoehorn the week into our time slot. Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>The world of connections: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fave-with-2-2-million-seed-looks-to-connect-creators-with-their-fandoms/">Fave raised $2.2 million</a> to connect fandoms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/somewhere-good-seed-round/">Somewhere Good raised $3.75 million</a> to build feedless micro-communities, and both Spokn (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2154482&amp;&amp;preview=true">$4 million</a>) and Spot (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/spot-meetings-seed/">$5 million</a>) are hoping to use the spoken word to connect companies and their staffs. Honestly we think that the overall connection-community world is super exciting.</li>
<li>Piano, one of those startups we actually have the luck of using, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/piano-raises-88m-for-analytics-subscription-and-personalization-tools-for-publishers-adds-linkedin-as-investor/">raised $88 million for analytics</a>, subscription and personalization tools. We get into why the round makes sense, and why one investor stood out more than the others.</li>
<li>Corporate media: Coinbase is <a href="https://www.axios.com/coinbase-media-editor-crypto-682b8dca-11dd-4efc-93ef-ecb50ecdda35.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">building out a media-ish org</a> (Alex wrote about it <a href="https://alexwrites.substack.com/p/news-media-marketing-and-power">here on his personal blog</a>; <a href="https://www.scrawler.co/p/on-media-and-content-marketing">Scrawler.co has more on the matter</a>), and with <a href="https://www.axios.com/theskimm-bankers-sale-acquisition-f1be39c5-f29b-4ae8-93ba-558569bdc414.html">TheSkimm hoping to find a corporate home</a> and The Hustle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/hubspot-acquires-media-startup-the-hustle/">doing the same</a>, we had to dig into the matter. Our take is that content marketing is a response to expensive social advertising. And that it&#8217;s fine. And that it is not news.</li>
<li>Shoutout Forbes and<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/media/forbes-union/index.html"> its new union effort</a>. Well done.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/uptrust-raises-2m-to-fight-the-billions-of-dollars-wasted-on-useless-mass-incarceration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uptrust raised $2 million, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which let us talk about the venture-sized opportunity in fighting the billions of dollars wasted on useless mass incarceration.</span></li>
<li>And then we chatted about the public markets. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fast-growth-pushes-an-unprofitable-no-code-startup-into-the-public-markets-inside-monday-coms-ipo-filing/">Monday.com&#8217;s IPO is filed</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/inside-marqetas-fascinating-fintech-ipo/">Marqeta&#8217;s IPO is filed</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/can-squarespace-dodge-the-direct-listing-value-trap/">Squarespace&#8217;s direct listing is done</a>, and more. It&#8217;s hectic out there for late-stage startups.</li>
</ul>
<p>The show flew by, much like our days recently, simply because it was so fun and jam-packed with news. And we got to make jokes about our listeners and Monday.com PR timing, so what else could we ask for? Talk soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As decentralized currencies have taken off in recent months, there&#8217;s been renewed attention around DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, as a means of bringing together groups of investors who can deploy capital as a unit while voting collectively on those investments. In the spirit of blockchain, they aim to bring greater transparency to investment decision-making.</p>
<p>A number of high-profile DAOs have launched in recent months as the fervor for crypto mania increased. <a href="https://www.syndicateprotocol.org/syndicate/komorebi">Komorebi Collective</a>, launching today, is a new organization founded by women in the blockchain space that will be making investments exclusively in &#8220;exceptional female and nonbinary crypto founders,&#8221; founding member Manasi Vora tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The group is comprised of a number of core team members largely assembled from the crypto nonprofit <a href="https://she256.org/">she256</a> and the organization <a href="https://blockchaingirls.org/">Women in Blockchain</a>, including <a href="https://twitter.com/manasilvora">Vora</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wvaeu">Eva Wu</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kristiehuang">Kristie Huang</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/medhakothari">Medha Kothari</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah">Kinjal Shah</a>, who will collectively do most of the heavy lifting behind finding and presenting investments to the group. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Other hand-selected members who committed a minimum of $5,000 USD will likely have a lighter commitment.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each investment will be voted on by all the collective&#8217;s key signers, some 36 in total, the majority of whom are female.</p>
<p>&#8220;DAOs level the hierarchy of a venture fund by ensuring everyone is going to have a seat at the table,&#8221; says Shah, who is also an investor at crypto VC firm Blockchain Capital. &#8220;We are very careful in approaching the backers that are really mission-aligned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other members of the DAO include firms like Kleiner Perkins, Mechanism Capital, Dragonfly Capital, IDEO CoLab Ventures and Stacks Accelerator alongside a number of individuals and founders who work at firms like Twitter, Coinbase, Skynet Labs, Celo Labs and Gitcoin.</p>
<p>The organization itself is built on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Syndicate-411691f0a88b4e909b46796965ee11c1">Syndicate Protocol</a>, a project that shares some of Komorebi Collective&#8217;s backers.</p>
<p>The group hopes the structure of their organization will be able to take a mission-driven approach that improves diversity in the crypto space while proving the sustainability of the DAO model. Despite an explosion in startup investments in the past year, women-led startups received just 2.3% of venture dollars invested in 2020, a study in <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020#:~:text=This%20wasn't%20just%20part,comes%20after%20years%20of%20increases.">HBR</a> found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thereâs so much more room to grow when it comes to female founders getting funding and I want to be part of the solution,&#8221; Shah tells TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Indian government has expressed strong objection to Twitter for classifying tweets by Indian politicians as &#8220;manipulated media,&#8221; and separately asked social media firms to remove posts that refers to an &#8220;Indian variant&#8221; of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The first notice comes two days after Twitter <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257">labeled a tweet from Sambit Patra</a>, the spokesperson of India&#8217;s ruling party BJP, as &#8220;manipulated media.&#8221; In the tweet, Patra claimed that Congress, the leading opposition party in India, was using a so-called &#8220;toolkit&#8221; to derail the Indian government&#8217;s efforts against the coronavirus pandemic. Alt News, a leading fact-checking organization in India, <a href="https://www.altnews.in/covid-toolkit-attributed-to-congress-created-on-forged-letterhead/">debunked Patra&#8217;s claim</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter also labeled similar tweets posted by Priti Gandhi (who oversees BJP&#8217;s social media presence), Sunil Deodhar (National Secretary of the BJP), Vinay Sahasrabuddhe (Member of Parliament of India representing state of Maharashtra and also part of BJP), and Kuljeet Singh Chahal (General Secretary of BJP in Delhi). New Delhi&#8217;s notice didn&#8217;t mention any politician by name nor did it identify any tweets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the notice, the Indian government said Twitter chose to designate tweets as &#8220;manipulated&#8221; &#8220;prejudicially&#8221; even though an investigation hadn&#8217;t been conducted, and also &#8220;asked&#8221; Twitter to remove such tags in the interest of &#8220;fairness and equity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s action, the Indian government said, dilutes its credibility as a &#8220;neutral and unbiased&#8221; platform as well as puts a &#8220;question mark on the status of Twitter as an &#8216;Intermediary.&#8217; &#8221; Twitter, Facebook, and any other social media firm with a certain size &#8212; over a few million users &#8212; are identified as an &#8220;intermediary&#8221; in India, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">a recently unveiled law,</a>Â which provisions some of the world&#8217;s toughest rules for internet companies.</p>
<p>A spokesperson of Twitter &#8212; which has labeled several politicians&#8217; tweets over the years to provide more context or correction, citing news media and independent fact checkers or its own technology, in many markets &#8212; told TechCrunch that the company had no comment.</p>
<p>In a separate letter to social media firms, India&#8217;s IT ministry asked the firms to take down posts that refers to an &#8220;Indian variant&#8221; of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is completely FALSE. There is no such variant of Covid-19 scientifically cited as such by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO has not associated the term &#8216;Indian Variant&#8217; with the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus in any of its reports,&#8221; the ministry wrote in the second letter, which was first <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-india-socialmedia/india-asks-social-media-firms-to-remove-reference-to-indian-variant-of-coronavirus-idUSKCN2D22AG">reported by Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The new notices underscore the dilemma Twitter faces in India, the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market, where it has amassed more than 100 million users and has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">backed local startups</a>. Facebook counts India as its biggest market by users, and has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">made even bigger bets on Indian firms</a>.</p>
<p>The Jack Dorsey-led company has grappled with several tough situations in India this year. After briefly complying with a New Delhi order early this year, the company faced heat from the government for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">restoring accounts that had posted tweets critical of the Indian government&#8217;s policy</a> or the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>The two faced off again publicly last month after New Delhi ordered Twitter and Facebook to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">take down posts</a> that were critical of the government&#8217;s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Singapore <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/issuance-of-general-correction-directions-under-the-protection-from-online-falsehoods-and-manipulation-act-on-falsehoods-on-singapore-strain">ordered</a> Twitter and Facebook to issue corrections over what it said were &#8220;online falsehoods&#8221; that imply a new coronavirus variant had originated in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tanihub.com/">TaniHub Group</a>, an Indonesian startup that helps farmers get better prices and more customers for their crops, has raised a $65.5 million Series B. The funding was led by MDI Ventures, the investment arm of Telkom Group, one of Indonesiaâs largest telecoms, with participation from Add Ventures, BRI Ventures, Flourish Ventures, Intudo Ventures, Openspace Ventures, Tenaya Capital, UOB Venture Management and Vertex Ventures.</p>
<p>Openspace and Intudo are returning investors from TaniHubâs $10 million Series A, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/tanigroup-raises-10-million/">announced in May 2019</a>. The new funding brings its total raised to about $94 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, TaniHub now has more than 45,000 farmers and 350,000 buyers (including businesses and consumers) in its network. The company helps farmers earn more for their crops by streamlining distribution channels so there are fewer middlemen between farms and the restaurants, grocery stores, vendors and other businesses that buy their products. It does this through three units: TaniHub, TaniSupply and TaniFund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TaniHub is its B2B e-commerce platform, which connects farmers directly to customers. Then orders are fulfilled through TaniSupply, the companyâs logistics platform, which currently operates six warehousing and processing facilities where harvests can be washed, sorted and packed within an hour, before being delivered to buyers by TaniHubâs own couriers or third-party logistics providers.</p>
<p>Finally, TaniFund is a fintech platform that provides loans to farmers they can use while growing crops and pay off by selling through TaniHub. Co-founder and chief executive officer Eka Pamitra told TechCrunch its credit scoring system is based on three years of performance, the companyâs agriculture value chain expertise and partnerships with financial institutions.</p>
<p>âMore than 100 data points are considered when doing the credit risk assessment. For example, for cultivation financing products, TaniFund tailors each credit scoring based on agriculture risks and market risk of each commodity, on top of the typical borrower E-KYC scoring and process,â he explained. âBeyond credit scoring, having TaniSupply and TaniHub as a standby buyer within the ecosystem also helps to mitigate risk of each loan. TaniFund aims to further boost its credit scoring system with smarter data processing and better machine learning models.â</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Agritech startup TaniGroup raises $10M to help Indonesia&#8217;s farmers grow&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/tanigroup-raises-10-million/embed/#?secret=EXAtHibUzA" data-secret="EXAtHibUzA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pamitra said TaniHub will use its new funding to build the upstream and midstream parts of its supply chain â in other words, new cultivation areas, processing, packing centers and warehouses. The company will also expand its coverage beyond Java and Bali to source and sell locally, and continue improving its supply-demand forecast model to help farmers plan crop cultivation and timing, with the goal of reducing price fluctuations and maintaining a consistent supply. Pamitra added that TaniHub will also explore precision farming technology.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, TaniHub has started exporting several types of fruits and spices to the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and South Korea. This year, it plans to focus on expanding within Indonesia because the F&amp;B (food and beverage) market there is worth $137 billion and the Indonesian agriculture sector is still highly fragmented, Pamitra said.</p>
<p>Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, TaniHub says it was able to grow its revenue 600% year-on-year in 2020 as demand for online groceries increased.</p>
<p>âWe postponed our branch expansion plan and focused on increasing the seven existing warehousesâ since there was a surge of demand on the B2C segment and the process of onboarding farmers. This benefited us since the adoption of purchasing fresh groceries online increased significantly, and the willingness of farmers to work with us became remarkably high because the local traditional markets were closed due to lockdowns,â Pamitra said. âSince COVID-19, the eagerness of provincial governments to open communications for TaniHub to work with local farmers and SMEs in their region has been quite impactful.â</p>
<p>TaniHub is now working with several Indonesian government agencies, including the Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, to onboard more farmers, F&amp;B businesses and increase exports.</p>
<p>In a press statement, MDI Ventures director of portfolio management Sandhy Widyasthana said, âTaniHub Group has an important role in transforming the agriculture sector and has proven that its presence can deliver positive impact on the quality of life of farmers. We hope our investment can help them continue their work and expand their coverage to more and more farming communities in Indonesia.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://BuffaloGrid.com">BuffaloGrid</a>, a startup that provides phone charging and digital content to people in off-grid environments, is teaming up with the <a href="http://Techfugees.com">Techfugees</a> refugee nonprofit to provide free educational content and device charging to displaced people across East Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The initial service will see solar-powered &#8220;BuffaloGrid Hubs&#8221; deployed in refugee camps across Kenya and Uganda, providing unlimited free access to education and health content, as well as other streaming services and mobile power charging.</p>
<p>The âKnowledge is Freedomâ joint campaign has a goal of raising $3 million over the course of the next two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Daniel Becerra, CEO of BuffaloGrid, said: âOur mission is to remove barriers for internet adoption and provide the next billion with information, energy, and digital skills. I hope this campaign will raise awareness of the plight of displaced people and how collectively we have the power to change things. The entire team is excited to work with Techfugees. I believe together we have the technical expertise, experience and connections to make a real difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raj Burman, Techfugees CEO, said: &#8220;In an increasingly digital and climate change-stricken world, our mission is to make sure forcibly displaced people donât get left behind. Around 400,000 marginalized refugees reside in the Rwamwanja and Kakuma-Kalobeyei settlement camps in Uganda and Kenya, respectively. Our collaboration with BuffaloGrid presents a unique opportunity for an innovative, responsible digital solution to empower displaced communities with the support of our chapters in Kenya and Uganda to overcome the access barriers to education and health content to better their livelihoods.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Farmers and food businesses, like restaurants, deal with the same issue: a fragmented supply chain. <a href="http://secai-marche.co.jp/">Secai Marche</a> wants to streamline agricultural logistics, making fulfillment more cost-efficient and enabling food businesses to bundle products from different farmers into the same order. The company is headquartered in Japan, with operations in Malaysia, and plans to expand into Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. This week, it announced 150 million JPY (about $1.4 million USD) in pre-Series A funding from Rakuten Ventures and Beyond Next Ventures to build a B2B logistics platform for farmers that sell to restaurants, hotels and other F&amp;B (food and beverage) businesses.</p>
<p>This round brings Secai Marcheâs total raised to about $3 million. The capital will be used to expand its fulfillment infrastructure, including a network of warehouses and cold chain logistics, hire more people for its engineering team and sales and marketing.</p>
<p>Secai Marche was founded in 2018 by Ami Sugiyama and Shusaku Hayakawa, and currently serves 130 farmers and more than 300 F&amp;B businesses. Before launching the startup, Sugiyama spent four years working in Southeast Asia, including managing restaurants and cafes in Malaysia. During that time, she started to import green tea from Japan, intending to sell it directly to customers in Malaysia. But she realized supply chain inefficiencies not only made it hard to meet demand, but also ensure quality for all kinds of ingredients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Hayakawa was operating a farm in Japan and working on agriculture control systems that predicted weather and crop growth to help farmers maintain consistent quality.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Alibaba rival Pinduoduo is investing in agritech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/embed/#?secret=OLaXpMnwP4" data-secret="OLaXpMnwP4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both Sugiyama and Hayakawa ended up at consulting firm Deloitte, researching how to create a more efficient supply chain for Japanese agricultural exports to Singaporean F&amp;B businesses. Policies implemented by Prime Minister Yoshihide Sugaâs administration <a href="https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/03/12/challenges-in-boosting-japans-agricultural-exports">aim to increase Japanese agricultural exports</a> from 922.3 billion JPY (about $8.5 billion) in 2020 to 2 trillion JPY (about $18.5 billion) by 2025, and 5 trillion JPY (about $46.1 billion) in 2030.</p>
<p>Seche Marcheâs goal is to make it easier for farmers to sell their crops to F&amp;B businesses domestically or overseas.</p>
<p>âWe found that not only farmers in Japan, but also all farmers in Southeast Asia have the same problem in terms of the current supply chain,â Sugiyama told TechCrunch. âSo we left Deloitte and started our own business to connect not only farmers in Japan, but farmers in all Asian countries.â</p>
<p>Secai Marcheâs logistics management tech is what differentiates it from other wholesaler platforms. It uses an AI-based algorithm to predict demand based on consumption trends, seasonal products and farmer recommendations, said Hayakawa. Secai Marche runs its own warehouse network, but mostly relies on third-party logistics providers for fulfillment, and its platform assigns orders to the most efficient transportation method.</p>
<p>This allows F&amp;B businesses to consolidate orders from farmers, so they can order smaller batches from different places without spending more money. About 30% of Secai Marcheâs products are shipped to other countries, while the rest are sold domestically.</p>
<p>Secai Marche is reaching out to farmers who want to increase their customer base. About 30% of its products currently come from Japanese farms, 50% from Malaysia and the rest from other ASEAN countries. Sugiyama and Hayakawa said the COVID-19 pandemic affected Secai Marcheâs expansion plans because it originally planned to enter Singapore this year, but had to slow down since they were unable to travel and meet with farmers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many farmers have started selling directly to consumers through social media like Instagram or Facebook, and have approached Secai Marche for help with fulfillment, logistics, repacking and quality control.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vietnam has one of the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/5321/e-commerce-in-vietnam/">fastest-growing e-commerce markets</a> in Southeast Asia, but many major platforms still focus on large cities. This means people in smaller cities or rural areas need to deal with longer wait times for deliveries. Social commerce company <a href="https://mioapp.co/">Mio</a> is taking advantage of that gap by building a reseller network and logistics infrastructure that can offer next-day delivery to tier 2 and 3 cities.</p>
<p>The startup, which currently focuses on fresh groceries and plans to expand into more categories, announced today it has raised $1 million in seed funding. The round was co-led by Venturra Discovery and Golden Gate Ventures. Other participants included iSeed SEA, DoorDash executive Gokul Rajaram and Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal, co-founders of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">Indian social commerce unicorn Meesho</a>.</p>
<p>Rajaram, Aatrey and Barnwal will become advisors to Mio co-founder and chief executive officer Trung Huynh, former investment associate at IDG Ventures Vietnam. Other founders include An Pham (who also <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/scommerce-secures-funding-temasek">co-founded Temasek-backed logistics startup SCommerce</a>), Tu Le and Long Pham.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indian social commerce Meesho valued at $2.1 billion in new $300 million fundraise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/embed/#?secret=isG9vTHq9h" data-secret="isG9vTHq9h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Founded in June 2020, Mio now claims hundreds of agents, or resellers. They are primarily women aged 25 to 35 years old who live in smaller cities or rural areas. Most join Mio because they want to supplement their household income, which is usually below $350, Huynh and Venturra investment associate Valerie Vu told TechCrunch in an email.</p>
<p>The social commerce model works for them because they are part of tight-knit communities that are already used to making group orders together. On average, Mio claims that its resellers make about $200 to $300, earning a 10% commission on each order, and additional commissions based on the monthly performance of resellers they referred to the platform.</p>
<p>Mio is among a crop of social commerce startups across Asia that leverage the buying power of areas where major e-commerce players havenât reached dominance yet. For example, lower-tier cities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/the-incredible-rise-of-pinduoduo/">fueled Pinduoduoâs meteoric rise in China</a>, while Meesho has built a distribution network in 5,000 Indian cities. Other examples of social commerce areas focused on smaller cities and rural areas include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/super-an-indonesian-hyperlocal-social-commerce-startup-raises-28m-led-by-softbank-ventures-asia/">âhyperlocalâ startup Super</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/indonesian-social-commerce-app-kitabeli-gets-10m-led-by-go-ventures/">KitaBeli</a>, both in Indonesia, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/resellee-wants-to-become-the-pinduoduo-of-southeast-asia/">Resellee in the Philippines</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Super, an Indonesian hyperlocal social commerce startup, raises $28M led by SoftBank Ventures Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/super-an-indonesian-hyperlocal-social-commerce-startup-raises-28m-led-by-softbank-ventures-asia/embed/#?secret=vBDN0GRU3B" data-secret="vBDN0GRU3B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Social commerce companies typically donât require resellers to carry inventory. Instead, resellers pick which items they want to market to their buyers. In Mioâs case, most of their resellersâ customers are friends, family members and neighbors, and they promote group orders through social media platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Instagram or Zalo, Vietnamâs most popular messaging app. Then they place and manage orders through Mioâs reseller app.</p>
<p>To address delivery challenges, Mio is building an in-house logistics and fulfillment system, including a new distribution center in Thu Duc that can distribute goods to all of Ho Chi Minh and the surrounding five cities in Binh Dong and Dong Nai provinces. Vu and Huynh said Mio can process up to tens of thousands of daily order units at the center. Mio is also able to perform next-day deliveries for orders that are made prior to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>To lower logistics costs and ensure quick delivery times, Mio limits the number of products in its inventory. The company currently focuses on grocery staples, including fresh produce and poultry, and plans to add FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) and household appliances, too, especially white-label goods that have a higher profit margin.</p>
<p>Mioâs new funding will be used on its distribution center, and hiring for its tech and product teams. The startup plans to add more personalization options for product categories and resellers, so they can build their own brand identities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Telemedicine has faced an uphill battle to become more relevant in the U.S., with challenges like meeting HIPPA compliance requirements and insurance companies unwilling to pay for virtual visits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Telemedicine, in its original form of the phone call, has been around for decades. For people in remote or rural areas without easy access to in-person care, consulting a doctor over the phone has often been the go-to approach. But for a large swath of the world used to taking half a day off work just for a 15-30 minute doctorâs appointment, it may seem like telemedicine was invented only last year. That&#8217;s mostly because it wasnât until 2020 that telemedicine, in its myriad forms, debuted into the mainstream consciousness.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Itâs impossible to predict how healthcare institutions will operate post-pandemic, but with so many people now accustomed to telemedicine, startups that provide services around virtual care continue to be poised for success.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Telemedicine has faced an uphill battle to become more relevant in the U.S., with challenges such as meeting HIPAA compliance requirements and insurance companies unwilling to pay for virtual visits. But when COVID-19 began raging across the globe and people had to stay home, both the insurance and healthcare industries were forced to adapt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Itâs been said that there are decades where nothing happens, and then there are weeks when decades happen,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.startuphealth.com/">StartUp Health</a> co-founders Steven Krein and Unity Stoakes in the companyâs 2020 year-end report. That statement couldn&#8217;t be truer for telemedicine: Around $3.1 billion in funding flowed into the sector in 2020 â about three times what we saw in 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.startuphealth.com/insights-reports">report</a>. A health tech fund and insights company, StartUp Health counts Alphabet, Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz as some of its co-investors.</p>
<p>Now that people see the benefits and conveniences of &#8220;dialing a doc&#8221; from the kitchen table, healthcare has changed forever. Itâs impossible to predict how healthcare institutions will operate post-pandemic, but with so many people now accustomed to telemedicine, startups that provide services around virtual care continue to be poised for success.</p>
<h2>The state of telemedicine</h2>
<p>Major players in the field now look at the state of healthcare as, &#8220;before COVID and after COVID,&#8221; Stoakes told Extra Crunch. &#8220;In the post-pandemic world, thereâs a significant transformation thatâs occurred,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all accelerated; the customers have shown up. Thereâs more capital than ever and consumers and physicians have adapted quickly,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In the U.S., healthcare is first and foremost a business, so while there are treatment approaches that have long been proven to improve patient outcomes, if they didnât make sense financially, they werenât instituted at scale. Telemedicine is a great example of this.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/telemedicine-and-its-role-in-revolutionizing-healthcare-delivery">2017 study by the American Journal of Accountable Care</a> showed that telemedicine can be quite useful for managing healthcare. &#8220;The use of telemedicine has been shown to allow for better long-term care management and patient satisfaction; it also offers a new means to locate health information and communicate with practitioners (e.g., via e-mail and interactive chats or video conferences), thereby increasing convenience for the patient and reducing the amount of potential travel required for both physician and patient,â the study reads.</p>
<p>But as we&#8217;ve seen, it took a global healthcare emergency to drive widespread adoption of virtual healthcare in the U.S. Now that investors recognize the potential, they are increasingly pouring money into startups that promise to take telemedicine to the next level. Some of the investors backing these newer companies include StartUp Health, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Alphabet, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/11246-23/investor/profile">Kaiser Permanente Ventures</a>, U.S. Venture Partners, Maveron, First Round Capital, DreamIt Ventures, Human Ventures and Tusk Venture Partners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunchâs biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Itâs Thursday, everyone, and the technology and startup worlds were a mixed bag today. We learned about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/so-long-internet-explorer-and-your-decades-of-security-bugs/">final death of Internet Explorer</a> (RIP), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar/">new AR glasses from Snap</a>, fresh <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/new-cryptocurrency-irs-rules-2023-crypto/">cryptocurrency rules for the United States</a>, and even took the time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robotics-roundup-12/">to look into</a> all the pizza-robot startups. Hell, Ford even made the cut with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">new electric truck</a> that I secretly covet (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-can-power-your-home-in-an-outage/">it can power your house if the grid goes down!</a>).</p>
<p>As always, weâve collected the three key stories for the day below and then have a rapid-fire breakdown of startup and Big Tech news to follow. Letâs go! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer financial technology is <em>so</em> hot:</strong> With Berlin-based investing app Trade Republic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/">raising $900 million</a> and Robinhoodâs partial, first-quarter results <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom/">looking strong</a>, your Twitter feed may feel all fintech, all the time. And with good reason, as startups in the niche are seeing huge customer demand, which is, in turn, making investors both public and private salivate.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce roll-ups are raising jillions: </strong>The world is moving toward e-commerce at a rapid clip, which is leading to a host of startups raising piles of cash to buy, and consolidate brands that sell on popular digital platforms. Itâs an arms race to own your wallet, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/">Factory14 just put together $200 million</a> for its own effort. (More <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/">here</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Governments are not thrilled with cryptocurrencies:</strong> On the heels of news concerning fresh crackdowns on Bitcoin and friends in China, the United States is looking âto <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/new-cryptocurrency-irs-rules-2023-crypto/">put new requirements in place</a> that would make it easier for the government to see how money is moving around, including digital currencies,â Taylor reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>The startup world is awash in capital these days, so we cannot get to all the latest venture capital rounds in one bloc. Here, however, are a few favorites from the day:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/eanos-stella-wu-is-not-your-typical-construction-tech-startup-founder/"><strong>Eano raises $6M for its home renovation software</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Home renovations are hard because most of us are not trained project managers. Eano wants to make the process simpler for both homeowners and the folks hired to do the renovation work. Thank god.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/workrise-once-known-as-rigup-raises-300m-at-a-2-9b-valuation/"><strong>Workrise raises $300M for its workforce management platform</strong></a><strong>:</strong> With <a href="https://t.co/4ShhCP5Eqc">Procoreâs IPO going well today</a>, and Workrise raising $300 million at roughly the same time, it appears to be a great time to build products for less sexy markets. Workrise, for example, âconnects skilled laborers with infrastructure and energy companies looking to staff and manage projects efficiently.â With Franklin Templeton now an investor, it looks like itâs headed for an IPO in not too much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/pitch-a-platform-for-making-and-sharing-presentations-raises-85m-on-a-600m-valuation/"><strong>Pitch raises $85M to help folks build shareable presentations</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The push to build and fund software that may fit neatly into a remote or hybrid-work world continues today, with Pitch announcing a huge round at a $600 million valuation for what Ingrid describes as the âability for people to create, collaborate on and share presentations with each other through an online-based interface.â Frankly that sounds cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/maven-series-a-a16z/"><strong>Maven raises $20M for its cohort-based professional classes</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The education technology VC rush continues, with Andreessen Horowitz leading a $20 million round into Maven, which Natasha reports âhelps professionals teach cohort-based classes.â Notably Maven raised money via equity crowdfunding earlier in its life.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/chile-based-kredito-raises-4m-to-help-businesses-get-loans/"><strong>Kredito raises $4M to get loans for LatAm small businesses</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The fintech lending boom that has impacted consumers (BNPL and the like) and business is not stopping at the borders of the United States. Kredito is testament to that fact, putting together a new round to help get SMBs in Latin America access to credit.</p>
<h2>Chasing hype is human nature: The tyranny of startup trends</h2>
<p>The fear of missing out (FOMO) spreads faster than wildfire and often overwhelms rational decision-making.</p>
<p>In the VC community, investors look for lessons from disruptive startups they can use to identify other potential winners. But hype leads to bad decision-making, rushed due diligence and wishful thinking.</p>
<p>When and if those startups actually do well, &#8220;irrational FOMO takes over&#8221; because the initial assessment was based on bad information, says Victor Echevarria, a partner at Jackson Square Ventures. &#8220;Trends are addictive; to remain disciplined and avoid hype is to deny our innate instincts.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s natural for investors to follow the crowd, but in the race to the bottom, FOMO can be high-octane fuel.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Todayâs Big Tech news comes from Microsoft, Google, Twitter and Snap. And TikTok. Enjoy:</p>
<p><strong>Twitterâs epic product run continues:</strong> The product news parade from Twitter continued today, with the social media company announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-to-revamp-user-profiles-with-about-tab-support-for-pronouns-confirmed-status-and-more/">revamp to user profiles</a>Â and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">restarting of its verification process</a>. Between a rapid-fire rollout of its Clubhouse-competing Spaces product, or its media push with Revue and subscriptions, Twitter has been on a roll.</p>
<p><strong>Google didnât learn from Microsoftâs retail experiment:</strong> Big Search is following Redmond into the IRL retail game that the latter company already gave up on. Which is a bummer as I kinda dug Microsoft stores. Regardless, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/google-is-opening-a-retail-store-in-new-york-this-summer/">read all about Googleâs impending meatspace storefront here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft lays Internet Explorer to rest: </strong>The death date of Internet Explorer has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/so-long-internet-explorer-and-your-decades-of-security-bugs/">been fixed for June, 2022</a>. So you have that long to fool around with the venerable, if comedically aged internet browser. Few will miss Internet Explorer, but it was a pretty key product in the rise of the web. Kinda like Yahoo.
