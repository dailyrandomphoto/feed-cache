										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five and a half years after being acquired by a private equity firm, personal finance software company <a href="https://www.quicken.com/">Quicken</a> is announcing that it is being acquired by another private equity firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2016, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an affiliate of H.I.G. Capital <a href="https://www.quicken.com/about-us/press/quicken-completes-acquisition-hig-capital-and-outlines-vision">acquired Quicken</a> from Intuit Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Today, Menlo Park, California-based Quicken is announcing that Aquiline Capital Partners will be acquiring a majority stake in the company &#8212; also for an undisclosed amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Quicken CEO Eric Dunn did share some other details about Quicken’s performance since that last transaction, as well as its plans for the future. Dunn has a history with the company, so can speak pretty comfortably about where it’s been, and where it’s going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he took over as CEO of Quicken in 2016, he first joined previous parent company Intuit as employee No. 4 in 1986 when Quicken was its only software product. During his tenure at Intuit, he served as the CFO through the 1993 IPO and merger with ChipSoft (now known as TurboTax). While he was CFO, Dunn was also a software developer who worked on almost all of the early versions of Quicken, and was the first VP/general manager of the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the H.I.G. buy, it appears that Quicken has grown quite a lot. It currently has 2 million active users, which Dunn said is “significantly higher” than what it had at the time of its spinoff from Intuit. The executive declined to reveal hard revenue figures but he did share that the company is profitable and has seen a 50% increase in annual sales volume over the five-year period, (or double-digit growth if you annualize it).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re strongly profitable and have been consistently profitable since the time of the spinoff. We’re a very successful company, revenue-wise &#8212; far above what it ever was in the Intuit years,” he told TechCrunch. “More importantly, we’re a successful business that has succeeded in modernizing and improving quality for our customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, according to Dunn, Quicken has seen an NPS gain of 25 points over a five-year period. (NPS stands for Net Promoter Score, a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.I.G., Dunn added, invested alongside the Quicken management team to improve product quality, bring Quicken to a cloud platform and launch a digitally native product in its personal finance app, <a href="https://get.simplifimoney.com/">Simplifi</a>.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199664" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199664" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2199664 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simplifi-by-Quicken-mobile-dashboard.jpg?w=139" alt="" width="250" height="541" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simplifi-by-Quicken-mobile-dashboard.jpg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simplifi-by-Quicken-mobile-dashboard.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simplifi-by-Quicken-mobile-dashboard.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simplifi-by-Quicken-mobile-dashboard.jpg?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simplifi-by-Quicken-mobile-dashboard.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simplifi-by-Quicken-mobile-dashboard.jpg?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simplifi-by-Quicken-mobile-dashboard.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simplifi-by-Quicken-mobile-dashboard.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199664" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Quicken</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H.I.G. is not a growth-oriented expansion firm. They felt their work was done, and they did what they had set out to do,” Dunn said, “which is to carve out an asset with a lot of potential from a parent company which had neglected it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Reyna, managing director  at H.I.G. Capital, said the results of its investment in Quicken have been “outstanding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the number of financial technology companies (and potential competitors to Quicken) has exploded. But, Dunn maintains, Quicken in fact was “the first fintech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was one of the founding fintechs, the only software product at Intuit when it launched in 1983,” he told TechCrunch. “It started with the idea of automating personal finances to customers as a software tool living only on desktops.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, Dunn said Quicken plans to explore partnering with fintechs as it continues to evolve its model. It’s not ruling out acquisitions, but it’s also not an area of emphasis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No layoffs are planned with the new ownership. In fact, Dunn expects the company will only continue to hire and add to its 150-person staff (not including 250 contracted “customer care agents).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the company will simply focus on continuing the modernization of its Quicken product and bringing more functionality to its web and mobile offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll also continue to add to our Simplifi product, which is only about 18 months into its life,” he said. “It has a great feature set but there’s lots more we need to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also focus on integrated financial services, such as allowing for money movement from account to account in the product as opposed to going to an external site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aquiline is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York- and London-based private investment firm with $6.9 billion in assets under management. Its president, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vincenzo La Ruffa, says he is a Quicken user himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Quicken is trusted by millions of customers, who rely on it to lead healthy financial lives,” he said in a written statement. “As a longtime Quicken user myself, I’ve seen firsthand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the work Eric and the team at Quicken have put into building a compelling suite of products and services. I am confident in the growth trajectory ahead as we work with the company to expand the range of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovative solutions it offers in the personal financial management space.”</span></p>
<p>There has been a flurry of interest in fintechs focused on personal finance as of late. For example, in June, personal finance startup <a href="https://www.truebill.com/">Truebill</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/truebill-raises-45-million-for-its-personal-finance-app/">raised a $45 million Series D</a> funding round led by Accel.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tinder is redesigning its app to put a larger emphasis on its social, interactive features with the launch of &#8220;Explore,&#8221; a new section that will feature events, like the return of the popular &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series, as well as ways to discover matches by interests and dive into quick chats before a match is made. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder is <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-09-08-Tinder-Opens-This-Falls-Hottest-New-Venue-Tinder-Explore">redesigning</a> its app to put a larger emphasis on its social, interactive features with the launch of &#8220;Explore,&#8221; a new section that will feature events, like the return of the popular <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/tinders-interactive-swipe-night-stories-return-after-a-20-million-user-turnout/">&#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series</a>, as well as ways to discover matches by interests and dive into quick chats before a match is made. Combined, the changes help to push Tinder further away from its roots as a quick match-based dating app into something that&#8217;s more akin to a social network aimed at helping users meet new people.</p>
<p>This shift could resonate better with a younger generation that may feel like traditional online dating has lost its novelty. Today, these users are turning to apps marketing themselves <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-young-people-are-using-dating-apps-to-find-friendswithout-benefits-11626101537">as places to meet new friends</a>, while newcomers to the dating app industry are experimenting with other means of connecting users &#8212; such as with short, TikTok-like videos, as in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/">Snack</a>, or even audio, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/swoonme-uses-avatars-and-audio-for-its-less-superficial-dating-app/">as in SwoonMe</a>. For Tinder, these market shifts may have represented an existential threat to its own business. But instead, the company has doubled down on interactivity as being core to the Tinder experience, as means of maintaining its dominant position.</p>

<p>At launch, Tinder Explore will include a handful of existing features alongside a new way to meet people. The latter allows users to connect with others based on interests &#8212; like Foodies, Gamers, Music Lovers, Social Causes, Entrepreneurs, and more. Over time, more interests will be added which will allow Tinder members to find someone based on what they&#8217;re like, rather than just what they look like.</p>

<p>Explore will also be home to Tinder&#8217;s &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; the interactive series that launched in 2019 as an in-app &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; story which helped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/tinders-interactive-series-swipe-night-could-bring-a-needed-boost-to-user-engagement/">boost</a> Tinder engagement as it gave users a reason to relaunch the app at a specific time. Tinder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/tinders-interactive-swipe-night-stories-return-after-a-20-million-user-turnout/">hailed</a> &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; as a success, saying the feature attracted over 20 million users during its first run and led to a 26% increase in matches. In November, the series will <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-11-Tinder-Orders-More-Swipe-Night-Following-Transformative-20-Million-Member-Turnout-and-26-Increase-in-Matches">return</a> &#8212; this time, with new characters and a new &#8220;whodunit&#8221;-style storyline. It will now also leverage the &#8220;Fast Chat&#8221; feature that powers Tinder&#8217;s &#8220;Hot Takes&#8221; experience, which allows unmatched users to chat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hot Takes&#8221; will also appear in Tinder Explore, which the company describes as a more low-stakes way to match with other users. As a timer counts down, users who are chatting can choose if they want to match. If the timer expires, they meet someone new &#8212; similar to an online version of speed dating. Since launching this summer, millions of Tinder users have tried &#8220;Hot Takes,&#8221; which is only available from 6 pm to midnight local time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the bigger story about Tinder Explore isn&#8217;t just what sort of features it will host now, but what the company has in store for the future. Earlier this year, Tinder parent Match bought the Korean social networking company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">Hyperconnect for $1.73 billion</a> &#8212; its largest acquisition to date. And it&#8217;s preparing to use Hyperconnect&#8217;s IP to make the online dating experience even more interactive than it is today, having announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/match-group-to-add-live-audio-and-video-to-its-dating-app-portfolio-starting-in-2021/"> plans to add audio and video chat, including group live video</a>, to several of its top dating app properties, Tinder included.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AZvnFsv4C5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/match-group-to-add-live-audio-and-video-to-its-dating-app-portfolio-starting-in-2021/">Match Group to add audio and video chat, including group live video, to its dating app portfolio</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Match Group to add audio and video chat, including group live video, to its dating app portfolio&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/match-group-to-add-live-audio-and-video-to-its-dating-app-portfolio-starting-in-2021/embed/#?secret=AZvnFsv4C5" data-secret="AZvnFsv4C5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tinder Explore provides a platform where features like this could later be added &#8212; something Tinder hints towards, noting that the section is designed to offer users access to &#8220;a growing list&#8221; of social experiences with &#8220;many more to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A new generation of daters is asking for more from us in the post-Covid world: more ways to have fun and interact with others virtually and more control over who they meet on Tinder,&#8221; said Tinder CEO Jim Lanzone, in a company announcement. &#8220;Today’s launch of Explore is a major step in creating a deeper, multi-dimensional, interactive experience for our members that expands the possibilities of Tinder as a platform,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Tinder Explore began rolling out to major English-speaking markets on Wednesday, Sept. 8, and will be available globally by mid-October.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The deal could give Better a way to augment its lending business with the potential to enable fractional ownership of properties in the U.S. and other markets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online mortgage company <a href="https://better.com/">Better.com</a> has acquired U.K.-based startup <a href="https://www.propertypartner.co/">Property Partner</a> as it seeks to expand into new markets and offer new product lines. The deal could give Better a way to augment its lending business with the potential to enable fractional ownership of properties in the U.S. and other markets.</p>
<p>Better plans to go public later this year through its planned merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in a deal that values it at $7.7 billion. In the meantime the company has been active in the M&amp;A market, acquiring two U.K.-based companies in the lead up to the deal’s close.</p>
<p>In July, Better announced its <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/better-com-to-acquire-uk-based-digital-mortgage-brokerage/">acquisition of Trussle</a>, a digital mortgage brokerage in the U.K. that was widely seen as its first step to international expansion. But with the purchase of Property Partner, Better could gain technology capabilities to expand its feature set in the U.S. and other markets.</p>
<p>Launched in 2015, Property Partner enables fractional ownership of “buy to let” properties throughout the country. Through its platform, users could invest in individual properties or in a portfolio of properties and earn a portion of the rental income generated by those assets. It also created a resale market, enabling users to sell off their shares to other users.</p>
<p>The startup claims more than 9,000 investors on its property crowdfunding market and £140 million of assets under management. With the Better acquisition, the company expects to be able to expand both its investor base and properties to invest in.</p>
<p>Property Partner sent a <a href="https://www.propertypartner.co/blog/better-acquires-property-partner/">message to users</a> late last week to inform them of upcoming changes as a result of the deal. The startup announced it was temporarily pausing trading on the resale market while promoting some of Better’s plans as a result of the deal.</p>
<p>Under the new ownership, Property Partner said it would be able to reduce fees, grow its investor base, and dramatically expand investment opportunities by adding properties in the U.S. and other international locations to its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Better, the deal adds a new income stream in the short term while enabling the company to completely reimagine homeownership over a longer time horizon. Over the years Better has sought to augment its core mortgage lending business with additional products and services, including real estate agents, title and homeowners insurance, and the ability to make all-cash offers in certain markets in which it operates.</p>
<p>But in an interview with TechCrunch last month, Better CEO Vishal Garg previewed a vision for how fractional ownership could reduce friction and enable more freedom for the home-owning public:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have a large population in this country that is composed of retirees and they don&#8217;t have a current income, so they cannot actually refinance their mortgage and they&#8217;re still paying interest at 6%. They&#8217;d like to move to a warmer climate. Well, they can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s gonna cost them 6% to sell their house, then it&#8217;s gonna cost them 6% to buy the other house.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t they set it up so they sell 1% of their house in Connecticut every year and establish an income stream that qualifies them to go get a cheap mortgage and sell that house in Connecticut over a period of time, to someone who wants to live there and buy a piece of property in Florida.</p>
<p>There are all these frictions and it&#8217;s honestly just a simple data-matching problem. There&#8217;s no reason you need to own 100% of your home. What if we could give you the ability to sell 10% a year or 3% of your home or 2% of your home to people who want to buy a home in your neighborhood and are not ready yet because they&#8217;re renting.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[“We aren't so easily categorized,” said Better CEO Vishal Garg.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When executives at online mortgage company <a href="https://better.com/">Better.com</a> decided to take their company public earlier this year, they elected not to go the traditional IPO route or direct listing. Instead, Better will hit the public markets by merging with blank-check company Aurora Acquisition Corp in a SPAC deal that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/">values it at $7.7 billion</a>.</p>
<p>While the stock performance of post-merger SPAC companies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/06/the-spac-boom-is-over-with-the-majority-of-deals-now-trading-under-key-10-level.html">has been shaky at best</a> this year, the team at Better believed they were getting a preferable deal through their combination with Aurora (and additional investment by SoftBank) than if they decided to pitch bankers and institutional investors through a traditional IPO roadshow.</p>
<p>“When an investment bank signs up to sell your stock to the public, there&#8217;s no guarantee of a price or no certainty of execution,” said Better CEO Vishal Garg. “We just were not confident that the investment bankers were going to be able to execute.”</p>
<p>You can hardly blame Better’s leadership for that lack of confidence. In the past year, two other online mortgage lenders &#8212; Rocket Companies and loanDepot &#8212; were listed through traditional IPOs that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/quicken-loans-parent-sells-shares-in-ipo-below-target-to-raise-1point8-billion.html">priced below range</a> due to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/quicken-loans-parent-sells-shares-in-ipo-below-target-to-raise-1point8-billion.html">lackluster demand</a> from institutional investors.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to real estate brokerage Compass, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/compass-prices-ipo-at-bottom-of-range-to-raise-450-million">lowered its target range</a> on the day of its IPO and has seen its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COMP?p=COMP&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch">stock price continue to slide</a> since going public.</p>
<p>“A traditional public offering makes sense for a story that your traditional investment banker can understand and categorize,” Garg said. “If you can be easily categorized as an enterprise SaaS company or a payments company, then a public offering makes sense.”</p>
<p>But the team at Better has bigger ambitions than just being seen as a mortgage lender and compared with other financial services companies. With mortgage lending at its core, Better has added a number of additional products and services, including realtors, title insurance and homeowners insurance.</p>
<p>In the second half of this year, Better plans to begin offering home services and improvement loans, and eventually will expand to other finance and insurance products like personal, auto and student loans, as well as life and disability insurance.</p>
<p>“We aren&#8217;t so easily categorized,” Garg said.</p>
<h2>Making mortgages cheaper, faster and easier</h2>
<p>Like many digital disruptors seeking to upend established industries, Better was borne out of one person seeking to solve a problem for himself. Sometime around 2012 Vishal Garg, founding partner of <a href="https://www.onezerocapital.com/">One Zero Capital</a> and founder of the online student lending company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyRichUncle">MyRichUncle</a>, was hoping to buy his “dream home” but got hung up during the process of securing a mortgage and lost out on the bidding to a buyer who could close the deal faster.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://better.com/content/the-house-that-got-away-why-i-started-better-mortgage/">apocryphal founding story goes</a>, there were few options available for someone looking to apply for and secure a mortgage online &#8212; or even get a mortgage pre-approval letter. So Garg set out to build it.</p>
<p>“The original vision was to make the process of going from being a renter to a homeowner. cheaper, faster and easier,” Garg said. “We built a product that let you get a pre-approval letter online in five minutes, instead of five days or five weeks.”</p>
<p>According to Sarah Pierce, who joined the company as one of its first 30 employees and now runs all sales and operations, Better was able to fulfill the goal of getting approved for a mortgage faster by using its technology to assess borrower risk.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy, a pediatric teletherapy company, just closed a $13 million series A round. It’s far from the only teletherapy company looking to capitalize on a boom in venture capital investment in <a href="https://www.axios.com/venture-capital-investments-mental-health-startups-rise-bccbd34f-c1d4-427b-b9b8-5df932479c1a.html">mental health startups</a>, but it’s operating in a hyper-specific sphere: therapy for kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy was originally co-founded in 2015 by Rachel Mack Robinson, who, at the time, was a practicing pediatric therapist at a neurology clinic in Missouri, and Emily Purdom, also a speech language pathologist. Purdom is no longer involved with the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair noticed a pattern that still holds true in 2021: about </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/features/child-mental-health.html#mentaldisorders"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in five children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the US experience a mental disorder (like ADHD, or anxiety or depression for example), but just </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/access.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 percent </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">receive treatment from a mental healthcare provider, per the CDC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy’s bet is that teletherapy can close that gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the company’s infancy, Robinson called school districts across the country asking to pilot a teletherapy program. Her first greenlight was a district in rural Alaska, where Robinson delivered a combination of in-person and teletherapy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company provides fully online speech, occupation and behavioral therapy and has still focused on partnering with schools and other youth programs, like Little League (the company provided mental health services for the Little League World Series Tournaments). DotCom Therapy has partnered with over 400 schools (in over 100 districts) in 38 states, so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this most recent round of funding, the company plans to expand operations beyond school districts, and scale up their service to reach kids both in and out of school. The program for families specifically is called Zesh, an online therapy platform that matches kids with therapists, schedules visits and hosts video calls. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our main customer base was K-12 school districts. We have the core of our business rocking and rolling with our education market,” says Robinson. “But we know that we are wanting to expand our footprint, enter into health systems and also offer services for private patients through working different health plans,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Series A was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Capital Partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a firm with a history of success in the telemedicine space. New Capital Partners were early investors in Teladoc, a virtual healthcare company founded in 2002. Teladoc went public in 2015 at an enterprise value of $620 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was flushed out with investment from LRVHealth and OSF Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Cowen, general partner of LRVHealth, Stan Lynall, the vice president of investments for OSF Ventures, and James Outland, managing partner of New Capital Partners will join DotCom Therapy’s board. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the company has raised $14 million in funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic, Robinson says the greatest barrier to success  would have been hooking school districts and families on teletherapy. The pandemic has changed that outlook significantly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to COVID-19, restrictions on reimbursement for telehealth services, as well as geographic requirements for telehealth services </span><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/medicare-medicaid/final-2021-medicare-pay-schedule-what-physicians-need-know"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were</span></a> <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/opportunities-and-barriers-for-telemedicine-in-the-u-s-during-the-covid-19-emergency-and-beyond/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loosened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Use of telehealth services peaked in April 2020, but has since stabilized at about 38 times pre-pandemic usage, according to a July 2021 </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a move outside of school-based partners, DotCom Therapy will be entering into the wider sphere of mental health and telehealth, where there’s a significant amount of competition. Those range from </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2021/06/07/venture-funding-for-mental-health-startups-hits-record-high-as-anxiety-depression-skyrocket/?sh=7f2dbe411116"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unicorns like TalkSpace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to other startups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least in Robinson’s view, a specific focus on kids’ telehealth, and the specific disciplines of occupational and speech therapy will help to set DotCom apart in an increasingly crowded space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority of our competitors, I like to think, are the Teladocs, or the Gingers. But for them, the main focus has been on the adult population,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy does have general research backing the idea that online speech and occupational therapy for kids works. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5546562/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One systematic review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of seven studies on telehealth-delivered speech and language therapy made significant improvements in children’s language skills that were comparable to in-person therapy – though the research is still limited. </span></p>
<p>In general, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a lack of platform specific validation has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0093-1#Tab3">common critique</a> for other mental-health telemedicine companies. DotCom Therapy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has released </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fcff2136aa5202b58cfaba7/t/5ffbeac32b262f3dd3815e67/1610345172750/Drake%2BUniversity%2B-%2BCase%2BStudy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting children have benefited from their teletherapy program. However, Robinson didn’t disclose any additional ongoing validation studies focused specifically on DotCom’s service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead she notes that the company has worked with two advisors Andre Ostrovsky, a former chief medical officer of Medicaid and Colleen Kraft, a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, to develop and track outcome metrics for each service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will include DSM-5 cross cutting measures, ASHA&#8217;s functional communication metrics &amp; proprietary occupational therapy outcomes generated from a team of occupational therapists from masters to doctorate level,” says Robinson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the business side, DotCom’s current school district based approach is a multifaceted process – it takes more than just downloading an app. In one sense, they provide a service rather than just a platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy aims to become embedded within school districts the company works with. If a school has about 150 students that require speech therapy, for instance, DotCom Therapy will determine how many therapists they believe a school might need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a proprietary calculator that we&#8217;re able to identify the number of therapists that we need to deploy for that specific location,” Robinson says. Overall it takes about <a href="https://www.dotcomtherapy.com/schools">21 days</a> to match therapists with students, per DotCom Therapy&#8217;s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy will also coordinate with administrators at K-12 school districts who can be in the room while kids participate in therapy (there’s a video of how that works </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxva7kBjoQI&amp;t=280s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and will also handle the scheduling, and tracking of all student sessions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, DotCom Therapy has employed about 200 therapists, says Robinson, who are all employed as W-2 employees, rather than independent contractors. The company has about a 97 percent retention rate for employees, says Robinson. On the customer side, the company has retained about 90 percent of customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this Series A round, Robinson says the company is focusing on expansion into all fifty states by January, and by building out the services for private families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just feel a lot of urgency for us to grow quickly, but in a very smart way to be able to meet the demand without compromising quality. So what keeps me up at night is really making sure that we can grow at a healthy pace,” says Robinson. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Affinity is focused on industries like investment banking and venture capital, where there aren’t CRMs or networking platforms that cater to the specific needs of the long-term relationship.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relationships ultimately close deals, but long-term relationships come with a lot of baggage, i.e. email interactions, documents and meetings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.affinity.co/">Affinity</a> wants to take what Ray Zhou, co-founder and CEO, refers to as “data exhaust,” all of those daily interactions and communications, and apply machine learning analysis and provide insights on who in the organization has the best chance of getting that initial meeting and closing the deal.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $80 million in Series C funding, led by Menlo Ventures, which was joined by Advance Venture Partners, Sprints Capital, Pear Ventures, Sway Ventures, MassMutual Ventures, Teamworthy and ECT Capital Partners’ Brian N. Sheth. The new funding gives the company $120 million in total funding since it was founded in 2014.</p>
<p>Affinity, based in San Francisco, is focused on industries like investment banking, private equity, venture capital, consulting and real estate, where Zhou told TechCrunch there aren’t customer relationship management systems or networking platforms that cater to the specific needs of the long-term relationship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stanford grads Zhou and co-founder Shubham Goel started the company after recognizing that while there was software for transactional relationships, there wasn’t a good option for the relationship journeys.</p>
<p>He cites data that show <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/07/10/why-ai-can-fix-the-crm-problem/?sh=1c0a75b07ce7">up to 90% of company profiles and contact information living in traditional CRM systems are incomplete or out of date</a>. This comes as market researcher Gartner reported <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4001096-market-share-customer-experience-and-relationship-manage">the global CRM software market</a> grew 12.6% to $69 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is almost bigger than sales,&#8221; Zhou said. “Our worldview is that relationships are the biggest industries in the world. Some would disagree, but relationships are an asset class, they are a currency that separates the winners from the losers.”</p>
<p>Instead, Affinity created “a new breed of CRM,”  Zhou said, that automates the inputting of that data constantly and adds information, like revenue, staff size and funding from proprietary data sources, to assign a score to a potential opportunity and increase the chances of closing a deal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199617" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199617" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199617 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png" alt="" width="2880" height="1810" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=1536,965 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=2048,1287 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199617" class="wp-caption-text">Affinity people profile. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Affinity</p></div></p>
<p>He intends to use the new funding to expand sales, marketing and engineering to support new products and customers. The company has 125 employees currently; Zhou expects to be over 200 by next year.</p>
<p>To date, the company’s platform has analyzed over 18 trillion emails and 213 million calendar events and currently drives over 500,000 new introductions and tracks 450,000 deals per month. It also has more than 1,700 customers in 70 countries, boasting a list that includes Bain Capital Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, SoftBank Group, Nike, Qualcomm and Twilio.</p>
<p>Tyler Sosin, partner at Menlo Ventures, said he met Zhou and Goel at a time when the firm was looking into CRM companies, but it wasn’t until years later that Affinity came up again when Menlo itself wanted to work with a more modern platform.</p>
<p>As a user of Affinity himself, Sosin said the platform gives him the data he cares about and “removes the manual drudgery of entry and friction in the process.” Affinity also built a product that was intuitive to navigate.</p>
<p>“We have always had an interest in getting CRMs to the next generation, and Affinity is defining itself in a new category of relationship intelligence and just crushing it in the private capital markets,” he said. “They are scaling at an impressive growth rate and solving a hard problem that we don’t see many other companies in the space doing.”</p>

But if you can&#8217;t remember the chaos that ensued when the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/03/heart-heart-heart/">heart react</a> replaced the favorite star in 2015&#8230; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/03/hearts-and-stars-twitter/">brace yourself</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, Twitter added<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/twitter-dms-now-have-emoji-reactions/"> emoji reactions to DMs</a>, but this isn&#8217;t the same set of emojis. This announcement comes after Twitter<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/"> surveyed users</a> in March about how they&#8217;d react (ha) if the platform were to adopt a Facebook-like way to engage with tweets, and what emojis they&#8217;d want to communicate with. In the survey, some of the proposed emoji sets included &#8220;agree&#8221; or &#8220;disagree&#8221; buttons, a dislike button, or Reddit-like upvotes and downvotes. But Twitter found from its survey that users were concerned about getting negative emoji feedback.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199899" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199899" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2199899" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-08-at-7.20.27-PM.png?w=410" alt="" width="410" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-08-at-7.20.27-PM.png 732w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-08-at-7.20.27-PM.png?resize=90,150 90w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-08-at-7.20.27-PM.png?resize=181,300 181w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-08-at-7.20.27-PM.png?resize=410,680 410w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-08-at-7.20.27-PM.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199899" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/WFBrother/status/1374633883593887747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emoji sets that Twitter surveyed users about in March.

<p>&#8220;Although ‘frustration’ and ‘anger’ are also common emotions people feel while reading Tweets, and some people want to express disagreement with Tweets, we’re not incorporating these as emoji reactions right now,&#8221; Twitter said in a press release. &#8220;Our goal is always to support healthy public conversation and we want to see how our current set of emoji will impact conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike Facebook, which added reactions in 2015, Twitter isn&#8217;t testing an &#8220;angry&#8221; reaction, which was proposed in its survey. This is likely due to users&#8217; hesitancy around negative responses, but still &#8212; if you&#8217;ve never been on the receiving end of an ill-intended &#8220;ha ha&#8221; react&#8230; Good for you! And it&#8217;s not as though arguments don&#8217;t happen on Twitter without emoji reactions.</p>

<p>Twitter says that it wants emoji reactions to give people an easier way to show how they feel, which would &#8212; in a perfect world &#8212; lead to improved expression and participation in public conversation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This test is only the latest feature that Twitter has tinkered with in the last week. You may also notice interest-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">communities</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/twitter-full-width-image-tweets-test/">full-width</a> photos and videos, and new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-tests-a-safety-feature-on-web-to-remove-followers-without-blocking-them/">safety features</a> cropping up on your feed. With this particular experiment, Twitter said that it will continue to consider community feedback as it tests additional emoji reactions. Based on user responses, it may expand the test&#8217;s availability to other regions.</p>
<p>Users in Turkey can experiment with this feature on iOS, Android, and web, which will roll out across the country in the coming days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.varomoney.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varo Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/mobile-banking-startup-varo-is-becoming-a-real-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year became</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first U.S. neobank to be granted a national bank charter, announced this morning it has raised a staggering $510 million in a Series E funding round at a $2.5 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The massive &#8220;oversubscribed&#8221; financing comes nearly seven months after the fintech startup </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/varo-bank-raises-another-63m-led-by-nba-star-russell-westbrook/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $63 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a round led by NBA star Russell Westbrook, who also joined the startup as an advisor focused on the direction of Varo Bank’s programs aimed at underserved communities, including communities of color.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varo declined to reveal any hard revenue figures but did note that in the 13 months since obtaining its bank charter, the company has doubled its number of opened accounts to four million and tripled its revenue. The latest financing brings the San Francisco-based startup’s total raised to $992.4 million since its 2015 inception, meaning that this round alone effectively amounts to nearly $30 million more than what the company has raised over its lifetime. Varo has previously never disclosed valuation, but it did note that the $2.5 billion valuation figure is up &#8220;5x&#8221; since May of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its last raise, in February, Varo touted 3 million opened accounts. Doing the math we can deduce that the startup has added one million new accounts over the past seven months. At the time of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/challenger-bank-varo-soon-to-become-a-real-bank-raises-241m-series-d/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$241 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last June (that included participation from U2’s Bono), Varo counted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 2 million banking and savings accounts.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Varo Bank raises another $63M, led by NBA star Russell Westbrook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/varo-bank-raises-another-63m-led-by-nba-star-russell-westbrook/embed/#?secret=YuDjA5o0Lg" data-secret="YuDjA5o0Lg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investor Lone Pine Capital led the latest round, along with “dozens” of additional new backers, including Declaration Partners, Eldridge, Marshall Wace, Berkshire Partners/Stockbridge and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. They joined existing investors Warburg Pincus, The Rise Fund, Gallatin Point Capital and HarbourVest Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Varo announced it had been granted a national bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and secured regulatory approvals from the FDIC and Federal Reserve to open Varo Bank, N.A. — effectively becoming a “real” bank but with no physical branches.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO and founder Colin Walsh told TechCrunch that the move had a significant impact on his company&#8217;s growth. First off, it effectively eliminated an intermediary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being in the regulated system loop has allowed us to expand our margins considerably,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We also now have direct access to the payment network so our ability to generate substantial value both to our consumers as well as to our shareholders is becoming more and more apparent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walsh also said that Varo is not yet profitable, but is on its way there. He predicts that Varo will achieve profitability in about two years, or three years after becoming a bank.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the nice things that the charter affords us is that we can actually pursue growth and profitability at the same time,&#8221; Walsh said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very much within that three-year window of when we became a bank.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in the last 13 months, Varo has nearly doubled its employee count to nearly 800 today and expanded into a third hub in Charlotte, North Carolina.</span></p>
<p>Walsh admits that the raise was not necessarily in the company&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We didn&#8217;t set out to raise this much money. It was coming in fast and furious and we were at like $510 [million] and I finally said, &#8216;Ok, enough,&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;But the fact that we were able to raise this money without even really trying is evidence of the fact that there&#8217;s something happening that is just very culturally relevant in this moment and our success to me is very much about having that kind of impact at scale.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The executive added that the choice of lead investor did tie in to its eventual plans to go public.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a very reputable sophisticated crossover investor that invests in high-growth, high-potential private market companies and ultimately work with them to go public,&#8221; Walsh told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely on the roadmap for us as I think there&#8217;s a ton of value we can create as a public company when the time is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Existing investors, he added, aren&#8217;t putting pressure on Varo for that to happen. And so, Walsh predicts any move in that direction will only take place sometime &#8220;in the next couple of years.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said that down the line, it&#8217;s possible that Varo would explore a global expansion.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varo launched in 2017 with a mission to become “an all digital, mission-driven, FDIC insured bank designed around the modern American consumer,” Walsh said. Today, the company’s core product offerings include “premium” bank accounts that have no minimum balance requirement or monthly account fee and high-interest savings accounts combined with a suite of “tech-first features” designed to help people save and manage their money.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Neobanks&#8217; moves toward profitability could be the path to public markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/neobanks-moves-toward-profitability-could-be-the-path-to-public-markets/embed/#?secret=Nn74specfR" data-secret="Nn74specfR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It recently launched Varo Advance, a short-term line of credit that gives qualifying customers a way to secure a cash advance of up to $100 within its app “in seconds” and Varo Perks cashback rewards. The company also has plans to launch Varo Believe, a credit building credit card program designed to help Varo customers “safely build or repair their credit,” with a flexible security deposit and without fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will go toward continued investment in its products, risk platform and design, according to Walsh. Varo&#8217;s goal is to scale to &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of consumers and to become a &#8220;l</span>oved brand recognized for its social impact mission,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Since the beginning, the startup has been vocal about its intent to help boost financial inclusion with its offerings that aim to serve marginalized and underserved communities that it says have been historically excluded from traditional financial institutions. For Walsh, that remains important.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We believe we&#8217;re on the cusp of creating what will be an iconic brand that&#8217;s doing good in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to be like the &#8216;Patagonia of banking,&#8217; like where people feel really good about the company and what we&#8217;re doing and the impact we&#8217;re having on people&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varo Bank competes with a growing number of all-digital banks operating in the U.S., including Chime, Current, N26, Level, Step, Moven, Empower Finance, Dave, GoBank, Aspiration, Stash, Zero and </span><a href="https://neobanks.app/neobanks/united-states"><span style="font-weight: 400;">others</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Like many other fintechs, Varo saw a pandemic-related boost in business.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been a time when many re-evaluated their banking relationships and decided to switch to a digital bank that offers far better value and more convenience than a traditional bank,&#8221; Walsh said.</p>
<p>Lone Pine Capital&#8217;s David Craver said of his new investment: “What the Varo team has been able to achieve in such a short time in the market is truly remarkable. This is a group of trailblazers who are well on their way to building one of America’s next generation of iconic companies.</p>
<p>Warburg Pincus&#8217; Todd Schell and Varo investor said from day one, his firm was aligned with Walsh&#8217;s view that the bank charter was fundamental to a long term sustainable business model.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In Varo we saw the opportunity to radically redefine a cost structure, introduce new products across a wide variety of categories, and uniquely solve use cases which have historically been out of scope,&#8221; Schell wrote via email. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Varo today has all of the pieces to this puzzle, including a next generation banking technology stack, the license to operate and fully derive the benefits of it, and the capital to scale. V</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">aro already serves millions of Americas, but we believe it has the potential to reinvent financial services for tens of millions of people around the world.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRISPR-based biotech startup Mammoth Biosciences is officially a unicorn, the company says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The billion dollar valuation comes on the back of a $150 million series D round led by Redmile Group, with participation from Foresite Capital, Senator Investment Group, Sixth Street, Greenspring Associates, Mayfield, Decheng Capital, Plum Alley and NFX. Combined with a late 2020 Series C round of $45 million (which included participation from Amazon), this brings the company’s total financing to $195 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth Biosciences has been a major player in the CRISPR space since its founding in 2017. CRISPR, put simply, is a pair of biological scissors that can cut and replace genes in cells and living organisms, opening up the potential to perhaps permanently cure genetic disease, and perform DNA-based diagnostics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the company’s four founders is one of the original discoverers of CRISPR, Jennifer Doudna, who recently won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Emmaneulle Charpentier for their 2012 work demonstrating the CRISPR could be used to cut DNA. The company’s other co-founders are Janice Chen (CTO), Lucas Harrington (CSO), and Trevor Martin, (CEO). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a handful of other CRISPR-based companies out there, including a number that are already publicly traded. This unicorn milestone stands as a sign that Mammoth’s unique approach to CRISPR could help it distinguish itself in that landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a milestone,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says Ursheet Parikh, the co-leader of Mayfield’s engineering biology investment practice. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think the company has a long way to go from here. This round and this valuation are just signifying the promise of this stage of what the future will hold,” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parikh says he sees Mammoth as a CRISPR “platform.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth has been discovering new types of CRISPR systems that could be used to solve specific biological problems. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best analog is, before you had Intel and Microsoft, if somebody wanted to build a new application, they would have to build a whole new computer function with an operating system,” says Parikh. “You don’t have to build a CRISPR solution from the ground-up. You can work with Mammoth to find the right proteins for specific problems.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRISPR system most people think of when they hear the phrase is a two part mechanism called CRISPR/Cas-9. The actual molecular scissors that cut DNA (and allow for the editing to happen) is typically the Cas-9 protein. However, there’s a whole ecosystem of Cas proteins out there that can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">also </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut DNA, and as Mammoth’s leadership argues, can do so even better in the original depending on the application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth is creating a “CRISPR toolbox” or a collection of different Cas proteins. You could think of them as different types of scissors that each have their own specific use cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 2020, for instance Mammoth discovered a family of proteins called the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/mammoth-biosciences-lands-exclusive-license-to-new-crispr-proteins-that-could-boost-gene-editing-precision/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Casɸ family</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This family is an ultra-small version of the typical Cas9 proteins that may make it easier to develop therapies in living people, and could enhance the precision of gene-editing. Mammoth has also characterized a Cas14 system, another family of ultra-small proteins that latch on to different target sequences in the genome (like landing pads that tell Cas proteins approximately where to cut) than the Cas9 proteins do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mammoth was really founded with this idea that there&#8217;s this whole universe kind of a CRISPR that goes beyond the legacy systems like Cas9,” says Martin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of a CRISPR toolkit isn’t just interesting science, it’s also a smart business move for Mammoth for another reason: intellectual property ownership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original CRISPR/Cas9 system has been the subject of a </span><a href="https://synbiobeta.com/who-owns-crispr-in-2021-its-even-more-complicated-than-you-think/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">patent battle </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between the University of California Berkeley, and MIT’s Broad Institute, where scientists also discovered CRISPR around the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newer Cas proteins, not part of this patent battle, allow Mammoth to completely sidestep that concern. “The patent disputes that the Broad is involved in concern legacy CRISPR-Cas9 systems. Mammoth&#8217;s systems are not Cas9-based, so they are not subject to these disputes,” Martin clarifies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, Mammoth has been building up a collection of proprietary tools that might later be put to use. Though the possibilities are nearly limitless (genetic medicine or CRISPR-based diagnostics) many of these therapeutic products don’t exist quite yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 was a big year for CRISPR therapeutics due to an influx of </span><a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=CRISPR&amp;Search=Apply&amp;recrs=b&amp;recrs=a&amp;recrs=f&amp;recrs=d&amp;age_v=&amp;gndr=&amp;type=&amp;rslt="><span style="font-weight: 400;">new clinical trials. That </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggesting therapeutics are just beginning to work their way through the regulatory requirements – though approvals are still far off. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals have announced promising results from trials on CRISPR-based beta thalassemia and sickle cell treatments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this summer, Intellia Therapeutics </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(another company co-founded by Doudna) and Regeneron</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took the field a step further, </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2031054"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that CRISPR-based treatments injected directly into the body were useful in silencing a gene that causes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATTR amyloidosis, a disorder where proteins produced in the liver are misfolded (this can lead to complications, like heart failure over time). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth’s niche in the expanding world of CRISPR therapeutics, notes Martin, will be a focus on in-vivo applications (or therapies delivered in the human body) which he argues their CRISPR toolbox may enable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t have a timeline [for potential products] on the therapeutic side but we&#8217;ll definitely be releasing more information over the next few years and we&#8217;ve been really excited about the technical results so far,” says Martin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnostics, however, is already an area where Mammoth could distinguish itself sooner rather than later. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, the company is already working with partners to create viable products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, Mammoth </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mriglobal-to-perform-work-on-darpa-diget-program-301207845.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earned funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">point-of-care test that could detect up to 10 pathogens at once, and a larger, lab-based test that could detect up to 1,000. Mammoth has also </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/mammoth-biosciencess-crispr-based-covid-19-test-receives-nih-fundings-through-radx-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Institutes of Health (NIH) Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop advanced diagnostics using CRISPR, and entered into a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/mammoth-biosciences-partners-with-gsk-to-develop-handheld-crispr-based-covid-19-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnership with GSK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop a point-of-care Covid-19 test that could detect viral RNA in about 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth has continued to straddle both worlds of diagnostics and therapeutics, despite “pressure” to fit into one box or the other, says Parikh. The unicorn valuation, he adds, is an additional sign that the company’s technology can operate in both worlds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think what this milestone, this round, does, is validate their approach to company building, which was really to focus on an area of expertise, rather than just putting themselves in a box, of diagnostics or therapeutics,” he says.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This has felt like an inevitability at least since Amazon teamed with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/amazon-built-fire-tv-directly-into-a-cheap-4k-set/">South Carolina-based Element Electronics to bring the world a 43-inch Amazon Fire TV Edition</a> back in 2017. The company has also teamed with several third-party TV makers to build its popular voice assistant into sets, but today Amazon is taking things to the next level with the arrival of two new smart TVs, the Fire TV Omni Series and 4-Series.</p>
<p>The company is calling these the “first-ever Amazon-built smart TVs,” implying that they were purpose built, ground up, rather than slapping its voice technology into a set built and branded by another company.</p>
<p>The Fire TV Omni Series is the headliner &#8212; and more premium of the pair. Though, the price is still pretty low, as far as these things go, with a starting point of $410. That’s $40 cheaper than the aforementioned Amazon-branded Element system.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7x414p5r9W4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“Smart TVs have been around for decades, but we don’t think they’re really smart,” Amazon VP Daniel Rausch tells TechCrunch. “They&#8217;re not really that capable compared to what customers would love to get from them. More often than not, TVs present a passive experience. It can be complex and difficult to interact with. There are many heterogeneous devices and content experiences in our living rooms. And I think coordinating across all that is probably only grown in complexity for customers. We believe that with voice and ambient computing, TVs really have the potential to do so much more and to be so much smarter for customers.”</p>
<p>The company is entering a crowded space, with stiff competition from the likes of Samsung and LG (even if the seemingly decades-long rumors of an Apple Television have thus far proven fruitless). Naturally, the company is looking to distinguish itself with Alexa integration. The Omni set features far-field technology to use voice for a range of activities, from TV watching, to music and gaming.</p>
<p>The system features new integration with the recently rolled out Alexa conversations, offering a more natural way to ask the assistant things like “Alexa, what should I watch,” (that specific command won’t be out until later this year in a beta form), “Alexa, Play Something from Netflix,” (ditto, but for the fall) and the same feature for TikTok. The wildly popular social network launched on Fire TV in the U.K., Germany and France and is coming soon to North America. Now you can watch short videos on up to a 75-inch screen, if you’re so inclined.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2199842" style="width: 4046px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199842" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199842 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fire-TV-4-Series_front-e1631145467861.jpg" alt="" width="4036" height="2624" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199842" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The Omni is available in 43-, 50-, 55-, 65- and 75-inch models, all with 4K resolution. There’s on-board support for HDR10, HLG and Dolby Digital Plus, while the larger two models sport Dolby Vision support. There doesn’t seem to be a ton of differences between the Omni and the cheaper 4-Series. The latter starts at $370 and comes in 43-, 50- and 55-inch sizes, again all in 4K. The biggest difference between the two lines appears to be that the 4-Series has near-field Alexa capabilities built into its remote, while the Omni has far-field directly built into the set.</p>
<p>The new TVs arrive next month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199854" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199854" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2199854 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-Max-e1631145060388.jpg?w=187" alt="" width="187" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199854" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The TVs are joined by the new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max. The $55 streaming stick offers a number of the above voice features, coupled with a quad-core 1.8GHz processer and 2GB of RAM, promising better performance. The stick supports WiFi 6 and, naturally, Amazon’s gaming service, Luna.</p>
<p>Probably the most surprising bit in all of this is the appearance of Pioneer’s name. Years after dropping its beloved plasma line due to low margins, the company is returning to the TV space with a new 4K set bundled with an Alexa remote. The 43-inch version is scheduled to arrive through Amazon and Best Buy in September, while a 50-inch version is set to arrive two months later.</p>
<p>Toshiba’s upcoming set, meanwhile, has far-field tech built in. That will come in 55-, 65- and 75-inch models and is set for a spring 2022 debut.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AV8 supports entrepreneurs developing artificial intelligence-driven technologies in the areas of health, mobility, enterprise and deep-tech.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.av8.vc/">AV8 Ventures</a> unveiled its AV8 Ventures II fund with $180 million from Allianz Group, an insurance and asset management giant, aimed at supporting entrepreneurs developing artificial intelligence-driven technologies in the areas of health, mobility, enterprise and deep tech.</p>
<p>Since the Palo Alto venture firm’s launch in 2018, it has invested in 20 seed-stage companies, with another four in the pipeline. Its first fund was also $180 million and backed by Allianz, George Ugras, managing director at AV8, told TechCrunch. The new fund will also invest in seed stage and some Series A and will aim to go into 25 companies.</p>
<p>“The idea is to operate as a financial VC with the support of the world’ largest insurance company and asset manager behind us,” Ugras said.</p>
<p>Some of the technologies the firm is excited about include how chronic diseases are managed. Ugras believes the lack of access to swaths of data and alignment of interest around the table are prohibiting many of the right solutions from bubbling up. In enterprise, AV8 is looking at management around cyberattacks, predicting vulnerabilities and the impact they have on enterprises, so that companies can be proactive in securing their vulnerabilities versus reactive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the driver for the second fund was to ensure continuity in deal activity. AV8 “is seeing so many deals right now,” and the competition to get into a VC deal makes it difficult to project how fast a fund will be able to deploy the capital. Even if a firm gets excited and issues terms sheets, there is always uncertainty, he added.</p>
<p>With venture capital being abundant these days, Ugras noted that the velocity is the fastest he has seen in 22 years. The competitiveness in the market is such that if a startup has a decent team, there is no issue raising capital. However, on the investor side, they have to do things better than ever.</p>
<p>“In terms of the key diligence, you need domain expertise to be very clear on how you can add value and key execution milestones going forward,” he added. “Healthcare and insurance more so than others because the business models are complicated. If you have the startups educating you on the front end, it is going to be difficult for the fund.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airplanes and drones today, regardless of size or fuel type, all face the same limitation: eventually they have to land.</p>
<p>Skydweller Aero, the U.S.-Spanish aerospace startup, wants to break free from that constraint by developing an autonomous solar-powered aircraft it says will eventually be capable of perpetual flight.</p>
<p>Their pitch, which helped the company raise $32 million in a Series A, has led to an additional $8 million in oversubscribed funding led by Leonardo S.p.A, Marlinspike Capital and Advection Growth Capital. The company has also entered into a partnership with Palantir Technologies to use its Foundry analytics platform to process information at-scale and onboard the aircraft designed for telecommunications, government operations and emergency services.</p>
<p>“[Palantir is] the best at creating value from your data, whether it&#8217;s putting data into their system to create operational insights for how we may fly our aircraft, putting data in to understand the sensing systems that are coming off of our aircraft and what those might provide, or to understand what&#8217;s coming through the networks in the aircraft,” Skydweller co-founder John Parkes told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>And Skydweller will be generating a lot of data. The company is focused on three data-rich markets: telecommunications, geospatial intelligence and government surveillance. Skydweller plans to use the Foundry platform to help its customers, which includes the government, better understand whatever areas are being monitored.</p>
<p>The Foundry platform will also come in handy for route and mission planning, as Skydweller intends to leverage weather and atmospheric information to ensure the aircraft can efficiently use the sun’s rays to stay in the air.</p>
<p>“What it&#8217;s all about is creating a persistent aerial layer or pseudo satellite,” Parkes said. “We&#8217;re focused on building a perpetual flight aircraft. The goal is to create a plane that will fly for forever, so long as the sun rises.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Weather and atmospheric data is especially important as it will determine, in part, the altitude at which the aircraft flies. While the plane will be able to fly at high altitudes, “the harder problem and the more useful problem,” according to Parkes, is to capture enough energy and use weather planning to stay at lower altitude. Lower altitudes give better internet quality, geospatial data, and provide more power for payload, he said.</p>

<p>Skydweller’s tech was born out of the Swiss solar aircraft project dubbed Solar Impulse, which was helmed by Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg. The project operated for 14 years and invested $190 million into the solar-powered aircraft, before the foundation behind it sold the intellectual property to Skydweller in 2019. The Solar Impulse was configured to be piloted, however, so much of the work since then has been to unman the platform and turn it into an ultra-long endurance aircraft, Parkes said.</p>
<p>The aircraft is all-electric, outfitted with 2,200 square-foot solar panel wings, 600 kilograms of batteries and a hydrogen fuel cell back-up power system. The solar panels aren’t only used to maintain flight; they will also power systems for customers, like a geospatial camera system or payload from a telecom company.</p>
<p>The company’s using standard commercial aviation parts but most of them haven’t been tested beyond a certain number of hours of use – certainly far less than the number of hours Skydweller plans to keep the aircraft in the air. Plus, like other planes built from emerging technologies, there isn’t a full certification framework already established for the vehicle</p>
<p>“You’re into that uncharted territory to break some of those hour paradigms,” he said.</p>
<p>Skydweller launched its flight test campaign in 2020, and has focused on installing and testing the autonomous systems tech since. He added that “in a very short horizon” the company will be test flying the autonomous aircraft, including take-off, full flight and landing, with future milestones focused on completing long-endurance flights. Customers will be able to start licensing the aircraft within a year to eighteen months, Parkes estimated.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Edtech's boom is rivaled by that of the creator economy, which promises to help creators monetize and democratize their passions, all while maintaining their identity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Revitalized by the pandemic, entrepreneurs are on the hunt to refresh some of education’s most traditional tenets, from flashcards to tutors to after-school programs. And those aren’t just bets: They’re unicorn-valued businesses looking to capitalize on consumers’ newfound digital adoption.</p>
<p>The edtech sector’s boom is rivaled by that of the creator economy, which promises to help creators monetize and democratize their passions, all while maintaining their identity. The creator economy has grown over the past year due to an increased appetite for digital content from at-home eyeballs and a wave of new creators eager to meet demand.</p>
<p>Edtech and the creator economy certainly differ in the problems they try to solve: Finding a VR solution to make online STEM classes more realistic is a different nut to crack than streamlining all of a creator’s different monetization strategies into one platform. Still, the two sectors have found common ground in the past year &#8212; as encapsulated by the rise of cohort-based class platforms.</p>
<p>At large, cohort-based platforms help experts launch classes for their communities, no previous teaching experience required. Students move through the class together &#8212; ergo “cohort” &#8212; with the expert on-demand as a sounding board. It’s a bet on education, but it also allows an individual to showcase their passion by pushing all their chips to the center of the table rather than working for an institution. While the idea of experts teaching a group of people isn’t exactly new, it’s being refreshed by a wave of new startups.</p>
<p>It’s not a simple overlap, entrepreneurs and investors say. Some fear that turning creators into educators could bring in a rush of unqualified teachers with no understanding of true pedagogy, while others think that the true democratization of education requires a disruption of who is traditionally given the right to educate.</p>
<h2>Anyone’s a teacher!</h2>
<p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) and traditional institutions are built around the belief that students want to learn from accredited teachers, while many cohort-based platforms are forming around a more controversial, yet compelling, ethos: Anyone can be a teacher. The idea of empowering people to monetize their talents is a page directly out of the creator economy rulebook.</p>
<p>In other words, instead of convincing a college professor to teach in their spare time, what if you convinced the star product manager at a tech startup to launch a class sharing their tips and trade secrets? It’s not a theory; it’s a venture-backed business. Mighty Networks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/mighty-networks-raises-50m-to-build-a-creator-economy-for-the-masses/">raised a $50 million Series B</a> to help its creators launch classes. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/nas-academy-raises-11-million-to-help-creators-build-their-own-masterclass-like-courses/">Nas Academy raised $11 million to help creators launch their own MasterClass-type series.</a> Then there’s <a href="https://maven.com/">Maven</a>, an early-stage edtech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/udemy-and-altmba-co-founders-return-to-edtech-with-a-new-stealthy-business/">that raised millions before it even had a name</a> &#8212; and led the charge on popularizing cohort-based classes as a branding move to begin with.</p>
<p>These companies sit at the intersection of edtech &#8212; and its evolving views on how education should look &#8212; and the creator economy, with its empowering premise of &#8220;individuals as a business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark Tan has taken part in a dozen fellowships and received years of coaching through his years in tech. For Tan, who moved from the Philippines to the United States, the allure of virtual classes has always been the network of students also participating in the program. That virtual networking led him to stints at Amazon and Twitch, and, most recently, he spent the last three years working as a director of product at Wyze.</p>
<p>The realization that “you don’t need to be an expert teacher, just an expert” is what eventually gave Tan the confidence to launch a course of his own on Maven. It will begin in a few weeks and is about community-driven product development.</p>
<p>“I’ve been in fellowships with people who are really well known, and sometimes it’s hard to connect with them because they&#8217;ve been in my shoes five or 10 years ago,” he said. “I think there’s an overreliance on the expert being the teacher.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1817409" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1817409" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1817409" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bulb-on-off1.gif" alt="light bulb flickering on and off" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-1817409" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>“Over time, what I realized is that there’s way more stuff to learn from other people, so I spent more time connecting to [my peers] rather than spending time listening to the lecture.”</p>
<p>His four-week class was originally priced at $799 but now costs $599 and requires a commitment of five to 10 hours per week. Programming will range from live weekly workshops and open Q&amp;As to guest speakers and peer-to-peer networking.</p>
<p>In many ways, Tan is the quintessential example that cohort-based platform founders look for when trying to bring creators onto their service. He has experience at big, well-known companies, has spent years experiencing the product he is now selling and has a passion for education after seeing the benefit of peer-to-peer learning firsthand.</p>
<p>“The best teachers are the ones who haven’t been teachers before,” said Ana Fabrega, who spent years as a primary school teacher before joining Synthesis, an online enrichment school inspired by Elon Musk’s Ad Astra model. “I think that the instinct of a teacher is to jump in and try to control, over-engineer and plan everything so kids don’t struggle … but I think the approach that works the best is [by doing] the opposite.”</p>
<p>Synthesis focuses more on creating good facilitators that can sense engagement and create intimacy with students than educators who focus on a specific curriculum to hit certain metrics, Fabrega explained.</p>
<p>“We really want to make sure that the kids are the ones in charge and doing all the heavy lifting, not the teachers,” she said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.scalapay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scalapay</a>, a buy-now, pay-later (BNPL) technology provider that has made significant headway with retailers and consumers in Europe and in categories like fashion, has closed a round of funding that it will be using to fuel its expansion ambitions. The startup has raised $155 million at a $700 million valuation.</p>
<p>Tiger Global is leading this round, with new backers Baleen Capital and Woodson Capital also participating, alongside Fasanara Capital and Ithaca Investments, which had backed Scalapay in its previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/scalapay-raises-48m-to-scale-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$48 million round earlier this year</a>. (Scalapay has now raised $203 million in total.)</p>
<p>This is a sizable round of funding given Scalapay&#8217;s age: the company is only two years old and this is a Series A. Ramping up in this way underscores just how hot the BNPL market is right now, and also how the startup has been faring within that.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s service is based around being tightly integrated with online retailers&#8217; check-out process and offering users an interest-free, three-installment way to pay for anything they purchase. It now works with 3,000 merchants in Europe &#8212; specifically Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Finland, Belgium, Netherlands and Austria &#8212; and it has yet to move into huge markets like the U.S. and U.K.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we launched, we saw between 5% and 10% of all transactions for our customers go through Scalapay,&#8221; CEO Simone Mancini, who co-founded the company with Johnny Mitrevski, said in an interview. &#8220;Now we are at 15%-20% and its growing. In luxury fashion we&#8217;re accounting for 30%-50% of all transactions, and in some cases more than half. We want to be the thing that makes purchasing pleasurable again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pleasurable, and more likely to happen: while shopping cart abandonment continues to be an issue for all online retailers, Scalapay claims that its existence has increased conversions by 11%, and gives consumers the confidence to spend more, typically 48% more per shopper.</p>
<p>The growth of buy-now, pay-later services has been one of big hallmarks of the pandemic-era e-commerce market. Although the option to pay for items in installments had been around for years before Covid-19 &#8212; indeed, layaway and other delayed payment services were big even before e-commerce was a thing &#8212; usage of BNPL saw a new boost of attention on the back of way more people using online channels to shop, and &#8212; given the uncertainties of the economy &#8212; way more of them needing some financial help ultimately to make purchases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That was complemented too by a new and more sophisticated approach: the leading BNPL providers are bringing together a much more ambitious big-data play, leveraging wider risk analysis and a much more creative and complete picture of a person and his/her finances in order to better understand what to expect out of any transaction. The algorithms and how they direct the course of transactions have become as important as the accessibility of the services themselves.</p>
<p>All of this has led to a huge rush of big BNPL companies getting even bigger. Klarna, which has long been seen as the most valuable startup in Europe (in terms of paper valuation) raised money at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valuation of nearly $46 billion in June</a>. Affirm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public at the start of the year</a> and is currently valued at aorund $23 billion. PayPal re-upped its own ambitions in the market with an Asian kicker just this week: it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired Paidy in Japan for nearly $3 billion</a>. And of course Square has waded into the space in a big way with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$29 billion acquisition of Afterpay</a> in June.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s before you consider the many smaller BNPL companies that have raised and are raising money. They include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uks-zilch-raises-80m-at-a-500m-valuation-for-its-direct-to-consumer-buy-now-pay-later-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zilch</a>, which is now valued at over $500 million; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-60m-for-its-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resolve</a>, a spinout from Affirm, which has raised $60 million.</p>
<p>In that context, Scalapay&#8217;s $700 million valuation seems modest &#8212; maybe even a little like a bargain? You may not be surprised that this latest fundraising happened on the heels of the startup actually getting approached to be acquired, not by one but by two different companies, which were interested in the technology, but also the fact that Scalapay had made significant headway into specific markets &#8212; geographically, in Europe; and also in terms of product categories, specifically fashion &#8212; where they are keen to grow.</p>
<p>Mancini declined to say which companies except to note they were among the biggest of the lot. (Just my inference, but maybe the acquisition pace of some of the bigger players gives a clue as to whom it might have been?) In any case, Scalapay said no, but the chatter got other things moving, and that is how Tiger Global came into the picture.</p>
<p>Big investor pockets could prove to be a key part of how any of these companies fare going forward: relationship building and expanding your own pool of talent will be key for growing, both areas where having the right contacts and the right resources to meet new demands will come in handy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scalapay has quickly become an important player in European payments and the BNPL sector,” said Alex Cook, Partner, Tiger Global, in a statement. “We are impressed by their product development pipeline and strong focus on merchant success. We are excited to support Scalapay in the next phase of its growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly the company said it plans to stay very focused on improving the process of BNPL rather than diversify into other areas like fintech (areas where Affirm and Klarna are doing a lot); or the wider area of payments (an obvious move for Afterpay and Square).</p>
<p>“While the likes of Klarna and Afterpay have launched deposit accounts and moved further into the banking space, Scalapay’s exciting roadmap is laser focused on helping merchants with new customer experiences that increase conversion. They’re leveraging BNPL in an entirely new way,” added Francesco Filia, CEO of Fasanara Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A serial entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tak-hiroshi-takatoh/?originalSubdomain=jp">Hiroshi Takatoh</a> recognized the need for convenient and nutritious food for critically ill consumers after losing his late wife to cancer.</p>
<p>Takatoh founded <a href="https://teatismeal.com/">Teatis</a>, a plant-based sugar blocking superfood powder for diabetic consumers, in 2017 in stealth mode and went fully operational in April 2021 by teaming up with a group of doctors and registered nutritionists.</p>
<p>Teatis announced today it has raised $700,000 seed funding to advance its growth in the US market.  The seed money brings Teatis’ total funding to over $1million.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by <a href="https://www.genesiaventures.com/en/top-en/">Genesia Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryonations/">Ryo Ishizuka</a>, former CEO and co-founder of Japanese e-commerce company Mercari and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/takuya-noguchi-47e9">Takuya Noguchi</a>, CEO and founder of Japan’s skincare brand BULK HOMME. Seven other angel investors also participated in the seed funding.</p>
<p>Teatis will use the seed money for production and marketing in the US, where 122 million diabetics and pre-diabetics continue to work for prevention and treatment against diabetes, CEO and co-founder of Teatis Hiroshi Takatoh told TechCrunch. The company is now focusing on the US market where its production is located while its next funding, a Series A, is set for next year, Takatoh added.</p>
<p>“Most of our consumers, about 88%, are diabetics, and our recipe is built to help diabetics manage their blood sugar. A staggering number of Americans suffer from diabetes, and there is significant demand for diabetic-friendly foods that are nutritious, convenient and functional,” Takatoh said.</p>
<p>Teatis develops a supplement for all consumers interested in low-sugar foods, as well as pre-diabetics, Takatoh said. Teatis’ plant-based powders does not contain chemicals or sweeteners but include a special Japanese ingredient such as brown seaweed extract (Arame) that is proven to suppress the absorption of sugar from the intestinal tract and reduce blood sugar levels. The low-sugar powder can be made into teas, lattes or added to smoothies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The US meal placement market size for diabetes is estimated at $5 billion while the US consumer packaged foods market for diabetes is approximately $300 billion, Takatoh said.</p>
<p>“We combine food science and technology to solve problems for diabetics through food products and telehealth,” Takatoh said.</p>
<p>With its plan on building out a comprehensive one-stop shop for diabetic health, Teatis will launch a Registered Dietitian platform, <em>Teatis RD on Demand</em>, this month, to offer a full-service such as food products, telehealth, and recipes, for those battling diabetes.</p>
<p><em>Teatis RD on Demand</em> will provide private, 1-on-1 sessions with registered dietitians. It will start at $29 per 30 minutes, which is a reduced cost, versus traditional offline appointments that cost $150 per 30 minutes, and Teledoc, which costs $90 per 30 minutes, according to Takatoh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many existing players in space are old companies that don&#8217;t have digital competency and data-driven production methods. Mr. Takatoh is a proven serial entrepreneur with the qualities and boldness to take over the market&#8230;I&#8217;m excited to see how Teatis&#8217; great ideas and products will help many people who are suffering from diabetes and other chronic diseases in the future,&#8221; Genesia Ventures Manager Shunsuke Sagara said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chef-prepared, small-batch meal delivery startup <a href="https://www.cookunity.com/">CookUnity</a> is undergoing a major expansion after closing a $47 million Series B round.</p>
<p>Insight Partners led the round and was joined by Endeavor Capital and current investors IDCV, Fuel Ventures and Gaingels. The latest funding comes eight months after New York-based CookUnity closed a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cookunity-secures-15-5-million-in-series-a-funding-301207553.html">$15.5 million Series A round</a> led by Fuel Venture Capital. The company has now raised a total of $70 million since its inception in 2018.</p>
<p>Mateo Marietti, founder and CEO of CookUnity, had the idea for the subscription-based company five years ago. Marietti, who is from Argentina, was working in food tech and saw that modern delivery services were only able to offer limited food options and pricing, and was a trade-off between convenience and variety.</p>
<p>He went looking for a similar experience to apps like Spotify, where the music selection was limitless, and created CookUnity to connect creators of food with the people who would be eating it.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WoodSpoon’s food delivery service cooks up support for home chefs with $14M round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/woodspoons-food-delivery-service-cooks-up-support-for-home-chefs-with-14m-round/embed/#?secret=AL3MSTGSi3" data-secret="AL3MSTGSi3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>CookUnity combines the ready-to-eat meal category with a chef-focused business model that provides restaurant-quality meals at home. The rotating menu features hundreds of dishes, starting at $10.49 per meal, with an option of a subscription plan for four, six, eight, 12 or 16 meals per week. Meals heat up in minutes and also include both fast-cooking instructions, like in a microwave, or how the chef might prepare it at home, like with an additional squeeze of lemon or other toppings.</p>

<p>Chefs are also given tools and resources to create a digital-first business, and Marietti told TechCrunch that top-selling chefs bring in upwards of $1 million a year.</p>
<p>“We are building the infrastructure, working with farmers, providing the ingredients and the tech layer for both the consumer app and the chef app,” he added. “We don’t employ any talent or cook the food, but we give chefs the tools to start recruiting cooks, gather information on new recipes, organize their team and expand into new markets while also seeing their sales for the day or week.”</p>
<p>The company’s platform is already working with notable chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Marc Forgione and Esther Choi, and the Series B funding will enable it to add more chefs, including local rising stars and established restaurateurs, enabling them to sell beyond the typical on-demand food delivery zone, Marietti said.</p>
<p>Starting with the flagship kitchen in Brooklyn, CookUnity initially expanded to San Francisco, Dallas-Fort Worth, Boston and Washington, D.C. Following the Series A, the company opened kitchens in Los Angeles, Austin and Chicago. The new funding will now enable the company to accelerate its nationwide expansion with new kitchens in Atlanta and Miami by the end of the year. When all of the new kitchens are online, Marietti estimates that CookUnity will be able to serve 88% of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>In the last 12 months, CookUnity saw over 550% growth and to date has over 50 chefs on its roster, with plans to increase to 150 across all of its kitchens by mid-2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the investment, Rebecca Liu-Doyle, principal at Insight Partners, is joining the CookUnity board of directors. Insight’s model is to track companies for a long time before investing; in CookUnity’s case, Liu-Doyle was watching them for more than two years. She said the timing was right for Insight to invest.</p>
<p>In addition to product-market fit, strong chef retention and liking the company’s focus on the food market, which is a “massive total addressable market,” she said, CookUnity was on its way to building a big business with subscription-based revenue as it took on the complexities of the back-end business for chefs.</p>
<p>The value proposition is unique for both of the stakeholders — on the chef side there is a creator economy tailwind, which is taking the friction out of scaling a business while also enabling chefs to build a business with a larger footprint than they just selling food around their restaurants. On the consumer side, Liu-Doyle said CookUnity is providing affordable and convenient food without having to compromise on taste and quality.</p>
<p>“Very few companies can offer that: it is democratization on both fronts,” she added. “In order to execute on the vision, you need a specific team, which Mateo has, and show incremental improvement to the experience. It doesn&#8217;t just happen overnight. You have to be patient and deliberate in the way you improve the experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Work insights platform <a href="http://www.fin.com/">Fin</a> raised $20 million in Series A funding and brought in Evan Cummack, a former Twilio executive, as its new chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company captures employee workflow data from across applications and turns it into productivity insights to improve the way enterprise teams work and remain engaged.</p>
<p>Fin was founded in 2015 by Andrew Kortina, co-founder of Venmo, and Facebook’s former VP of product and Slow Ventures partner Sam Lessin. Initially, the company was doing voice assistant technology — think Alexa but powered by humans and machine learning — and then workplace analytics software in 2020. You can read more about Fin’s origins at the link below.</p>

<p>The new round was led by Coatue, with participation from First Round Capital, Accel and Kleiner Perkins. The original team was talented, but small, so the new funding will build out sales, marketing and engineering teams, Cummack said.</p>
<p>“At that point, the right thing was to raise money, so at the end of last year, the company raised a $20 million Series A, and it was also decided to find a leadership team that knows how to build an enterprise,” Cummack told TechCrunch. “The company had completely pivoted and removed ‘Analytics’ from our name because it was not encompassing what we do.”</p>
<p>Fin’s software measures productivity and provides insights on ways managers can optimize processes, coach their employees and see how teams are actually using technology to get their work done. At the same time, employees are able to manage their workflow and highlight areas where there may be bottlenecks. All combined, it leads to better operations and customer experiences, Cummack said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Fin’s view is that as more automation occurs, the company is looking at a “renaissance of human work.” There will be more jobs and more types of jobs, but people will be able to do them more effectively and the work will be more fulfilling, he added.</p>
<p>Particularly with the use of technology, he notes that in the era before cloud computing, there was a small number of software vendors. Now with the average tech company using over 130 SaaS apps, it allows for a lot of entrepreneurs and adoption of best-in-breed apps so that a viable company can start with a handful of people and leverage those apps to gain big customers.</p>
<p>“It’s different for enterprise customers, though, to understand that investment and what they are spending their money on as they use tools to get their jobs done,” Cummack added. “There is massive pressure to improve the customer experience and move quickly. Now with many people working from home, Fin enables you to look at all 130 apps as if they are one and how they are being used.”</p>
<p>As a result, Fin’s customers are seeing metrics like 16% increase in team utilization and engagement, a 25% decrease in support ticket handle time and a 71% increase in policy compliance. Meanwhile, the company itself is doubling and tripling its customers and revenue each year.</p>
<p>Now with leadership and people in place, Cummack said the company is positioned to scale, though it already had a huge head start in terms of a meaningful business.</p>

<p>Arielle Zuckerberg, partner at Coatue, said via email that she was part of a previous firm that invested in Fin’s seed round to build a virtual assistant. She was also a customer of Fin Assistant until it was discontinued.</p>
<p>When she heard the company was pivoting to enterprise, she “was excited because I thought it was a natural outgrowth of the previous business, had a lot of potential and I was already familiar with management and thought highly of them.”</p>
<p>She believed the “brains” of the company always revolved around understanding and measuring what assistants were doing to complete a task as a way to create opportunities for improvement or automation. The pivot to agent-facing tools made sense to Zuckerberg, but it wasn’t until the global pandemic that it clicked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Service teams were forced to go remote overnight, and companies had little to no visibility into what people were doing working from home,&#8221; she added. “In this remote environment, we thought that Fin&#8217;s product was incredibly well-suited to address the challenges of managing a growing remote support team, and that over time, their unique data set of how people use various apps and tools to complete tasks can help business leaders improve the future of work for their team members. We believe that contact center agents going remote was inevitable even before COVID, but COVID was a huge accelerant and created a compelling ‘why now’ moment for Fin’s solution.”</p>
<p>Going forward, Coatue sees Fin as “a process mining company that is focused on service teams.” By initially focusing on customer support and contact center use case — a business large enough to support a scaled, standalone business — rather than joining competitors in going after Fortune 500 companies where implementation cycles are long and there is slow time-to-value, Zuckerberg said Fin is better able to “address the unique challenges of managing a growing remote support team with a near-immediate time-to-value.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Canadian startup called <a href="https://nuula.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuula</a> that is aiming to build a superapp to provide a range of financial services to small and medium businesses has closed $120 million of funding, money that it will use to fuel the launch of its app and first product, a line of credit for its users.</p>
<p>The money is coming in the form of $20 million in equity from Edison Partners, and a $100 million credit facility from funds managed by the Credit Group of Ares Management Corporation.</p>
<p>The Nuula app has been in a limited beta since June of this year. The plan is to open it up to general availability soon, while also gradually bringing in more services, some built directly by Nuula itself and but many others following an embedded finance strategy: business banking, for example, will be a service provided by a third party and integrated closely into the Nuula app to be launched early in 2022; and alongside that, the startup will also be making liberal use of APIs to bring in other white-label services such as B2B and customer-focused payment services, starting first in the U.S. and then expanding to Canada and the U.K. before further countries across Europe.</p>
<p>Current products include cash flow forecasting, personal and business credit score monitoring, and customer sentiment tracking; and monitoring of other critical metrics including financial, payments and eCommerce data are all on the roadmap.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building tools to work in a complementary fashion in the app,&#8221; CEO Mark Ruddock said in an interview. &#8220;Today, businesses can project if they are likely to run out of money, and monitor their credit scores. We keep an eye on customers and what they are saying in real time. We think it&#8217;s necessary to surface for SMBs the metrics that they might have needed to get from multiple apps, all in one place.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p4">Nuula was originally a side-project at BFS, a company that focused on small business lending, where the company started to look at the idea of how to better leverage data to build out a wider set of services addressing the same segment of the market. BFS grew to be a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190122005515/en/BFS-Capital-Achieves-2-Billion-in-Financing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantial business in its own right</a> (and it had raised its own money to that end, to the tune of<a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/54065-89/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $184 million</a> from Edison and Honeywell).  Over time, it became apparent to management that the data aspect, and this concept of a super app, would be key to how to grow the business, and so it <a href="https://debanked.com/2021/04/bfs-capital-is-now-nuula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pivoted and rebranded earlier this year</a>, launching the beta of the app after that.</p>
<p>Nuula&#8217;s ambitions fall within a bigger trend in the market. Small and medium enterprises have shaped up to be a huge business opportunity in the world of fintech in the last several years. Long ignored in favor of building solutions either for the giant consumer market, or the lucrative large enterprise sector, SMBs have proven that they want and are willing to invest in better and newer technology to run their businesses, and that&#8217;s leading to a rush of startups and bigger tech companies bringing services to the market to cater to that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Super apps are also a big area of interest in the world of fintech, although up to now a lot of what we&#8217;ve heard about in that area has been aimed at consumers &#8212; just the kind of innovation rut that Nuula is trying to get moving.</p>
<p class="p4">&#8220;Despite the growth in services addressing the SMB sector, overall it still lacks innovation compared to consumer or enterprise services,&#8221; Ruddock said. &#8220;We thought there was some opportunity to bring new thinking to the space. We see this as the app that SMBs will want to use everyday, because we&#8217;ll provide useful tools, insights and capital to power their businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p4">Nuula&#8217;s priority to build the data services that connect all of this together is very much in keeping with how a lot of neobanks are also developing services and investing in what they see as their unique selling point. The theory goes like this: banking services are, at the end of the day, the same everywhere you go, and therefore commoditized, and so the more unique value-added for companies will come from innovating with more interesting algorithms and other data-based insights and analytics to give more power to their users to make the best use of what they have at their disposal.</p>
<p>It will not be alone in addressing that market. Others building fintech for SMBs include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/uks-selina-finance-raises-42m-for-its-smb-loans-platform-based-on-home-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selina</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/uks-anna-raises-21m-for-its-smb-focused-business-account-and-tax-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANNA</a>, Amex&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/amex-acquires-softbank-backed-kabbage-after-tough-2020-for-the-smb-lender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kabbage</a> (an early mover in using big data to help loan money to SMBs and build other financial services for them), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/novo-a-neobank-for-smbs-banks-41m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Novo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/07/uks-atom-bank-raises-another-206m-led-by-bbva-for-millennial-and-smb-financial-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atom Bank</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/hoping-to-be-latams-top-digital-bank-for-smbs-xepelin-launches-a-lending-and-revenue-management-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xepelin</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/liberis-the-embedded-finance-provider-for-smes-raises-additional-70m-in-equity-and-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liberis</a>, biggies like Stripe, Square and PayPal, and many others.</p>
<p class="p4">The credit product that Nuula has built so far is a taster of how it hopes to be a useful tool for SMBs, not just another place to get money or manage it. It&#8217;s not a direct loaning service, but rather something that is closely linked to monitoring a customers&#8217; incomings and outgoings and only prompts a credit line (which directly links into the users&#8217; account, wherever it is) when it appears that it might be needed.</p>
<p class="p2">“Innovations in financial technology have largely democratized who can become the next big player in small business finance,” added Gary Golding, General Partner, Edison Partners. “By combining critical financial performance tools and insights into a single interface, Nuula represents a new class of financial services technology for small business, and we are excited by the potential of the firm.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to be working with Nuula as they build a unique financial services resource for small businesses and entrepreneurs,” said Jeffrey Kramer, Partner and Head of ABS in the Alternative Credit strategy of the Ares Credit Group, in a statement. “The evolution of financial technology continues to open opportunities for innovation and the emergence of new industry participants. We look forward to seeing Nuula’s experienced team of technologists, data scientists and financial service veterans bring a new generation of small business financial services solutions to market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://juno.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juno</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a proptech startup which aims to build more sustainable and affordable apartment buildings, has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comcast Ventures, Khosla Ventures and Real Estate Technology (RET) Ventures co-led the financing, which brings the company’s total raised to $32 million since its 2019 inception. JLL Spark, Vertex Ventures, Anim, K50, Foundamental and Green D Alumni Ventures also participated in the Series A investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juno co-founder and CEO Jonathan Scherr said the San Francisco-based startup plans to build all electric properties by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">assembling “the first OEM ecosystem for ground-up development.” (For the unacquainted, OEM stands for “original equipment manufacturer.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">treating housing development like product development, a process we call ‘productization,’ ” he told TechCrunch. “By creating buildings that are worthy of being repeated, tools and systems can be created to enable continuous improvement and increase efficiency. If buildings are considered or designed in a one-off context, then the learnings from one project to the next will fail to exist.”</span></p>
<p>Note that Juno&#8217;s productization could be considered similar to the more commonly used term prefabrication in some aspects. While prefab construction company Katerra <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/softbank-backed-construction-giant-katerra-said-to-be-shutting-down-after-raising-billions/">crashed and burned</a>, a number of other companies in the space continue to raise money and grow, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/abodu-raises-20m-to-build-prefabricated-backyard-homes/">Abodu</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/khosla-backs-construction-tech-startup-mighty-buildings-plans-to-create-3d-printed-homes/">Mighty Buildings,</a> which is also backed by Khosla but is more focused accessory dwelling units and single-family homes. There is also North Carolina-based <a href="https://prescientco.com/">Prescient</a>, which is also  constructing multifamily housing and hotels through prefabrication.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199953" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199953" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199953 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Exterior-2.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199953" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rendering of Austin project; Engraff Studio / Juno</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juno&#8217;s theory is that via &#8220;productization,&#8221; it can create the tools, systems and processes that can lead to things like reduced design timelines, increased precision in estimation and scheduling and a “significantly accelerated” construction process. All this, Scherr said, can result in more affordable housing options for people all over the United States. Also, Juno claims that its design process, for example, is 60% faster than in traditional real estate development.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other players in the space, Juno of course touts an approach that it says is far more sustainable than traditional construction methods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, construction refuse is literally 2x that of all municipal refuse combined in the U.S.,” Scherr told TechCrunch. “The Juno system creates efficiency in the design, supply chain, and construction of buildings that reduce waste and energy usage.” Features include low-carbon, all timber construction, more exposed wood (which Juno says is anti-microbial) and entirely gasless buildings, for example.</span></p>
<p>Thanks to its focus on all-electric buildings in cities that have established roadmaps to clean energy generation, the Juno residential system is trending toward a net zero target for embodied carbon in its multifamily residential units, Scherr said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scherr founded Juno with BJ Siegel, who was a designer of the original Apple Store, and Chester Chipperfield, who currently serves as an advisor to the company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipperfield previously served as global creative director at Tesla, head of special projects at Apple and head of digital at Burberry. Scherr has worked as a venture investor and advisor to a number of companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the concept architect for Apple’s retail program going back as far as 1999, BJ [Siegel] had thought about how to create an identity for the built environment that deserved to be repeated,” Scherr said. “By doing so, he and his colleagues at Apple began to think about Apple retail more like Apple’s products: grounded in a decentralized supply chain.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199963" style="width: 328px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199963" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2199963 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/founders-2.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="318" height="478" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/founders-2.jpg 1363w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/founders-2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/founders-2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/founders-2.jpg?resize=768,1154 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/founders-2.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/founders-2.jpg?resize=1022,1536 1022w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/founders-2.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> From left to right: Chester Chipperfield, co-founder and advisor Jonathan Scherr, co-founder and CEO BJ Siegel, co-founder and Head of Design / Juno</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juno was created with a similar model in mind: with the goal of designing &#8220;better&#8221; housing that could be replicated so that the company is able “to build out a supply chain and lay the groundwork for learning systems in ways that have never been possible before,” said Scherr, whose father was a real estate developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juno is starting out by building what it describes as the first national network of mass timber apartment buildings at scale with all-electric buildings in cities across the United States. And it’s partnering with </span><a href="https://swinerton.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swinerton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="http://www.ennead.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ennead Architects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to put its model into practice. The startup has also broken ground on its first project &#8212; an apartment building in East Austin &#8212; and currently has more than 400 units in development. The East Austin building is slated to open in 2022. Juno also has sites planned for Seattle and Denver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to continue to build out its product, break ground on its first cohort of projects and engage with more developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juno&#8217;s investors are naturally bullish on what the company is doing, and plans to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evan Moore, partner at Khosla Ventures, said he does not generally invest in real estate development companies or builders or architects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But when a strong team is working on a dramatically different product in an important industry, I&#8217;ll get behind it,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, Moore added, apartment development has been a finance-driven industry, rather than product-driven, despite the fact that apartments are consumer products and derive their value from their use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So there&#8217;s a tremendous opportunity to design buildings with the customer experience at the forefront,” he said. “What if Apple built apartment buildings? To me, that means working backwards from the experience you want to create, designing the components, supply chain and systems to support it, and working within cost as a constraint. That&#8217;s an ambitious idea, and an experiment worth undertaking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheena Jindal, principal at Comcast Ventures, notes that America’s housing stock is increasingly aged and in short supply &#8212; making it more difficult for people to buy houses. Her firm, she said, believes that everyone deserves access to an affordable home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we first met the Juno team, we were struck by their first principles approach to building,” she wrote via email. “Juno fundamentally understood what was broken in multifamily housing production and tackled it head on by focusing earlier in the value chain with its design and OEM sourcing strategy. Juno partners with existing players in the value chain, rather than displacing them.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://neuroglee.com/">Neuroglee Therapeutics</a>, a startup developing digital therapeutics for people with neurodegenerative diseases, has raised a $10 million Series A led by Openspace Ventures and EDBI. The funding will be used to launch virtual neurology clinics and to support Neuroglee’s move to Boston. Other participants included Ramen Singh, the former chief executive officer of Mundipharma; Biofourmis co-founders Kuldeep Singh Rajput and Wendou Liu; and Eisai Co., the Japanese pharmaceutical that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/neuroglee-gets-2-3-million-to-develop-digital-therapeutics-for-neurodegenerative-diseases/">led Neuroglee’s last round last year</a>.</p>
<p>In an email, founder and chief executive officer Aniket Singh Rajput told TechCrunch that the company is moving to Boston because the city “is one of the largest digital health hubs in the world. As a company devoted to developing our first line of solutions for treating mild cognitive impairment related to difficult-to-treat neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, we believe Boston will offer us the strategic support in order to do so.”</p>

<p>Neuroglee and the Mayo Clinic are currently working together on a new platform called Neuroglee Connect. Based on the Mayo Clinic’s 10-day in-person program HABIT (Health Action to Benefit Independence and Thinking) for people with mild cognitive impairment from possible neurodegenerative conditions, Neuroglee’s technology will enable HABIT to scale, making it available to patients and caregivers in their homes. Neuroglee Connect users will also have access to health navigators who are available 24 hours and clinical care teams for assessments and interventions.</p>
<p>Neuroglee&#8217;s product pipeline also includes digital therapeutics for Parkinson’s disease and strokes.</p>
<p>Since Neuroglee’s previous funding announcement in December 2020, Rajput said it has hit milestones like the successful product development of NG-001, its prescription digital therapy software for Alzheimer’s, and began work on its proof-of-concept study to earn NG-001 a Breakthrough Designation from the Federal Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Neuroglee’s adaptive learning tech uses machine learning and biomarkers related to cognitive function, mood and behavior to automatically personalize therapy plans for each patient, who access the software through a smartphone or tablet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“For example, adjustments will be made to the number and type of tasks and games that are offered, based on the speed of the patient’s finger movements, time to complete games or tasks, and their facial expression identified through the device camera,” said Rajput. “The solution also incorporates reminiscence therapy, which uses images from the patient’s past to evoke positive memories and emotions, which have been shown to improve cognitive functioning.&#8221;</p>
