</div><p id="speakable-summary">A host of features are being added to Google&#8217;s Android Auto experience, and the company&#8217;s Automotive OS will come to more cars including, for the first time, Honda vehicles from 2022 onwards.</p>
<p>Google introduced its Android Auto app in 2015, enabling drivers to run a tethered connection between their smartphone and their vehicle’s stereo system to play music from the device, have Maps’ turn-by-turn directions be read aloud, and take calls through the sound system. In the six years since, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-google-maps-ui-right-hand-drive-cars-181544539.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">both Android Auto</a> and the infotainment systems they operate on have gotten a whole lot smarter. On Thursday, Google announced that it will be rolling out even more features and capabilities to drivers, whether they run Android Auto on their phones or directly through their cars.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While Android Auto has been designed to minimize distractions to the driver when on the road, initially connecting the phone to the infotainment or stereo system has to date been a whole thing. You’d have to make sure the Bluetooth radio was live on your phone, then cajole the vehicle into recognizing and pairing with the device, then remember the myriad various oral commands to incite Android Auto into doing what you actually wanted it to. But no longer! Drivers will soon be able to effectively automate the tethering process just by saying “Hey Google, let’s drive.” </span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>What’s more, Google has redesigned the Auto UI to enable access to a bevy of content sources including Amazon Music, Audible, iHeartRadio, JioSaavn, Pandora, Podcast Addict, SoundCloud, and YouTube Music with one-tap accessibility as well as have the system read incoming text messages aloud and allow the driver to respond by voice. Expect to see these new features arrive over the next few weeks in English-speaking markets as well as Germany, Spain, Mexico, France and Italy.</p>
<p>And for international travelers using dual-SIM phones, Android Auto will allow you to establish separate Work and Personal profiles and have their relevant contact lists and calendar appointments display, depending on when and why they’re behind the wheel.</p>
<p>For vehicles with in-car displays, Android Auto (the mirroring version, not what you’d find on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Polestar 2</a> or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvos-c-40-recharge-knocks-the-ass-off-its-xc-40-predecessor-and-we-love-them-for-it-163057786.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">XC40 Recharge</a>) will soon boast a few new features, such as games. Google is partnering with GameSnacks to offer drivers quick and fun diversions to play while the vehicle is parked. Finally, an end to doom-scrolling while sitting in public charging lots. Conversely, Google is making paying for gas less interactive. Just say “Hey Google, pay for gas” to have the vehicle’s infotainment system complete a contactless payment with Google Pay. You do have to select the fuel grade and, you know, actually pump the gas but, still. The feature will be available at Exxon and Mobil gas stations to start with support for Shell, Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations coming soon.</p>
<p>As for the integrated Android Automotive OS (like what you’d find in select Ford, GM, and Volvo vehicles), get ready to see it in a whole bunch of new makes and models. Google announced on Thursday that its latest partner is Honda, which will begin producing vehicles with built-in AAOS come the 2022 model year, and will soon be available in both the Chevy Silverado and the Renault Mégane E-Tech.</p>

They&#8217;re designed to be carried around by the wind and could be used in numerous applications including disease and air pollution tracking, according to a paper published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03847-y.epdf?sharing_token=H_ir9bfrqhQ2lsW0udPg7tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NHZkfDUEKmhjTX15axDSP-EqNRoRAgjNvE6EgxUSns1ObKU5SUSYUOHSWqZ9JANy9Q6W9_XUSRUaunfaoZagd0JEEDFEcyG2SX3x8NHC-DnDrqqnfXavjw1lkDTh94pHLKNh-JhwCeItdJXrbLXUTKVw1qqCBB4z7eIWvQjUOatQ%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.vice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>Nature</em></a>. At the same time, they could be made from biodegradable materials to prevent environmental contamination.</p>
<p>The design of the flyers was inspired by spinning seeds from cottonwood and other trees. Those fall slowly by spinning like helicopters so they can be picked up by the wind and spread a long distance from the tree, increasing the range of the species.</p>
<p>The team from Northwest University ran with that idea but made it better, and smaller. &#8220;We think we&#8217;ve beaten biology&#8230; we&#8217;ve been able to build structures that fall in a more stable trajectory at slower terminal velocities than equivalent seeds,&#8221; said lead Professor John A. Rogers. &#8220;The other thing&#8230; was that we were able to make these helicopter flyer structures that are much smaller than seeds you would see in the natural world.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3me68t6Kh0I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;re not so small that the aerodynamics starts to break down, though. &#8220;All of the advantages of the helicopter design begin to disappear below a certain length scale, so we pushed it all the way, as far as you can go or as physics would allow,&#8221; Rogers told <em>Vice</em>. &#8220;Below that size scale, everything looks and falls like a sphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The devices are also large enough to carry electronics, sensors and power sources. The team tested multiple versions that could carry payloads like antenna so that they could wireless communicate with a smartphone or each other. Other sensors could monitor things like air acidity, water quality and solar radiation.</p>
<p>The flyers are still concepts right now and not ready to deploy into the atmosphere, but the team plans to expand their findings with different designs. Key to that is the use of biodegradable materials so they wouldn&#8217;t persist in the environment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t think about these devices&#8230; as a permanent monitoring componentry but rather temporary ones that are addressing a particular need that’s of finite time duration,&#8221; Rogers said. “That&#8217;s the way that we&#8217;re envisioning things currently: you monitor for a month and then the devices die out, dissolve, and disappear, and maybe you have to redeploy them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot has changed for <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo.</a> The language learning company launched nearly a decade ago on the Disrupt stage with no monetization plans. Today, that scrappy app has matured into a well-known consumer brand and a business that makes a ton of money. This growth fueled the startup’s recent decision to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/5-lessons-from-duolingos-bellwether-edtech-ipo-of-the-year/"> go public</a>, which is rare for a consumer edtech company.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder<a href="https://twitter.com/luisvonahn?lang=en"> Luis von Ahn</a> returned to TechCrunch Disrupt this year to explain how the sophistication of public markets impacts the company&#8217;s strategy. Armed with fresh capital from the IPO and attention from the public markets, Duolingo is drawing its line on what’s next and what’s never going to be on its roadmap.</p>
<p>Part of becoming a listed company is opening yourself up to critique from the public markets, which are full of investors rooting for viable businesses that know how to make money and appreciate in value. But what happens if optimizing for money isn’t what a company wants to do?</p>
<p>Duolingo’s early days were defined by an allergy to monetization because its mission was to scale free education. When the company eventually introduced monetization through subscriptions, it didn’t paywall any learning content. Instead, its subscription product is built around enhancing the user experience — from avoiding advertisements altogether to allowing for unlimited mistakes. Today, about 95% of Duolingo’s users consume the product for free.</p>
<p>Von Ahn defended the idea that Duolingo may be tempted to begin paywalling learning features for its subscription service now that it&#8217;s in the eye of retail investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audio startup <a href="https://syngspace.com/">Syng</a> has been building on quite a bit more hype than the average fresh hardware startup, largely because of the team behind it. Founder and CEO Chris Stringer was Jony Ive&#8217;s first hire at Apple and worked at the company for 21 years. In an interview, Stringer referred to the first time he heard stereo audio was &#8220;the most impressive product demo ever,&#8221; and that his company is looking to build on that wonder by building &#8220;triphonic&#8221; audio hardware that can transform the home-listening experience with spatial audio.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about transforming the stage from that stage/audience static experience that&#8217;s essentially just an image on the wall, to actually making the stage the square footage of your home,&#8221; Stringer tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Syng has closed a $48.75 million &#8220;combined&#8221; Series A from investors led by Palo Alto-based Eclipse Ventures, the startup tells TechCrunch. Other investors include Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger, Lionel Richie, and Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia. The company has now raised $50 million to date to build out an audio hardware startup with a hefty focus on design and advanced tech.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s hardware relies on computational audio technology similar to tech that consumers have seen in products like the HomePod, which allows speakers to adjust to the spaces that they&#8217;re in. But Syng&#8217;s products are designed for spatial audio first-and-foremost. The company&#8217;s first product &#8212; the Syng Cell Alpha &#8212; is a high-end $1,799 speaker that looks like it belongs in a mid-century modern spaceship. The Apple design ethos is strong in the product which channels a bit of the Jony Ive-designed Harman Kardon SoundSticks, inside a package that Stringer says is meant to be treated more like a piece of furniture than the brutalistic tower speakers that currently carve out the ultra high-end of audio.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten a chance to listen to the hardware myself, so I&#8217;ll reserve any judgments there, but while $1,799 is certainly quite pricey for a single speaker, it&#8217;s also clear that most users will not be getting the most out of the tech by buying just one. The Cell Alpha speakers are meant to interact with each other, taking in feedback while creating a dynamic soundstage for users. A big selling point of this auto-adjustment is less rigid speaker placement and the ability to let your design interests dictate where speakers are placed more than a room&#8217;s natural acoustics. This is likely only true up to a certain point, obviously, but Stringer hopes that this leads to fewer audio systems fixated around a giant TV on the wall and more people really enjoying music in their homes.</p>

<p>The company currently supports up to 4 speakers in a single room. The Cell Alpha only comes in a single variation at the moment, but Stringer hints at future products down the road in different price points and sizes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getting an ultra-high-end audio setup in your home has typically meant hiring a contractor and creating a weave of complex speakers, cables, receivers, amps and universal remotes that can be an awful lot for anyone to handle. Syng&#8217;s model brings a more Sonos-like approach, treating devices more like home objects than utilitarian objects to be disguised and hidden, into the mix.</p>
<p>Hardware is hard &#8212; as they say &#8212; and consumer audio can be an especially difficult place to play as a newcomer. Legacy is more important in internet-connected audio than most other realms of hardware, as people can often keep premium home audio products running for decades &#8212; or at least much longer than other tech devices. Betting on the reliability of a lifetime of firmware updates for a new startup can be a tricky bet for consumers, especially with a price tag like the Cell Alpha&#8217;s. Another challenge for the startup is that most users have scant options for playing spatial audio,  most music streaming services barely support it. As executive Chris Stringer notes, this likely won&#8217;t be the case for long as major players like Apple start pushing the technology more aggressively, but hardware startups and market timing have always had a complicated relationship.</p>
<p>Other investors in the startup include Bridford Group, SIP Global Partners, Renegade Partners, Animal Capital, Schusterman Family Investments, Vince Zampella and Alex Rigopolous. Stringer says the funding will be used for R&amp;D around the company&#8217;s future hardware and software products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Treasury is wading into the fight against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> by sanctioning virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> exchange Suex for its role in facilitating ransomware payments.</p>
<p>The sanctions are the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364">first of its kind</a> against a cryptocurrency exchange, and prohibit Americans from doing business with the company.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest action as part of a U.S. government-wide effort to counter the rise of ransomware — including a cross-agency taskforce and a $10 million bounty for information on state-backed cybercriminals — that has so far seen mixed results. Just this week, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">BlackMatter ransomware group</a> demanded $5.9 million in ransom from a hacked Iowa farm services provider.</p>
<p>But experts believe that the Treasury’s action against Suex, and the U.S. government’s apparent decision to employ the age-old tactic of following the money rather than the criminals themselves, will come as a major blow to many of the biggest ransomware operators. While the sanctions won’t end ransomware attacks for good, dismantling the mechanisms for ransomware groups to cash out their cryptocurrency could be vital in slowing them down.</p>
<p>Chanalysis, which aided the U.S. in its investigation of Suex, has lauded the move as a “big win”, labeling the exchange as one of the worst-offenders of cryptocurrency-based money laundering. In <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ofac-sanction-suex-september-2021">a blog post</a>, the blockchain analysis firm said Suex netted almost $13 million from ransomware operators like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/universal-health-services-ransomware/">Ryuk</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/maze-ransomware-group-shutting-down/">Maze</a> since the exchange was founded in 2018. Chanalysis also said the exchange took in more than $24 million from crypto scam operators.</p>

</ul>

	</p>
<p>The Treasury said that over 40% of known Suex transactions were associated with bad activity.</p>
<p>Gurvais Grigg, Chainalysis’s global public sector and chief technology officer, believes the U.S. will continue to target exchanges, yet his analysis shows that illicit activity is largely concentrated to just a few services.</p>
<p>“A group of just five received 82% of all ransomware funds from 2020, based on our data at the time,” he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Paul Sibenik, lead case manager at blockchain forensics company CipherBlade, said the U.S. is likely to also go after lesser-known nested services and over-the-counter (OTC) brokers — where trading happens directly between two parties but utilizes a major exchange for liquidity. Suex, for example, uses the infrastructure of a larger exchange to handle its transactions.</p>
<p>“The usage of a rogue OTC like Suex can be an effective workaround so that an attacker need not have an account at the applicable exchange, but ultimately it&#8217;s fair to say that the exchange is still facilitating the transaction from the ransomware attacker,” Sibenik tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Exchanges have an obligation to monitor suspicious transactions going into applicable accounts, but it&#8217;s also critically important for exchanges to ensure that whatever rogue OTCs and nested services they do business with are compliant themselves,” said Sibenik. “Otherwise, there can absolutely be a threat of enforcement actions, and arguably legal liability as well.”</p>
<p>The Treasury’s latest sanctions — and the threat of more — will undoubtedly see ransomware actors change their tactics, just as some have done by shifting to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">double extortion techniques</a>. Rather than just encrypting files, double extortion ransomware exfiltrates the data first and threatens to publish the files if the ransom isn&#8217;t paid.</p>
<p>Sibenek has already seen some threat actors moving from Bitcoin to Monero, which he describes as “untraceable in any meaningful and practical way.” Even this is less viable for ransomware groups moving to cash out, with many exchanges having delisted so-called privacy coins due to regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>“Cryptocurrency is only useful if you can buy and sell goods and services or cash out into fiat, and that is much more difficult with privacy coins,&#8221; Grigg says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making smartphones more accessible is always a good idea, and Google&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/making-android-more-accessible">latest features</a> bring quick actions and navigation to people whose expressions are their primary means of interacting with the world. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.vision.switches">Project Activate</a> and <a href="http://g.co/cameraswitches">Camera Switches</a> let users perform tasks like speaking a custom phrase, or navigating using a switch interface, through facial gestures alone.</p>
<p>The new features rely on the smartphone&#8217;s front-facing camera, which can watch the user&#8217;s face in real time for one of six expressions: a smile, raised eyebrows, opened mouth, and looking left, right, or up. It relies entirely on local computing and no image data is saved, nor is it doing what is generally understood as &#8220;facial recognition&#8221; — this type of machine learning can focus specifically on, for example, identifying the eyebrows and sending a signal whenever they move past a certain, customizable threshold.</p>
<p>Each expression can be assigned a different role. Camera Switches integrates with Android&#8217;s existing switch compatibility, by which people who use assistive tech like a joystick or blow tube can navigate the phone&#8217;s OS. Now that can be done without any peripheral device at all, and users can pick various facial gestures for iterating through selections, confirming a choice, backing out, and so on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206267" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206267" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2206267" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="550" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg 1772w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=768,412 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=1536,824 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2206267" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Using Project Activate, expressions can be tied to self-contained actions like speaking a phrase. Many people with disabilities rely on caretakers for a variety of reasons, but one thing you can&#8217;t ask a caretaker to do is get your caretaker&#8217;s attention! So one useful application might be assigning (say) an extended eyebrow raise to have the device speak the phrase &#8220;hey!&#8221; or &#8220;I need help with something,&#8221; or &#8220;thanks!&#8221;</p>
<p>The gestures can also be used to play an audio file, or text or call a predetermined number. More expressions and more capabilities are on the way, as well as more languages — of course faces don&#8217;t have languages, but the app and support documentation do, so Project Activate will start with English-speaking countries and move out from there. Camera Switches, on the other hand, will be available in 80 languages from the start.</p>
<p>Note that these can&#8217;t both be used at once, since they both require access to the camera and expression recognition thing. So users should make sure they have a backup method for navigation. Both should run on pretty much any Android phone from the last five years or so.</p>

<p>Lastly, an update to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/googles-lookout-app-for-vision-impaired-now-scans-food-labels-and-long-documents/">Lookout</a> app, which reads labels for people with visual impairments, adds the ability to scan and read out handwritten content the way it can with printed things. That&#8217;s useful for sticky notes, &#8220;gone fishing&#8221; type signs on the doors of stores, and things like greeting cards with notes from the sender. The app has seen big increases in usage over the last year so they&#8217;re building it out. (Support for identifying euro and Indian rupee banknotes should help fuel that growth too.)</p>
<p>All the new stuff should be available later this week free of charge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla broke ground on its &#8220;Megafactory,&#8221; a new production facility in California, so christened because it will produce the company’s large-scale battery system Megapack.</p>
<p>News of the previously unannounced factory was confirmed by the Lathrop Mayor Sonny Dhaliwal, in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sonny.dhaliwal.5">Facebook post</a> that was deleted and re-posted. “We are proud to be the home of the Megafactory, Tesla’s most recent expansion here,” he said. “The future of green energy will be produced right here in our community.”</p>
<p>The factory, in the small northern California city of Lathrop, is near Tesla’s automotive plant in Fremont. Lathrop is also home to Tesla’s 870,000-square-foot distribution center.</p>
<p>Megapacks, as well as Tesla’s other energy storage products, were being manufactured at the electric automaker’s so-called &#8220;Gigafactory” in Sparks, Nevada. This is the first facility dedicated to the Megapack, though it’s unclear if production of Tesla&#8217;s other storage products – which include Powerwall and Powerpacks – will shift to the new factory.</p>
<p>The new factory is a positive signal for the automaker’s growing Energy division. As opposed to the Powerwall, which is a home consumer battery product, the Megapack is meant for utility-scale energy storage. Utilities building solar and wind farms are increasingly pairing these with large batteries to store excess energy to discharge to the grid later. Just last week, the Arizona electric utility Salt River Project brought online a 100 megawatt-hour Megapack project.</p>
<p>In a second-quarter earnings call in June, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that there was “significant unmet demand” for these storage products, adding that the Megapack was “basically sold out through next year.&#8221; He also estimated demand for Powerwall to be in excess of 1 million units per year.</p>
<p>Much of the bottleneck isn’t merely due to production capacity – Musk also told investors that cell supply and the global semiconductor shortage were creating production ceilings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as you do in a car, so it&#8217;s like, which one do want to make?” he said. “Cars or Powerwalls? So we need to make cars, so that will &#8212; Powerwall production has been reduced.”</p>
<p>The chip shortage, however, seems to show no signs of abating; in fact, the White House on Thursday will be hosting its second summit with semiconductor manufacturers and purchasers to address the ongoing effects on the technology and auto industries.</p>

<h3>How Do You Select the Right Tech Stack?</h3>
<p>From day zero, startups have to make dozens of trade-offs when it comes to the infinite variety of tech stacks available to today’s engineers. Choose the wrong combination or direction, and a startup could be left with years of refactoring to fix the legacy damage. What are the best practices for assessing potential stacks, and how can you minimize the risk of a painful mistake? Top technologists Tammarrian Rogers (Snap, Inc.), Preeti Somal (HashiCorp) and Jill Wetzler (Pilot) will discuss strategies for improving engineering right from the beginning and at every stage of a startup’s journey.</p>

Hear Palihapitiya’s thoughts on the future of SPACs, which tech sectors are primed for a boom, and what excites him most in terms of future investments.</p>
<h3>How DAOs Could Shake Up VC</h3>
<p>Investment in blockchain startups and tokens exploded in 2021, and some investors are blowing up the idea of a venture capital firm as they look to back more projects in the crypto world. DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, are starting to pop up more and more, turning traditional VC on its head by building investment organizations on the blockchain. With David Pakman (Venrock) and Manasi Vora (Skynet Labs).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Esri Hackathon Finalist Presentations</h3>
<p>From August 23 to September 13, developers from around the world joined Esri and TechCrunch for <strong>Hack for a Sustainable Future</strong> — a hackathon to imagine and build new apps to take on global challenges like climate, equity and public health.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How’s this for a bit of regional synchronicity? This week, a pair of Chinese robotics firms secured $200 million rounds. It’s all part of a booming ecosystem that we get some insight into every so often. There are so many players in China’s robotics space it can be hard to keep track of some of the innovation over there, but these sorts of large funding rounds are a surefire way to make some waves.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to be a major acceleration point for the country, on the tail of some major manufacturing shortages that brought the world’s supply chains to a standstill. But this week’s pair of big raises point toward an adoption of automation that moves beyond manufacturing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124338" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124338" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2124338" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6049932f64b5c.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124338" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hai Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Hai Robotics grabbed the bigger headlines of the two with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/hai-robotics-picks-up-200m-for-its-warehouse-robot/">announcement of a joint Series C and D that amount to $200 million</a>. The company’s Shenzhen location puts it smack in the heart of China’s manufacturing zone, but the company’s specialty is warehouse/fulfillment robotics. It already has a decent-sized international footprint with deployment in 30 countries, including a recent deal with Booktopia, a large Australian online book retailer.</p>
<p>5Y Capital and Capital Today led the C and D, respectively. The rounds also featured Sequoia Capital China, Source Code Capital, VMS, Walden International and Scheme Capital. The funding will be used to further Hai’s international expansion and build out its existing presence in China.</p>

The round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, with participation from CICC ALPHA and Prosperity7 Ventures. The company specializes in service robots &#8212; not dissimilar from the sorts of robo-waiters we’ve seen from California-based Bear Robots. It’s a sizable industry on its own, though the company has already begun expanding its use cases, including hotels and hospitals.</p>

<p>Keenon says its robots have been deployed in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and Singapore, and the funding will go toward further expanding that footprint.</p>
<p>“We believe robotic solutions can have a profound impact across the services industry by assisting with repetitive, tedious workflows,” SoftBank’s Kentaro Matsui said in a release. “Using AI and machine learning, combined with advanced manufacturing capabilities, Keenon is building innovative robotics to help increase productivity for restaurants, hotels, and hospitals in China and globally.”</p>

<p>Newly flush with cash, Locus Robotics (which seems to make its way into this roundup more often than not), <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/locus-robotics-acquires-waypoint-robotics-301380031.html">has agreed to acquire Waypoint Robotics</a>. Waypoint more or less operates in the same warehouse category as Locus. Its flagship product is Vector, an autonomous omnidirectional robot capable of moving around up to a 300-pound payload.</p>
<p>&#8220;Locus is the proven leader in the development of highly productive and innovative AMR technology that efficiently solves our customers&#8217; needs for total warehouse optimization,&#8221; Locus CEO Rick Faulk said in a release. &#8220;As order fulfillment and labor shortages continue to grow around the world, the acquisition of Waypoint Robotics will accelerate our ability to meet these global needs in just months rather than years, helping us drive the digital transformation of the warehouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Locus announced a $150 million Series E in February and an additional $50 million this month. The company is clearly looking to build a robust fulfillment ecosystem it hopes can probably compete with Amazon’s offering.</p>

<p>The first fruits of Boston Dynamics’ acquisition by Hyundai <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/boston-dynamics-owner-hyundai-deploys-spot-for-factory-safety-monitoring/">are finally arriving</a>. The drably-named “Factory Safety Service Robot” is effectively a bespoke Spot robot designed to patrol factories, starting with a pilot at the Hyundai-owned Kia Plant in Seoul. The robot comes equipped with lidar and a thermal camera and can patrol the factory floor autonomously or be controlled remotely through a browser.</p>

<p>This week, Nvidia and Open Robotics announced a partnership that looks to be beneficial for both parties. Essentially, the agreement is designed to make Nvidia’s Jetson development platform and Open Robotics’ ROS 2 software work together. The deal is designed to speed up development time for roboticists using Nvidia’s perception technology.</p>
<p>“As more ROS developers leverage hardware platforms that contain additional compute capabilities designed to offload the host CPU, ROS is evolving to make it easier to efficiently take advantage of these advanced hardware resources,” Open Robotics CEO Brian Gerkey <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ai-perception-coming-to-ros-developers/">said in a release</a>. “Working with an accelerated computing leader like NVIDIA and its vast experience in AI and robotics innovation will bring significant benefits to the entire ROS community.”</p>

<p>And hey, happy Disrupt week! Shout-out to RoboDeck, the deck maintenance robot. The company is competing in this week’s Startup Battlefield with a product they assure us is more than just “Roomba, but for resealing your deck” (to quote Greg’s piece). The system applies sealant and uses built-in mapping technology to determine the edges of the surface to avoid falling off.</p>

<p>The company has a prototype at the moment, capable of handling 500 square feet of deck in a charge. RoboDeck plans to offer the devices as an RaaS rental model when it comes to market. The company has thus far raised $500,000, with most of the funding coming from SOSV.</p>

Twenty startups competed this week on the TechCrunch virtual stage for $100,000 in equity-free prize money and last night, we announced the finalists: <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://adventr.io/">Adventr</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.cellinobio.com/">Cellino</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.withkoa.com/">Koa</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://nthcycle.com/">Nth Cycle</a> and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://tatum.io/">Tatum</a>.</p>
<p>The stakes stretch beyond prize money, however. The winner will become known to investors and potential partners and customers, thanks to global press coverage the event enjoys. It&#8217;s a hefty award and one that requires a panel of expert judges to help determine who should receive it. It&#8217;s a critical appointment — while brief — that can have a lasting impact on the founders who win, as well as help maintain TechCrunch&#8217;s reputation as an outlet that finds innovative tech and entrepreneurs behind it.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the five judges who will pick the 2021 Startup Battlefield winner:</p>
<p><b>Kirsten Green</b> is the founder and managing partner of Forerunner Ventures, a San Francisco-based VC firm she formed in 2010. Green has built her career as a VC by becoming an expert within the fields in which she invests, beginning in the consumer space and expanding to health and wellness, durable supply chains and more. Before starting Forerunner, the UCLA business economics graduate and licensed CPA was an equity research analyst and investor at Banc of America Securities, formerly Montgomery Securities, covering publicly traded retail and consumer stocks.</p>
<p>Green, who has collected a series of accolades, including being honored in Time’s 100 Most Influential People and named a Top 20 Venture Capitalists by The New York Times, currently serves as a board member on several portfolio companies, including Glossier, Faire, Hims-Hers, Curated, Ritual and Modern Fertility. She is also on the board of Nordstrom and previously served on the boards of Dollar Shave Club and Bonobos.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Lanzone </strong>was named earlier this month as the next <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/jim-lanzone-breaks-up-with-tinder-swipes-right-to-take-the-ceo-job-at-yahoo-renate-nyborg-takes-tinder-ceo-role/">CEO of Yahoo Inc</a>. (formerly Verizon Media and new TechCrunch corporate parent), a job he will officially begin September 27. The appointment comes <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">less than two weeks after Apollo Global completed its acquisition of the media group from Verizon for $5 billion. Lanzone is leaving his current CEO position at dating app Tinder to take this new role.</span></p>
<p>Lanzone has a long history in media and as an entrepreneur. He worked at Ask.com (formerly Ask Jeeves), a division of IAC/InterActiveCorp., for seven years, eventually leading the internet company. He went on to found Clicker, <span id="m_2435934466641439592m_4193223825249713276:2hy.2" role="menuitem" aria-haspopup="true">an</span> internet video search and programming guide. Clicker, which launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009, was acquired by CBS Interactive. He rose through the ranks at CBSi, holding the chief digital officer role until eventually becoming president and CEO. During his time at CBSi, Lanzone led the creation, launch and growth of streaming services CBS All Access, <span id="m_2435934466641439592m_4193223825249713276:2hy.1" role="menuitem" aria-haspopup="true">CBSN</span> and CBS Sports HQ.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Luciana Lixandru</strong> is a partner at Sequoia, where she focuses on enterprise and consumer technology companies across Europe. The Georgetown University economics and mathematics graduate started her career at Morgan Stanley as an analyst and was later an associate at Summit Partners.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming Sequoia’s first partner in Europe, Lixandru worked at Accel for eight years, where she led investments in Deliveroo, Hopin, Miro and UiPath, among others.</p>
<p><b>Sarah </b><strong>Tavel</strong> is a general partner at Benchmark, where she invests in network effect businesses with a focus on marketplaces and social, as well as cryptocurrency. Tavel currently sits on the boards of Chainalysis, Hipcamp, REKKI, Supergreat, Popshop and Poparazzi, as well as several unannounced companies.</p>
<p>After graduating from Harvard with a degree in philosophy, Tavel was a consultant at The Kerden Group and then vice president at Bessemer Venture Partners. She joined Pinterest in 2012 as one of the company&#8217;s first 35 employees after co-leading the Series A investment while at Bessemer. While at Pinterest she helped it expand internationally, close its Series C financing and led three acquisitions.</p>
<p>Tavel left Pinterest to become a partner at Greylock Partners, where she led their investment in Sonder and Gixo, which was acquired by Openfit.</p>
<p>Tavel is also a founding member of All Raise, the nonprofit organization focused on women in the venture capital and VC-backed startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Alexa von Tobel</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, the co-founder and managing partner of Inspired Capital, can likely relate to the startup founders on the TechCrunch stage. The Harvard College and Harvard Business school graduate founded LearnVest in 2008 with the goal of helping people make progress on their money. The company, which raised nearly $75 million in venture capital, was acquired by Northwestern Mutual in May 2015 in one of the biggest fintech acquisitions of the decade.</span></p>
<p>Von Tobel joined the management team of Northwestern Mutual as the company’s first chief digital officer. She later assumed the role of chief innovation officer through which she oversaw Northwestern Mutual’s venture arm. She&#8217;s also a New York Times-Bestselling author of the book, &#8220;Financially Fearless and Financially Forward&#8221; and hosts the weekly podcast &#8220;The Founders Project with Alexa von Tobel.&#8221; Alexa is a member of the 2016 Class of Henry Crown Fellows and an inaugural member of President Obama’s Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The lesson appears to be that revenue growth matters more than near-term margins for fintech companies, allowing them to secure valuations that far surpass their final private marks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startups are having one hell of a week.</p>
<p>On the heels of Boston-based software-and-payments company Toast&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/indications-of-a-hot-market-abound-as-freshworks-toast-price-ipos/">strong IPO pricing</a>, Remitly <a href="https://ir.remitly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/remitly-announces-pricing-initial-public-offering">priced</a> shares in its own debut above its proposed range yesterday evening. The Seattle-based fintech company sold 12,162,777 shares (7,000,000 primary) at $43 apiece. The company had previously targeted a $42 per-share max price for its IPO equity.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>At $43 per share, Remitly is valued less like a fintech company with gross margins in the 50% to 60% range and more like a middle-tier public SaaS firm, flush with recurring revenues and net-dollar retention north of 100%.</p>
<p>Toast, after seeing its shares rise sharply after starting to trade yesterday, sports a similar revenue multiple despite far weaker blended gross margins.</p>
<p>The lesson from today&#8217;s public markets appears to be that revenue growth matters more than near-term margins for fintech companies, allowing them to secure valuations that far surpass their final private marks. It&#8217;s an incredibly bullish set of results for fintech startups; they are worth more than they might have thought, or than their investors previously were willing to pay.</p>

It&#8217;s just perhaps even <em>better </em>than that for fintech upstarts.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the math, and then ask when the hell Chime and Klarna are going to get off their duffs and go public.</p>
<h2>Fintech is the new SaaS?</h2>
<p>In the second quarter of 2021, Toast <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001650164/000119312521276664/d166297ds1a.htm#tx166297_1">reported revenues</a> of $424.7 million and revenue costs of $336.3 million, giving the company a blended gross margin of just under 21%. Toast has high-margin SaaS revenues, low-margin fintech revenues and then smaller business lines that float around breakeven. It shakes out to a somewhat modest figure.</p>
<p>And worth $30.856 billion this morning, according to Yahoo Finance data, Toast has a run-rate multiple of 18.2x. Per <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">Bessemer data</a>, that&#8217;s roughly on par with the median revenue multiple for public SaaS companies.</p>
<p>Our read of the Toast revenue multiple is that public markets are valuing it far more on growth than margins, which means that fintech startups can accrete SaaS multiples no matter their gross margins, provided sufficient near-term revenue upside. Notable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/22/governor-newsom-signs-nation-leading-legislation-expanding-protections-for-warehouse-workers/">this week signed a bill</a> aimed at protecting warehouse workers from unsafe quotas. The bill, which cites issues around bathroom breaks, rest periods and other safety laws, has been seen as a repudiation of longstanding complaints against workplace conditions at Amazon fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>Introduced by Assembly Member Lorena Gonzalez in February,<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB701"> the bill</a> is designed to increase the transparency of quotas imposed on employees at warehouse distribution centers. Under the law, employers are required to inform workers of speed quotas. The legislation is also designed to mitigate punitive retaliation for not meeting quotas, including skipping breaks.</p>
<p>“This bill would provide that if a current or former employee believes that meeting a quota caused a violation of their right to a meal or rest period or required them to violate any occupational health and safety law or standard,” it reads, in part, “they have the right to request, and the employer is required to provide, a written description of each quota to which the employee is subject and a copy of the most recent 90 days of the employee’s own personal work speed data.”</p>
<p>The legislation was the most prominent in a list of 33 bills signed by the embattled Governor, along with a pair of vetoes. In statement tied to the news, Newsom commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We cannot allow corporations to put profit over people. The hardworking warehouse employees who have helped sustain us during these unprecedented times should not have to risk injury or face punishment as a result of exploitative quotas that violate basic health and safety. I’m proud to sign this legislation giving them the dignity, respect and safety they deserve and advancing California’s leadership at the forefront of workplace safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>For her part, Gonzalez has been more direct about the bill’s intended impact on Amazon, citing the company’s track record in <a href="https://a80.asmdc.org/press-releases/20210922-governor-signs-gonzalez-bill-creating-nations-first-protections-against">a statement released</a> following the governor’s signing.</p>
<p>“Amazon’s business model relies on enforcing inhumane work speeds that are injuring and churning through workers at a faster rate than we’ve ever seen. Workers aren’t machines. We’re not going to allow a corporation that puts profits over workers’ bodies to set labor standards back decades just for ‘same-day delivery,’ ” Gonzales writes. “This bill is simply about giving workers some basic dignity back and empowering them to keep themselves safe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In recent years, Amazon fulfillment centers have been a flash point for worker unionization efforts. Most recently, workers at one of the company’s Alberta fulfillment centers filed to hold a union vote, with a representative for Teamsters Canada<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/canadian-amazon-facility-files-union-vote-union-2021-09-14/"> calling the company</a>, “profoundly anti-worker.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new forecast on the state of the app economy indicates the third quarter will see record-breaking revenues spent on apps and games. According to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/q3-2021-biggest-quarter-yet/">App Annie</a>, consumers worldwide will spend $34 billion on apps and games in Q3, a 20% year-over-year increase on spending. The increase indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on consumer habits and behavior is having a lasting effect when it comes to how people are now using apps for entertainment, shopping, work, education and more.</p>
<p>App Annie, we should note, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">made headlines last week</a> for having massaged its data in earlier years using confidential sources, then misrepresented this to its trading firm clients as having been statistically modeled with internal controls to prevent such a thing from occurring. This resulted in a $10+ million securities fraud settlement with the SEC, as firms used the data to make investment decisions, as a result.</p>
<p>But App Annie data today still remains a fairly accurate representation of the mobile market, despite these manipulations, and for now is still one of many top companies that supply large app publishers, marketers and investors with information related to the mobile ecosystem.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2LY4zmEv2h"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/embed/#?secret=2LY4zmEv2h" data-secret="2LY4zmEv2h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The firm said that the largest contributor to app revenue in Q3 continues to be in-game spending and mobile subscriptions &#8212; the latter, a focus of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/fortnite-likely-isnt-coming-back-to-the-app-store-anytime-soon/">lawsuits</a> and increased regulation as both Apple and Google fight to retain their right to a cut of the purchases flowing through their app store platforms. Gaming continues to account for the majority of consumer spend, though non-gaming spending has grown its share over the past few years, thanks to subscriptions.</p>
<p>Android also still continues to outpace iOS on downloads, but the reverse is true when it comes to consumer spending.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207456" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207456" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207456" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Downloads in Q3 will have grown by 10% year-over-year to reach a record high of 36 billion, driven by Google Play and particularly downloads in emerging markets like India and Brazil. The strongest growth was also seen in Brazil, the Philippines and Mexico, and the Latin American market has begun to catch the attention of global publishers now, as well, as one with growth potential.</p>
<p>Industries driving download growth include travel, education and medical &#8212; all three of which have had pandemic impacts. Travel app downloads grew 35% quarter-over-quarter on Google Play and 15% on iOS as the summer travel season has picked up amidst widespread vaccine rollout. Medical and education apps, of course, have pandemic ties, as users turned to mobile technology to keep up with online learning and with doctors&#8217; appointments, COVID testing and vaccine appointments.</p>
<p>But iOS still reigns when it comes to revenue generated by mobile apps, accounting for 65% of app stores&#8217; consumer spending globally, which is in line with the past four quarters.</p>

<p>Consumer spending on iOS apps grew 15% year over year to $22 billion, and 15% year-over-year on Google Play to reach around $12 billion. Most of this revenue is generated by gaming apps, which account for 66% of the spend across both apps stores. In terms of non-gaming apps, iOS commands 76% of consumer spending. Much of the growth outside of gaming, across both platforms, comes from entertainment apps, photo and video apps, social media and dating apps, the firm says.</p>
<p>The U.S. and China are the largest iOS markets for consumer spending, with Japan, the U.S. and Taiwan accounting for the strongest growth. On Google Play, the U.S., Japan and South Korea were the largest markets by consumer spend, but Japan, Russia and Australia drove the growth.</p>
<p>While examinations of revenue and downloads have historically helped to paint a broad picture of the state of the mobile economy, as markets mature there&#8217;s greater interest in user engagement with apps &#8212; like those consumers already have installed on their devices.</p>
<p>A report from an App Annie competitor <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/state-of-app-engagement-report-2021">Sensor Tower, also out today</a>, dives into active users, sessions and retention metrics for games and non-games alike. The firm found that the top 500 apps worldwide now average 91.7 million monthly active users and this number has grown by 8.4% year-over-year during the second quarter, up from 84.6 million in Q2 2020.</p>

<p>Business apps saw the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between Q1 2018 and Q2 2021, climbing nearly 42% over that time frame, Sensor Tower said. Meanwhile, consumers in Q2 2021 spent the most time in entertainment apps, with each of the top 100 seeing nearly 29 minutes of daily usage, on average.</p>

<p>Among games, shooter genre games &#8212; like PUBG Mobile and Garena Free Fire &#8212; saw the most daily active users in Q2, as the top 50 games in this genre averaged 7.6 million daily active users. In terms of weekly actives, however, hypercasual games came out on top.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower also credits earlier increases in active users across apps to the COVID-19 pandemic as users who turned to mobile devices during lockdowns. But after a slight dip in Q3 2020, growth in active users has now returned to pre-pandemic levels, it said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors has now joined a slew of other major automakers, including Toyota, Chinese state-backed SAIC Motor and Mercedes-Benz AG, in putting its chips behind Chinese autonomous driving startup Momenta.</p>
<p>GM, the largest automaker in the U.S. in terms of vehicle sales, said Tuesday it will invest $300 million in Momenta to accelerate the development of AV tech for future GM vehicles in China. Julian Blissett, executive VP of GM and president of GM China, said in a statement that the investment will help the automaker bring “solutions tailor-made for [GM’s] consumers in China.”</p>
<p>The news comes less than six months after Momenta closed a nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/">$500 million</a> funding round, which saw participation from SAIC, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz AG and Bosch. As TechCrunch’s Rita Liao notes, “mega-fundraising has become common in the capital-intensive autonomous vehicle world.” But it appears that the startup is moving closer to commercialization as it aims to mass-produce cars equipped with its software by the end of this year.</p>
<p>This is just the latest aggressive investment into next-gen technology from GM, which said in June it had earmarked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion</a> for electric and AV ventures through 2025. Here in the U.S., GM’s interest in autonomous technology is best-known via its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise, which recently tapped a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion</a> line of credit from the automaker’s financial firm.</p>
<p>But GM has also established a strong series of partnerships in China, as it seeks to take a firm foothold in the world’s largest EV market. The country’s best-selling electric vehicle, a tiny city car called the Wuling Mini EV, is manufactured by SAIC-GM-Wuling &#8212; as the name suggests, a joint venture between GM, SAIC and Wuling Motors. SAIC-GM-Wuling also manufactures the popular brand Baojun.</p>
<p>Chinese municipal governments have also taken a notably progressive stance toward autonomous driving, Chinese AV startup executives noted at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-rise-of-robotaxis-in-china/">TC Mobility in June</a>.</p>
<p>“In China, each local government is incentivized to really act like entrepreneurs like us,” Huan Sun, Europe general manager at Momenta, said during the event. “They are very progressive in developing the local economy… What we feel is that autonomous driving technology can greatly improve and upgrade the [local governments’] economic structure.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>While GM declined to state when drivers would see Momenta tech in its Chinese vehicles, a spokesperson for the automaker confirmed that the partnership between the two companies would not extend to GM vehicles manufactured and sold in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicle company Motional is expanding its operations and employee headcount in Las Vegas, including tripling the size of its testing facility, in the run up to its planned 2023 commercial deployment of robotaxis.</p>
<p>The company, the product of a $4 billion joint venture between Aptiv and Hyundai, has been in Las Vegas for nearly four years. Motional first began testing it autonomous vehicle in Las Vegas through a partnership with Lyft. The two companies kicked off with what was supposed to be a weeklong pilot program to offer rides in autonomous vehicles on the Lyft network in Las Vegas during the 2018 CES tech trade show.</p>
<p>The partnership predates the joint venture with Hyundai. At the time, Motional was known as Aptiv Autonomous Mobility Group. That temporary experiment, which has always included a human safety driver, was extended and still exists today. As of February 2020, the program had given more than 100,000 paid self-driving rides in Aptiv’s — now Motional’s — self-driving vehicles, per the Lyft app. Motional has not provided an updated number on the number of paid rides taken through the Lyft app.</p>
<p>Motional&#8217;s operations in Nevada extend beyond its partnership with Lyft. The company also tests on public roads on an ongoing basis in Nevada.</p>
<p>The expansion plans at its Las Vegas facility also include doubling its operations center. What this actually means is that the company is now using its entire 130,000-square-foot technical center that Motional opened several years ago to house its fleet of autonomous vehicles as well as an engineering team dedicated to research and development of software and hardware systems, validation and mapping.</p>
<p>As part of this expansion, Motional is also hiring more than 100 new employees. The company currently employs more than 250 people in Las Vegas.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FkTuGlpZqQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/motional-ceo-hints-at-an-autonomous-future-in-logistics/">Motional CEO hints at an autonomous future in logistics</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Motional CEO hints at an autonomous future in logistics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/motional-ceo-hints-at-an-autonomous-future-in-logistics/embed/#?secret=FkTuGlpZqQ" data-secret="FkTuGlpZqQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Motional&#8217;s growing operations in Las Vegas — and notably a closed track that will allow four times the volume of testing — are in preparation for its next-generation robotaxi based on the all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5. Motional&#8217;s President and CEO Karl Iagnemma said the expansion will allow the company to accelerate testing ahead of the commercial deployment of its fully driverless robotaxis in 2023.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas announcement comes a month after Motional <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/">expanded operations in California</a>. The company said in August it is opening a new operations facility in Los Angeles to support testing on public roads, hiring more engineers and adding an office in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The investment into California and this latest plan to grow operations in Nevada follows a hiring spree that has pushed Motional’s total headcount to more than 1,000 people, an expansion into Seoul and its announcement last December to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">fully driverless robotaxi services</a> in major U.S. cities in 2023 using the Lyft ride-hailing network.</p>
<p>Motional didn&#8217;t disclose its investment into the California expansion, nor has it shared financial details of its plans for the Las Vegas facility. A company spokesperson said it &#8220;does represent Motional’s largest investment in our Nevada operations.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Clarification: Motional announced it was doubling its operations. It is not doubling the size of its facility, instead it is using the entire center and adding more than 100 employees. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever had to take out a loan, you know just how many documents are involved in the approval process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is tedious and time-consuming, and in many more cases than you’d expect &#8212; still manual.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ocrolus.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a startup that is hoping to change that with an automation platform that it says analyzes financial documents with over 99% accuracy. To that end, the New York-based company today has announced that it has raised $80 million in Series C funding toward its mission of helping lenders automate the underwriting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fin VC led the financing, which values New York-based Ocrolus at “north of $500 million” and brings its total funding raised since its 2014 inception to over $100 million. Thomvest Ventures, Mubadala Ventures, Oak HC/FT, FinTech Collective, QED Investors, Bullpen Capital, ValueStream Ventures, Laconia, RiverPark Ventures, Stage II Capital and Cross River Bank also participated in the latest round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is one that is refreshingly transparent about its financials. From the first quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2021, Ocrolus has grown its revenue from $1 million to $20 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), according to co-founder and CEO Sam Bobley. It has managed to land a number of high-profile fintech customers, including Brex, Enova, LendingClub, PayPal, Plaid and SoFi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s done that by spending roughly $10 million in total sales and marketing expenses, Bobley said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s ready to go after more traditional financial institutions too. With its new capital, the startup plans to “more aggressively” build products for the mortgage lending and banking industries and expand its U.S. operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus uses a combination of technology, including OCR (optical character recognition), machine learning/AI and big data to analyze financial documents. But what sets it apart, says Bobley, is the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) component also used in document processing to further ensure accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the company aims to help lenders make “faster, data-driven decisions.” Its technology can classify financial documents, capture key data fields, detect fraud and analyze cash flows, according to Bobley. It’s clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a digital acceleration in many industries, with financial services being among the most affected. Prior to the pandemic, less than 1% of loans in the world were made online, notes Bobley. But since the COVID-19 outbreak, demand for digital lending technology among traditional financial services firms has “accelerated dramatically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, as COVID-19 has forced financial institutions to evolve, every lender and bank has no choice but to offer online options to customers,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fin VC managing general partner and founder Logan Allin agrees, pointing out that fintechs and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">banks alike still struggle with “mountains” of digital and paper documents in extracting the financial data they need to process and analyze during the loan application process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ocrolus has emerged as one of the pillars of the fintech ecosystem and is solving for these challenges using OCR, AI/ML, and big data/analytics,” he wrote via email. “We believe that Ocrolus is just getting started in terms of the use cases and scope of their platform and we are excited about this unconstrained TAM.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus is not the only player in the space, but what’s helping drive its growth and set it apart, Allin believes, is its fraud detection and compliance overlay capabilities, as well as its tailored analytics and benchmarking capabilities for its customer base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Ocrolus started </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the intent to automate the long-term care Medicaid application process. It found that “well-paid professionals” were spending their time combing through documents page by page, line by line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we started to research the problem and what we learned is that existing technology in the market simply was not accurate enough to be useful,” Bobley told TechCrunch. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google offer OCR products, but many struggle at reading text off of PDFs and images, particularly when the documents are semi-structured or unstructured, Bobley said. It’s also difficult for machines to make sense of all the varying formats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to create a new way of doing this. And what we did was we built a machine learning-based platform that also incorporates humans,” he said. “The goal was that no matter what the document that was submitted looks like &#8212; if it&#8217;s a clean document from Chase, or a blurry cell phone image from a community bank in Kansas &#8212; we&#8217;ll be able to process it with perfect accuracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the solution can’t do automatically, it slices into smaller tasks and routes to its own team of analysts and quality control specialists to perform data verification. The company then uses a series of algorithm checks to make sure its workers did the work correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Long story short, we deliver back perfectly accurate structured digital data for every single file we process,” Bobley said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206996" style="width: 2493px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206996" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2206996 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocrolus-data-extraction-e1632373276873.jpg" alt="" width="2483" height="1674" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206996" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus </span></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a year or so into the company’s life, the team realized that “lending was a much bigger and more attractive market opportunity”  than Medicaid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really entered the fintech lending space at the right place at the right time,” Bobley told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2016, the company had launched its official product and was generating revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the benefits of our software is that it has really helped fintech lenders scale,” Bobley said. “Our product, frankly, is 10x better than doing it manually. Once we processed the loans instantly or in a matter of minutes, when everybody else was taking hours or days, people started to come to us &#8212; including big fintech lenders &#8212; without us even having a sales force.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for Bobley, the startup is more than just about speeding up the loan process. It is also about financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform helps lenders automate underwriting and intelligently leverage cash flow and income data for credit scoring” Bobley said. “By enabling lenders to more quickly analyze diverse sources of financial data, Ocrolus levels the playing field for every borrower, providing expanded access to credit at a lower cost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to also use its new capital to continue to hire, with a focus on its machine learning and data science teams. It’s also planning to open a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new data quality control facility in Florida to accommodate financial institutions and government entities with onshore data requirements. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open banking &#8212; a new approach to payments and other financial services that disrupts traditional card-based infrastructure by linking directly into banks &#8212; is having a moment. On the heels of open banking startup TrueLayer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/truelayer-nabs-130m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-open-banking-rises-as-a-viable-option-to-card-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hitting a $1 billion valuation</a> in its latest round after seeing strong traction for its services, today another open banking startup, <a href="https://www.payvyne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vyne</a>, is officially opening for business, and announcing seed funding of $15.5 million to help it grow.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from Hearst, Entrée Capital, Triplepoint, Seedcamp, Venrex, Founder Collective and Partech, with Alex Chesterman (founder of Rightmove and CEO of Cazoo), Charlie Dellingpole (CEO and founder of ComplyAdvantage) and Will Neale (founder of Grabyo) also participating. CEO Karl MacGregor said in an interview that the round was &#8220;massively oversubscribed.&#8221;</p>
<p>London-based Vyne has been quietly building its platform &#8212; which targets merchants to help them build open banking-based payment services &#8212; for the past 18 months, honing the tools based on feedback from early customers that it&#8217;s picked up ahead of today&#8217;s wider launch. The sizable seed round from strong investors is due to a few factors. Firstly, because of its early traction &#8212; the company says that it&#8217;s already processing millions of pounds in transactions in the U.K. each month, and is growing currently at a rate of 95% each month &#8212; in what (secondly) many believe is poised to be a big market in coming years. And thirdly, because of the pedigree of its four founders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TrueLayer nabs $130M at a $1B+ valuation as open banking rises as a viable option to card networks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/truelayer-nabs-130m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-open-banking-rises-as-a-viable-option-to-card-networks/embed/#?secret=66nS6NOV7V" data-secret="66nS6NOV7V" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>MacGregor&#8217;s long financial services resume includes years as an executive at Barclays (at Barclaycard), online betting company Ladbrokes (where he oversaw not just payments but also fraud) and Worldpay. COO Damien Cahill spent years at Worldpay, as well as Amazon. CTO Adam Rowland was also a Worldpay alum, among other financial services roles elsewhere. And business development head Nick Daniel spent years in financial services at Logica (now part of CGI) and VocaLink (which was acquired for nearly $1 billion by Mastercard a few years ago).</p>
<p>With a lot of that experience covering payment systems based on cards and card networks, it was the perfect knowledge bank for understanding why open banking was such an important innovation, and why it had an opportunity to disrupt a lot of what&#8217;s in place today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our key takeaway over those years [of experience] was that payment cards are not a great fit for e-commerce,&#8221; MacGregor said. &#8220;They were designed 40 years ago, and are costly and inefficient.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He noted that the annual cost of dealing with fraud is now at €25 billion (there is a comparable number in <a href="https://www.merchantsavvy.co.uk/payment-fraud-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this report</a>), and that&#8217;s before considering other issues related to the friction of using cards for payments, such as shopping cart abandonment (users give up instead of pulling out cards and punching numbers in), mistyped details and more.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Because of that, MacGregor said many in the industry, including Vyne&#8217;s co-founders, &#8220;saw open banking as a huge opportunity&#8221; to transform the rails around how people get paid. &#8220;That is a global scale opportunity, and this is what motivates us,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p>MacGregor claims that implementing an open banking-based system can save a merchant up to 65% in costs because of the added speed and efficiency (and no longer needing to pay fees to card networks).</p>
<p>TrueLayer&#8217;s value in the market, as one of the early movers in this space, has been in how it worked with a wide range of major and smaller banks to help build the infrastructure and services to integrate their banking services into a wider network where they could be used for direct payments and providing other kinds of financial data about their customers. It then used that critical mass to build out the connectors to those who wanted to use those integrations to do stuff: build payment flows, authenticate users and more.</p>
<p>As a later entrant, Vyne&#8217;s value has been in using some of that groundwork to then focus more on the merchant end of that ecosystem, and to make their open banking-based services work more seamlessly for their customers. For example, if a customer selects an open banking option for payment in an app, the customer is then redirected to the banking app used for banking to authenticate the transaction and the connection without needing to enter any details. &#8220;The UX has been significantly improved,&#8221; MacGregor said.</p>
<p>Targeting primarily digitally native consumers as the most likely early adopters, Vyne also lets merchants build QR codes and pay-by-link to complete transactions.</p>
<p>The fact that we&#8217;re still talking about early adopters, however, speaks to the bigger challenges that exist, not just for Vyne but all startups focused on open banking. Open banking is at its most mature state in the U.K., but even here it&#8217;s relatively young: regulations only came into effect at the start of January 2018. Europe has followed on, and although there are companies like Plaid in the U.S. that have made some interesting headway in building services that bypass payment rails, regulation has been <a href="https://www.finextra.com/the-long-read/234/why-bidens-executive-order-is-a-green-light-for-us-open-banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow to follow</a>. Some have even <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/open-banking-treasury-prime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculated</a> it may never arrive.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why fintechs are buying up legacy financial services companies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/why-fintechs-are-buying-up-legacy-financial-services-companies/embed/#?secret=hbYYWdkf5Q" data-secret="hbYYWdkf5Q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s catchily-named <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Banking Implementation Entity</a> (OBIE for short), a trade body for those building in this area, is predictably upbeat about growth. However, if the numbers speak for themselves, there is clear opportunity. The OBIE <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/three-years-since-psd2-marked-the-start-of-open-banking-the-uk-has-built-a-world-leading-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a recent report</a> that some 300 fintechs are now in the open banking ecosystem, and more than 2.5 million consumers in the U.K. are using services enabled by open banking (these include payments, getting lines of credit, authenticating services, and more). And, API call volumes reached 6 billion in 2020, up from just 66.8 million in 2018. Adoption is coming, if perhaps slowly and not as internationally as what open banking is trying to replace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our view is that this is the hockey stick of growth that all VCs like,&#8221; Megumi Ikeda, the MD for Hearst Investments, said in an interview. &#8220;The second factor is the habits of consumers. They have shifted to a cashless economy [but] merchants are still operating on old banking rails&#8230; Open banking helps the merchants catch up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps just as importantly, by giving customers a more direct grip on how and where their financial data is used, by dis-intermediating the card companies (and credit ratings, and many others involved) in the process, open banking is part of a bigger evolution in how personal data and information are being used. As systems catch up with what we use them for, that can only be a good thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earning passive income as an investor in single-family rental homes is a dream for many, but also something that can be intimidating to break into.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.awning.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a startup that aims to make the process less intimidating through a platform designed to allow individuals to invest in single-family rental homes not just in the cities or states in which they live but in other markets remotely as well. And today, the San Francisco-based real estate brokerage is coming out of stealth with $9.3 million in a seed funding round led by Global Founders Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MassMutual Ventures and several strategic angel investors, including Side co-founders Guy Gal &amp; Ed Wu, SafeGraph founder Auren Hoffman, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opendoor’s former VP of Analytics Peter Fishman, Lightspeed Ventures Partner Justin Overdorff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Scale founder Lucy Guo, also participated in the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Shri Ganeshram</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danaus Chang in 2019 to start</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning after stints as a founding team member at FlightCar and lead product and engineering at Eaze. Prior to becoming an entrepreneur, Ganeshram had dropped out of high school in Texas after gaining early admission to MIT (where he later co-founded FlightCar).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform launched in closed access earlier this year, and is today open to investors across the U.S. and Canada. Currently, it connects buyers with listings in three states &#8212; California, Texas and Florida. Part of the plans for the new capital is to add new markets to its portfolio in the coming months.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning works by using machine learning and data analytics in an effort “to surface the best nationwide single-family rental properties for investors, with estimations of their financial returns.” A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wning customers are paired with advisors to determine their investment strategy, and Awning’s local agents “qualitatively” review every property. Those advisors can also help investors secure financing and connect buyers with &#8220;vetted&#8221; property managers to oversee their properties and manage leasing and day-to-day maintenance.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a similar, but different, model to another startup we covered recently &#8212; Mynd, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a company that also aims to make it easier for people to buy and manage single-family rental properties, which last week announced it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/mynd-raises-57-3m-from-qed-investors-at-a-870m-valuation-to-give-people-a-way-to-invest-in-rental-properties-remotely/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $57.3 million in funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from QED Investors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unlike Mynd, Awning won’t manage the properties for investors. It is also different in that it is focused on helping individual investors, while Mynd also serves institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning’s &#8220;advisors&#8221; (also licensed real estate agents) curate properties that they believe are the best fit for an investor based on their budget and goals, and using the startup’s proprietary machine learning model, can estimate the rent, expenses, appreciation and potential ROI on every listing on the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform does this by ingesting all the listings from different MLSes in the various markets, and automatically analyzes each one for returns and risks after an advisor learns about a potential investor’s financial goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once an investor is ready to move further, they can use our platform to communicate with an advisor and place offers,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ganeshram said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207226" style="width: 2828px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207226" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg" alt="" width="2818" height="1528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg 2818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=1536,833 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=2048,1110 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2818px) 100vw, 2818px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207226" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Awning</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ganeshram, the process to invest in single-family rentals has been “cumbersome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels like it’s stuck in the last century,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning’s “strong” human and technology components make it a faster and easier experience, the company claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the platform has helped facilitate the sale of $5 million in real estate. It makes money by taking a commission from the seller, just as other real estate brokerages do, and doesn’t charge any additional fees. That commission is typically 6% built into the listing, paid upon closing &#8212; with 3% going to the respective agents for the buyer and seller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later this year, Awning plans to launch in Florida and Alabama, and then other markets over the next year. Expansion can be challenging because the company must set up a licensed brokerage in each state it wants to enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Founders Capital’s </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donaldstalter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Stalter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said his firm has known Awning co-founders “for years” before Awning&#8217;s formation, and when they approached his firm about starting the company, he “knew that we needed to lead their first round of financing,” Stalter wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kendrickgeluzkho/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kendrick Kho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Global Founders Capital said he has invested in other real estate investment startups over the past five years, and believed that Awning stands out from other offerings with its focus on individual buyers, rather than institutions. He also likes the company’s approach of  “getting buyers familiar with their potential investments as actual physical houses instead of lines on a spreadsheet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With their product and engineering expertise, they have quickly built a platform where curation, education, and data accuracy are superior to alternatives,” Kho wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also attracted to the fact that Awning does not reject the idea of partnering with real estate agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of entrepreneurs in real estate tech believe that human agents are superfluous, but don&#8217;t realize that when a buyer in New York City wants to buy their very first investment property and are looking at homes hundreds of miles away,” Kho added, “he or she wants a human agent there to answer questions and be an expert guide on the process.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EU lawmakers are finally set to standardize charging ports for consumer electronics devices like smartphones and tablets &#8212; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613">announcing</a> a proposal today that, once adopted, will see the region settle on USB-C as a universal charging port for gadgets which will also include cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld videogames consoles.</p>
<p>Some smaller consumer electronics devices &#8212; like smart watches and fitness bands &#8212; are being excluded owing to factors like their size and conditions of use.</p>
<p>The Commission plan will also see regional lawmakers unbundle the sale of chargers from mobiles so they are not automatically included in the box.</p>
<p>Fast charging standards will also be harmonized under the proposal &#8212; while device makers will have requirements to provide users with &#8220;relevant information about charging performance&#8221;, including info on the power required and if a device supports fast charging.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will make it easier for consumers to see if their existing chargers meet the requirements of their new device or help them to select a compatible charger,&#8221; the Commission notes, going on to suggest that the full package of measures will help consumers limit the number of new chargers they buy and help them save €250 million a year on unnecessary charger purchases.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613">announcement</a> of the proposal, the Commission acknowledges that the &#8220;voluntary approach&#8221; it has pursued for over a decade &#8212; attempting to nudge the electronics industry toward a common standard through mechanisms like a Memorandum of Understanding &#8212; has failed to deliver the sought-for standard, with still three different types of mobile phone chargers in play for instance.</p>
<p>The wider aim here is to make a meaningful dent in the global e-waste mountain by reducing a portion generated by the consumer electronics sector &#8212; with the Commission noting, for example, that consumers already own around three mobile phone chargers on average, of which they use two on a regular basis. Ergo, there&#8217;s simply no call for device makers to put a new charger in the box every time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Disposed of unused chargers are estimated to represent some 11,000 tonnes of e-waste annually, the Commission adds.</p>
<p>One of the non-standard chargers still on the mobile market belongs to the iPhone maker Apple, of course &#8212; which has resisted pressure to put a standard port in its devices &#8212; so a pan-EU law to enforce a universal charger could force the tech giant to finally abandon its proprietary Lightning port.</p>
<p>For years, Apple has presided over a sprawling and doubtless highly lucrative accessories business rather than switch to more standard ports on its devices. Indeed, sometimes it has even removed standard ports &#8212; deleting the 3.5mm headphone jack off of the iPhone, for instance. It means that users of Apple&#8217;s devices typically have to purchase dongles if they wish to gain access to more standard ports &#8212; generating yet more future e-waste.</p>
<p>Whether the EU&#8217;s legislative proposal will actually outlaw Apple&#8217;s dongle-based workaround to embedded universality remains to be seen. (We&#8217;ve put the question to the Commission.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU lawmakers take fresh aim at Apple&#8217;s Lightning connector with latest e-waste push&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/eu-lawmakers-take-fresh-aim-at-apples-lightning-connector-with-latest-e-waste-push/embed/#?secret=Z8Np6agVet" data-secret="Z8Np6agVet" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Commenting on the Commission proposal in a statement, Margrethe Vestager, its EVP for digital strategy, said: “European consumers were frustrated long enough about incompatible chargers piling up in their drawers. We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger. This is an important win for our consumers and environment and in line with our green and digital ambitions.”</p>
<p>In a mirror statement, Thierry Breton, the EU&#8217;s commissioner for internal market, added: “Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that. With our proposal, European consumers will be able to use a single charger for all their portable electronics – an important step to increase convenience and reduce waste.”</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s other institutions &#8212; the European Parliament and Council &#8212; will still need to back the proposal in order for it to become law. Although the European Parliament has long expressed frustration with the Commission&#8217;s failure to deliver a common charging standard &#8212; and voted overwhelmingly for tougher action on the issue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/eu-lawmakers-take-fresh-aim-at-apples-lightning-connector-with-latest-e-waste-push/">last year</a> &#8212; so MEPs will likely be keen to make a pan-EU law on this happen.</p>
<p>Even so, there won&#8217;t be a radical change overnight. The Commission has suggested a transition period of 24 months from the data of adoption of the legislative &#8212; so even if the Parliament and Council quickly agree to the plan it will still be years, plural, before device makers have to comply.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s PR notes that it wants to give industry &#8220;ample time&#8221; to adapt to the planned law change, even though the sector has had over a decade of pressure on exactly this issue.</p>
<p>A further step will be needed for Europe to get the common charger solution the Commission wants &#8212; with more harmonization required to ensure interoperability of the external power supply. Legislators say that piece will be dealt with by the review of the Ecodesign Regulation &#8212; slated to be launched later this year with the aim of it also entering into force at the same time as the common charger port requirement.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_4614">FAQ</a> on the latter proposal, the Commission answers its own question on why it&#8217;s taken it so long to grasp the legislative nettle with this issue, writing that it had initially sought to continue with a more &#8220;ambitious&#8221; voluntary approach in the hopes that the sector would engage. However, it said proposals put forward by the industry &#8220;fell short&#8221; &#8212; and would not have delivered a common charging solution.</p>
<p>Legislators learning that they do actually need to legislate looks like an important lesson as the world gears up to tackle other existential environmental challenges &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/uns-ipcc-report-on-climate-change-sounds-code-red-for-planet/">climate change</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/calyxia-bags-17-6m-to-tackle-the-global-microplastics-problem/">microplastics pollution</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly been devastating on many levels. But if there’s any silver lining in the global crisis, it could be that it’s less taboo to talk about feeling anxious, depressed or burnt out. Because chances are, the person you’re talking to is feeling one of those things too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s no surprise that therapists and psychiatrists alike are struggling to keep up with demand. But not all therapists are created equal and unfortunately, there are psychiatrists out there that can be too quick to dole out medicine to treat a person’s issues.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.meruhealth.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meru Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a startup that aims to solve a number of the challenges associated with getting access to quality mental health care, with what it describes as a comprehensive online mental health solution. Kristian Ranta founded the San Mateo, California-based company in 2016 after his brother, Peter, committed suicide. In his view, if his brother had access to better mental health options, he might not have taken his own life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As COVID forced people to seek online options for all types of healthcare, including mental health, it’s no surprise that Meru Health grew its customer base by 10x and saw about 700% revenue growth in 2020. And today, the startup is announcing that it has secured $38 million in a Series B round of funding, bringing its total raised since its 2016 inception to $51.3 million. Industry Ventures led the $30 million equity round. The remaining $8 million was secured in debt. Early backers Bold Capital Partners, Freestyle VC, FMZ Ventures and Leksell Social Ventures also participated in the equity financing, while J.P. Morgan funded the debt portion of the round.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first two or three years of Meru Health’s life, Ranta focused mostly on research to determine just how well digital therapy and “old school” psychiatry was working. The evidence out there, he felt, was flimsy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things the company concluded was that “digital is great bu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t without the human touch, it&#8217;s not going to get utilization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or in other words, purely app-based solutions just won’t cut it when it comes to treating depression, anxiety and burnout.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But if there’s no kind of accountability, there or there is no human connection, it’s going to be much harder to keep people engaged and people end up dropping out,” Ranta told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meru Health works with employers such as Stanford University and several Fortune 100 and 500 companies, EAPs such as Wellspring and healthcare payers such as Cigna, Humana and Moda Health to provide an online mental healthcare program that it says </span><a href="https://www.meruhealth.com/science#studies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strong and lasting clinical outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has been able to sell its solution to employers by demonstrating that the benefits of offering the program to employees far outweighs the cost. Specifically, Meru estimates that the average cost savings for an employer for its program is over $6,000 per enrolled participant because the downstream healthcare costs and reduced worker productivity of untreated anxiety and depression are so high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s interesting about Meru Health’s approach is that it aims to be a holistic one &#8212; treating both the mind and body concurrently, rather than just focusing on one thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We learned, for example, if we just do talk therapy, it doesn’t work for all mental health struggles,” Ranta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it helps patients with getting better sleep and nutritional coaching because, as Ranta puts it, “sleep is interconnected to mental health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still haven’t seen anyone else look at the food and mood connection,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also provides a wearable device to capture physical biomarkers so people can see the effects of things like deep breathing and “start to control their own response to stress,” Ranta said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207101" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207101" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207101 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1T8C0554.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1T8C0554.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1T8C0554.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1T8C0554.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1T8C0554.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1T8C0554.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1T8C0554.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1T8C0554.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1T8C0554.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207101" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Meru Health</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ne of the challenges in mental health grades, but there&#8217;s just a lot of self report, so we&#8217;ve been bringing in these elements of more objective data capture and also provide feedback for our patients,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holistic approach seems to be resonating, and Meru’s plans with the capital include getting fully covered by carriers in more states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building out our nationwide network, and how to be in 40 states by year’s end,” Ranta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also, naturally, plans to add to its staff of about 170.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also intends to continue clinical trials, and “do science properly,” as Ranta puts it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do open data sharing through trials with the best universities and share all the results openly,” he said. “We’re now showing with research that this approach has 3-5x better clinical results than the standard of care in the U.S., and a roughly 80% completion rate, which compares to 30% to 50% in traditional therapy because we engage people dramatically better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That engagement caught the eye of Industry Ventures VP Fanni Fan, who said her firm has been following the mental health space for years and “looking to back entrepreneurs leveraging technology to improve access and quality of care in behavioral health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meru Health stood out among its competitors in many ways, she told TechCrunch, including its “exceptionally high engagement and completion rates, strong clinical outcomes validated by long-term clinical studies and three month curriculum coupled with biofeedback that drive engagement and also enable payers to measure outcomes more easily.”</span></p>
