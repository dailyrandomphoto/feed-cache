										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian fintech startup BharatPe has raised $370 million in a new round of financing as it looks to aggressively scale its business in the next two years. It&#8217;s the nineteenth Indian startup to become a unicorn this year (up from 11 last year) as several high-profile global investors double down in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The new round &#8212; a Series E &#8212; was led by Tiger Global and valued the New Delhi-based startup at $2.85 billion (post-money), it said in a statement Tuesday evening. Dragoneer Investor Group and Steadfast Capital also participated in the new round, which brings the startup’s to-date raise to over $580 million against equity.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s news <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/tiger-global-in-talks-to-back-bharatpe-at-2-5-billion-valuation/">confirms a TechCrunch scoop from June</a> in which we reported that the four-year-old startup was looking to raise about $250 million at a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion. BharatPe was valued at about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/india-fintech-bharatpe-valued-at-900-million-in-new-108-million-fundraise/">$900 million in its Series D</a> round in February this year, and $425 million last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BharatPe co-founder Ashneer Grover confirmed that the startup was indeed looking to raise $250 million until inbound requests from investors prompted an oversubscription. The new investment also includes some secondary transactions.</p>

<p>BharatPe, which counts Coatue, Ribbit Capital and Sequoia Capital India among its existing investors, operates an eponymous service to help offline merchants accept digital payments and secure working capital.</p>
<p>Even as India has already emerged as the second-largest internet market, with more than 650 million users, much of the country remains offline.</p>
<p>Among those outside of the reach of the internet are merchants running small businesses, such as roadside tea stalls and neighborhood stores. To make these merchants comfortable with accepting digital payments, BharatPe relies on QR codes and point of sale machines that support government-backed UPI payments infrastructure.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111978" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111978" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111978 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="527" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg 1722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=680,350 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=1536,790 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111978" class="wp-caption-text">Scores of giants and startups are attempting to serve neighborhood stores in India. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bank of America Research</p></div></p>
<p>The startup, which serves more than 7 million merchants in over 130 Indian cities, said it has disbursed close to $300 million to merchant partners. It does not charge merchants for universal QR code access, but is looking to make money by lending.</p>
<p>The startup plans to expand its product offerings as well as work with Centrum Financial Services, with which it was recently granted the license by India’s central bank (Reserve Bank of India) to set up a small finance bank. (Centrum Financial Services has collaborated with BharatPe for the license, and the Indian startup says the two are “equal” partners.)</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s development further illustrates the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">growing interest of Tiger Global in India</a>. The New York-headquartered firm has backed dozens of Indian startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/indian-social-commerce-dealshare-raises-144-million-eyes-international-expansion/">social commerce startup DealShare</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/tiger-global-in-talks-to-invest-in-classplus-at-over-250-million-valuation/">edtech Classplus</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/india-jobs-app-apna-raises-70-million/">Apna</a> (an app that helps blue-collar workers connect with recruiters) and home services platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/home-services-platform-urban-company-raises-255-million-at-2-1-billion-valuation/">Urban Company</a> in recent months.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Infra.Market, an Indian startup that helps construction and real estate companies procure materials and handle logistics for their projects, said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/india-infra-market-valued-at-2-5b-in-tiger-global-led-125m-funding/">raised $125 million in a round led also by Tiger Global</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.K. cybersecurity company Pen Test Partners has identified several vulnerabilities in the APIs of six home electric vehicle charging brands and a large public EV charging network. While the charger manufacturers resolved most of the issues, the findings are the latest example of the poorly regulated world of Internet of Things devices, which are poised to become all but ubiquitous in our homes and vehicles.</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities were identified in the API of six different EV charging brands — Project EV, Wallbox, EVBox, EO Charging’s EO Hub and EO mini pro 2, Rolec and Hypervolt — and public charging network Chargepoint. Security researcher Vangelis Stykas identified several security flaws among the various brands that could have allowed a malicious hacker to hijack user accounts, impede charging and even turn one of the chargers into a &#8220;backdoor&#8221; into the owner’s home network.</p>
<p>The consequences of a hack to a public charging station network could include theft of electricity at the expense of driver accounts and turning chargers on or off.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185146" style="width: 381px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185146" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2185146 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/wallbox.png" alt="" width="371" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/wallbox.png 371w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/wallbox.png?resize=134,150 134w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/wallbox.png?resize=268,300 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/wallbox.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185146" class="wp-caption-text">A Raspberry Pi in a Wallbox charger. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pen Test Partners <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Some EV chargers used a Raspberry Pi compute module, a low-cost computer that&#8217;s often used by hobbyists and programmers.</p>
<p>“The Pi is a great hobbyist and educational computing platform, but in our opinion it’s not suitable for commercial applications as it doesn’t have what’s known as a &#8216;secure bootloader,&#8217;” Pen Test Partners founder Ken Munro told TechCrunch. “This means anyone with physical access to the outside of your home (hence to your charger) could open it up and steal your Wi-Fi credentials. Yes, the risk is low, but I don’t think charger vendors should be exposing us to additional risk.”</p>
<p>The hacks are &#8220;really fairly simple,&#8221; Munro said. “I can teach you to do this in five minutes,” he added.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s report, <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/smart-car-chargers-plug-n-play-for-hackers/">published this past weekend</a>, touched on vulnerabilities associated with emerging protocols like the Open Charge Point Interface, maintained and managed by the EVRoaming Foundation. The protocol was designed to make charging seamless between different charging networks and operators.</p>
<p>Munro likened it to roaming on a cell phone, allowing drivers to use networks outside of their usual charging network. OCPI isn’t widely used at the moment, so these vulnerabilities could be designed out of the protocol. But if left unaddressed, it could mean &#8220;that a vulnerability in one platform potentially creates a vulnerability in another,&#8221; Stykas explained.</p>
<p>Hacks to charging stations have become a particularly nefarious threat as a greater share of transportation becomes electrified and more power flows through the electric grid. Electric grids are not designed for large swings in power consumption — but that’s exactly what could happen, should there be a large hack that turned on or off a sufficient number of DC fast chargers.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t take that much to trip the power grid to overload,” Munro said. “We’ve inadvertently made a cyberweapon that others could use against us.”</p>
<h2>The &#8220;Wild West&#8221; of cybersecurity</h2>
<p>While the effects on the electric grid are unique to EV chargers, cybersecurity issues aren’t. The routine hacks reveal more endemic issues in IoT devices, where being first to market often takes precedence over sound security — and where regulators are barely able to catch up to the pace of innovation.</p>
<p>“There’s really not a lot of enforcement,” Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumer Reports, told TechCrunch in a recent interview. Data security enforcement in the United States falls within the purview of the Federal Trade Commission. But while there is a general-purpose consumer protection statute on the books, &#8220;it may well be illegal to build a system that has poor security, it’s just whether you&#8217;re going to get enforced against or not,” said Brookman.</p>
<p>A separate federal bill, the Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act, passed last September but only broadly applies to the federal government.</p>
<p>There’s only slightly more movement on the state level. In 2018, California passed a bill <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/05/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices/">banning default passwords</a> in new consumer electronics starting in 2020 — useful progress to be sure, but which largely puts the burden of data security in the hands of consumers. California, as well as states like Colorado and Virginia, also have passed laws requiring reasonable security measures for IoT devices.</p>
<p>Such laws are a good start. But (for better or worse) the FTC isn’t like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which audits consumer products before they hit the market. As of now, there’s no security check on technology devices prior to them reaching consumers. Over in the United Kingdom, “it’s the Wild West over here as well, right now,” Munro said.</p>
<p>Some startups have emerged that are trying to tackle this issue. One is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/thistle-technology-seed-security-iot/">Thistle Technologies</a>, which is trying to help IoT device manufacturers integrate mechanisms into their software to receive security updates. But it’s unlikely this problem will be fully solved on the back of private industry alone.</p>
<p>Because EV chargers could pose a unique threat to the electric grid, there’s a possibility that EV chargers could fall under the scope of a critical infrastructure bill. Last week, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/national-security-memorandum-on-improving-cybersecurity-for-critical-infrastructure-control-systems/">released a memorandum</a> calling for greater cybersecurity for systems related to critical infrastructure. “The degradation, destruction or malfunction of systems that control this infrastructure could cause significant harm to the national and economic security of the United States,” Biden said. Whether this will trickle down to consumer products is another question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve got &#8217;til it&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p>After a fittingly fleeting time in the wild, Twitter is banishing its ephemeral stories feature known as Fleets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">which debuted in November 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter began testing Fleets back in March of last year. The company thought that it might be able to lure people who were hesitant about collecting their stray thoughts into the platform&#8217;s semi-permanent format with a &#8220;lower-pressure&#8221; kind of a tweet. Many major social platforms have some form of disappearing content, so it made sense that Twitter would give things a try too — but after eight months live, Twitter is killing the feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like Instagram Stories, Fleets lived on top of the timeline, highlighted in their own dedicated space. As fleets phase out, Spaces, Twitter&#8217;s Clubhouse-like audio rooms, will occupy the same slot in the app.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">if you see a Fleet no you didn&#39;t <a href="https://t.co/4rKI7f45PL">https://t.co/4rKI7f45PL</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company hoped that Fleets would bring new users under its wing, but the only people who really adopted the new feature were apparently already Twitter diehards. Twitter said it would go back to the drawing board to figure out how to get more people participating on Twitter and Fleets were an unfortunate casualty of that realization. Some members of the product team that built Fleets shared their thoughts on Twitter in the feature&#8217;s waning hours.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">it&#39;s easy to think fleets was just a stories clone. we never aimed to compete on the best creation tools/filters/etc. we wanted to be raw and authentic. non-performative. feel lighter than tweeting. with the unique twitter network as a differentiator.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re not evolving our approach and winding down features every once in a while – we&#8217;re not taking big enough chances,&#8221; Twitter Consumer Product VP Ilya Brown said in a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>We can only hope that Twitter&#8217;s future products continue the <a href="https://www.sfweekly.com/culture/sex/butt-stuff-part-two/">gay sex naming scheme</a> that the company accidentally introduced when it named Fleets &#8220;fleets.&#8221; (Congrats, <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1422389683296690177">gay former intern</a>!)</p>
<p>To the company&#8217;s chagrin, the feature&#8217;s swift demise apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/NickPacilio/status/1422293917714849796">inspired more enthusiasm for the product</a> than Fleets had enjoyed previously. Twitter&#8217;s tweet announcing the death of Fleets also somehow turned into an iconic enough moment that the company made it into a collectible hoodie that reads &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry or you&#8217;re welcome,&#8221; ensuring that Fleets will live on in our hearts until we inevitably forget they ever existed — perhaps the most fitting tribute of all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Advanced Technology Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm with more than $1.8 billion in assets under its management, was hit by a ransomware attack in July that saw cybercriminals steal personal information on the company&#8217;s private investors, or limited partners (LPs).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21033785-advanced-technology-ventures">a letter</a> to the Maine attorney general&#8217;s office, ATV said it became aware of the attack on July 9 after its servers storing financial information had been encrypted by ransomware. By July 26, the ATV learned that data had been stolen from the servers before the files were encrypted, a common <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">&#8220;double extortion&#8221; tactic</a> used by ransomware groups, which then threaten to publish the files online if the ransom to decrypt the files is not paid.</p>
<p>The letter said ATV believes the names, email addresses, phone numbers and Social Security numbers of the individual investors in ATV&#8217;s funds were stolen in the attack. Some<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 300 individuals were affected by the incident, including one person in Maine, according to a listing on the Maine attorney general&#8217;s <a style="background-color: #ffffff; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/7e015fa7-e338-450c-a8fb-f0056d59e467.shtml?=2a8bf27469bf669a2753cacd93ca6a51ca952e56">data breach notification portal</a>.</span></p>
<p>Venture capital firms often do not disclose all of their LPs — the investors who have thrown millions into an investment vehicle — to the public. A number of pre-approved names may be included in an announcement, but overall, a company&#8217;s private investors try to stay that way: private. The reasons vary, but it comes down to secrecy and a degree of competitive advantage: The firm may not want competitors to know who is backing them, and an investor may not want others to know where their money is going. This particular attack likely stole key information on a hush-hush part of how venture money works.</p>
<p>ATV said it notified the FBI about the attack. A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately comment when reached by TechCrunch.<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> ATV&#8217;s managing director Mike Carusi did not respond to questions sent by TechCrunch on Monday.</span></p>
<p>The venture capital firm, based in Menlo Park, California with offices in Boston, was founded in 1979 and invests largely in technology, communications, software and services, and healthcare technology. The company was an early investor in many of the startups from the last decade, like software library Fandango, Host Analytics (now Planfun) and Apptegic (now Evergage). Its more recent investments include Tripwire, which was later sold to cybersecurity company Belden for $710 million; Cedexis, a network traffic monitoring startup acquired by Cisco in 2018; and Actifo, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-acquires-actifio-to-step-into-the-area-of-data-management-and-business-continuity/">sold to Google</a> in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May of this year, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-05-11/snapchat-suspends-yolo-lmk">Snap suspended two Snapchat-integrated apps</a> that allowed users to send anonymous messages, Yolo and LMK, following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/snap-cuts-off-yolo-lmk-anonymous-messaging-apps-after-lawsuit-over-teens-death/">a lawsuit</a> filed on behalf of a mother whose son died by suicide after being bullied through messages on the apps for many months. In the wake of the suspensions, another anonymous messaging app called <a href="https://getsendit.com/">Sendit</a> has been rising in the app stores&#8217; charts, as Snapchat&#8217;s younger users sought a replacement for the apps the company blocked.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Since the news of the suspensions was first <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-05-11/snapchat-suspends-yolo-lmk">reported</a> over 80 days ago, Sendit&#8217;s app has seen more than 3.5 million installs across iOS and Android, according to app intelligence firm Apptopia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This is a rapid pace of installs compared with how quickly it grew while Yolo and LMK were active on the market. </span>In the same period before the news was announced, Sendit had only seen seen 180,000 installs across <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/sendit-get-anonymous-love/id1439623630">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fullsenders.sendit&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a>, Apptopia says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2184608" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184608" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2184608 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png 1736w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=768,767 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=1536,1534 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-02-at-11.56.44-AM.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184608" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apptopia</p></div></p>
<p>Sendit also received few user reviews before May 11, 2021. But in the days that followed the suspension, &#8220;yolo&#8221; has become the second-most-used keyword in Sendit&#8217;s user reviews, Apptopia told TechCrunch. Most of these reviews are positive, saying the app is like &#8220;Yolo but better,&#8221; for instance. In other words, Snap&#8217;s suspension hasn&#8217;t stamped out demand for anonymous Snapchat Q&amp;A apps, it only crowned a new app as the market leader.</p>
<p>Sendit today is currently ranking No. 3 among Lifestyle apps on Apple&#8217;s U.S. App Store and has climbed to No. 57 on the App Store&#8217;s list of top free apps. It jumped three ranks overnight from Monday to Tuesday, in fact.</p>
<p>Like Yolo and LMK, Sendit also features a popular teen activity on Snapchat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/28/anonymous-snapchat-group-chat-yolo">anonymous Q&amp;As.</a> The app also includes other Lens games, like &#8220;Never Have I Ever,&#8221; &#8220;This or That,&#8221; &#8220;Kiss, Marry, Block&#8221; and others.</p>
<p>To be clear, none of these are official Snapchat applications. Instead, they integrate with a toolkit for third-party developers called <a href="https://kit.snapchat.com/">Snap Kit,</a> which allows them to create new product experiences that work with Snapchat&#8217;s best features, like Stories, Bitmoji, the Snapchat Camera and <a href="https://kit.snapchat.com/">more</a>.</p>
<p>Snap says its Snap Kit developers have to agree to its Terms of Service, which requires apps to prioritize user safety and take action on any reports of abuse. Those guidelines are meant to encompass any reports of bullying, harassment, hate speech or threats taking place on the third-party services. In addition, apps that offer friend finding, user-generated content and anonymous features are supposed to inform Snap of their moderation practices and customer support response times.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185118" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185118" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="615" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=300,271 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=768,695 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=680,615 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot of public App Store review of sendit; username redacted</p></div></p>
<p>In practice, however &#8212; as the lawsuit highlighted &#8212; there appears to be an issue with how well those terms are enforced on Snap&#8217;s end. The company tells us that it&#8217;s continuing to review developers to ensure their compliance. It has yet to announce any policy changes as result of that investigation, but <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-apps-that-are-dangerous-to-kids-health-20210607-z6got3ejcvd4jaj3wenkjqzxje-story.html">some</a> <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/apps-to-watch-out-for">child</a> <a href="https://www.tullahomanews.com/news/local/child-advocates-certain-apps-pose-risks/article_4ccf03dc-3a07-11e9-86f6-b3b70d5e02df.html">advocates</a> would argue that anonymous apps should have no place in a teenager&#8217;s life at all.</p>
<p>Even before the Snap lawsuit, apps like Yolo and LMK had raised concerns among child advocates and parents alike. For example, nonprofit Common Sense Media, an independent source for media recommendations and advice for families, <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/lmk-anonymous-polls">pointed out that</a> &#8220;anonymity on social media can easily lead teens down a slippery slope of poor choices.&#8221; The organization said that while teens will be drawn to the excitement of responding anonymously &#8212; perhaps learning that someone might have a crush on them &#8212; &#8220;hiding behind anonymity can also bring out hatefulness and sexually explicit risk taking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sendit&#8217;s App Store reviews (see photos) indicate that is, indeed, taking place. (Sendit didn&#8217;t respond to a request for more information about its app&#8217;s operations.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185119" style="width: 466px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185119" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2185119" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS.jpg?w=456" alt="" width="456" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS.jpg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS.jpg?resize=101,150 101w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS.jpg?resize=201,300 201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS.jpg?resize=768,1145 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS.jpg?resize=456,680 456w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS.jpg?resize=1030,1536 1030w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS.jpg?resize=34,50 34w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185119" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot of public App Store review of sendit; username redacted</p></div></p>
<p>The tech industry is littered with anonymous social apps that failed due to issues with cyberbullying. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/12/in-wake-of-teen-suicides-ask-fm-faces-a-myspace-problem/">After numerous</a> teen suicides related to Ask.fm&#8217;s anonymous platform, its owner IAC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36702766">sold off</a> the toxic property to an asset management firm. Other high-profile anonymous app failures include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/29/psst/">Secret</a>, which became a home to cyberbullying; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/after-bans-from-apple-and-google-sarahah-debuts-enoff-for-anonymous-feedback-at-work/">Sarahah,</a> which was banned by the app stores and later pivoted; Yik Yak, whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/">founders left for Square</a> after the app became plagued by cyberbullying; and After School, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/03/after-school-is-the-latest-anonymous-app-resulting-in-student-cyberbullying-and-school-threats/">which also got kicked out</a> of the App Store. To date, only anonymous platforms like Glassdoor and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/blind-raises-37m-to-double-down-on-workplace-gossip-and-career-advice/">Blind</a>, which focus on workplace chatter and career advice, have seemed to thrive.</p>
<p>The question for Snap to decide now is not just how it will enforce its terms on anonymous apps, but whether it&#8217;s worth allowing anonymous apps to operate given their documented dangers &#8212; and their potential tragic, as well as legal, consequences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Maps <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/widgets-dark-mode-3-updates-google-maps-ios/">announced today</a> three feature updates to its iOS app. With live location sharing in the iMessage app, a traffic widget for the home screen and dark mode, Google Maps is positioning itself as a stronger competitor against iOS&#8217; native Apple Maps.</p>
<p>Live location sharing was already possible in Google Maps &#8212; by tapping on the blue dot that shows where you are, you can share with select friends your ETA to your destination, and even how much battery life your phone has. But the Google Maps iMessage widget makes it easier to share your location without navigating away from your conversation. By default, Google Maps will share your location for one hour, but it&#8217;s possible to extend to up to three days &#8212; if you want to stop sharing, tap the &#8220;stop&#8221; button on the thumbnail.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185094" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185094" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185094" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185094" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google Maps</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google Maps&#8217; existing iMessage widget allows users to send GPS coordinates of their location in iMessage &#8212; but if you&#8217;re trying to meet up with friends, this wouldn&#8217;t be as useful as sharing a live location. Apple Maps already has a similar feature built into iMessage, so Google is taking a leaf out of Apple&#8217;s book to try to beat them on their own app. For a long time, Google Maps was widely considered to be the superior navigation app, but in 2018, Apple completely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/apple-is-rebuilding-maps-from-the-ground-up/">rebuilt Maps from the ground up</a>, making it more competitive. Plus, as iOS 15 rolls out, Apple Maps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-upgrade-brings-more-detailed-maps-transit-features-ar-view-and-more/">will add</a> AR functionality, better public transit features, more detailed maps and other improvements.</p>
<p>Google Maps added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/google-maps-adds-more-waze-like-features-including-driving-incident-reports/">Waze-like traffic and incident report features</a> to its app in 2019, which made it more appealing for driving commuters &#8212; the app says that one of its &#8220;most powerful features is the ability to see live traffic conditions in an area.&#8221; Now, users with the latest Google Maps app will be able to add a traffic widget to their home screen, which can quickly share what traffic is like in their area. The widget also allows users to set frequent destinations, like home, work or the gas station, and navigate to those places with just a tap. Though the app already has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/android-q-scores-a-system-wide-dark-theme/">dark mode</a> on Android, this feature will also roll out to iOS users in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>As Google Maps and Apple Maps compete to become the best navigation app, an unlikely competitor comes in Snapchat, which has created a more social experience on its Snap Map. Last week, Snapchat added the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/snapchat-adds-my-places-feature-to-snap-map-connecting-users-to-businesses/">My Places</a> feature to the Snap Map, which helps users find new spots to visit based on the activity of other users in their area. The ephemeral messaging app also announced at the end of July that during Q2 of 2021, the platform grew both revenue and daily active users at the highest rates it has achieved in the last four years. Still, as of last year, Google Maps had <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/maps-15th-birthday/">over 1 billion worldwide</a> users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, movie ticketing and discovery business Fandango, a <a href="https://together.nbcuni.com/n/fandango/">division</a> of NBCUniversal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/walmart-is-selling-its-on-demand-video-service-vudu-to-fandango/">bought the on-demand video streaming service Vudu</a> from Walmart, after the retailer had failed to capitalize on the service it had first acquired in 2010 for $100 million. Today, Fandango is taking the next steps with Vudu by merging the service with its existing streaming platform, FandangoNOW. The newly combined service will continue to use the name Vudu and will feature over 200,000 new release and catalog movies and TV shows to rent or buy without a subscription, as well as &#8220;thousands&#8221; of free-to-stream titles.</p>
<p>The company tells us it chose to stick with &#8220;Vudu&#8221; as its name because it&#8217;s already a popular brand with a loyal following and is significantly larger than the FandangoNOW service.</p>
<p>Despite the changes coming to the service, existing FandangoNOW customers won&#8217;t lose access to any of the content they already purchased. Both their movies and TV series will be automatically transferred over to the new Vudu service starting today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, Vudu&#8217;s on-demand library competes with Apple iTunes, Amazon Prime Video and Google Play/YouTube, as well as similar services from various telecos. In particular, these types of services appeal to those who want to watch new releases and have the option to own favorite movies and shows &#8212; rather than subscribe to services where such content comes and goes as licensing deals expire.</p>
<p>At launch, the newly merged Vudu will include new releases like “F9: The Fast Saga,” Pixar’s “Luca,” “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,” “Peter Rabbit 2,” “The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard,” “A Quiet Place Part II,” Disney’s “Cruella,” “Godzilla vs. Kong,” “In the Heights” and others. Next Tuesday, it will also gain access to Marvel Studios’ “Black Widow&#8221; &#8212; the title that&#8217;s now the subject of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/scarlett-johansson-files-suit-over-disney-black-widow-release/">a breach of contract lawsuit</a> filed on behalf of actress Scarlett Johansson, who&#8217;s suing Disney for sending what was supposed to be a theatrical release directly to its streaming service Disney+ on opening day.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185033" style="width: 388px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185033" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185033" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/vudu.jpg?w=378" alt="" width="378" height="254" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/vudu.jpg 378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/vudu.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/vudu.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/vudu.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185033" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fandango</p></div></p>
<p>Many titles are available in 4K Ultra HD and support formats such as Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, the company notes.</p>
<p>Vudu already has a large, built-in audience for its movie and TV marketplace. Fandango claims the service has over 60 million registered users and reaches &#8220;millions&#8221; on a daily basis.</p>
<p>By way of its expansive platform support, it&#8217;s capable of reaching over 75 million U.S. TV-connected device households, per NPD Group data. This includes Vudu&#8217;s support for Samsung, LG and Vizio smart TVs; the Roku platform, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Xfinity X1 and Xfinity Flex, PlayStation, Xbox, Tivo and others.</p>
<p>Following the merger and rebranding, the new Vudu service will also take FandangoNOW&#8217;s place as the <a href="https://support.roku.com/article/208756538">official movie store</a> on the Roku platform, where consumers can rent or purchase using Roku Pay.</p>
<p>Vudu joins Fandango&#8217;s existing digital network, which will continue to include Fandango&#8217;s movie ticketing business, MovieTickets.com, Flixster, Movieclips and Rotten Tomatoes. While the merger of the two services at least clears up some overlap within the Fandango division, NBCU parent company Comcast continues to have its own overlap issues when it comes to streaming. Comcast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/comcast-acquires-xumo/">acquired ad-supported streaming service Xumo</a> in February 2020 and, via NBCU, runs the year-old <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/nbcuniversals-streaming-service-peacock-officially-launches-tomorrow/">streaming service Peacock.</a> As of yet, it hasn&#8217;t made any moves to centralize those efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic wreaking havoc amongst early years education amid school lockdowns, it’s no wonder edtech startups have piled into the space. But it has also served to highlight the abysmal nature of early years teaching: Some 40 million teachers across the globe are <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/teachers#:~:text=There%20are%20close%20to%2085,and%2012.5%20in%20tertiary%20education.">leaving</a> the sector, according to the World Bank. Of the 1.5 billion primary-age children, only a few can access high-quality education, and approximately 58 million primary-age children are out of education, <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/in-focus-articles/unesco-no-progress-in-reducing-global-number-of-children-out-of-school/#:~:text=A%20new%20UNESCO%20policy%20paper,little%20overall%20improvement%20since%202007.&amp;text=Most%20of%20these%20children%20will,at%20risk%20of%20dropping%20out.">most of whom are girls</a>.</p>
<p>So the opportunity to make a difference, using online teaching, in these very young years, is great, because classes sizes can be reduced online, and the quality of teaching improved.</p>
<p>This is the idea behind <a href="https://www.thebinaschool.com/">bina</a>, which bills itself as a “digital primary education ecosystem”. It has now raised $1.4 million to aim at the education of 4- to 12-year-olds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding round was led by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/taizo-son/?sh=2fe2f5961c9b">Taizo Son</a>, one of Japan’s billionaires. Other investors and advisors include Jutta Steiner, founder at Parity Technologies, the company behind Polkadot decentralized protocol, and Lord Jim Knight, ex-Minister of Education (U.K.).</p>
<p>Bina’s &#8220;schtick&#8221; is that it has very small online class sizes of six students (3x smaller than the <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=EDU_CLASS#">OECD average</a>).</p>
<p>It also boasts of “adaptive learning paths” that cover international standards; teachers with a minimum of eight years of digital teaching experience; and data-driven decision making for its pedagogical approach.</p>
<p>Noam Gerstein, bina&#8217;s CEO and founder said: “I’ve interviewed students, teachers and parents globally for years, and it is clear a new systemic design is needed. With our founding families, we are building a world in which every child has access to quality education, educators&#8217; skills are valued and continuously developed, and parents don&#8217;t need to choose between their work and family life.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says it also grants pupils company shares (RSUs) as they grow with the school. Currently available to English-speaking students in the CET time zone, the bina School is planning a SaaS product for governments, NGOs and school systems.</p>
<p>“We right now compete against companies like Outschool, Pearson&#8217;s online Academy, Primer and Prisma,” he told me over a call. “So these are the big names of the last year for the first phase. But the strategy is that we&#8217;re building it in two phases. The first phase is actually building a school that we operate as a &#8216;lab&#8217; school. And the second phase is what we call &#8216;bina as a service&#8217;. So it&#8217;s a SaaS &#8216;school as a service&#8217;. The idea is that we offer collaboration with NGOs and governments, doing accreditation and training and licencing of the product. So for that second part we&#8217;re actually competing against the big accreditation system.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startup Alley is the place to be at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23. The sold-out expo area is the virtual home to hundreds of innovative startups ready to demo their tech and talent. While exhibiting offers plenty of opportunity for all, a VIP experience kicked off in July for 50 startup exhibitors the TechCrunch staff chose to form the first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley+ cohort</a>.</p>
<p>Part of that experience includes a series of master classes in the run-up to Disrupt. Case in point, on August 24,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/dan-olsen-leads-a-product-market-fit-masterclass-for-the-startup-alley-cohort/"> Dan Olsen</a> will lead a master class called “How to Create Product-Market Fit.” Now, we’re ready to share the next presentation, and it’s another great one, folks.</p>
<p>On August 17th, John Lynn, co-founder of <a href="https://celainnovation.com/">CELA Innovation</a>, and Jade Kearney, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Lean Startup expert and co-founder and CEO of She Matters, </span>will present a master class called, “The Key Principles of the Lean Startup Methodology.”</p>
<p><strong>A quick tangent:</strong> If you’re not already familiar with <a href="https://celainnovation.com/">CELA</a> or what it does, the NYC-based company matches early-stage startups to world-class accelerators and incubators that align with a startup’s vertical and business goals. Last year, at Disrupt 2020, CELA connected the winners of our Pitchers and Pitches mini pitch-off competitions with an accelerator to boost their business.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, back at the master class:</strong> Change — positive or negative — is inevitable, and this master class will focus on what founders can do when change arrives on their doorstep. Examples of change can include receiving funding, running out of funding, losing a co-founder or a key customer or anything else that&#8217;s shaking up their situation.</p>
<p>John and Jade will help each cohort founder produce a Lean Startup transformation for one current business situation. Founders can then use it as a template for optimizing anything in their business the next time change comes calling.</p>
<p>The session begins by examining why you should use the Lean Startup methodology at inflection points — when there is a sudden change to your company, good or bad.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll learn how you can use the Lean Startup methodology to create resources when you are overwhelmed by opportunity or just feel like you have gone as far as you can go with what you have.</p>
<p>Next, John and Jade will show how this methodology makes the difference between knowing what you want to build and learning what you need know about your customers, industry or product.</p>
<p>Lastly, Team CELA will isolate some of your key business activities as they exist right now. Then they will walk you through a process to turn that activity into a Lean Startup experiment that produces insights, new value and new opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nikola, the electric truck startup that went public via a SPAC merger, warned Tuesday that supply chain constraints are causing numerous delays forcing it to slash its vehicle delivery projections in half.</p>
<p>The company, which is still in pre-production, said in its second-quarter earnings call that its plans to <a href="https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation_file/27/Q1_2021_Nikola_Earnings_Call_Presentation.pdf">produce 50 to 100 electric semi trucks</a> in this year have been lowered to 25 to 50 units. The less than rosy projections continued on the revenue front.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.webcast-eqs.com/nikola20210803/en">cut its revenue forecast</a> for the year to $0 to $7.5 million. It was previously $15 million to $30 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nikola reported a net loss of $143 million in the second quarter, up from a $115.7 million loss in the same period last year. Its adjusted loss was 20 cents per share, which is actually better than analysts expected. The company&#8217;s cash balance at the end of the quarter was $632.6 million.</p>
<p>While the company focused its earnings call on its progress toward producing electric trucks — which included testing pre-production vehicles and completing 0.5 Phase of its factory in Arizona — the market was more interested in its lowered outlook and the lingering effects from its founder Trevor Milton being charged with securities fraud. Among the company&#8217;s updates is that it has built 14 pre-production vehicles, five alpha and nine beta prototypes.</p>
<p>Shares of Nikola were down 7.47% in midday trading.</p>
<p>Milton, who resigned last year as Nikola&#8217;s CEO and executive chairman, was charged July 29 with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-indicted-on-three-counts-of-fraud/">two counts of securities fraud</a> and wire fraud by a federal grand jury. Prosecutors detailed in the complaint how Milton used social media and frequent appearances on television in a PR blitz that flooded &#8220;the market with false and misleading information about Nikola&#8221; before the company even produced a product.</p>
<p>In March 2020, the company announced it would go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company VectoIQ Acquisition Corp. Milton frequently posted on Twitter, directing his messages to retail investors after the company went public that summer. Then, in September, just days after GM had announced a $2 billion investment in the company, noted short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Nikola of fraud. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/sec-to-investigate-short-sellers-claims-against-nikola-report-says/">opened an inquiry</a> in the matter and within two weeks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/nikolas-chairman-steps-down-stock-crashes-following-allegations-of-fraud/">Milton had stepped down</a> as executive chairman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inspiration4 is getting its own documentary. Netflix said Tuesday it would be releasing a five-part series on the mission, its first documentary to cover an event “in near real-time,” in five parts in September.</p>
<p>&#8220;Countdown: Inspiration4 Mission to Space&#8221; will follow the first all-civilian Inspiration4 crew as they prepare for and undergo a three-day flight to low Earth orbit. The private flight is being funded by &#8212; surprise! &#8212; a billionaire: Jared Isaacman, the CEO and founder of payment processor Shift4 Payments. He will be joined by Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital and a pediatric bone cancer survivor; Christopher Sembroski, a Lockheed Martin engineer and Air Force veteran; and professor of geoscience Sian Proctor.</p>
<p>Isaacman has committed to donating $100 million to St. Jude’s out of his own funds, in addition to the public donation drive that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission/">used to select</a> Sian Proctor’s seat. As of March, the donation drive raised an additional $13 million for the children’s hospital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The crew will travel to orbit in a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft and a Falcon 9 rocket. The launch giant is customizing the Dragon especially for the mission, replacing a docking mechanism with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spacex-is-outfitting-it-dragon-spacecraft-with-an-observation-down-for-space-tourists/">transparent glass dome</a> out of which crewmembers will be able to take in what will likely be some pretty spectacular views. The dome will only be large enough to fit one passenger at a time, and it’ll only open once the spacecraft has safely exited Earth’s atmosphere. (Stellar views are a relatively recent concern for launch developers and space passengers, mostly an effect of the burgeoning space tourism industry.)</p>
<p>The Netflix series will likely be the cherry on top of the massive media event that will be Inspiration4. The Netflix series will be directed by Jason Hehir, who previously headed &#8220;The Last Dance,&#8221; an ESPN documentary miniseries about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Draper Esprit’s model enables it to deploy them right back into new investments, ensuring more of Europe’s best startups can raise funding."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">British venture capital firm Draper Esprit recently <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/draper-esprit-floats-to-become-largest-tech-vc-on-londons-main-market/ar-AAMsV6K">moved its listing</a> from the AIM to the main board in London, the LSE. The investing group also moved its secondary listing from Dublin’s Euronext Growth Market to its larger sister exchange, Euronext Dublin, which makes sense given its long connection to Irish capital.</p>
<p>Draper has always felt like something of an anomaly from our perspective, a generalist venture capital firm that was itself public. But this July, Forward Partners <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/discover/news-and-insights/london-stock-exchange-welcomes-forward-partners-aim">listed its shares on the AIM</a>, and there are other venture firms in Europe that are also listed.</p>
<p>At first blush, the setup may seem odd; venture capital firms invest in companies that they hope to see go public one day &#8212; why would they float themselves? But Draper Esprit co-founder Stuart Chapman told TechCrunch in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/why-draper-esprit-doubled-down-on-its-status-as-a-publicly-listed-vc/">an interview</a> that he finds it shocking “that venture capital backs some of the most mind-blowing tech advances in our history over the last 70 years, using the same legal structure as a 1958 property vehicle in New York.” It’s a reasonable point.</p>
<p>Perhaps fundraising success is part of why the venture model has not seen much disruption in recent decades, apart from rising fund sizes. But the model is not perfect. It can foist artificial time constraints on investors and force them to focus their deal flow into particular stages for fund-construction reasons. As we found out researching this piece, the public venture model highlights some of these limitations &#8212; and may be able to alleviate them in part.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>And yet we can’t come up with a single U.S. venture capital firm, for example, that has publicly listed in the same manner as Draper Esprit or Forward Partners.</p>
<p>To better understand why we’re seeing European VCs float, and not their peers in other markets, The Exchange reached out to Draper Esprit, Forward Partners, and fellow listed venture investors Mercia and <a href="https://augmentum.vc/">Augmentum Fintech</a>. From the group, we’ve learned that there are plenty of reasons why the model may be popular in the U.K. and not in the U.S.</p>
<p>But there are also reasons why being a public venture capitalist can make the VC game a rather different, longer-term effort. The firms in question did not go public on a whim.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about the good, the bad, and the regulatory concerning publicly listed venture capital firms. The future? Or just a regional quirk?</p>
<h2>From exception to trend?</h2>
<p>Following its move, Draper Esprit is now the largest &#8220;purely tech VC&#8221; listed on London’s Main Market. Its initial listing had also been a market milestone: &#8220;Listing Draper Esprit five years ago was a radical and unusual step for a venture capital business,&#8221; Chapman said of Draper&#8217;s 2016 dual-listing on London&#8217;s AIM and Dublin&#8217;s Enterprise Securities Market (ESM) — now Euronext Growth.</p>

<p>Just last month, two tech-related investment funds IPO&#8217;d on the London Stock Exchange: <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/07/15/seraphim-space-investment-trust-raises-180m-in-oversubscribed-ipo/">space-focused Seraphim Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/discover/news-and-insights/london-stock-exchange-welcomes-forward-partners-aim">Nic Brisbourne&#8217;s Forward Partners</a>. In both cases, Draper Esprit was happy to assist with information, Chapman told us, adding that the firm also invested in Forward via its fund-of-funds effort.</p>
<p>The news adds up to a roster of listed investors that also includes fintech fund Augmentum Fintech, asset manager <a href="https://www.mercia.co.uk/">Mercia Asset Management PLC</a> and intellectual property commercialization company IP Group. &#8220;We&#8217;re supportive of others following in our footsteps and we will be big fans of having much wider diversity,&#8221; Chapman told TechCrunch in an interview, which you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/why-draper-esprit-doubled-down-on-its-status-as-a-publicly-listed-vc/">read in full here</a>.</p>
<p>Having recently joined the club, Forward Partners’ founder and CEO Nic Brisbourne gave us a good overview of the three high-level reasons that could lead a fund to list: open opportunities to create more value from new initiatives that sit outside traditional investment capital; breaking the cycle of fundraising; and opening access to the early-stage venture capital asset class. Let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics, a San Jose-based company developing a pill to replace medical injections, went public on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-223596/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> S-1 filings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shares were estimated to price between $14 and $16 last week. On Friday, shares debuted slightly lower, around $11. Rani raised about $73 million in its debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani’s debut comes amidst a flurry of IPO activity in therapeutics. In 2020, </span><a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biotech-ipo-performance-tracker/587604/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">71 biotech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies went public. Already in 2021, 59 companies have IPO&#8217;ed, and even more are on the way. On July 30 alone, </span><a href="https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/ipo-calendar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eight biotech companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were expected to begin trading, including Rani Therapeutics. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics, is, as founder Mir Imran puts it, “laser focused” on itself, rather than the IPO activity around it. The decision to go public was partially bolstered by the results of a phase I study &#8212; early evidence that the RaniPill, the company’s flagship product, could be brought into the clinic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are already in humans, and clearly on a strong path to make oral biologics [a] reality. This is a hot and unique market for life science direction and we’re excited to be driving innovation in this area,” Imran tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics&#8217; flagship product is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-rani-therapeutics-robotic-pill-could-change-subcutaneous-injection-treament/">RaniPill, essentially, a capsule designed to deliver medicines that would usually be delivered via injections</a>. TechCrunch covered the pill in more detail </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-rani-therapeutics-robotic-pill-could-change-subcutaneous-injection-treament/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it works according to a few basic steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pill is covered by a coating resistant to stomach acid. Once the pill enters the small intestine, the coating dissolves, allowing for a small balloon to inflate. Once that small balloon inflates, medication is delivered by a microneedle (which dissolves after the drug is administered). Then, the rest of the balloon is “excreted through normal digestive processes,” per the company’s S-1 filing. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Rani Therapeutics&#8217; robotic pill could change subcutaneous injection treatment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-rani-therapeutics-robotic-pill-could-change-subcutaneous-injection-treament/embed/#?secret=EAHlUN9VuU" data-secret="EAHlUN9VuU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This whole process occurs in a pill that, on the outside, looks like a gel capsule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is evidence for some conditions suggesting patients prefer oral drugs to injections: for example, studies on cancer patients </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003561/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have illuminated patient preference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for oral therapies rather than regular injections. That&#8217;s not the case for every condition. Some patients show preference to long-acting medicines delivered via injection rather than having to take lots of pills (this is the case for some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00721-w">HIV patients)</a>. </span></p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s fair to say that needles aren&#8217;t exactly pleasant. <span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jan.13818"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 review and meta analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 35 studies found that between 20% and 30% of young adults are afraid of needles, a fear that can lead some people to avoid medical treatments or vaccines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics has been developing capsules for drugs that have already been approved by the FDA, but are often administered via regular injections. They include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octreotide for acromegaly or neuroendocrine tumors in the GI tract (NETs) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TNF-alpha inhibitors for psoriatic arthritis </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) for osteoporosis </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human growth hormone (HGH) for HGH deficiency </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parathyroid hormone for hypothyroidism </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product furthest along in the research cycle is the pill developed to administer octreotide (called RT-101), which was tested in a phase</span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03798912"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I clinical trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 62 participants. The trial results, partially reported in the S-1 filing, showed 65% bioavailability of the octreotide drug, compared to an injection. That suggests that the pills can get the drugs into the body efficiently, though these results are early. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next year, the company plans to initiate two additional Phase I studies on PTH for osteoporosis, and human growth hormone. Studies on the rest of the drugs in the pipeline are scheduled for 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the company’s goal is to validate the RaniPill independently of specific drugs. The company is pursuing an </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/investigational-device-exemption-ide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigational Device Exemption</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IDE), which would allow the company to test RaniPill in a clinical study without a drug involved. This study aims to establish how safe the product is for repeated dosing, and is slated to begin next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we want to continue to generate data with drugs, because we will be making drugs. But nonetheless, it’s important to establish what the platform’s safety and tolerability is,” said Imran. So that’s quite important as well.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s leadership does have a track record of successful exits in the biotech space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics was founded in 2012 by Mir Imran, who has already overseen several exits and acquisitions of medical device companies. In 1985, Imran developed an implantable cardiac defibrillator as part of his first company, Intec Systems, which was later acquired by Eli Lilly. Since, he has started 20 medical device companies, of which 15 have either IPOed or been acquired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for now, Rani Therapeutics financials report significant losses. Net losses for 2019 and 2020 totaled $26.6 million and $16.7 million, respectively. As of March 2021, the company was running a deficit of $119.6 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the company has raised about $211.5 million in funding since inception, without counting cash generated from today’s IPO. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics has plans to use the $73 million raised during the IPO to fund the IDE study and pursue additional clinical trials. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube earlier this year announced its plans to significantly invest in original creator content for its TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, with the introduction of a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/"> $100 million YouTube Shorts Fund</a>. The fund will reward creators for their most engaging and most viewed short-form videos over the course of 2021 to 2022, with the goal of quickly scaling creator activity on YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/youtube-expands-tiktok-rival-shorts-to-the-uk-canada-latin-america-lets-users-tap-all-of-youtube-for-tunes/">new short-form video platform</a>, Shorts, to better rival TikTok. Today, YouTube announced the fund is officially launching and creators will begin to receive their first payouts in August.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184972" style="width: 321px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184972" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2184972" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?w=680" alt="" width="311" height="311" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png 1215w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184972" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>Every month, YouTube will invite thousands of eligible creators to claim a payment from the fund. These payouts may range anywhere from $100 to $10,000, based on viewership and engagement with their Shorts videos. Reached for comment, YouTube declined to share the exact viewership thresholds creators will have to reach to earn the payouts, saying that those numbers may change from month to month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company told TechCrunch it will determine how it calculates the thresholds by analyzing the best-performing channels and then calculating their bonus based on a number of factors, which includes views, where their audience is located and more. The company also said it wanted to make sure it was rewarding as many creators as possible, which is why it set a minimum payment of $100.</p>
<p>To qualify, creators must produce original content &#8212; not videos that were re-uploaded from other channels or those with watermarks from other social services. That was a problem that Instagram&#8217;s TikTok competitor Reels has faced &#8212; creators often re-used the same content they&#8217;re sharing on TikTok when they publish to Reels. To fight the problem, Instagram even had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-repost-tiktoks-best-practices-200536658.html">adjust its algorithm to downrank the recycled content. </a></p>
<p>While there are plenty of tools that allow creators to strip the watermark from a video, as well as those that let you edit videos for upload to multiple short-form video platforms, YouTube says it will be using a combination of automation and human reviewers to ensure creators meet its guidelines around original content.</p>
<p>Creators will also need to be 13 or older in the U.S., or the age of majority in other countries and regions, to quality. Those ages 13 to 18 will also need to have a parent or guardian set up their AdSense account, link it to the creator&#8217;s channel and accept the terms, as this is where payments will be directed. All of a creator&#8217;s Shorts videos will count toward their bonuses each month they receive views &#8212; not just the month they were uploaded, YouTube notes.</p>

<p>The channels also need to have uploaded at least one eligible Short in the last 180 days and must follow YouTube’s Community Guidelines, copyright rules and monetization policies. While YouTube Partner Program members can participate in the fund, creators don&#8217;t have to already be monetizing on YouTube to quality for the new Shorts bonuses.</p>
<p>At launch, the fund will support creators in the U.S., Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Over time, it will expand to more markets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184973" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184973" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2184973" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184973" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>The company also told us it&#8217;s not looking for any specific types of video to reward, as the fund gets off the ground. Instead, it&#8217;s only looking at the metrics, like the total monthly performance a channel’s Shorts received.</p>
<p>On the one hand, not specifying any video categories or subject matter to lean into gives creators a lot of freedom to experiment when producing Shorts. But on the other, it could also lead creators to simply make more TikTok-like content, but publish it to YouTube instead in hopes of cashing in. That could result in YouTube Shorts feeling a lot like the TikTok clone that it is, rather than allowing it to differentiate itself by the nature of its content.</p>
<p>For comparison, other TikTok rivals, like Pinterest&#8217;s Idea Pins or Snapchat&#8217;s Spotlight aim to leverage what makes their platform unique and deliver that as short-form, public videos. Pinterest&#8217;s Idea Pins are often focused on tutorials or recipe-making, which are popular searches on its service. Spotlight, meanwhile, can feature Snaps &#8212; including those from private accounts, not professionals. That makes some Spotlight videos feel less polished and produced, compared with TikTok or Reels, which fits in with its more casual aesthetic.</p>
<p>YouTube says it will begin reaching out to creators starting next week to let them know if they&#8217;ve qualified for a bonus. The company will send a notification in the YouTube app, which includes the amount of the bonus and details on how to claim it. Creators will then have until the 25th of the month to claim the bonus payment before it expires.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184975" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184975" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2184975" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?w=680" alt="" width="374" height="374" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-monetize.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184975" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">growth</a> and popularity has encouraged a number of social platforms to invest directly in the creator community in hopes of winning back some of their audience. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">Facebook recently announced</a> its own $1 billion-plus bonus system for videos across both Facebook and Instagram through the end of 2022, including but not limited to Reels videos. Snap initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">said it would distribute</a> $1 million per day through the end of 2020 for top Snaps on Spotlight, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/media/snapchat-spotlight/index.html">but later dialed that back</a>. Pinterest announced a much smaller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/">($500,000) creator fund</a> that runs through 2021.</p>
<p>And to counteract all the challenges, TikTok last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">introduced a $200 million fund</a> for U.S. creators.</p>
<p>With the official launch of the Shorts Fund, YouTube notes it now has 10 ways creators can make money on its platform, including ads, YouTube Premium subscription revenue shares, channel memberships, Super Chat, Super Thanks, Super Stickers, merchandise, ticketing and YouTube BrandConnect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Substack <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/sit-right-down-and-write-yourself-a-letter">announced</a> last week that it acquired Letter, a platform that encourages written dialogue and debate. The financials of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed, but this acquisition follows Substack&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/substack-confirms-65m-raise-promises-to-rapidly-expand-its-financial-backing-of-newly-independent-writers/">$65 million raise</a>.</p>
<p>Newsletters are all the rage &#8212; Facebook launched its exclusive, celeb-studded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin</a> platform last month, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitters-acquisition-strategy-eat-the-public-conversation/">Twitter acquired</a> the newsletter startup Revue earlier this year. Letter doesn&#8217;t publish email newsletters like Substack, but rather, it allows writers to engage in epistolary exchanges about fraught topics like <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/968">Brexit</a>, <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/789">dating </a>and the <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/956">2020 U.S. Presidential election</a>. The idea behind Letter makes sense. Complicated conversations require nuance, yet these online debates too often happen on platforms like Twitter, where short-form tweets make it harder to have nuanced conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could see that Letter, like Substack, was working in opposition to the ad-driven attention economy, attempting to change the rules of engagement for online discourse,&#8221; Substack wrote in its acquisition announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But this acquisition may be cause for concern among those already troubled by the controversy Substack faced earlier this year, when <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers">news came out</a> that the platform offered some writers up to six-figure advances as part of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html">Substack Pro program.</a> The problem wasn&#8217;t that Substack was incentivizing writers to join the platform, but rather, who Substack had hand-picked to pay an advance. Plus, Substack says that it&#8217;s up to the writer to <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers">disclose</a> whether they&#8217;re part of Substack Pro, which creates a lack of editorial transparency.</p>
<p>As Substack grew, writers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">left jobs</a> at BuzzFeed and the New York Times, lured by pay raises and cautious optimism. But as more writers came forward as part of the Substack Pro program, Substack was criticized for <a href="https://doyles.substack.com/p/in-queers-we-trust-all-others-pay">subsidizing</a> anti-trans rhetoric, since some of these writers used their newsletters to share such views. Substack admits it&#8217;s <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation">not entirely apolitical</a>, but the choices of which writers to subsidize, and its decision to use only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/substack-explains-its-hands-off-approach-to-content-moderation/">lightweight moderation tactics</a>, are a strong political choice in an era of the internet when content moderation has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">tangible effect</a> on global politics. Some writers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">even chose</a> to leave the platform.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Substack faces backlash over the writers it supports with big advances&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/embed/#?secret=OMM0Onzvsh" data-secret="OMM0Onzvsh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Annalee Newitz, a nonbinary writer who since left the platform, <a href="https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so">wrote on Substack</a>, &#8220;Their leadership are deciding what kinds of writing and writers are worthy of financial compensation. [ … ] Substack is taking an editorial stance, paying writers who fit that stance, and <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers">refusing to be transparent</a> about who those people are.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, when Substack described its new acquisition<a href="https://on.substack.com/p/sit-right-down-and-write-yourself-a-letter"> Letter</a> as a platform that encourages people to &#8220;argue in good faith instead of dropping bombs for retweets,&#8221; it made the acquisition worthy of a deeper examination. Statements like this sound agreeable, yet this kind of language often appears in arguments that deem social justice a threat to free speech. But free speech shouldn&#8217;t mean <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/you-cant-censor-away-extremism-or">endorsing hate speech</a>.</p>
<p>Substack wants to position itself as a neutral platform, and for many writers, it&#8217;s a valuable way to make money, especially in an unstable journalism industry. But given that some users have already become skeptical of who Substack chooses to financially incentivize, it&#8217;s worth examining the implications of buying Letter, a platform that includes writers associated with the so-called <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/10/17338290/intellectual-dark-web-rogan-peterson-harris-times-weiss">intellectual dark web</a> in its group of twenty &#8220;<a href="https://letter.wiki/members">featured writers</a>.&#8221; On Letter, some of these writers question the <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/893" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://letter.wiki/conversation/893&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627744096461000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRSn278lAxFPQQsNtJicj7vWmROw">validity of childhood transgender identity</a> and refer to the statement &#8220;trans women are women&#8221; as <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/1082" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://letter.wiki/conversation/1082&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627744096461000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg4z74k3wV3d-On5MFzQ06kWdwFQ">propaganda</a>, for example. Substack has already <a href="https://gen.medium.com/substack-is-not-a-neutral-platform-8fc5bdf8e5f2">lost the trust</a> of some trans and gender-nonconforming writers, and the content on its newly acquired Letter won&#8217;t help rebuild that trust.</p>
<p>In addition, Letter co-founder Clyde Rathbone <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/825">wrote in support</a> of a controversial <a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/">letter published in Harper&#8217;s Magazine</a>, which called for the &#8220;concerted repudiation of cancel culture.&#8221; But critics of the letter point out that free speech isn&#8217;t really at stake here.</p>
<p>The open letter had been<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> signed by over 150 prominent writers </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8212; like Gloria Steinem, Noam Chomsky (a Letter author) and Malcolm Gladwell (a Bulletin author). It argued:</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;We need to preserve the possibility of good-faith disagreement without dire professional consequences.&#8221; These &#8220;professional consequences&#8221; echoed the predicament that J.K. Rowling &#8212; who also signed the letter &#8212; <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/j-k-rowling-faces-backlash-after-tweeting-support-transphobic-researcher-n1104971">had put herself in.</a> After denying that trans women are women, her reputation suffered. Some might call that &#8220;cancel culture,&#8221; but others might call it the refusal to continue to platform people who perpetuate harmful beliefs.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The panic over &#8216;cancel culture&#8217; is, at its core, a reactionary backlash,&#8221; <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cancel-culture-harpers-jk-rowling-scam_n_5f0887b4c5b67a80bc06c95e">wrote</a> journalist Michael Hobbes. &#8220;Conservative elites, threatened by changing social norms and an accelerating generational handover, are attempting to amplify their feelings of aggrievement into a national crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Substack says it plans to use the acquisition of Letter to help writers collaborate, and that it won&#8217;t integrate Letter into its platform. Rather, the Letter team will relocate from Australia to San Francisco to &#8220;bring their expertise to help build more of the infrastructure and support.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Substack if the anti-trans content on Letter is cause for concern within the company, given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">recent backlash</a> against the platform.</p>
<div dir="auto">
<p>&#8220;We think that open debate and disagreement are absolutely part of having free press, and that includes views that you or I may not like,&#8221; a representative from Substack said. &#8220;Anyone could browse Substack and find things they agree with and things they don’t agree with. Substack has no ad-driven feeds pushing content based on virality and outrage, and there is a direct relationship between writers and readers who can opt out of that anytime. So the bar for us to intervene in that relationship and tell writers what they should be saying is really high, and the fact that Letter allowed writers to openly debate and discuss is consistent with that philosophy.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div dir="auto">We don&#8217;t know yet how or if Letter will change Substack &#8212; but given the existing discourse around the kind of content Substack pays for, Substack isn&#8217;t demonstrating &#8220;good faith&#8221; with this acquisition.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thoma Bravo-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sophos/">Sophos</a> has announced its second takeover in as many weeks with the acquisition of Seattle-based DevSecOps startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/refactr-inc">Refactr.</a></p>
<p>Refactr was founded in 2017 and offers an automation platform that helps cybersecurity and DevOps teams to collaboratively operate. The platform, which is used by the nonprofit Center for Internet Security and the U.S. Air Force’s Platform One, features a drag-and-drop low-code pipeline builder and DevOps-friendly features that encourage disparate teams to collaborate on the same agile workflow process, according to the company.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to enable DevSecOps to become the modern approach to automation, where cybersecurity use cases like Security Operation, Automation and Response (SOAR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR), compliance, cloud security, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/identity-access-management/">Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) become building blocks for DevSecOps solutions,” said Michael Fraser, CEO and co-founder of Refactr.</p>
<p>The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, will see Refactr’s entire team of developers and engineers join Sophos. While Sophos says it will continue to develop and offer Refactr’s DevSecOps automation platform to existing customers, it will also embed its SOAR capabilities to its own managed threat response (MTR) and XDR solutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;With Refactr, Sophos will fast track the integration of such advanced SOAR capabilities into our adaptive cybersecurity ecosystem, the basis for our XDR product and MTR service,” said Joe Levy, chief technology officer at Sophos.</p>
<p>Sophos’ acquisition of Refactr lands shortly after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/sophos-acquires-braintrace-to-supercharge-its-threat-detection-capabilities/">announced plans to buy Braintrace</a>, a cybersecurity startup that provides organizations visibility into suspicious network traffic patterns. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/thoma-bravo-completes-3-9b-sophos-acquisition/">Thoma Bravo completed its $3.9 billion takeover of Sophos in 2020</a> as the company continues to increase its reach in the cybersecurity space.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marvell.com/">Marvell</a> announced this morning it has reached an agreement to acquire <a href="https://www.innovium.com/">Innovium</a> for $1.1 billion in an all-stock deal. The startup, which raised over $400 million according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/innovium-inc">Crunchbase data</a>, makes networking ethernet switches optimized for the cloud.</p>
<p>Marvell president and CEO Matt Murphy sees Innovium as a complementary piece to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/more-chip-industry-action-as-marvell-is-acquiring-inphi-for-10b/">the $10 billion Inphi acquisition</a> last year, giving the company, which makes copper-based chips, more ways to work across modern cloud data centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Innovium has established itself as a strong cloud data center merchant switch silicon provider with a proven platform, and we look forward to working with their talented team who have a strong track record in the industry for delivering multiple generations of highly successful products,&#8221; Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Innovium founder and CEO Rajiv Khemani, who will remain as an advisor post-close, told a familiar tale from a startup CEO being acquired, seeing the sale as a way to accelerate more quickly as part of a larger organization than it could on its own. &#8220;As we engaged with Marvell, it became clear that our data center optimized portfolio combined with Marvell’s scale, leading technology platform and complementary portfolio, can accelerate our growth and vision of delivering breakthrough switch silicon for the cloud and edge,&#8221; he wrote <a href="https://www.innovium.com/blog-post/marvell-to-acquire-innovium-for-1-1-billion-on-to-next-phase-of-growth/">in a company blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cwxxQpUZk7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/">2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/embed/#?secret=cwxxQpUZk7" data-secret="cwxxQpUZk7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2014, raised more than $143 million last year on a post-money valuation of $1.3 billion, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/117920-17/company/profile#deal-history">according to PitchBook data</a>. The question is, was this a reasonable deal for the company given that valuation?</p>
<p>No company wants to sell for less than it was last valued by its investors. In some cases, such deals can still be accretive for early backers of the selling concern, but not always. In this case TechCrunch is not privy to all the details of the Innovium cap table and what its later investors may have built into their deals with the company in the form of downside protection; such measures can tilt the value of the sale of a company more toward its later and final investors. This is usually managed at the expense of its earlier backers and employees.</p>
<p>Still, the Innovium deal should not be seen as a failure. Building a company that sells for north of $1 billion in equity value is impressive. The deal appears to be slightly smaller in enterprise value terms. In the business world, enterprise value is a useful method of valuing the true cost of an acquisition. In the case of Innovium, a large cash position, what was described as “Innovium cash and exercise proceeds expected at closing of approximately $145 million,” lowered the cost of the transaction to a more modest $955 million in net outlays.</p>
<p>Our general perspective is that the sale is probably not the outcome that Innovium’s backers had hoped for, but that it may still prove lucrative to early workers and early investors, and still works at that lower figure. It’s also notable how in today’s market of mega-rounds and surfeit unicorns, an exit north of the $1 billion mark in equity terms can be viewed as a disappointment in any terms. Innovium is selling for around the price that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/">Facebook paid for Instagram</a> in 2012, a deal that at the time was so large that it dominated technology headlines around the world.</p>
<p>But with so much capital available today, private valuations are soaring and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">mega deals abound</a>. And recent rounds north of $100 million, much like Innovium’s 2020-era, $143 million round, can set companies up with rich valuations and a narrow path in front of them to beat those heightened expectations.</p>
<p>What likely happened? Perhaps Innovium found itself with more cash than opportunities to spend it; perhaps it simply needed a large partner to help it better sell into its market. With expected revenues of $150 million in Marvell’s fiscal 2023, its next fiscal period, Innovium did not fail to reach scale. It may have simply grown well as a private, independent company, and stalled out after its last round.</p>
<p>Regardless, a billion-dollar exit is a billion-dollar exit. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year. While both company boards have approved the deal, it still must clear regular closing hurdles, including approval by Innovium&#8217;s private stock holders.</p>

<p>Boeing is all set to make a second attempt at flying its Starliner CST-100 commercial crew spacecraft to the International Space Station, performing a key demonstration ahead of actually putting astronauts on board for the final big launch before it can claim the spacecraft is certified for regular flight by NASA. Today&#8217;s &#8220;Orbital Flight Test 2&#8221; (OFT-2) mission is a re-do of one that Boeing and NASA first performed in December, 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That first try was meant to be the only one, but it didn&#8217;t go quite as planned, with software errors resulting in a mistaken fire of the craft&#8217;s engines, exhausting the fuel required to get to the Space Station for automated docking as planned. Boeing instead looked to salvage the test with a landing attempt, which also encountered a problem that was corrected before a good touchdown.</p>
<p>While Boeing originally wanted to re-fly the mission sometime last year, the schedule was pushed out for a variety of reasons, and a global pandemic occurring in the interim can&#8217;t have helped. Both Boeing and NASA conducted extensive investigations into not just the cause of the specific problem that the OFT-1 mission encountered, but the culture and processes of Boeing&#8217;s software development as well.</p>
<p>Space industry enthusiasts may already know that Boeing&#8217;s Starliner is one of two commercial spacecraft NASA contracted to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station, the other being SpaceX. Elon Musk&#8217;s private launch company succeeded with its orbital flight test, and subsequently flew humans aboard its final demonstration launch, and is now a regular service provider for NASA, having carried two groups of astronauts to the ISS for standard tours of duty.</p>
<p>Accordingly, all eyes will be on Boeing to see if it can pull this off cleanly, especially given how much time it&#8217;s had since the last flight to correct any errors and prepare. The launch is set for 1:20 PM ET, with live coverage via the stream above kicking off around 12:30 PM ET.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Draper Esprit, another British venture capital firm, moved from the AIM to the LSE proper, with a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We cover a lot of venture capital news here at TechCrunch. New funds, partner changes, the funding rounds themselves &#8212; the list is long. Lately, we&#8217;ve had to touch on rolling funds, solo GPs and a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/"> faster-than-ever investing cadence</a> that has rewritten the rules of venture investing. Gone are the days when investors can take weeks, let alone months, to get into a hot deal in today&#8217;s turbocharged private markets.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another venture capital trend worth discussing: venture capital firms going public. This July, for example, London-based Forward Partners<a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/discover/news-and-insights/london-stock-exchange-welcomes-forward-partners-aim"> went public on the AIM</a>, a sub-market of the well-known London Stock Exchange. Augmentum Fintech is another example of a<a href="https://augmentum.vc/investors/results-and-analyst-coverage/#announcements"> London-listed venture capital firm</a>. The investing group focuses on European fintech.</p>
<p>Most recently, Draper Esprit, another British venture capital firm,<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/draper-esprit-floats-to-become-largest-tech-vc-on-londons-main-market/ar-AAMsV6K"> moved</a> from the AIM to the LSE proper, with a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. TechCrunch has cited Draper Esprit partners in our explorations of the European venture capital scene in the past, especially<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/late-stage-capital-is-having-a-cascading-effect-on-european-vc-activity/"> in our regular digs</a> through the startup hub&#8217;s numbers.</p>
<p>To understand why Draper Esprit not only decided to stay public but doubled down on its structure by moving to the main boards in London and Dublin, we got on the horn with the firm&#8217;s co-founder,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuart-chapman-22a10a/"> Stuart Chapman</a>. What follows is an edited and condensed transcript of our call. Coming up, The Exchange has analysis and further interviews about whether the trend of floating venture capital firms may spread, and why other investing groups opted in. But first, highlights from our chat with Chapman.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: We have a bunch of questions about the change in listing, but let&#8217;s start with how long ago you began this transition.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stuart Chapman: </strong>I co-founded Esprit with<a href="https://draperesprit.com/news/thank-you-simon"> Simon Cook</a> back in 2006, and after a 10-year journey of raising conventional funds, we were coming to the point of raising our fourth fund. But we were having frustrating meetings with limited partners who were trying to pigeonhole us, and at the same time, the London market was getting more and more frustrated that private companies were staying private longer and they would not have access to them. I think we were down to ARM as the last true bastion of tech companies on the London Exchange, so we were approached by a group of City funds to raise our fourth fund through a public market listing.</p>
<p>The junior market in London was very helpful for that, and we spent five happy years on AIM, raising money annually &#8212; until we crossed over the billion [sterling] capitalization mark. By then, it was quite obvious that if we want to fulfill the same ambition and growth over the next five years, we were going to need to step up onto a bigger market that was going to give us wider access to funds and [expand our] attraction to a much larger group of people. Part of our mission at Draper Esprit is to democratize venture capital, as Simon would say; and [being listed on the main market] increases that opportunity.</p>
<p>When we started out on the AIM, we raised capital from professional funds&#8217; tech enthusiasts, who were positively biased. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s not very many of them, and once you have exhausted that, then you move down into the more general funds &#8212; maybe funds with an angle on the U.K., funds with an angle on technology. But by their very nature, they tend to be small-cap funds, and there&#8217;s not that many of them in the U.K. So, by stepping up, we enable ourselves to go into more generous funds as well as tech funds [that] have a minimum bar.</p>
<p><strong>And should we now expect to see Draper Esprit raise more capital per annum?</strong></p>
<p>In a perfect world, the answer is no, because realizations equal investments, so you are self-sustaining. The one thing I would say about Draper Esprit is that we are trying to be innovative. It shocks me that venture capital backs some of the most mind-blowing tech advances in our history over the last 70 years using the same legal structure as a 1958 property vehicle in New York. I don&#8217;t get it! Surely, we can reinvent and push ourselves forward as much as we push our entrepreneurs. So long story short, Simon and I never opted to rest. We always wanted to see if we could create the next thing that would help entrepreneurs be more successful.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about innovation in venture capital models, what&#8217;s the main motivation for your use of retail investment platform PrimaryBid? Is it to open the door for more regular folks to invest, or is it a really material way to add capital to Draper Esprit?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the former. If you go back to 2010, we launched our [Enterprise Investment Scheme] product &#8212; in the U.K., the EIS is a tax wrapper, where private individuals can invest into tech businesses and receive 30% tax credit; and then, if it goes well, it&#8217;s tax-free. It&#8217;s a great government initiative. However, whenever a government interferes in a market, it goes to the lowest denominator, and most people in the industry were using it to enable investors to gain tax credit. Whereas we said: That&#8217;s silly; you should use it to enable people to back the best possible businesses, and then the tax credit is just a bonus.</p>
<p>So what we did back in 2010 [was] we enabled X entrepreneurs, X people in the tech ecosystem, to participate in the Draper Esprit EIS program to be part of this democratizing equity. Today, that&#8217;s about £150 million in the EIS vehicle, and about £50 million in the VCT, which is another U.K. tax-related vehicle where you get the same benefits &#8212; so it&#8217;s now over £200 million from small individuals. The idea for us is to extend our ecosystem out into influential people.</p>

<p><strong>How do you feel about having opened the way for other funds to go public?</strong></p>
<p>Personally, and at Draper Esprit, we are big supporters of innovation, so we have helped Mark Boggett at Seraphim [and shared information and] our path. And then Nic Brisbourne &#8230; was an ex-colleague of mine and Simon&#8217;s, so we actually helped Nic, but we also invested in Forward Partners as a way of showing our support to what he was doing through our fund of funds program.</p>
<p>I think where we are very different is where we get confused with the more technology transfer shops. IP Group [for example is] a great model and it&#8217;s got real longevity [and has been] in the market much longer than us. But that&#8217;s not what we do. They’re looking to back computer science from an early stage in universities. And so, yes, we&#8217;re supportive of others following in our footsteps and we will be big fans of having much wider diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you investing in other funds, and does it open up your capital’s geographic footprint? </strong></p>
<p>Two reasons, to be very honest with you. One is consistent with the previous point, which is [that] Europe wins when it has a really strong ecosystem. And, historically, Europe has founded seed funds in a haphazard way. Finland, for example, had 80 programs to raise early-stage capital. Regions were granted seed funds, but they had no follow-on capital.</p>
<p>No one realized that venture capital was an escalator, and unless you could pass the baton to the next person, [startups] have to do it themselves. But if you have to do it yourself, you don’t create an ecosystem.</p>
<p>The first point was how do we build an ecosystem, consistent with how we get more people into venture capital. If you have a solid ecosystem, then you bring in headhunters, you bring in talent, you bring in bankers, lawyers, you bring in advisers, you bring in the geniuses.</p>
<p>The second reason is that venture capital is quite constrained. If you raise a fund, it is very, very rarely permissible to invest it in other funds. Going back to Simon and I and our quest to be innovative, [we asked] well, why can&#8217;t we invest in early-stage funds, and work with them as partners, and [be their] go-to Series A, Series B fund.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>TechCrunch note</strong>: The firm then drew up a 2&#215;2 matrix, with geography on one side, and skillset on the other. Draper Esprit divided the world into niches where it was strong and weak, and geographies where it was strong and weak. Where it was weak twice, it would partner with other funds, perhaps investing in them. This helped ensure ready deal flow.]</em></p>
<p>By partnering, we put ourselves into an area where we could benefit from their talent [and geographic focus], and they benefit from our capital, and it has been a phenomenal success. We are now in about 42 funds across Europe. The first commitment was with £75 [million] and we&#8217;ve just committed a second £75 [million] to the program. So, we’re at £150 million, [making us] one of the largest private commercial investors.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your take on Ireland, and do you see it as more than a gateway to Europe? </strong></p>
<p>The Irish story has a very long heritage. They always used to be our largest shareholder, the Irish government, through the<a href="https://isif.ie"> Ireland Strategic Investment Fund</a>. They might be the second or third largest shareholder that we still have, but there is a very long relationship between Simon and I and the investment group over there.</p>
<p>And Ireland is renowned for great education, whether that be in the south through Trinity and UCD [in Dublin], or whether that be the north through Queen&#8217;s [University Belfast]. So, there&#8217;s been a great education system, great engineering infrastructure. They have greatly benefited from the Facebooks of the world, and the Googles of the world having [offices] in Ireland. That&#8217;s all the positives, and we have two investors in Ireland.</p>
<p>The downside is that it is relatively small. The numbers of Series A and later-stage growth deals that come out of Ireland are still a lot less than other cities. So we are fans of Ireland; the talent there is fantastic, but it’s a part of an ecosystem instead of another London or another Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Draper Esprit hoping to find the next great startups? Is there a sector or two that you find particularly exciting?</strong></p>
<p>In fintech, we&#8217;re taking an unfashionable approach. You have large incumbents with very outdated systems, but a very loyal and a very high degree of trust customer base. And then you have the regulators in Europe which are very positive towards innovation and incumbents and challengers. I hear my American colleagues are less complimentary about the SEC.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re in an environment where people are being encouraged to challenge the big banks. But they don&#8217;t have trust, and they don&#8217;t have the balance sheet. So, where we are currently attacking &#8212; we genuinely believe that the big guys need to update these legacy systems, and they&#8217;re not going to throw them away. And so, the only way you can update is you have to take off slivers of your book, of your market, and update it bit by bit. These projects are, if not tens, hundreds of millions [of pounds]. [It’s a] lucrative customer base that needs to adopt technology.</p>
<p><strong>But updating that old tech would likely require fintech startups?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s our strategy. The reason why I say it is not fashionable is because it doesn&#8217;t touch the consumer. It&#8217;s quite dull, and [it has] very long sales cycles. When you look at the genius within the teams that we&#8217;re backing, it&#8217;s that very in-depth [knowledge] where the sector views them as experts, the sector views and as the go-to people. So it&#8217;s a very high barrier to entry, which is why I think Europe does very well compared to [the U.S.] in this area because to actually try and attack those European startups from an overseas perspective is quite difficult.</p>
<p><em>More to come shortly; stay tuned.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three-and-half months after launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-brings-touch-id-to-the-magic-keyboard/">the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID</a>, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/mac/accessories">is finally breaking it out from its iMac bundle</a>. The accessory is now available as a standalone through Apple Stores and the company’s site.</p>
<p>There are two versions: the standard and a longer model with a numeric keypad (pretty much what the company offers with all of its Magic Keyboards), running $149 and $179, respectively. There’s also a $99 version that keeps the new rounded, compact design, but drops the Touch ID in favor of a key that locks the system. But where’s the fun in that?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184950" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184950" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184950" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="183" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png 3674w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=150,27 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=300,54 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=768,138 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=680,122 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=1536,275 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=2048,367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184950" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of the models have keys devoted to Spotlight, Dictation, Do Not Disturb and Emoji (I ended up disabling the latter on mine, because I couldn’t avoid accidental presses <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>
<p>An important caveat in all of this: Touch ID only works on Macs running the M1 chip, which disqualifies a pretty massive chunk of the Macs currently on the market. If you do own one of those fancy new systems, the feature can be used for secure logins, purchases and the like. The limitation appears to be a result of Touch ID&#8217;s use of the Secure Enclave found on Apple&#8217;s new chip.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184951" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184951" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184951" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="478" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png 3967w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=768,358 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=680,317 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=1536,717 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=2048,956 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184951" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The keyboard includes a woven USB-C to Lightning cable, though Touch ID also works when the keyboard is connected wirelessly via Bluetooth. Also new are redesigned versions of the Magic Mouse and Trackpad, running $79 and $129 each.</p>
