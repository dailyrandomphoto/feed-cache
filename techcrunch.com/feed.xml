										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a long-time coming folks, but TechCrunch is finally back with our first <strong>live, in-person event</strong> since, well, the Before Times. Join us on April 14 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TechCrunch Early Stage 2022</a>, located in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/#6ba76bba-42de-47f3-857e-4014e6a45235">spacious San Francisco venue</a>, Pier 27.</p>
<p>There’s a reason we chose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage</a> to be our first all-live event. Community building and connection is essential for early-stage founders to find the support they need to stay the difficult course so you&#8217;ll have to be there in-person to participate. Nothing beats the power of face-to face connections — when properly vaxxed, masked and socially distant, of course. We&#8217;ll be following the appropriate city, state and federal protocols and recommendations and you can keep tabs on our COVID-19 policy directly on the event page.</p>
<h3>Register early and save big:</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a limited number of tickets available at the introductory price of $199 &#8211; once they are gone prices will automatically increase so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/?display=true#tickets">secure your your TC Early Stage ticket now</a> for the best deal and save $350!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259727" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h3>Okay, so what’s in it for you?</h3>
<p>This conference focuses on entrepreneurs and founders at every point along the earliest stages of the startup spectrum.</p>
<p>What does that mean? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage</a> provides access to <strong>essential information, resources and community connection to help you realize your entrepreneurial potential</strong>. The summit has your name written all over it if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work a full-time job, dream of starting your own business and want to learn how to turn your spark of an idea into a viable startup</li>
<li>Bootstraping your startup on the side and need to figure out the next steps that will move you closer to being your own boss</li>
<li>Love coding, developing and engineering new products and wonder what it takes to monetize your ideas</li>
<li>Run your startup with the funding you scored using the friends-and-family plan and want to figure out the best path to raising a Series A</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the day three concurrent tracks will offer a variety of topics — think protecting your IP, accelerating user growth, structuring your cap table or receiving feedback on your business pitch. Choose from a range of expert-led workshops, plus smaller, more intimate roundtables that foster deeper conversations and connections.</p>
<p>All of this spells access. You’ll engage with the experts and other founders and get real-time feedback about issues currently facing your company or the idea you are trying to get off the ground. You&#8217;ll even have access to chat with the TechCrunch editorial staff to offer their perspective on marketplace trends and give you inside tips on how to engage some earned-media exposure. And if you miss anything, you&#8217;ll still get all of the session presentations to reference after the event ends.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage</a> is where you’ll actively engage with a community of entrepreneurs, founders and builders. Connect, commiserate and find inspiration with other founders going through a shared journey. Walk away with actionable strategies and advice from industry experts. We’re talking tips that you can use now — when you need them most.</p>
<p><strong>Case in Point:</strong> Here’s what Chloe Leaaetoa, the founder of Socicraft, told us about her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage</a> experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sequoia Capital’s session, Start with Your Customer, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. My team and I identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage 2022</a> takes place — live — on April 14 in San Francisco, Calif. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/?display=true#tickets">Get your ticket</a>, join industry experts and like-minded, early-stage travelers to learn how to make your entrepreneurial dream a reality. We can’t wait to see you there — and we’ve waited two long years to say that!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz said Thursday it plans to use Luminar&#8217;s lidar technology in future vehicles as part of a broader deal that includes data sharing and the automaker taking a small stake in the company.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Mercedes-Benz will acquire up to 1.5 million Luminar shares, in exchange for certain data and services, according to a regulatory filing. Shares of Luminar popped on the news and are now trading more than 17.7% higher.</p>
<p>Luminar&#8217;s agreement with Daimler North America Corporation will involve developing and integrating its technology on its next-generation series production passenger vehicles as well as other defined activities, the filing said. Daimler will share certain data from development and production vehicles with Luminar&#8217;s lidars to be used for continuous product improvement and updates.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260128" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In exchange, Luminar agreed to issue 1.5 million shares of its Class A common stock to Daimler.</p>
<p>Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell called the partnership &#8220;a landmark moment&#8221; in the industry that &#8220;will demonstrate how substantially increased safety and autonomous driving functions on consumer vehicles are going from sci-fi to mainstream.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies declined to share a declined to share information about when Luminar lidar would be integrated into Mercedes-Benz vehicles.</p>
<p>Luminar also has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/volvos-flagship-electric-suv-will-come-with-luminars-lidar-and-software-as-standard/">partnership with Volvo Cars</a> to integrate the lidar company&#8217;s hardware and software and a proprietary perception system will be standard in the automaker&#8217;s forthcoming flagship electric SUV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is separate from another agreement to develop Luminar&#8217;s Iris lidar technology with plans to bring it into series production vehicles by Daimler, in which the company receives non-recurring engineering service fees for certain defined work.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">In October 2020, Daimler’s trucks division said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/daimler-invests-in-lidar-company-luminar-in-push-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-highways/">invested in Luminar</a> as part of a broader partnership to produce autonomous trucks capable of navigating highways without a human driver behind the wheel. The investment was undisclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new app called <a href="https://www.weavit.ai/">Weavit</a> wants to be a &#8220;Shazam for your thoughts&#8221; &#8212; that is, it wants to offer people a different way to quickly capture their thoughts in a note-taking tool with a press of a button, which are then matched to other content in a broader knowledge base. Currently, Weavit can link your notes to your contacts, meetings, topics, and other weblinks, allowing you to jot down your ideas and other inspiration without having to try to first organize those thoughts in some more structured way.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s founders believe this parallels how your brain already works.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every thought that we have in our mind, sometimes, is completely unstructured and simply does not fit within an existing note that we have,&#8221; explains Weavit co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/komal-n/">Komal Narwani</a>. &#8220;You just want to throw a thought out there, and you want the machine to do the organization for you &#8212; so you can surface that information at a later stage and have it all neatly organized.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To use the app, you can either type or dictate your idea to enter it into Weavit&#8217;s database.</p>
<p>The app then uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to link certain items within the note to people, places, events, and other topics it knows about. For instance, if you wrote down you met someone at a certain event, like CES, then &#8220;CES&#8221; would be identified as an event and linked to other content where &#8220;CES&#8221; was also included. (Weavit connects to over 60 million Wikipedia topics to aid in these sorts of connections.) Plus, the person in your note could be identified and linked to their company, to past locations or meetings, and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260144" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260144" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2260144" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg 2126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=1536,816 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=2048,1089 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260144" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weavit</p></div></p>
<p>This automated form of linking makes it easier for people to build on their own existing knowledge as they write down their ideas. However, Weavit will also support using common tools, like the hashtag or the @ mention, so its users can make more manual connections as needed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Weavit&#8217;s co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elefort/?originalSubdomain=hk">Emmanuel Lefort</a>, came up with the idea for the note-taking app in his past life working at a bank. The bank was tasked with selling financial products to its clients, but the sales staff wasn&#8217;t fully able to take advantage of latent information that resided within people&#8217;s personal networks. He thought it would be interesting if there was a way to automatically connect information together, automatically, without requiring manual entry into a CRM.</p>
<p>At launch, Weavit isn&#8217;t yet at the stage of connecting its users&#8217; content to others across a distributed network of some kind &#8212; like within an internal organization, perhaps; that&#8217;s more of a long-term goal.</p>
<p>Instead, everything recorded in your Weavit app is private and encrypted. (Data is also encrypted while in transit, we&#8217;re told).</p>
<p>Currently, Weavit is iOS only but only available to users with an access code, as the startup is still in the early phases of testing.</p>
<p>TechCrunch readers who want to try the app can use the code <strong>&#8220;braincrunch.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260143" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260143" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2260143" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg 1554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260143" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weavit</p></div></p>
<p>Narwani says Weavit could fill a niche by being a more approachable app amid other tools powered by or resembling graph databases, like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, which are Markdown-based knowledge management tools. While those productivity apps are more complex and powerful, that also means they&#8217;re more complicated to adopt &#8212; especially for everyday users who aren&#8217;t as technical. Weavit, on the other hand, could be used by anyone for jotting down notes not only about their work or their research, but for remembering, organizing connecting everyday bits of information &#8212; like movie recommendations, the names of your kids&#8217; teachers, or websites on a particular subject you want to save for later.</p>
<p>The startup raised a $1.25 million seed round in 2020, led by Fluxus Ventures and is a team of six full-time, based in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Though the app&#8217;s MVP had been live last year, the app was retooled and relaunched in December 2021, based on user feedback. In other words, the version of the app live now is only a few weeks old. In its first ten days on the App Store, the new version of Weavit gained 1,500 sign-ups, the company claims.</p>
<p>The Weavit team is also working on a web app and will soon launch a Chrome extension for capturing images and web pages while browsing, to make Weavit capable of collecting content from the web &#8212; not just your own thoughts, ideas and inspirations. An Android app is further down the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/HiCommunities/status/1483891910469160969">bringing</a> its Communities feature to Android four months after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">launched</a> on iOS and the web. The social media giant says Android users can now engage in Communities via the Twitter app as long as they&#8217;ve updated to the latest version. Once users join their first community, a new Communities tab will appear in their navigation bar.</p>
<p>The feature is designed to make it easier to connect with other users based on shared interests. Users are able to join social hubs and tweet directly to other people with shared interests rather than their regular group of followers. Although those tweets are public, replies are limited to other community members. There are numerous popular communities based on countless topics such as dogs, weather, sneakers, cryptocurrency, astrology and more.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android is HERE!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260122" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>if you’re on Android, you can now engage in Communities via the Twitter app (make sure to update to the latest version!) <a href="https://t.co/jHIhngixKD">pic.twitter.com/jHIhngixKD</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Communities (@HiCommunities) <a href="https://twitter.com/HiCommunities/status/1483891895541673993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Earlier this month, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/HiCommunities/status/1478795193050701825">detailed</a> its plans to update and expand Communities. The company said that right now, all Communities are either invite-only or open to all. However, Twitter is exploring a &#8220;request to join&#8221; option where admins and moderators can approve or deny requests. It&#8217;s also going to test a &#8220;Ranked Timeline&#8221; where users will see the top tweets happening in their Communities first, but users will also still have the option to see their timeline in chronological order.</p>
<p>Lastly, Twitter also says it&#8217;s working on ways for users to express themselves in their Communities. It&#8217;s going to explore a way for moderators to highlight notable content in the communities. Twitter&#8217;s also going to test ways for users and moderators to have Q&amp;As with one another.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p2">Twitter’s Communities feature pairs well with its efforts to court creator communities. Over the past year, the company has rolled out its paid subscription feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/"><span class="s1">Super Follows</span></a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/twitter-starts-to-roll-out-paid-ticketed-spaces-on-ios/"><span class="s1">Ticketed Spaces</span></a> for its audio rooms and <span class="s1">a one-time payment feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">Tip Jar</a></span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While buy now, pay later startups have largely focused on the consumer, a growing group of them are now focusing on the B2B space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The premise behind that is that after all, businesses need more flexible payment options, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in December, Affirm spinout Resolve, which specializes in “buy now, pay later” capabilities for B2B transactions, announced that it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-25m-in-insight-partners-led-round-to-grow-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-offering/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $25 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in equity funding. Across the pond, Berlin-based Billie closed on </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/billie-a-buy-now-pay-later-specialist-for-the-b2b-market-raises-100m-on-a-640m-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $100 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding round. And, in Latin America, TruePay, a one-year-old São Paulo-based “buy now, pay later” startup, recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/lee-fixels-addition-leads-32m-investment-into-truepay-a-brazilian-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-startup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $32 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series A financing.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259798" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest BNPL startup seeking to target the B2B space to secure financing is </span><a href="https://www.vartana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vartana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to be the “Affirm for B2B.” For the unacquainted, Affirm &#8212; started by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin &#8212; was one of the earliest players in the consumer BNPL sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in June 2020 by two former KeepTruckin employees, Vartana was selected as the company name because it is the Sanskrit word for &#8220;financial wellness,” according to CEO Kush Kella. And today, the startup is emerging from stealth with $7 million in equity funding and $50 million in credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, co-founders Kella and Ahmed Sharif say they are building a buy now, pay later and checkout platform designed strictly for business to business purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw the inefficiencies in the process and the time it took to complete a transaction and that helped us realize that you can digitize the entire process rather than relying on email and manual paperwork,” Kella told TechCrunch. “We want to bring the same level of flexibility Affirm has brought to consumers to businesses.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Vartana’s target customers are mid- to late-stage technology companies and their resellers. The company was in private beta since last June and is now launching to the public after seeing transaction volume grow by 100% quarter over quarter. It works by pre-approving customers in the sales funnel for payment plans through “real-time” automated underwriting technology. Customers can then choose their preferred payment options and complete transactions “within minutes” through what the company describes as an “integrated checkout experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, say a business is trying to purchase 50 Salesforce licenses. Typically Salesforce would want to charge that business $50,000 upfront. Some companies might not have that kind of extra cash and rather than take out a loan, they may want to spread out their payments. (Note: Salesforce is not a Vartana user.) Vartana offers terms ranging from 12 to 60 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many businesses don&#8217;t have the budget to pay for that kind of thing upfront,” Kella said.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jUx9TPfS6j"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/everyone-loves-bnpl/">Credit card and payments companies compete for a slice of the growing BNPL market</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Credit card and payments companies compete for a slice of the growing BNPL market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/everyone-loves-bnpl/embed/#?secret=jUx9TPfS6j" data-secret="jUx9TPfS6j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in many areas of fintech, the B2B BNPL space is hardly a winner takes all scenario. There seems to be room for many startups, targeting different types of businesses. For example, Resolve focuses on marketplace and e-commerce transactions where buyers are looking to get relatively shorter payment terms “in a self-service fashion,” Kella noted. Vartana, he said, instead focuses on the technology sales market where sellers and buyers need to collaborate to complete the purchase and buyers need financing of greater than 12 months to purchase software or hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our technology is focused on helping buyers and sellers collaborate and deal with more complex transactions,” Kella, who was a founding engineer at KeepTruckin, told TechCrunch. “We focus on businesses trying to acquire a technology product that could range in price from $10,000 to $1 million.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vartana charges a fee (a percentage depending on the length of the contract) from the seller of the tech product. In some cases, where sellers aren’t “comfortable” paying, they pass on the fee to the buyers, Kella said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audacious Ventures led the equity portion of the financing while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/i80-group-1b-in-credit/">i80 Group</a> provided the credit. Flex Capital and several angel investors &#8212; including KeepTruckin CEO and co-founder Shoaib Makani, Google Ventures partner and former Lime president and former Google Ventures partner Joe Kraus, Rubric CEO and co-founder and former Lightspeed Ventures Partners partner Bipul Sinha, Slack CFO Allen Shim, Rippling CFO Adil Syed and others &#8212; also participated in the funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vartana plans to use its equity funding to work on its product roadmap, which involves adding more staff to its current headcount of 17 across engineering, operations and sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nakul Mandan, founder and partner at </span><a href="https://www.audacious.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audacious Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said that every enterprise business his firm has invested in “cares about cash flow and getting paid upfront from their customers, but also benefits in sales velocity by giving better payment terms to its customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vartana, he believes, solves the problem for both the vendor and the customer “in an elegant solution, and is accordingly relevant to almost every B2B company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audacious, Mandan added, was particularly impressed by the team’s vision around building an “end to end checkout solution that combines tech, customer financing and closing process management for an enterprise sales team.” The company’s closing process management and collections offering integrates within a sales reps’ existing tech stack &#8212; another differentiator in the investor’s view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s truly a holistic approach to solve what sales reps need to get their customers to quickly close deals,” he said.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Losing Chinese corporate venture capitalists entirely, and overnight -- which will not happen, mind -- would be sharply contractionary but not lethal.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the Ant Group IPO was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">canceled by central authorities</a>, China&#8217;s government has been on a regulatory tear.</p>
<p>You know the broad outlines: After a lengthy period of growth, capital investment and aggressive business practices, China&#8217;s central government spent much of 2021 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">reining in its technology sector</a>. While some of the actions were reasonable from an antitrust perspective, many of the changes to the country&#8217;s tech sector appeared more punitive toward entities viewed as too powerful.</p>

Didi was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/04/didi-app-pulled-from-app-stores-after-suspension-order/">effectively executed</a> after it had the audacity to go public in the United States. Video game time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/china-restricts-kids-online-gaming-to-three-hours-a-week/">for kids was cut</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-game-regulator-stops-issuing-licenses-110541021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming titles left unapproved</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/china-proposes-strict-control-of-algorithms/">algorithms put under the microscope</a>, and more. The business climate for building tech companies under the new &#8220;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60034050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Prosperity</a>&#8221; push in the country appeared to take a dramatic turn for the worse.</p>
<p>As a result of the changes, the value of many well-known Chinese technology companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/global-investors-flee-from-chinese-tech-stocks-after-the-government-crackdown-on-ant-and-alibaba/">suffered</a>.</p>
<p>Although the exit window for China-built tech companies is seemingly constricting to only domestic exchanges, and the space made available in the economy for tech companies to build and innovate apparently shrinking, venture capital activity was strong last year in the country.</p>
<p>We were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/china-venture-capital-q3-2021/">surprised to see it as 2021 entered its final months</a>, just as we were surprised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/data-show-2021-was-a-bonkers-record-setting-year-for-venture-capital/">when we got the full-year numbers</a>.</p>
<p>But there was more. ByteDance recently &#8220;dissolved its strategic investment team, sending worrying messages to other internet giants that have expanded aggressively by investing in other companies,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/tiktok-bytedance-dissolves-strategic-investment-arm/">TechCrunch reported</a>. Why did TikTok&#8217;s parent company do so? We explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the beginning of this year, ByteDance reviewed its “businesses’ needs” and decided to “reduce investments in areas that are not key business focuses,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. &#8230;</p>
<p>The “restructuring” still stirred up a wave of panic in the industry. China’s cyberspace regulator has drafted new guidelines that will require its “internet behemoths” to get its approval before undertaking any investments or fundraisings, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cyberspace-regulator-drafts-new-rules-internet-behemoths-sources-2022-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported</a>. Some Chinese media outlets reported similar drafted rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hot damn.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re still sorting out precisely what is going on, but it appears that the ability of large Chinese tech companies to deploy capital at will into smaller companies is rapidly coming to a close.</p>
<p>From this juncture, our question is simple: Will government regulations slowing Big Tech investments into smaller companies in China shake up its larger venture capital market? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Tracking corporate venture capital investment in China</h2>
<p>The answer to our question is yes, but perhaps not lethally.</p>
<p>Tracking just how important corporate venture capital is to the Chinese VC scene is an interesting problem to crack. One way to view the data is to look at the list of most active investors in private Chinese tech companies in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram announced today it will allow users to remix any video content on the app, not just short-form reels videos. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/instagram-officially-launches-remix-on-reels-a-tiktok-duets-like-feature/">officially launched Remix</a>, its version of TikTok Duets, last March. The feature lets users record their reels video alongside a video from another user, as a means of interacting, reacting, collaborating, or highlighting other content on the Instagram Reels platform. Now Instagram says any public video on the app is fair game for a remix. But this only applies to videos published publicly from this point forward &#8212; the feature won&#8217;t work on older content.</p>
<p>The company said the expansion made sense as it&#8217;s watched as Remix has been embraced by Reels users. It wanted to offer more ways for creators to &#8220;reinvent their content&#8221; and collaborate with others. When remixing a non-Reels video, creators will still have access to Reels&#8217; set of creative tools, including Collabs, Voiceover, Effects and Audio Tools.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, users can tap the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner of any public Instagram video published after this update goes live. From there, you&#8217;ll choose &#8220;Remix this video&#8221; and record your answer or upload a video from your phone&#8217;s camera roll. Creators are able to remix either all or part of the other person&#8217;s video, and download it as part of the remix. The resulting remixed video will then be visible anywhere you share your reels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259997" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Though the feature&#8217;s expansion could certainly inspire more remixing, resulting in more content for Instagram Reels, it&#8217;s not clear that all Instagram creators will be open to the idea of having their video content repurposed in this way. Those who don&#8217;t want to participate will need to opt out of having their videos remixed from their account settings, Instagram says. This is available under the &#8220;Reels and Remix Controls&#8221; setting, which now allows you to toggle on or off remixes for both reels and feed videos. All users are being defaulted to &#8220;on&#8221; for the new feature, however.</p>
<p>Alternately, creators who want to allow some videos to be remixed and others not, will be able to disable remixes on a per-video basis if they chose to leave the setting on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260097" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260097" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2260097" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-Remixing-Prompt-All-users-will-see.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260097" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>With the launch of remixes for public videos, Instagram seems to assume that everyone with a public account intends to be a &#8220;creator&#8221; and is open to the idea of having their content repurposed by other users. That&#8217;s not necessarily the case. A number of Instagram users may have simply allowed their accounts to default to public during their initial sign-up, without realizing that doing so would later expose their content to a potentially much wider audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, Instagram isn&#8217;t the first to automatically opt-in users to having their content repurposed in order to better compete with TikTok. When YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">launched</a> its own TikTok rival, YouTube Shorts, it did so by allowing creators to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10623810?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=10343432">sample audio</a> from other people&#8217;s videos for use in their own. Instagram has just taken things a step further.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260096" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260096" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2260096" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260096" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Unrelated to the remix changes, Instagram also announced it would now allow users to highlight the topic, date and time of a scheduled Live on their profiles. This will give users an easier way to view and sign up for Lives and creators won&#8217;t necessarily have to create a feed post to promote the event.</p>
<p>The new features are rolling out to all Instagram users now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mitsubishi Electric, the automaker&#8217;s electronics equipment manufacturing company, is starting a pilot program to explore the value of autonomous robots. The company will be working with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-spinoff-cartken-and-reef-technologies-launch-miamis-first-delivery-robots/">Cartken, the Google alum startup that came out of stealth last March</a>, to unleash a small number of Cartken&#8217;s delivery robots in a Japanese mall to provide indoor and curb-side food delivery services, initially for Starbucks customers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers will be able to use their Starbucks app to select robotic delivery for their order, and a Cartken robot will meet the customer at one of the delivery points inside or outside the mall, <a href="https://www.e-logit.com/loginews/2022:011905.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Mitsubishi</a>. </span>The pilot, which will take place at <span style="font-weight: 400;">Aeon Mall Tokoname starting this month, </span>will run through April 2022 with plans to scale to a porter service that resembles curbside pickup for other shoppers, according to <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anjali Jindal Naik, COO and co-founder of Cartken. </span></p>
<p>The pilot with Cartken, Mitsubishi&#8217;s first time trying out delivery robots, will help the company explore other use cases for the tech while tapping into the nascent Japanese autonomous delivery market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259661" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mitsubishi Electric would like to create the new robot delivery market in Japan by using Cartken robots,&#8221; Naoki Fujita, who manages Mitsubishi Electric&#8217;s Mobility Innovation Department, told TechCrunch. &#8220;This is a totally new attempt for us, and in this process, we can utilize our knowledge, technology and even relationships with customers from Mitsubishi&#8217;s various business units to see the development of this program succeed and expand into new markets where the technology can be used.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>While the first phase of the partnership sees Mitsubishi as a distributor for Cartken&#8217;s tech, down the line, the two companies intend to work together to develop additional technology that will support Mitsubishi&#8217;s future partnerships. For example, they&#8217;re currently looking into the development of facility technology that can help Cartken&#8217;s robots interact with elevators, said Fujita.</p>

<p>Cartken, which partnered with REEF Technology last year to bring its self-driving robots to deliver food in downtown Miami, will not only gain from Mitsubishi&#8217;s expertise in electrical equipment, but it will also help the startup establish a presence in Japan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starting a pilot at Aeon Mall will help with that. Aeon is one of the largest retailers in Asia, with a retail network that spans not just hundreds of malls, but also convenience stores and supermarkets.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The selection of Aeon Mall is because it is the perfect ecosystem to test the robots&#8217; success in a setting that is high-volume,&#8221; Naik told TechCrunch. &#8220;Also, Aeon Mall allows for a range of use-cases to be investigated, with the goal of quickly adding more robots to allow more visitors to experience delivery service, and then scaling up by 2022.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Cartken&#8217;s Model C robots were chosen by Mitsubishi because of their high rating in safety and dependability in both indoor and outdoor settings, said Fujita. The startup says its robots can navigate autonomously inside and outside the mall, but they are all equipped with remote monitoring systems that allow for human override if necessary.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So far we’ve only encountered a few situations that need emergency remote assistance,&#8221; said Naik. &#8220;New construction that requires an alternate robot route is an example of where a remote operator gets involved. Similarly, remote assistance is also used in the setup phase, allowing us to deploy in just a few days while the robots learn a map of the service area.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Recently, competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/serve-robotics-new-autonomous-sidewalk-delivery-robots-dont-require-human-assist/">Serve Robotics, a spinout of Uber, announced its robots&#8217; ability to handle similar levels of autonomy</a>. The company said in certain operational design domains, AKA geofenced areas, its robots can reach full autonomy. As with Cartken, its robots also have remote operators on standby in the case of emergency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament has definitively backed major limits on behavioral advertising during a plenary vote on amendments to the pan-EU Digital Services Act (DSA).</p>
<p>The move looks set to crank up pressure on Big Tech business models that rely on pervasive tracking and profiling of users to target ads &#8212; with adtech duopoly Facebook and Google, which make most of their money through mass surveillance and microtargeting of Internet users, squarely in the frame.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In an </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">earlier vote</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the parliament already backed a full ban on profiling minors and limits on the use of special category data for ad targeting to be added to another piece of draft digital legislation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But while the DMA will apply to so-called internet &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; (such as Facebook and Google) the latest amendments expand the remit of restrictions even further as t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he DSA updates the bloc&#8217;s long-standing ecommerce directive, so is set to apply to digital services more broadly. </span></p>
<p>Having the same provisions in both packages of legislation is also important for legislative consistency (which supports enforcement) &#8212; and sends a clear signal of where the parliament stands on this issue.</p>

<p>While MEPs rejected an amendment to the DSA that had proposed a complete ban on behavioral advertising, a number of amendments proposed by a coalition of MEPs, civil society organisations and companies &#8212; organizing as the <a href="https://trackingfreeads.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tracking-free Ads Coalition</a> &#8212; were passed during the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/sed/doc/news/flash/25941/Result_19-01-2022_Voting%20session_en.pdf">votes</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These included one that is &#8212; effectively &#8212; a ban on using UX tweaks to manipulate/force consent as the amendment requires platforms to offer parity in consent flows for refusing or agreeing to hand over data.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the event of a user denying profiling the amendment says they should be given &#8220;other fair and reasonable options&#8221; to access the service. This amendment was passed with 329 in favor vs 303 against (with 60 abstentions).</p>
<p>Another Coalition amendment which passed mirrors provisions in the DMA to ban the ad profiling of minors and also prohibit the use of highly sensitive personal data (such as racial or ethnic origin, political or religious affiliation, sexuality or health data) for behavioral targeting of <em>anyone.</em></p>
<p>It passed with a larger majority: 410:273 (with 9 abstentions).</p>
<p>At the same time, an attempt to weaken the draft legislation by removing existing restrictions in the text on dark patterns &#8212; via a split vote &#8212; was also resoundingly defeated by MEPs in a definitive rejection of Big Tech&#8217;s lobbying against regulation.</p>
<p>On dark patterns the parliament voted overwhelmingly (524:157; with 11 abstentions) to reiterate its desire for a ban.</p>
<p>Practices the parliament wants outlawed include giving more visual prominence to certain consent options vs others; repeatedly requesting consent after a denial to try to fatigue users into agreeing; nudging users to change settings after they have already made a choice; ignoring automated opt-outs signalled by users and requesting consent regardless; and making it &#8220;significantly more cumbersome&#8221; to terminate a service vs signing up.</p>
<p>The upshot of these votes is that the elected representatives of EU citizens have signalled strong backing for significant restrictions to microtargeting and related adtech practices (like manipulative consent flows) which &#8212; if they make it through into the final law &#8212; will put a significant squeeze on surveillance-based business models, increasing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">pressure for adtech reform</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK privacy watchdog warns adtech the end of tracking is nigh&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/embed/#?secret=CvBjusAMIK" data-secret="CvBjusAMIK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This is extremely significant because &#8212; trilogue pending &#8212; you can&#8217;t target people anymore on all the sensitive data or whatever can be used to infer that sensitive data, so sexual orientation, political affiliation, trade union membership, ethnic origin and so on, that&#8217;s quite broad &#8212; and whatever could be used to infer that,&#8221; said MEP Alexandra Geese, one of the parliamentarians backing the Tracking-Free Ads Coalition, speaking to TechCrunch after the vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a game-changer &#8212; together with the other provisions we already had, and the compromise on the DMA which is the ban for targeted advertising on minors&#8230; the [provisions against] dark patterns [to] clearly allow people to say &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; to tracking. That&#8217;s a bunch of provisions that clearly limit the possibility to use surveillance advertising significantly and I think that could usher in a change of the whole business model of the internet &#8212; away from surveillance advertising and towards contextual advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be complicated for platforms,&#8221; she added. &#8220;They will defend [current targeting practices] but all the restrictions are significant and I think especially advertisers will start looking at that and say, well why do we have to put up with these &#8212; in the end we don&#8217;t reach the people, why can&#8217;t we just do context? So I&#8217;m really hoping for a change of the business mode&#8230; We&#8217;re clearly showing this is not working, this is not compatible with a democracy &#8212; do something about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>An industry standard framework for obtaining consents to serve tracking ads currently is already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">facing a finding that it breaches the General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR).</p>
<p>So quite how the current creepy adtech &#8216;standard&#8217; &#8212; of pervasive, consentless profiling of Internet, users combined with high velocity trading of people&#8217;s attention &#8212; would be able to survive with even less rope to lasso consumers&#8217; eyeballs in the future is indeed unclear.</p>
<p>Geese pointed to a statement by Facebook in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/facebook-will-no-longer-allow-advertisers-to-target-political-beliefs-religion-sexual-orientation/">November</a> &#8212; when the tech giant announced that it would not longer allow advertisers to target people based on &#8220;sensitive&#8221; topics, arguing: &#8220;They are feeling the heat, definitely,&#8221; before pressing the case to follow through and cement legislative limits: &#8220;But as long as we don&#8217;t have the instruments to check this that doesn&#8217;t mean anything &#8212; I mean who believes Mark Zuckerberg anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">DSA proposal</a> also contains a package of measures to dial up transparency and accountability on platforms and their hierarchy generating AIs &#8212; requiring larger platforms to submit to a degree of regulatory oversight of their algorithms, as well as to provide public interest researchers with access to data to enable independent scrutiny of platform effects.</p>
<p>Such measures will clearly be crucial in ensuring any legislative limits on Big Tech&#8217;s microtargeting are actually implemented by the platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We clearly can&#8217;t solve all the problems with the DSA &#8212; because first of all we need to do a lot more research, and the problem is so far we couldn&#8217;t do the research because we couldn&#8217;t access the data,&#8221; says Geese. &#8220;[But] with the DSA you give the Commission, the digital service coordinators, researchers and NGOs access to the data if they have good projects in order to assess the compliance so once the DSA&#8217;s in force we will start having an enormous amount of knowledge, of insights. And we will be able to come up with even better and more precise regulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t depend on Mark Zuckerberg or someone from Google telling us &#8216;oh we&#8217;re doing nothing wrong&#8217;; we will have the knowledge to deal with it. I think this is really what makes a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s vote to restrict adtech is especially significant given the massive lobbying effort by Google and Facebook throughout last year, also looping in their extensive proxy network of third party industry organizations to lobby on their behalf.</p>
<p>US tech giants have poured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/us-giants-top-tech-industrys-100m-a-year-lobbying-blitz-in-eu/">literally millions into trying to influence</a> the shape of this major update to EU digital legislation in recent years &#8212; leading to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">some especially </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1483786510214303744">cringeworthy memeing</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> this week from internal market commissioner EVP, Thierry Breton. (Albeit, at least Breton avoided straight-up parroting of adtech talking points, <a href="https://twitter.com/_Kaari_N/status/1461269111611314186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlike some others in the Commission</a>&#8230; ).</span></p>
<p>Big (ad)tech&#8217;s campaigning against regulation of tracking ads also &#8212; oh the irony! &#8212; included a blitz of ads targeted at EU lawmakers ahead of today&#8217;s vote, as well as plenty of cash splashed on traditional newspaper ads. Such as the below Facebook ad in a German newspaper pushing a self-serving claim that small businesses need tracking ads to survive&#8230;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the end, MEPs don&#8217;t appear to have been taken in by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">Nick Clegg&#8217;s favorite talking point</a>. (Aka: &#8216;Save Me(ta) to Save SMEs&#8217;.)</p>
<p>How did they resist all that spin? Paul Tang, another of the parliamentarians who&#8217;s backed the push against tracking ads, pointed to a <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/french-and-german-smes-oppose-tracking-based-ads-survey-finds/">recent YouGov survey</a> of SMEs in France and Germany &#8212; which found a majority don&#8217;t actually want to use tracking ads but said they feel they have no choice but to use Facebook and Google because of their market dominance.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the impact of antitrust reports, produced by competition authorities in the UK and Australia in recent years, digging into the adtech duopoly &#8212; which have suggested the lion&#8217;s share of every ad dollar (or euro) ends up in the coffers of Facebook and Google. (Or, put another way, the Big Adtech philosophy is: &#8216;me, me, me; not SME&#8217;.)</p>
<p>Tang also pointed out that the Coalition put over a year of work into raising awareness and educating fellow lawmakers on the issues and harms linked to tracking ads, with all this effort inexorably buoyed up by a parade of Big Tech scandals over the period &#8212; such as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-european-parliament/">Facebook Files</a>. Or the flow of cartel-ish revelations from various <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">antitrust suits</a>.</p>
<p>So, in the European parliament at least, the penny appears to have dropped on Big Tech.</p>
<p>What happens next? The plenary vote amending the DSA sets the parliament&#8217;s negotiating position for trilogue discussions with its co-legislators, the Council (aka EU Member States&#8217; governments) and the Commission &#8212; so Facebook and Google&#8217;s lobbying will likely swing towards Member State governments in earnest. And perhaps we&#8217;ll see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">Sundar Pichai finding time for another politician-pressing tour of European capitals</a>.</p>
<p>In one early reaction to the parliament&#8217;s vote, the European arm of adtech industry association, the Interact Advertising Bureau (IAB), showed no signs of dialling down the lobbying &#8212; describing the vote as &#8220;disappointing&#8221;, and claiming that &#8220;personal data in advertising is already tightly regulated by existing legislation&#8221;, before urging EU lawmakers to &#8220;reconsider&#8221; to &#8220;ensure we end up with a DSA that provides legal certainty for all actors&#8221;.</p>
<p>The IAB&#8217;s regional director of public policy, Greg Mroczkowski, added in the statement: &#8220;It is disappointing that in a mistaken belief that targeted advertising causes online disinformation or breaches privacy and data protection principles, MEPs have decided to pass amendments that not only overlap with the GDPR and existing consumer law but risk undermining these rules, as well as the entire ad-supported digital economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, a Digital Services Act that boosts transparency and certainty across the online economy is in everyone’s interests. We will be consulting with our members and all interested stakeholders to try to come up with solutions that are workable, secure and efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is still months more road to run on this drama before the full and final detail of the DSA is hammered out &#8212; so plenty could change. But, after the trilogue discussions conclude &#8212; assuming a compromise is reached (it still has not over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/">ePrivacy reform</a>) &#8212; MEPs get another vote on the final text s<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">o today&#8217;s vote underscoring the parliament&#8217;s red lines on adtech sends a strong signal to Member States over what the parliament will accept in the final legislative package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hence why anti-tracking ads campaigners are sounding so jubilant. (And, well, the IAB isn&#8217;t.)</span></p>

<p>The EU Parliament just adopted the amendments of the Tracking-free Ads Coalition to the Digital Services Act report (499 &amp; 500) &#8211; effectively banning the use of sensitive personal data and data of minors for  advertising purposes! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DSA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DSA</a> <a href="https://t.co/laRlJiEata">pic.twitter.com/laRlJiEata</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;There was an enormous amount of lobbying on parliament&#8230; It was really enormous &#8212; and we still made it. So I&#8217;m a lot more optimistic than yesterday, I have to say,&#8221; adds Geese. &#8220;This is a really really good report we&#8217;re passing in parliament today.&#8221;</p>
<p>On potential Council pushback, she suggests any pro-tracking moves by Member State governments might be tempered by the momentum that&#8217;s now been generated on the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;In trilogue &#8212; let&#8217;s see. From what I know, surveillance advertising wasn&#8217;t a big issue in the discussions in Council that led to the general approach. It wasn&#8217;t even discussed much. And now there&#8217;s a momentum &#8212; that is very, very different &#8212; and I think governments will have to look into it. And ask themselves is that really the position we want to defend? Why are we defending Meta&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s interests rather than the interests of our own companies?</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s going to be a different debate, I think. I know the general approach of the Council is already fixed but this is a possibility. We have to find a compromise anyway &#8212; and we will discuss it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Germany the government has changed in the meantime. That might have some weight. It depends a little bit. We will see. Too early to foresee that I think &#8212; but there&#8217;s an open space right now to talk about it,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;If we had lost this vote it would have been a lot more difficult because it would have been limited to minors. But now we have to discuss it in the trilogue very actively.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the defeat of the amendment that had proposed a full, default ban on profiling for ads, Geese suggests Big Tech&#8217;s  lobbying did succeed in sewing enough FUD around the issue to create doubt in MEPs&#8217; minds.</p>
<p>But she argues their spin won&#8217;t be able to survive the rising scrutiny &#8212; including from antitrust regulators interrogating the source of the adtech duopoly&#8217;s market power. So the direction of travel in the coming years looks clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the platforms manage to do was the instil the idea in people that either you have surveillance advertising or you have no advertising at all online. And that&#8217;s not true,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We need some more time to show that this is not true &#8212; there&#8217;s some very good alternatives that would be even a lot better for European companies, also in terms of competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have these huge competition issues with Google and Facebook controlling in Germany and France, 70% of the market &#8212; globally a lot more &#8212; and now the people who really follow competition policy in digital markets know that, with the Texas lawsuit discoveries and so on that there&#8217;s really cartel curbing going on&#8230;. So once there&#8217;s interest for the topic you can communicate these facts but first you need to raise awareness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s complicated to explain and it&#8217;s not something people really feel in their daily lives, so politicians are not too motivated to look into this&#8230; And this is why this success is so important because in trilogue, the media, everyone will start talking about it, looking into it, and see how rotten the system is &#8212; and why it&#8217;s so bad for us. This is why I have quite a lot of home that sooner or later we will either have a total ban or just phase out the business model.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company has already declined to comment, and the sources cautioned the effort was still early and could change.However, Instagram leader Adam Mosseri said in December that his social network was &#8220;actively exploring&#8221; NFTs.

<p>A dip into NFTs would make sense. While companies sometimes abuse the link between NFTs and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">the metaverse</a> (merely offering NFTs doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re creating a metaverse, folks), Meta might want a framework for them so that residents of its virtual worlds can sell unique digital goods. This could also help Meta prevent third-party platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opensea-nft-insider-trader-resigns-190502174.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">OpenSea&#8217;s</a> market from gaining too strong a hold if NFTs prove to be more than a short-lived trend.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259979" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.workplace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace</a>, the app owned and originally built by Facebook (now Meta) as a version of the social network for enterprise employees to communicate with each other, has signed up upwards of 7 million users, finding traction in particular among multinational organizations with a mix of front-line, deskless and desk-based workers, as a way for management to stay connected to all of them, and for those employees to chat about work with each other.</p>
<p>Now, it is gearing up to add more functionality to enhance that usefulness: Workplace will soon be adding an integration with <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp</a>, the popular messaging app with billions of users and also owned by Meta, so that Workplace customers can cross-post announcements and share other data with employees using the messaging app.</p>
<p>WhatsApp functionality is expected to go live sometime later this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259947" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It sounds like messaging communication will be part of that initial launch, but the company is also working on ways of integrating other kinds of Workplace productivity functionality into WhatsApp, such as integrating Shift Cover &#8212; a way for shift workers to swap shifts with each other and keep managers and their planning systems in the loop, which was initially launched on Workplace back in <a href="https://en-gb.workplace.com/resources/news-updates/november-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Ujjwal Singh, the head of Workplace, would not be specific about the exact timing, explaining that they are still &#8220;working through the details&#8221; of how it will function, with some decisions still being made, the focus being how best to leverage what is in its DNA as a consumer app as an enterprise service.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2260112" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg" width="5760" height="3600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img_9962.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5760px) 100vw, 5760px" />&#8220;This is something we&#8217;d been working on for a while,&#8221; he said in an interview, noting that even though the two have been a part of the same stable under Facebook, the different business announcements that WhatsApp has been making, for example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-doubles-down-on-business-tools-with-whatsapp-api-updates-login-connect-for-messenger-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding the WhatsApp API</a> last year, needed to be in place first. It&#8217;s also been working with customers to build the feature. &#8220;We want to be careful about what goes out to a consumer app. We wanted to do this in a way that was safe for companies to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move to bring more business usage to WhatsApp and more functionality into Workplace are both a long time coming but fit with the broader strategies for both products, and with Meta&#8217;s strategy as a whole.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the Meta front, the company has been on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years-long mission</a> to bring its various apps closer together both as customer-facing services and at the back end. That strategy has included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrating Messenger with Instagram&#8217;s messaging feature</a> so that consumers could communicate across the apps; and it&#8217;s also had a business/commercial focus, giving companies that use WhatsApp for Business the ability to initiate contacts on, say, Facebook, and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/how-to-message-a-business-on-whatsapp-from-their-facebook-shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue conversations more directly over WhatsApp</a>. Those efforts have not been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/02/facebook-warned-over-privacy-risks-of-merging-messaging-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncontroversial</a>, although gradually they have been rolled out nevertheless.</p>
<p>This brings not just more activity to the different platforms, but creates more reasons to sway businesses to advertise, use premium products like WhatsApp for Business, and generally carry out more commercial activities across Meta. They are also potentially building out a bigger use case for Meta as more than just a consumer product that is based around advertising across its apps.</p>
<p>Workplace started out in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/10/facebook-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early days</a> as essentially Facebook&#8217;s answer to the rise of Slack: Why let an upstart eat our enterprise lunch, the thinking went, when so many people are already using Facebook for non-work interactions (and some work ones), and our own employees have proven that it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook for work chit-chat and planning?</p>
<p>Longer term, it seems that this original thesis didn&#8217;t quite carry out as Facebook had thought it would: Initially it brought in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/facebook-workplace-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of integrations</a>, similar to those you might find on Slack, to position Workplace as a useful productivity hub, and to that it added a lot of native functionality around collaboration and communication for knowledge workers. But more recently, it seems to have shifted focus somewhat.</p>
<p>First of all, products like Slack and Teams from Microsoft continued to stick around and grow their reputations &#8212; a shift that Workplace has followed by working more closely with those platforms. (Most recently, with a <a href="https://www.workplace.com/blog/workplace-and-microsoft-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teams integration</a> for video and other features.) Second of all, it&#8217;s found a new wave of users among those who are &#8220;deskless&#8221;, front-line and other customer-facing workers who are not sitting at computers all day, but on the go, with mobile phones being their primary way of interacting with their managers, colleagues and organizations overall.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;A lot of front-line workers outside the U.S. are using consumer tools like WhatsApp to get work done,&#8221; Singh said. &#8220;We have data that says using WhatsApp for shift management is just part of it. The data shows that frontline workers feel disconnected from executives making decisions, and so that is the key point of this integration.&#8221; He&#8217;s referring here to new research the company is also releasing today that supports how Workplace is developing. It found that ju</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">st over half (54%) of front-line workers said they felt connected to their organization’s HQ &#8212; one reason why it sees an opportunity to build out Workplace, and WhatsApp as a way to bridge that gap. </span></p>
<p>Longer term, this WhatsApp integration and the wider shift that the company is making to serve deskless workers are positioning Workplace among a new wave of apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/blink-a-productivity-app-aimed-at-frontline-workers-raises-20m-at-a-100m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blink</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/yoobic-raises-50m-for-its-chat-and-communications-app-app-aimed-at-frontline-and-service-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a> targeting front-line employees and their specific requirements and functions in the workplace. It will be interesting to see whether Facebook chooses to remain a simple messaging and communications tool in that mix or whether it starts to build more features to cater specifically to those users. It&#8217;s a crowded field, with others also vying for customers in this space, including When I Work — which last year raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/when-i-work-an-messaging-app-that-lets-shift-based-teams-schedule-work-and-more-raises-200m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/homebase-raises-71m-for-a-team-management-platform-aimed-at-smbs-and-their-hourly-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, which raised $71 million; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a>, which focuses on home services pros; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/workwhile-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WorkWhile</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew</a> (which <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square acquired</a> last year); and <a href="https://www.justworkshours.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justworks</a> (which in September 2021 filed to go public).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Committing to a diverse and inclusive workplace is one thing, but following through is another.</p>
<p>To help companies do this more effectively, <a href="https://diversio.com/">Diversio</a> is using artificial intelligence technology, data analytics and knowledgeable subject matter experts to find where the company’s process is breaking down and create a comprehensive action plan to get it back on track.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $6.5 million in Series A funding from a group of investors including First Round Capital, Golden Ventures and Chandaria Family Holdings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259673" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Laura McGee, co-founder and CEO, started the company in 2018 after doing diversity and inclusion consulting for corporate clients and the government that led her to do a lot of CEO roundtables. She kept hearing from them that while diversity was well understood, they didn’t know how to do it.</p>
<p>“We said, ‘we hear you,’ but there were no metrics or accountability, and those were the kinds of tools that will help us set targets and then actually drive change,” McGee told TechCrunch. “From our perspective, this is a software solution. This has got to be something that companies use on an ongoing basis, is tied to business records and ultimately provides evidence-based recommendations.”</p>
<p>Diversio’s software takes in survey data from employees and uses natural language processing algorithms to analyze the data. From that feedback, Diversio can identify specific problems that are preventing diverse employees from doing their best work. Then the company matches those pain points to action items pulled from a recommendation engine of 1,600 validated programs and policies from around the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A is the company’s first institutional funding after raising $60,000 from angel investors and bootstrapping the company. In fact, fundraising for this particular business case was a challenge until she met Meka Asonye, partner at First Round. The questions in 2018 were around if companies would spend money in this area, McGee said.</p>
<p>Then in 2020, the world changed, particularly surrounding the death of George Floyd. That, and for a variety of reasons, diversity and inclusion were recognized as a critical business — and rightly so, McGee explained.</p>
<p>“Customers are expecting companies to take action, and investors are starting to ask questions when they allocate capital,” she added. “And then equally the risk is becoming ever greater. If as a company you undergo a scandal, there is really nothing that can bring you down faster.”</p>
<p>Since launching in 2018, Diversio has grown 300% year over year. Over the past 12 months, the company doubled its customers and is now working with about 400 customers, many that have come through working with investors across their portfolios, McGee said.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to invest in its team. The company currently has 35 employees, and McGee’s plan is to double that by the end of the year, especially in the company’s new offices in London and New York. It will also work on product development, including more targeted and customized data analysis and the recommendation engine.</p>

<p>Next up, McGee expects to grow the company’s international footprint in Europe and the U.K. and grow more in North America. Diversio is also working on getting additional partnerships.</p>
<p>“The 30% Club is one example, and investors are another,” McGee added. “Our vision is establishing a set of inclusion metrics that are widely adopted and creating a platform and a system that allows companies to really learn from one another in order to refine the recommendation.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, First Round’s Asonye said when talking to Diversio customers, they would tell him that they know they have a diversity and inclusion problem and didn’t know where to start, but having a platform like Diversio helped them not only measure, but then act, was a differentiator from other companies in the market.</p>
<p>And at a time when a lot of companies are raising money because it is a convenient time in the market, or they are raising money because they have to, it was “impressive” to see the way Diversio was able grow to the size and scope it did and to get to the number of customers essentially as a bootstrapped company, he added.</p>
<p>“One of the other really interesting things about the business is that this is a problem that hits medium companies, small companies and big companies, and despite the fact that you would think somebody would have this figured out, that&#8217;s not the case,” Asonye added. “They have the high-growth tech companies that go from 50 to 200 and start asking if they should be thinking about values. Almost every piece of the market actually has this sort of problem and is traveling to find the solution. That really resonated with us.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A cyberattack targeting a contractor working for the International Committee of the Red Cross has spilled confidential data on more than 515,000 &#8220;highly vulnerable&#8221; people, many of whom have been separated from their families due to conflict, migration and disaster.</p>
<p>The Red Cross did not name the contractor, based in Switzerland, which it uses to store data nor say what led to the security incident, but said that the data comes from at least 60 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies.</p>
<p>In a statement, the international organization pleaded with the attackers not to publicly share or leak the information given the sensitivity of the data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259963" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Your actions could potentially cause yet more harm and pain to those who have already endured untold suffering. The real people, the real families behind the information you now have are among the world&#8217;s least powerful. Please do the right thing. Do not share, sell, leak or otherwise use this data,&#8221; read <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/sophisticated-cyber-attack-targets-red-cross-red-crescent-data-500000-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the statement</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of the breach, the organization shut down its Restoring Family Links program, which aims to reunite family members separated by conflict or disaster.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Red Cross told TechCrunch that the stolen information included names, locations and contact information, as well as credentials used to access some of the organization&#8217;s programs.</p>
<p>The hack compromised personal data such as names, locations and contact information of more than 515,000 people. The people affected include missing people and their families, unaccompanied or separated children, detainees and other people receiving services from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement as a result of armed conflict, natural disasters or migration. Login information for about 2,000 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers who work on these programs has also been compromised. No other information at the ICRC was compromised due to the segmentation of the systems, said Red Cross spokesperson Crystal Ashley Wells.</p>
<p>International human rights groups and disaster relief agencies are an increasing target for hackers. Last year the United Nations had its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/09/09/united-nations-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network breached</a> by unknown cyberattackers, and Microsoft revealed that the U.S. Agency for International Development <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/us/politics/russia-hack-usaid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was targeted</a> to launch malicious emails to thousands of targets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Customer service is making and breaking companies over the past two years as shopping moved online and consumers wanted more out of the traditional service companies were offering.</p>
<p><a href="https://zingtree.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zingtree</a> provides interactive contact center software that guides agents to the next best action so that they can cater to even the most discerning customer.</p>
<p>To continue developing its product, the company raised $15 million in Series A funding. Conductive Ventures led the round and was joined by Storm Ventures, Madrona and angel investors like Hilarie Koplow-McAdams. Existing investors participating in the round included Rally Ventures, Parade Ventures and Vitalize Ventures. The new investment brings the company’s total funding to $18.5 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zingtree was founded in 2014 to make business information actionable for teams so that agents could quickly make decisions during complex service calls. Users leverage no-code “decision trees” to create detailed agent scripts, guide customers to solve their own issues and manage their internal processes at scale. As a result, agents are able to improve their average handling time, resolution and consumer satisfaction, Juan Jaysingh, CEO of Zingtree told TechCrunch via email.</p>
<p>“Unlike our competitors, business users can build and maintain Zingtree agent scripts without any IT or engineering development resources, and we have ready-built integrations for CRM systems so agents work out of one place, and our interface is so easy to use for agents that it requires little to no training,” Jaysingh added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alpha Edison leads customer service platform Thankful’s $12M round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/alpha-edison-leads-customer-service-platform-thankfuls-12m-round/embed/#?secret=4zGgLBT3IO" data-secret="4zGgLBT3IO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is the latest in the customer service sector to attract venture capital. For example, in the past few months, we’ve seen companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/alpha-edison-leads-customer-service-platform-thankfuls-12m-round/">Thankful</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/sanas-aims-to-convert-one-accent-to-another-in-real-time-for-smoother-customer-service-calls/">Sanas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/zendesk-acquires-ai-automation-startup-cleverly-to-advance-customer-service/">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/level-ai-lands-13m-series-a-to-build-conversational-intelligence-for-customer-service/">Level AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/goodcall-picks-up-4m-yelp-partnership-to-answer-merchant-inbound-calls/">Goodcall</a> announce similar news.</p>
<p>Several drivers affected business and customer care processes over the past two years. For example, employee shortages due to COVID cases rising and “The Great Resignation.” Contact center agents now working at home could no longer rely on in-person subject matter experts, managers or experienced peers.</p>
<p>Jaysingh explained that the global pandemic, in particular, has put more onus on companies to improve their customer service capabilities. They are having to manage customers that become frustrated quickly and will leave a brand or enterprise quickly if they don’t get high-quality service at speed.</p>
<p>“This is negatively impacting companies’ revenues if they don’t solve for providing consistent high-quality service to their customers,” he added. “Not only has the pandemic accelerated remote-first culture, it is now seen as a competitive edge to acquire top-notch global talent.”</p>
<p>Zingtree’s enterprise annual recurring revenue grew three times in 2021 after growing two times in 2020. The company “is in striking distance” of profitability, but decided to prioritize growth in taking the latest capital raise, Jaysingh said. It was bootstrapped for six years before taking its first institutional seed funding in 2020 to scale the business.</p>
<p>It is working with more than 600 customers in 50 countries to make more than 15 million human decisions every month. Among the list are consumer brands and enterprise customers like SharkNinja, Groupon, Getty Images, Ricoh, Fossil and Experian.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Though Jaysingh did not give a specific valuation, he did say the new funding round was almost a five-time lift from the previous round a year ago.</p>
<p>He expects to invest heavily in building the Zingtree ,team with plans to double headcount across all departments. It has 46 employees currently after having 10 employees at the end of 2020. The new funding will enable the company to get to 70 by the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>The company will also deploy funds in product development to add enhancements like artificial intelligence and machine learning and data insight solutions and features, as well as build integrations and partnerships with even more contact center core technologies, like current partner Talkdesk.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Carey Lai, founder and managing director of Conductive Ventures, is joining Zingtree’s board of directors, along with Vikram Verma, former CEO of contact center communication platform 8&#215;8.</p>
<p>Lai told TechCrunch via email that Zingtree’s no-code solution was a differentiator from competitors due to its ease of use, while also offering sophisticated features and functionalities. He also was impressed by the company’s early customer traction in attracting top-tier customers and its experienced management team.</p>
<p>“Interesting companies are built when you combine the market opportunity paired with the experience, commitment and vision of the executive leadership team,” he added. “Zingtree is helping enterprises deliver on the promise of great customer support. Over the past seven years, businesses have repeatedly come to Zingtree to help their employees make better and faster decisions daily while still being able to follow standard operating procedures. That&#8217;s a game-changer for contact centers and support teams with complex products, strict compliance and the need to scale.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://codesee.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeSee</a> is an aptly named startup, one that is building a set of tools to help developers understand how all the parts of a code base fit together. Today, the company announced a $7 million secondary seed on top of the $3 million it received in 2020. The round was led by new investors Wellington Access Ventures, Plexo Capital and Menlo Ventures along with several industry angels who had participated in the first seed investment.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Shanea Leven says that her company is solving a problem of understanding the entire code base, something that every developer struggles with, no matter their level of experience, especially when they encounter a new code base.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always this feeling of dread and anxiety of just how overwhelming this is going to be, and how long is this going to take me before I can actually feel confident that I can make a meaningful contribution to this code base,&#8221; she said, adding, &#8220;No matter how experienced you are. You hit that moment, and you hit it all the time because the code base is actually changing from under you every day.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259946" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Leven says that the company has continued to grow and develop since we last spoke at the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/codesee-launches-oss-port-open-source-project-to-help-developers-visualize-code-base/">their open source OSS Port</a> project last September, and that they are getting closer to releasing a paid version of the product, which is being tested with companies now.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CodeSee launches OSS Port open source project to help developers visualize code base&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/codesee-launches-oss-port-open-source-project-to-help-developers-visualize-code-base/embed/#?secret=IIscuzlogR" data-secret="IIscuzlogR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We are getting much closer to [completing] a teams and enterprise offering, which is what we are currently working on right now,&#8221; she said. They are also working on a new tool called Review Maps, which makes it easier to visualize changes to the code base in GitHub. Instead of an alphabetical list of the changed files, which doesn&#8217;t actually help understand how the files changed or how they relate to the whole, they get a map of the changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So when you go to make your meaningful contribution, like you&#8217;re going to go write your first pull request, which is your first code change, we can visualize your change in the context of the rest of your codebase.&#8221; This becomes even more crucial in large, complex projects where hundreds of changes are being pushed a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gets really daunting when you see a code review that has 600 files changed&#8230;and so what most people do when your code review gets that big is they just don&#8217;t review it. But with us you can, since now you can see your changes. You can zoom out to see the bigger picture. You can kind of see what kind of impact overall your change is going to have to the code base. And that is making developers really happy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 13 employees with plans to add five or six more this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneur John Roa believes in the value of privacy. After selling his design consultancy, ÄKTA, to Salesforce in 2015, he decided to spend a few years “off the grid” on an island in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he’s back in New York City, launching <a href="https://www.caden.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caden</a>, a startup that allows consumers to share their data with companies and get paid for it in return. Roa wrote the business plan in the form of a thesis on the future of data privacy while he was working at Salesforce, right before he began his sabbatical, he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he first wrote the business plan, it was “purely speculative,” Roa said. He anticipated that regulation would present challenges for companies in storing third-party, or passively collected, data, and envisioned a long-term shift to a “privacy-first” world where users own their personal data and have full control and consent over its use. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden, which just came out of stealth mode with a $3.4 million pre-seed round, is Roa’s attempt toward building this world. Jerry Yang, co-founder of TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company, Yahoo!, participated in the round alongside Starwood Capital’s Barry Sternlicht, former Citigroup CTO Don Callahan and other angel investors, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259849" style="width: 408px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259849" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2259849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="398" height="265" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg 5252w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Roa.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259849" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Caden founder John Roa.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Caden</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company calls itself a “zero-party” data platform, which means users share data with brands only on a voluntary basis. One of its core products is an encrypted “on-device vault” where a user can store their personal data and see insights drawn from it &#8212; a feature Roa compared to Spotify’s “Year in Review” but spanning a broader set of preferences and behaviors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden’s second core product is an API called Link, which allows users to connect to accounts like their e-mail or bank and extract their data to store in the vault. Once it’s in the vault, the user can then opt to give permission to specific companies they trust to use the data, and can revoke or alter the permissions at any time because users ultimately own their data stored with Caden, Roa said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roa’s team started working on the technology nine months ago, and plans to bring its beta mobile application to market in the next six months. It will allow users to immediately begin receiving compensation for their data, Roa said, likening the app to a savings account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of U.S. states have either passed or are considering legislation similar to the </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a state law enacted in 2018 that gives consumers the right to opt out of allowing companies to sell their personal information. Although companies have collected third-party data about their users for years, Roa said regulation is turning third-party data collection into “more of a liability than an asset” for companies because of onerous audit and compliance requirements. Zero-party data, he added, is more accurate and robust because it comes directly from the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden hopes to attract consumer brands first because they have the most to gain through better access to data, investor Jerry Yang told TechCrunch in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you think about how much effort and resources are required to collect and store data, infer insights, protect it, buy third-party data, and keep it all current, Caden is creating a platform solution that allows many companies to tap into without doing it themselves. Beyond the first phase, I’m confident that Caden can also go beyond consumer companies,” Yang wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caden isn’t the first company to make a foray into this space. Datacoup tried it back in 2012 with its platform that allowed users to sell their data directly to companies, and </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-andrew-yangs-plan-to-pay-you-for-your-data-doesnt-add-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ended up shutting down in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because users were only making paltry sums of money. Consumer data is difficult to value, and companies are incentivized to find ways to pay as little as possible for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roa believes Caden will be able to surmount these challenges by providing a superior user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While brands are not generally eager to give users their data back, Roa said, &#8220;now, they legally have to, but they don&#8217;t have to make it easy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What Caden and others are doing is devising ways to make that a much more streamlined process that is completely user-driven, so we don&#8217;t actually need the third-party companies to elicit that action back,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also wants to unlock intangible value for consumers through better brand experiences, not just direct payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If by using Caden your life just becomes a little more enjoyable, things are catered to you, and you&#8217;re being spoken to &#8212; it&#8217;s those value points that we&#8217;re focused on. And this is where a lot of our contemporaries have struggled,” Roa said.</span></p>

It will offer brands consumers &#8220;know and love,&#8221; according to Amazon, and an app will let you choose an item, size and color and send it directly to a fitting room or pickup counter. The first store is coming to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23676409011" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">The Americana at Brand</a> in Los Angeles sometime &#8220;later this year,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Amazon said it will offer &#8220;hundreds of brands&#8221; chosen by fashion creators and &#8220;feedback provided by millions of customers shopping on Amazon.com.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t specify which, but its online store currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/luxury/page/AFE3EE04-D5A9-4B33-868A-630812FC42CC?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sv__2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">carries</a> products from designers like Oscar de la Renta, Altuzarra and La Perla. However, many luxury and high-end brands have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-25-amazon-fashion.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">resisted</a> listing goods online with Amazon.</p>

<p>The stores will offer double the number of styles of traditional stores, while not forcing customers to search manually for the right size or color. Instead, if you see a clothing item you like, you can scan its QR code using the Amazon Shopping App to see sizes, colors, customer ratings and other details. You can then send it to the fitting room or directly to the pickup counter if you don&#8217;t need to try it on. As you might expect, it also uses an AI-powered algorithm to recommend more products based on what you&#8217;ve already picked.</p>
<p>You can open the fitting room door using the app, with all the items you&#8217;ve picked inside. Each one offers a touchscreen that lets you continue shopping and request new items to try on without having to leave. They&#8217;ll then arrive in &#8220;minutes&#8221; thanks to tech that Amazon also uses in its fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>You can feel free to buy items online that you found in the store, with the same prices in both places. Items can be returned in store, and any item you&#8217;ve scanned will be saved in the shopping app so you can revisit it later.</p>
<p>Amazon has already opened a number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-la-open-to-public-200248518.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Fresh grocery stores</a>, along with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-02-amazon-books-seattle.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">book stores</a> and even a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hair-salon-ar-color-bar-121013314.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">hair salon</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, a fintech unicorn known for its APIs that connect consumer bank accounts to financial applications, announced today that it is buying <a href="https://cognitohq.com/">Cognito</a>. The price is around $250 million, paid in a blend of cash and stock TechCrunch understands, though we couldn&#8217;t suss out the exact mix of each.</p>
<p>The deal highlights where Plaid is heading in its post-Visa form. Recall that the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">previously intended</a> to sell itself to the consumer credit giant before the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">deal ran into a regulatory wall</a>; since then Plaid has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/plaid-raises-425m-series-d-from-altimeter-as-it-charts-a-post-visa-future/">raised capital and expanded its valuation</a> by a factor of around four.</p>
<p>Cognito is an interesting buy for Plaid, offering verification services for the fintech world, which is distinct from what its acquirer is best known for. In practice, Cognito offers ID verification, along with help with thorny issues like know your customer (KYC) rules, and anti-money laundering requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259799" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you deal with money in motion, there&#8217;s work to do behind the scenes to ensure that your service is not facilitating nefarious activity, for example. (Unless, naturally, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-230696/">your company is named HSBC</a>.) By buying Cognito &#8212; the acquiring entity is bringing aboard all of the smaller firm&#8217;s staff, including its three co-founders &#8212; Plaid is layering more services atop its core remit of consumer bank account connections via developer hooks.</p>
<p>Plaid&#8217;s API work puts it in between consumers, and a host of financial applications and services. That&#8217;s a lucrative, important, and I would add sticky place to be &#8212; all good things for a business. But why merely shuttle data back and forth, when it is possible to do more?</p>
<p>Recall that Plaid bought another startup called Flannel last year, in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/plaid-moves-further-payments-march-acquihire-flannel-fintech-2021-6">what Insider described</a> as a push into the payments world; the company, flush with external cash and with equity worth north of $13 billion to use in deals, is adding to its roster of services that it can offer customers.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Plaid CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/zachperret">Zach Perret</a> and Cognito CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/alain">Alain Meier</a> (previously of <a href="https://t.co/IIZsk7uhZZ">Bloom</a>) about the transaction. Meier said that the talks started off as a chat about a partnership that evolved into a sale; per Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cognito-5ed4">data indicates that</a> Cognito raised single-digit millions while independent, meaning that its exit price was likely attractive to its investors and staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Plaid the deal makes sense from a number of angles. First, the issue of verifying users for fintech applications is, per Meier, an &#8220;extremely complex problem.&#8221; That means that Plaid can get past building all of what Cognito has thus far with its checkbook. And with Plaid customers asking for ways to more quickly onboard users per Perret, Plaid knew that it had customer demand for what the smaller company had built; buying Cognito means that Plaid can instantly layer on another service to its already growing customer base.</p>
<p>From that perspective, the deal is something akin to Microsoft acquiring an enterprise software company, knowing that it can sell its product via existing channels and customer relationships. By selling to Plaid, Cognito can likely scale its in-market footprint far more quickly than it could have by itself. Plaid, the company shared with TechCrunch via email, has around 5,500 customers today, a rich vein for Cognito to mine now under the larger company&#8217;s aegis.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Perret about where Plaid is heading from a product perspective. Our hunch, given the Cognito deal, was that it intends to build an ever-wider cadre of services that customers of its core product can add as they will to their existing contracts. As Cognito will be priced as an add-on, our thesis felt directionally correct.</p>
<p>The CEO noted that Plaid had launched a product called &#8220;Signal&#8221; <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/highlights-from-day-1-at-plaid-forum/">recently</a>, aimed at helping reduce fraud as an example of what the company has been working on in recent quarters. Plaid has also built a <a href="https://my.plaid.com/">consumer portal</a> where end-users can check their various connection points.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s illustrative. Plaid&#8217;s work to build more services atop its core product &#8212; which feels very similar to the product work that <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe has done</a> on top and adjacent to its payments nucleus &#8212; doesn&#8217;t appear to be merely a push to better support business customers. It has a consumer play in the mix as well. I would add at this juncture that the company remains, in our view, a firmly B2B company today.</p>
<p>Still, you can imagine what could be coming in the future. If consumers use Plaid as the de facto way to connect to the larger web of fintech and finservices products, and the company provides a central hub, or source of truth, it could build relationships with myriad individuals. That would give it sway on both ends of the fintech-user relationship, a powerful place to sit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that Plaid dreams big and uses its relationships on both sides of the app-user coin to do lots. Like, say, reinvent credit scoring. That would be a net-good for individuals everywhere.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Cognito deal is not the final acquisition that we anticipate from Plaid before its eventual public offering. More when we have it.</p>
