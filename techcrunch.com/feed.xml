										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based cannabis and digital health start-up Sanity Group has closed a $44.2M Series A financing round led by Swiss VC Redalpine along with US-based Navy Capital and SOJE Capital. GMPVC also participated in the round. This appears to be the largest round of cannabis funding in Europe to date and brings total investment in Sanity Group to $73M.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to expand the Group&#8217;s medical division in Europe as well as a EU-GMP-compliant research and production facility near Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Previous investors include HV Capital, TQ Ventures, Atlantic Food Labs, Cherry Ventures, Bitburger Ventures, and SevenVentures. In addition, Sanity Group has attracted celebrity angels including music producers will.i.am, Scooter Braun, and actress Alyssa Milano.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sanity’s cannabis-based platform is for mental health and chronic pain management, allowing the tracking of cannabis-based therapy digitally with a medical device. This tells customers how much of the active ingredient (THC, CBD or other cannabinoids) is being administered. This is then registered in a therapy diary.</p>
<p>Finn Age Hänsel, founder and managing director of Sanity Group said: &#8220;A round of this magnitude shows that cannabis is increasingly moving into the mainstream of investor awareness, and represents an important milestone in our business expansion on our way to becoming Europe&#8217;s leading cannabis company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over an interview, he added: &#8220;So we are fully legal and operated in Germany. We are just about to enter the Czech Republic and Poland. The UK is one of the biggest markets we want to enter going forward because, as you might know, the whole area of medical cannabis is slowly but surely opening all over Europe, with Germany being the largest market, about 80% of all the cannabis cannabinoid-based therapies today. But actually, the UK being the number two, which is a super attractive market for us but we look further into the Czech Republic and Poland, because those are the markets that have opened up from a regulatory perspective, at the most, over the last two years, and then France will open up next year, but that&#8217;s basically one after the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sean Stiefel, CEO at Navy Capital said: &#8220;The European cannabis market faces exciting developments in the coming months. Compared to the North American market, Europe is now where we were in the U.S. about four years ago. We want to bring our expertise and experience to the table. For our first investment in Europe, it was important for us to find a team that understands the market and has real industry experts in its ranks.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In March, Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-30/spotify-acquires-locker-room-and-announces-plans-for-a-new-live-audio-experience/">announced</a> it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">acquiring the company</a> behind the sports-focused audio app Locker Room to help speed its entry into the live audio market. Today, the company is making good on that deal with the <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-06-16/get-to-know-some-of-the-features-in-our-live-interactive-audio-offering-greenroom/">launch</a> of Spotify Greenroom, a new mobile app that allows Spotify users worldwide to join or host live audio rooms, and optionally turn those conversations into podcasts. It&#8217;s also announcing a <a href="http://greenroomcreatorfund.byspotify.com/">Creator Fund</a> which will help to fuel the new app with more content in the future.</p>
<p>The Spotify Greenroom app itself is based on Locker Room&#8217;s existing code. In fact, Spotify tells us, current Locker Room users will see their app update to become the rebranded and redesigned Greenroom experience, starting today.</p>
<p>Where Locker Room had used a white-and-reddish orange color scheme, the new Greenroom app looks very much like an offshoot from Spotify, having adopted the same color palette, font and iconography.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To join the new app, Spotify users will sign in with their current Spotify account information. They&#8217;ll then be walked through an onboarding experience designed to connect them with their interests.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166703" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166703" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2166703" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-05-Create-Room.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="481" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166703" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>For the time being, the process of finding audio programs to listen to relies primarily on users joining groups inside the app. That&#8217;s much like how Locker Room had operated, where its users would find and follow favorite sports teams. However, Greenroom&#8217;s groups are more general interest now, as it&#8217;s no longer only tied to sports.</p>
<p>In time, Spotify tells us the plan is for Greenroom to leverage Spotify&#8217;s personalization technology to better connect users to content they would want to hear. For example, it could send out notifications to users if a podcaster you already followed on Spotify went live on Spotify Greenroom. Or it could leverage its understanding of what sort of podcasts and music you listen to in order to make targeted recommendations. These are longer-term plans, however.</p>
<p>As for Spotify Greenroom&#8217;s feature set, it&#8217;s largely on par with other live audio offerings &#8212; including those from Clubhouse, Twitter (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Spaces</a>) and Facebook (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-hosts-first-test-of-live-audio-rooms-in-u-s/">Live Audio Rooms</a>). Speakers in the room appear at the top of the screen as rounded profile icons, while listeners appear below as smaller icons. There are mute options, moderation controls, and the ability to bring listeners on stage during the live audio session. Rooms can host up to 1,000 people, and Spotify expects to scale that number up later on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166705" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166705" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2166705" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-02-Join-Group.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="481" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166705" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Listeners can also virtually applaud speakers by giving them &#8220;gems&#8221; in the app &#8212; a feature that came over from Locker Room, too. The number of gems a speaker earned displays next to their profile image during a session. For now, there&#8217;s no monetary value associated with the gems, but that seems an obvious next step as Greenroom today offers no form of monetization.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting there are a few key differentiators between Spotify Greenroom and similar live audio apps. For starters, it offers a live text chat feature that the host can turn on or off whenever they choose. Hosts can also request the audio file of their live audio session after it wraps, which they can then edit to turn into a podcast episode.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly is that the live audio sessions are being recorded by Spotify itself. The company says this is for moderation purposes. If a user reports something in a Greenroom audio room, Spotify can go back to look into the matter, to determine what sort of actions may need to be taken. This is an area Clubhouse has struggled with, as its users have sometimes encountered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse">toxicity</a> and abuse in the app in real-time, including in troubling areas like<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/the-murky-world-of-moderation-on-clubhouse"> racism and misogyny.</a> Recently, Clubhouse said it had to shut down a number of rooms <a href="https://twitter.com/joinClubhouse/status/1383935475333820417">for antisemitism</a> and hate speech, as well.</p>
<p>Spotify says the moderation of Spotify Greenroom will be handled by its existing content moderation team. Of course, how quickly Spotify will be able react to boot users or shut down live audio rooms that are in violation of its Code of Conduct remains to be seen.</p>
<p>While the app launching today is focused on user-generated live audio content, Spotify has larger plans for Greenroom. Later this summer, the company plans to make announcements around programmed content &#8212; something it says is a huge priority &#8212; alongside the launch of other new features. This will include programming related to music, culture, and entertainment, in addition the to sports content Locker Room was known for.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166704" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166704" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2166704" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-03-Find-Upcoming-Room.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="481" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166704" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>The company also says it will be marketing Spotify Greenroom to artists through its Spotify for Artists channels, in hopes of seeding the app with more music-focused content. And it confirmed that monetization options for creators will come further down the road, too, but isn&#8217;t talking about what those may look like in specific detail for the moment.</p>
<p>In addition, Spotify is today announcing the Spotify Creator Fund, which will help audio creators in the U.S. generate revenue for their work. The company, however, declined to share any details on this front, either&#8211; like the size of fund, how much creators would receive, time frame for distributions, selection criteria or other factors. Instead, it&#8217;s only offering <a href="http://greenroomcreatorfund.byspotify.com/">a sign-up form</a> for those who may be interested in hearing more about this opportunity in the future. That may make it difficult for creators to weigh their options, when there are now so many.</p>
<p>Spotify Greenroom is live today on both iOS and Android across 135 markets around the world. That&#8217;s not quite the global footprint of Spotify itself, though, which is available in 178 markets. It&#8217;s also only available in the English language for the time being, but plans on expanding as it grows.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;s recent Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote was packed with new features for iPhones, Macs and iPads — and like it has done pretty consistently since the debut of its original &#8216;Health&#8217; app in 2014, those included updates focused on personal health and wellness. Often, it&#8217;s impossible to assess the impact of the work Apple is doing in these areas in the moment, and health-related feature announcements aren&#8217;t generally as splashy as user interface overhauls for Apple&#8217;s device software, for instance. But viewed as a whole, Apple has built probably the most powerful and accessible suite of personal health tools available to an individual, and it shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>I spoke with Apple Vice President of Technology Kevin Lynch who actually demonstrated the Apple Watch for the first time on the world stage during Apple&#8217;s September 2014 keynote event. Lynch has seen Apple Watch grow considerably during his time at the company, but he&#8217;s also been integral to the evolution of the its health initiatives. He explained how it became what it is today and provided some hints as to where it might go in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been amazing how much it&#8217;s evolved over time,&#8221; Lynch said, referring to the original Health app. &#8220;It actually started from Apple Watch, where we were capturing heart rate data for calorimetry activity, and [Activity] ring closure, and we needed a place to put the heart rate data. So we created the Health app as a place to store the data.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_1149129" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1149129" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1149129" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg 2144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple-watch-health.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1149129" class="wp-caption-text">Apple Health began as a simple companion app to store activity data from the Apple Watch in 2014.</p></div></p>
<p>From there, Lynch says Apple realized that once you had this centralized location, they could develop a system that could store other data types, as well, and create an API and architecture that allowed developers to store related data there, as well, in a privacy-respecting way. In the early days, the Health app was still essentially a passive storehouse, providing users one touchpoint for various health-related information, but the company soon began thinking more about what else it could offer, and inspiration came from users.</p>
<h3>User-guided evolution</h3>
<p>A key turning point for Apple&#8217;s approach to health came when the company saw that users were doing more with features available via the Apple Watch than the company ever intended, Lynch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were showing people their heart rate, and you could look at it — we were using it for calorimetry,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;But some users actually were looking at their heart rate when they weren&#8217;t working out, and noticed it was high. [&#8230;]They would go talk to their doctor, and the doctor would find a heart issue, and we would start getting letters about this. We still get letters today about our work in the space, which is amazing. But some of those early letters were clueing us into &#8216;Wait, we could actually look for that ourselves in the background.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple then developed its high heart rate alert notifications, which can tell users when Apple Watch detects an unusually high heart rate that occurs when they aren&#8217;t moving around very much. High resting heart rates are good indicators of potential issues, and Apple also later added notifications for unusually low heart rates. This was all data that was already available to the user, but Apple saw that it could proactively provide it to users, providing the benefits already enjoyed by the most vigilant of all Apple Watch owners.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166131" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/watchos7-series5-high-heart-rate-notification.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166131" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2166131" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/watchos7-series5-high-heart-rate-notification.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="607" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/watchos7-series5-high-heart-rate-notification.jpg 1350w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/watchos7-series5-high-heart-rate-notification.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/watchos7-series5-high-heart-rate-notification.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/watchos7-series5-high-heart-rate-notification.jpg?resize=768,455 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/watchos7-series5-high-heart-rate-notification.jpg?resize=680,403 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/watchos7-series5-high-heart-rate-notification.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2166131" class="wp-caption-text">Apple Watch introduced high heart rate notifications in 2017.</p></div></p>
<p>From there, Apple started investing more heavily in thinking about more areas where it could glean similar insights. Rather than waiting for user behavior to identify new areas to explore (though Lynch says that&#8217;s still important to the team), the company started hiring more clinicians and medical researchers to chart the path forward for Health.</p>
<p>One example of where that led was announced at WWDC: Walking steadiness, a new metric that provides a simple score of how stable a Watch wearer&#8217;s average gait is.</p>
<p>&#8220;Walking steadiness [&#8230;] actually came from fall detection,&#8221; Lynch said. We were working on fall detection, and and that&#8217;s been really awesome, but as we&#8217;re working on it, we&#8217;re brainstorming about how we can actually help people not fall, rather than just detecting that they fell. It&#8217;s pretty tricky to do that in the moment — there&#8217;s not much you could do once that&#8217;s actually happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynch is referring to the fall detection feature that Apple introduced in 2018, which could use motion sensor data to detect what was likely a sudden and severe fall, and provide emergency alerts to hopefully render aid to the wearer who had fallen. Apple was able to look at fall detection data for users in its 100,000-participant strong <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/apple-heart-and-movement-study">Heart and Movement study</a> and combine that with data gathered from the iPhone in the same study about walking metrics.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The Heart and Movement study data] has been super helpful in some of the work here on machine learning,&#8221; Lynch said. &#8220;And then we did a focus study of particularly around falls with walking steadiness, where we used [as] the source of truth a set of traditional measurements of walking steadiness; so questionnaires, clinical observation, people meeting with doctors and they&#8217;re observing the person walking. And then as over the period of a year or two, as people in that study happened to fall, we were able to look at all their metrics ahead of that and understand, &#8216;What are the real predictors here of potential fall?&#8217; Then we were able to build a model around that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apple actually accomplished something with its Walking Steadiness feature that is very rare in the health and fitness industry: It created a clinically validated, meaningful new metric around individual health. The Health app assigns a score from Very Low to Low or OK, based on motion-sensing data passively gathered through Apple&#8217;s iPhone sensors (the phone is better able to detect these metrics since it&#8217;s positioned on your hip, Lynch says). Perhaps best of all, according to Lynch, the data is actually something people can use to make real improvements.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other compelling thing is that it&#8217;s actionable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some of these things can be harder to change. But with walking steadiness, there are exercises you can do to improve your walking steadiness. And so we built those into the Health app. You can watch the videos and do the exercises and work to improve your steadiness ahead of falling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walking steadiness is perhaps the best expression yet of an area of increased focus for Apple when it comes to health: Turning the devices you carry with you into an ambient protector of sorts.</p>
<h3>&#8216;The Intelligent Guardian&#8217;</h3>
<p>Apple&#8217;s Health app provides a good overview of the metrics that you might want to keep track of, and the company has steadily built out a library of vetted contextual information to make it easier to understand what you&#8217;re seeing (including through new updated lab displays that translate results into plain language in iOS 15). But one of the areas where it&#8217;s in a unique position to innovate is in proactive or preventative health. Lynch pointed out that the walking steadiness feature is a progression of those efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The walking steadiness work is in this category that we think of as &#8216;Intelligent Guardian&#8217;; it&#8217;s &#8216;How can we help watch out for people with data that they may not otherwise be even looking at or aware of, and let them know of potential changes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lynch admits that the &#8216;Intelligent Guardian&#8217; category wasn&#8217;t something that was initially really part of the plan for Apple Watch and health.</p>
<p>In the early days, we weren&#8217;t as onto this line of thinking about &#8216;Intelligent Guardian, as we are now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those early letters were really inspiring in terms of [pointing out] we could actually let people know these things that are really meaningful.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166160" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fall-detection.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166160" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2166160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fall-detection.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fall-detection.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fall-detection.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fall-detection.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fall-detection.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fall-detection.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fall-detection.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2166160" class="wp-caption-text">Fal detection on Apple Watch.</p></div></p>
<p>Those letters still inspire the team working on health features and help motivate the team and validate their work. Lynch cites one Apple received where a person had purchased an Apple Watch for their father, and while his father was out biking he got thrown off the bike and fell into a gully. Apple Watch detected the fall, and also that he was unconscious, and the Watch was luckily set up to notify emergency contacts and 911, and did both. It provided the son with a location on a map, so his son rushed to the spot, but found paramedics on scene already loading his father (who ended up being okay) into an ambulance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, there&#8217;s a lot of thought that we put into &#8216;What are the other things that we could maybe sense about someone and let them know about?'&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our work on health very much involves this ongoing discussion of, from a clinical perspective, what is really interesting to know about somebody? Then from a science perspective, what do we think that we can sense about somebody? It&#8217;s this intersection of what might we be able to know and extract from the data that we gather, or are their new sensors that we might be able to build to get some data that could answer the questions that, clinically, we think would be really valid.&#8221;</p>
<h3>A community approach to individual health</h3>
<p>Another big change coming in iOS 15 for Apple Health is sharing. Apple will allow private, secure sharing of health data from users to loved ones and caregivers, including doctors. Users can choose exactly what health data to share, and can revoke access at any time. Apple itself never sees that data, and it&#8217;s encrypted locally on your device and then decrypted in local memory on the receiving device.</p>

<p>Health sharing is a natural extension of Apple&#8217;s work with the &#8216;Intelligent Guardian&#8217; since it elevates personal health care into what it always has been — something managed by a network of connected individuals — but augmented by modern technology and sensing capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other person you&#8217;re watching out for can see that information, and be notified of changes, and you can see a little dashboard of the data,&#8221; Lynch said. &#8220;That&#8217;s going to be super helpful, we hope, for people, especially as you&#8217;re caring for an older adult, or caring for a partner of yours — that&#8217;s going to basically enable people to do that kind of mutual support on their health journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynch points out that it&#8217;s not just about surfacing data that people might not otherwise find, but it&#8217;s actually about opening the door for more communication around health between families and personal networks that typically might never happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;It enables conversations, where maybe people wouldn&#8217;t maybe naturally talk about how much they&#8217;ve been walking lately or how their sleep&#8217;s been going,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re up for sharing that, then it can be a conversation that maybe you otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have had. And then it&#8217;s the same with doctor interactions; when you&#8217;re interacting with a doctor, they may not have a great view of your daily health. They have these little silo views of blood pressure at the time and stuff like that, so how can we help you tell your whole story when you&#8217;re talking with your doctor and make that conversation even richer than it would have been otherwise, in a very quick period of time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharing with a doctor relies on integrating with a healthcare provider&#8217;s electronic healthcare records (EHR) system, but Lynch notes that it&#8217;s using all interoperable standards to make this work, and they have a range of providers with large footprints in the U.S. already lined up to participate at launch. Healthcare professionals using this feature will be able to see data users share with them in a web view in their EHR system, and while that data is only shared ephemerally, they can easily annotate and store specific readings in their permanent EHR for a patient should they require it to back up a diagnosis or course of treatment.</p>
<p>I asked Lynch about the state of EHR, which has had a tricky history in terms of adoption and interoperability, and he said that it&#8217;s true that this is something they initially started working on years ago, at a time when making it work would have required a much more massive technical undertaking on Apple&#8217;s side to make it actually work. Luckily, the industry in general has been trending toward adopting more open standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;There really has been a change in how you can connect to the EHRs in a more standardized way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And certainly, we&#8217;ve been working with and across all of them to help get this mature.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Benefits of a long-term user relationship</h3>
<p>One of the biggest potential benefits for both users and their doctors of Apple Health is just how much data they can gain access to over time. Apple users who have stuck with the platform and used Health have now been tracking at least heart rate data for around seven years. That&#8217;s why another iOS 15 feature, Health Trends, has even more potential future impact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trends is looking at the longer term changes, and starting to identify what may be statistically significant changes in those areas,&#8221; Lynch explained. &#8220;There are about 20 areas that we&#8217;re starting with to do this, and if we start seeing those notable trends, then we can highlight those to you and show you how, for instance, your resting heart rates change now, you know, versus a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is once again the result of the Apple Heart and Movement study and the insights that the company continues to derive from that work. During the study, Apple focused a lot on how to fine-tune insight delivery, so as to ensure that it was providing users with information they could use, but at the same time avoiding any kind of overload or generating more confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you work on something like trends, we don&#8217;t want to overwhelm people with insights, if you will, but we also don&#8217;t want to like not have, you know, if there&#8217;s something relevant to show, we don&#8217;t want to suppress that. How do we tune that in? So we did a lot of that tuning with the data that we have in the Heart and Movement study, and we&#8217;re excited to see how it goes with the with public launch, and we&#8217;ll keep iterating on it. We think this is going to be a really powerful way for people to understand long-term changes.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The future is fusion</h3>
<p>Apple&#8217;s health story to date is largely one made up of realizations that the sensors the iPhone and Apple Watch carry, originally for other purposes, can provide tremendous insights into our health on a continuous basis — something that previously just hasn&#8217;t been possible or practical. That evolved into an intentional strategy of seeking out new sensor technologies to integrate into Watch and other Apple devices to address even more daily health concerns, and Apple continues to figure out new ways to use the sensors that are there already — the addition of respiratory rate measurement during sleep in iOS 15 is a prime example — while working on what new hardware comes next to do even more.</p>
<p>Perhaps one place to look for even more potential in terms of future health capabilities lies in sensor fusion, however. Walking steadiness is the result of not just the iPhone or the Apple Watch acting independently, but of what&#8217;s possible when the company can use them in combination. It&#8217;s another place where Apple&#8217;s tight integration of software and hardware give it an edge, and it multiplies as Apple&#8217;s ecosystem of devices, and the sensors they carry, continues to grow.</p>
<p>I ended our interview by asking Lynch about what kind of possibilities might open up when you consider that AirPods, too, contain their own sensors and gather different data that could complement that monitored by the iPhone and Apple Watch in terms of health.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already do sensor fusion across some devices today, and I think there&#8217;s all kinds of potential here,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With many consumers making the switch to online shopping in the last year due to Covid-19 and largely staying active on those platforms even after physical shops and the freedom to move about them have been restored, companies that are enabling those services are continuing to see a lot of business and attention. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.bringg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bringg</a>, which has built software to help retailers with last-mile logistics &#8212; specifically to manage, and in some cases even tap, people fulfilling deliveries &#8212; has raised $100 million in a Series E round of funding.</p>
<p>The money is coming about a year after its last round &#8212; a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/bringg-nabs-30m-to-expand-its-delivery-logistics-platform-used-by-walmart-and-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $30 million Series D</a> &#8212; and Bringg has confirmed that the funding values the company at $1 billion &#8212; representing a hike of about 4x on its previous valuation. Part of the reason for that has been the company&#8217;s strong growth of 180% in new customers over the last year, a high watermark for delivery services, given the pandemic.</p>
<p>Insight Partners is leading this round, and Salesforce Ventures, Viola Growth, Next 47, Pereg Ventures, Harlap, GLP and Cambridge Capital &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; are also investing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Guy Bloch, Bringg&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview that the funding will be used both to continue growing Bringg&#8217;s customer base, but also the company&#8217;s capabilities, and also likely for acquisitions to consolidate some of the links that go into the logistics and fulfillment chain.</p>
<p>Bringg has to date focused on the last mile &#8212; a critical area for retailers, commonly accounting for 30-40% of the total cost of delivering an item &#8212; but Bloch believes that there are other parts of the system that it could tackle alongside that.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim is to perfect the customer experience,&#8221; he said of the company&#8217;s strategy. &#8220;It’s not just the last mile but the middle mile. We have so many examples of that.&#8221; It&#8217;s also building out more options for its customers, including wider flexibility around delivery in-store, &#8220;greener&#8221; deliveries bundling several orders in one area, and more.</p>
<p>The company counts a number of huge companies among its list of current customers. They include Walmart, Albertsons, Co-Op in the UK, Coca-Cola and Panera.</p>
<p>With them and others, Bringg&#8217;s opportunity is a wide one. While some retailers, particularly larger ones, are &#8220;insourcing&#8221; in Bloch&#8217;s words, and building large operations to fulfill their own and third-party orders themselves, others &#8212; especially smaller companies &#8212; are looking for options of clicking into existing infrastructure, with not just logistics software, but perhaps even networks of delivery people to move their products. But in addition to that are the types of companies that Bringg is helping, a swathe of retailers that include not just groceries and goods, but ready made food from restaurants and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have amassed a large connected network over the years, millions of drivers,&#8221; said Bloch. &#8220;Every time we take on a new brand, it looks into our delivery hub and can see different variations depending on locations.&#8221; This enables customers to take blended offerings, too, to fill in gaps where they may lack their own people.</p>
<p>In that regard, Salesforce is a strategic backer here: as the CRM giant has grown, it&#8217;s extended its reach into providing a lot of different tools to its business customers, including e-commerce tools and management systems. Bringg is being integrated into that as part of its efforts to help businesses run their businesses.</p>
<p>Bringg is not the only company looking to build services to help other retailers jump into the new world of commerce. Others include the likes of Ocado, and of course Amazon and its vast network targeting businesses, and more. It&#8217;s an interesting company in the mix, however, simply for being completely neutral in the equation, with no direct to consumer services of its own.</p>
<p>“It’s clear to us that Bringg is building something special and we’re excited to partner with them as they continue to introduce transformative change for retailers and logistics partners,” said Jeff Horing, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Insight Partners, in a statement. “With Guy’s experience and leadership and a growing list of marquee customers, we’re confident that Bringg will continue to pave the way as the clear leader in the space.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, although Bringg will be looking to make acquisitions, Bloch said that the startup is &#8220;not entertaining&#8221; acquisition offers itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goal is to build a lasting company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Companies need our urgent help to do a job.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yet another SaaS startup, which began its journey in India, has attained the much coveted unicorn status. BrowserStack, a startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/browserstack-hauls-in-50-million-series-a-from-accel/">operates a giant software testing platform</a>, said on Wednesday it has raised $200 million in a new financing round that valued the 10-year-old firm at $4 billion.</p>
<p>BOND led the Dublin and San Francisco-headquartered startup&#8217;s Series B financing round, while Insight Partners and existing investor Accel participated in it. <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/press/browserstack-acquires-percy-visual-testing">BrowserStack</a>, which for the first six years of its journey didn’t raise any money and remains profitable, has raised $250 million to date.</p>
<p>As companies move to rapid development cycles they often don’t have the time to perform adequate testing. For instance, say Google is working to launch a new mobile app. The search giant will want to test the new app on thousands &#8212; if not tens of thousands &#8212; of different mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At present, even a company the size of Google will find it cumbersome to secure, store and maintain all those test devices. That’s where BrowserStack comes into play.</p>
<p>The startup has 15 data centers across the world and a repository of over 2,000 devices. BrowserStack, which began its journey in Mumbai, licenses its service to firms to let them remotely test their apps and websites on its devices, explained Nakul Aggarwal, co-founder and CTO of BrowserStack, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission has always been to help engineers build amazing products for their customers. Whenever they are developing an app or a website they have to ensure that it works across the fragmented ecosystem,&#8221; said Aggarwal, referring to various kinds of mobile devices, tablets, TVs, wearables and other platforms. &#8220;We are ensuring that engineers don&#8217;t have to worry about building their own in-house labs for devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google is not a hypothetical example. The Android-maker along with giants including Amazon, Microsoft, Twitter, Tesco, Ikea, Spotify, Expedia, and Trivago are among over 50,000 customers of BrowserStack. Over 60% of BrowserStack&#8217;s customers today are in the U.S.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166877" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166877" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2166877 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/browserstack-founders.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/browserstack-founders.jpeg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/browserstack-founders.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/browserstack-founders.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/browserstack-founders.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166877" class="wp-caption-text">BrowserStack founders Nakul Aggarwal and Ritesh Arora (BrowserStack)</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;As software continues to rewire everything, the bar on speed and quality continues to rise, and testing software across the expanding number of browsers and devices is a huge and expensive challenge for development teams to manage on their own,&#8221; said Jay Simons, General Partner at BOND, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;BrowserStack makes this simple and cost-effective, giving developers instant access to the widest range of browser and device configurations to test their applications. This product is an absolute boon for today&#8217;s web and app developers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until early 2018 when BrowserStack, which bootstrapped its way to profitability, first raised capital from an investor. Aggarwal said the founding team&#8217;s previous failed ventures made them more disciplined about money and it wasn&#8217;t until BrowserStack had assumed the market leading position and began scaling to new markets that it started to explore outside capital.</p>
<p>Aggarwal said BrowserStack wants to become the testing infrastructure of the internet and the new funds will help achieve that. &#8220;Every pull request that is getting raise, we want to become the infrastructure where it is getting tested,&#8221; he said. The startup, which recently acquired visual testing and review platform Percy, is open to more acquisition and acquihire opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our recent acquisition of Percy, a visual testing platform, was just the start. We will accelerate the rate at which we take new products to market through acquisitions and investment in our Product and Engineering teams. We want to achieve our vision of becoming the testing infrastructure for the internet,&#8221; said Ritesh Arora, co-founder and chief executive of BrowserStack.</p>
<p>BrowserStack joins a number of SaaS startups &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/chargebee-valued-at-1-4-billion-in-new-125-million-fundraise/">Chargebee</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-100-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/">Gupshup</a> &#8212; that began their journey in India and became a unicorn this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the past 18 months, employees have enjoyed increased flexibility, and ultimately a better work-life balance, as a result of the mass shift to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/remote-work/">remote working</a> necessitated by the pandemic. Most don’t want this arrangement, which brought an end to extensive commutes and superfluous meetings, to end: <a href="https://buffer.com/2021-state-of-remote-work">Buffer’s 2021 State of Remote Work</a> report shows over 97% of employees would like to continue working remotely at least some of the time.</p>
<p>Companies, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">some of the biggest names in tech</a>, appear to have a different outlook and are beginning to demand that staff start to return to the workplace.</p>
<p>While most of the reasoning around this shift back to the office centers around the need for collaboration and socialization, another reason your employer might say is that the office is more secure. After all, we’ve seen an unprecedented rise in cybersecurity threats during the pandemic, from phishing attacks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/what-you-need-to-know-about-covid-19-related-cyberattacks/">using Covid as bait</a> to ransomware attacks that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/fujifilm-becomes-the-latest-victim-of-a-network-crippling-ransomware-attack/">have crippled entire organizations</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/cc-sequoia-tessian/">Tessian</a> research shared with TechCrunch shows that while none of the attacks have been linked to staff working remotely, 56% of IT leaders believe their employees have picked up bad cybersecurity behaviors since working from home. Similarly, 70% of IT leaders believe staff will be more likely to follow company security policies around data protection and data privacy while working in the office.</p>
<p>“Despite the fact that this was an emerging issue prior to the pandemic I do believe many organizations will use security as an excuse to get people back into the office, and in doing so actually ignore the cyber risks they are already exposed to,” Matthew Gribben, a cybersecurity expert, and former GCHQ consultant, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“As we’ve just seen with the Colonial Pipeline attack, all it takes is one user account without MFA enabled to bring down your business, regardless of where the user is sat.”</p>
<p>Will Emmerson, CIO at Claromentis, has already witnessed some companies using cybersecurity as a ploy to accelerate the shift to in-person working. “Some organizations are already using cybersecurity as an excuse to get team members to get back into the office,” he says. “Often it’s large firms with legacy infrastructure that relies on a secure perimeter and that haven’t adopted a cloud-first approach.”</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;All it takes is one user account without MFA enabled to bring down your business, regardless of where the user is sat.&#8221;<br />
<cite>Matthew Gribben, former GCHQ consultant</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>The bigger companies can try to argue for a return to the traditional 9-to-5, but we’ve already seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/how-3-remote-friendly-tech-companies-plan-to-return-to-the-office/">a bunch of smaller startups embrace remote working</a> as a permanent arrangement. Rather, it will be larger and more risk-averse companies, says Craig Hattersley, CTO of cybersecurity startup SOC.OS, a BAE Systems spin-off, tells TechCrunch, who “begrudgingly let their staff work at home throughout the pandemic, so will seize any opportunity to reverse their new policies.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Although I agree that some companies will use the increase of cybersecurity threats to demand their employees go back to the office, I think the size and type of organization will determine their approach,” he says. “A lack of direct visibility of individuals by senior management could lead to a fear that staff are not fully managed.”</p>
<p>While some organizations will use cybersecurity as an excuse to get employees back into the workplace, many believe the traditional office is no longer the most secure option. After all, not only have businesses overhauled cybersecurity measures to cater to dispersed workforces over the past year, but we’ve already seen hackers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/hackers-phishing-post-covid-office/">start to refocus their attention on those returning to the post-COVID office</a>.</p>
<p>“There is no guarantee that where a person is physically located will change the trajectory of increasingly complex cybersecurity attacks, or that employees will show a reduction in mistakes because they are sitting within the walls of an office building,” says Dr. Margaret Cunningham, principal research scientist at Forcepoint.</p>
<p>Some businesses will attempt to get all staff back into the workplace, but this is simply no longer viable: as a result of 18 months of home-working, many employees have moved away from their employer, while others, having found themselves more productive and less distracted, will push back against five days of commutes every week. In fact, a recent study shows that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/return-to-office-employees-are-quitting-instead-of-giving-up-work-from-home?sref=lAVQtUwz">almost 40% of U.S. workers</a> would consider quitting if their bosses made them return to the office full time.</p>
<p>That means most employers will have to, whether they like it or not, embrace a hybrid approach going forward, whereby employees work from the office three days a week and spend two days at home, or vice versa.</p>
<p>This, in itself, makes the cybersecurity argument far less viable. Sam Curry, chief security officer at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybereason/">Cybereason</a>, tells TechCrunch: “The new hybrid phase getting underway is unlike the other risks companies encountered.</p>
<p>“We went from working in the office to working from home and now it will be work-from-anywhere. Assume that all networks are compromised and take a least-trust perspective, constantly reducing inherent trust and incrementally improving. To paraphrase Voltaire, perfection is the enemy of good.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small businesses have traditionally been underserved when it comes to IT &#8212; they are too big and have too many requirements that can&#8217;t be met by consumer products, yet are much too small to afford, implement or thoroughly need apps and other IT build for larger enterprises. But when it comes to neobanks, it feels like there is no shortage of options for the SMB market, nor venture funding being invested to help them grow.</p>
<p>In the latest development, <a href="https://banknovo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Novo</a>, a neobank that has built a service targeting small businesses, has closed a round of $40.7 million, a Series A that it will be using to continue growing its business, and its platform.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Valar Ventures with Crosslink Capital, Rainfall Ventures, Red Sea Ventures, and BoxGroup all also participating. The startup is not disclosing valuation but Novo &#8212; originally founded in New York in 2018 but now based out of Miami &#8212; has racked up 100,000 SMB customers &#8212; which it defines as businesses that make between $25,000 and $100,000 in annualized revenues &#8212; and has seen $1 billion in lifetime transactions, with growth accelerating in the last couple of years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a wide variety of options for small businesses these days when it comes to going for a banking solution. They include staying with traditional banks (which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/10x-a-uk-fintech-raises-187m-to-build-new-services-for-old-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting to add an increasing number of services</a> and perks to retain small business customers), as well as a variety of fintechs &#8212; other neobanks, like Novo &#8212; that are building banking and related financial tools to cater to startups and other small businesses.</p>
<p>Just doing a quick search, some of the others targeting the sector include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rho-a-startup-bank-aimed-at-high-growth-businesses-raises-15m-series-a-led-by-m13-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rho</a>, <a href="http://northone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NorthOne</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/lili-a-neobank-aimed-at-freelancers-raises-55m-as-it-passes-200k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lili</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/mercury-banks-20m-for-its-banking-service-aimed-at-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brex</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hatch-a-neobank-for-smbs-launches-with-20m-in-funding-from-investors-like-kleiner-perkins-foundation-and-plaids-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatch</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/uks-anna-raises-21m-for-its-smb-focused-business-account-and-tax-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uks-tide-raises-14m-to-challenge-big-banks-with-a-mobile-first-service-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tide</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/greeces-viva-wallet-raises-80m-for-its-neo-bank-targeting-small-business-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viva Wallet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/indias-open-neo-bank-raises-30-million-to-help-businesses-automate-their-finances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open</a>, and many more (and you could argue also players like Amazon, offering other money management and spending tools similar to what neobanks are providing). Some of these are not in the U.S., and some are geared more at startups, or freelancers, but taken together they speak to the opportunity and also the attention that it is getting from the tech industry right now.</p>
<p>As CEO and co-founder Michael Rangel &#8212; who hails from Miami &#8212; described it to me, one of the key differentiators with Novo is that it&#8217;s approaching SMB banking from the point of view of running a small business. By this, he means that typically SMBs are already using a lot of other finance software &#8212; on average seven apps per business &#8212; to manage their books, payments and other matters, and so Novo has made it easier by way of a &#8220;drag and drop&#8221; dashboard where an SMB can integrate and view activity across all of those apps in one place. There are &#8220;dozens&#8221; of integrations currently, he said, and more are being added.</p>
<p>This is the first step, he said. The plan is to build more technology so that the activity between different apps can also be monitored, and potentially automated</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re able to see this is your balance and what you should expect,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The next frontier is to marry the incoming with outgoing. We&#8217;re using the funding to build that, and it&#8217;s on the roadmap in next six months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Novo has yet to bring cash advances or other lending products into its platform, although those too are on the roadmap, but it is also listening to its customers and watching what they want to do on the platform &#8212; another reason why it&#8217;s clever to make it easy to for those customers to integrate other services into Novo: not only does that solve a pain point for the customer, but it becomes a pretty clear indicator of what customers are doing, and how you could better cater to that.</p>
<p>Listening to the customers is in itself becoming a happy challenge, it seems. Novo launched quietly enough &#8212; between 2018 and the end of 2019, it had picked up only 5,000 accounts. But all that changed during 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic, which Rangel describes as &#8220;just hockey stick growth. We grew like crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason, he said, is a classic example of why incumbent banks have to catch up with the times. Everyone was locked down at home, and suddenly a lot of people who were either furloughed or laid off were &#8220;spinning up businesses,&#8221; he said, and that led to many of them needing to open bank accounts. But those who tried to do this with high-street banks were met with a pretty significant barrier: you had to go into the bank in person to authenticate yourself, but either the banks were closed, or people didn&#8217;t want to travel to them. That paved the way for Novo (and others) to cater to them.</p>
<p>Its customer numbers shot up to 24,000 in the year.</p>
<p>Then other market forces have also helped it. You might recall that banking app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/bbva-says-that-it-is-shutting-down-banking-app-simple-will-transfer-users-to-bbva-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simple was shut down by BBVA</a> ahead of its merger with PNC; but at the same time, it also shut down Azlo, it&#8217;s small business banking service. That led to a significant number of users migrating to other services, and Novo got a huge windfall out of that, too.</p>
<p>In the last six months, Novo grew four-fold, and Rangel attributed a lot of that to ex-Azloans looking for a new home.</p>
<p>The fact that there are so many SMB banking providers out there might mean competition, but it also means fragmentation, and so if a startup emerges that seems to be catching on, it&#8217;s going to catch something else, too: the eye of investors.</p>
<p>“The ability of the Novo team to grow the company rapidly during a year where businesses have faced unprecedented challenges is impressive,” said Andrew McCormack, founding partner at Valar Ventures, the firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, another big figure in fintech. “Novo tripled its small business customer base in the first half of 2021! Their custom infrastructure and banking platform put them in prime position to expand their services at an even faster pace as we come out of the health crisis. All of us at Valar Ventures are excited to join this team.”</p>

<p>While that may sound pretty obscure the case essentially loops in the entire &#8216;data industrial complex&#8217; of adtech players, large and small, which make money by profiling Internet users and selling access to their attention &#8212; from giants like Google and Facebook to other household names (the ICCL&#8217;s <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/press-announcement-rtb-lawsuit/">PR </a>also name-checks Amazon, AT&amp;T, Twitter and Verizon, the latter being the parent company of TechCrunch &#8212; presumably because all participate in online ad auctions that can use RTB); as well as the smaller (typically non-household name) adtech entities and data brokers which also also involved in handling people&#8217;s data to run high velocity background auctions that target behavioral ads at web users.</p>
<p>The driving force behind the lawsuit is Dr Johnny Ryan, a former adtech insider turned whistleblower who&#8217;s now a senior fellow a the ICCL &#8212; and who has dubbed RTB the biggest data breach of all time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He points to the <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/audience-taxonomy/">IAB Tech Lab&#8217;s audience taxonomy documents</a> which provide codes for what can be extremely sensitive information that&#8217;s being gathered about Internet users, based on their browsing activity, such as political affiliation, medical conditions, household income, or even whether they may be a parent to a special needs child.</p>
<p>The lawsuit contends that other industry documents vis-a-vis the ad auction system confirm there are no technical measures to limit what companies can do with people&#8217;s data, nor who they might pass it on to.</p>
<p>The lack of security inherent to the RTB process also means other entities not directly involved in the adtech bidding chain could potentially intercept people&#8217;s information &#8212; when it should, on the contrary, be being protected from unauthorized access, per EU law&#8230;</p>

<p>Ryan and others have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/google-and-iab-adtech-targeted-in-latest-batch-of-rtb-privacy-complaints/">filing formal complaints against RTB security issue for years</a>, arguing the system breaches a core principle of Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which requires that personal data be &#8220;processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security&#8230; including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss&#8221; &#8212; and which, they contend, simply isn&#8217;t possible given how RTB functions.</p>
<p>The problem is that Europe&#8217;s data protection agencies have failed to act. Which is why Ryan, via the ICCL, has decided to take the more direct route of filing a lawsuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t many DPAs around the union that haven&#8217;t received evidence of what I think is the biggest data breach of all time but it started with the UK and Ireland &#8212; neither of which took, I think it&#8217;s fair to say, any action. They both said they were doing things but nothing has changed,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, explaining why he&#8217;s decided to take the step of litigating.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to take the most efficient route to protection people&#8217;s rights around data,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Per Ryan, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has still not sent a statement of issues relating to the RTB complaint he lodged with them back in 2018 &#8212; so <em>years</em> later. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">May 2019</a> the DPC did announce it was opening a formal investigation into Google&#8217;s adtech, following the RTB complaints, but the case remains open and unresolved. (We&#8217;ve contacted the DPC with questions about its progress on the investigation and will update with any response.)</p>
<p>Since the GDPR came into application in Europe in May 2018 there has been growth in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/">privacy lawsuits </a> &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/uk-privacy-class-action-complaint-against-google-gets-unblocked/">class action style suits</a> &#8212; so litigation funders may be spying an opportunity to cash in on the growing enforcement gap left by resource-strapped and, well, risk-averse data protection regulators.</p>
<p>A similar complaint about RTB lodged with the UK&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) also led to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">lawsuit being filed last year</a> &#8212; albeit in that case it was against the watchdog itself for failing to take any action. (The ICO&#8217;s last missive to the adtech industry<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/uk-resumes-privacy-oversight-of-adtech-warns-platform-audits-are-coming/"> told it to &#8212; uhhhh &#8212; expect audits</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The GDPR was supposed to create a situation where the average person does not need to wear a tin-foil hat, they do not need to be paranoid or take action to become well informed. Instead, supervisory authorities protect them. And these supervisory authorities &#8212; paid for by the tax payer &#8212; have very strong powers. They can gain admission to any documents and any premises. It&#8217;s not about fines I don&#8217;t think, just. They can tell the biggest most powerful companies in the world to stop doing what they&#8217;re doing with our data. That&#8217;s the ultimate power,&#8221; says Ryan. &#8220;So GDPR sets up these guardians &#8212; these potentially very empowered guardians &#8212; but they&#8217;ve not used those powers&#8230; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re acting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do wish that I&#8217;d litigated years ago,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;There&#8217;s lots of reasons why I didn&#8217;t do that &#8212; I do wish, though, that this litigation was unnecessary because supervisory authorities protected me and you. But they didn&#8217;t. So now, as Irish politics like to say in the middle of a crisis, we are where we are. But this is &#8212; hopefully &#8212; several nails in the coffin [of RTB&#8217;s use of personal data].&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The lawsuit has been filed in Germany as Ryan says they&#8217;ve been able to establish that IAB Tech Labs &#8212; which is NY-based and has no official establishment in Europe &#8212; has representation (a consultancy it hired) that&#8217;s based in the country. Hence they believe there is a clear route to litigate the case at the Landgerichte, Hamburg.</p>
<p>While Ryan has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/how-a-small-french-privacy-ruling-could-remake-adtech-for-good/">indefatigably sounding the alarm about RTB</a> for years he&#8217;s prepared to clock up more mileage going direct through the courts to see the natter through.</p>
<p>And to keep hammering home his message to the adtech industry that it must clean up its act and that recent attempts to maintain the privacy-hostile status quo &#8212; by trying to <a href="https://www.responsibleaddressablemedia.com/pram-launch-release">rebrand and repackage the same old data shuffle</a> under shiny new claims of &#8216;privacy&#8217; and &#8216;responsibility&#8217; &#8212; simply won&#8217;t wash. So the message is really: Reform or die.</p>
<p>&#8220;This may very well end up at the ECJ [European Court of Justice]. And that would take a few years but long before this ends up at the ECJ I think it&#8217;ll be clear to the industry now that it&#8217;s time to reform,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>IAB Tech Labs has been contacted for comment on the ICCL&#8217;s lawsuit.</p>
<p>Ryan is by no means the only person sounding the alarm over adtech. Last year the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">European Parliament called for tighter controls on behavioral ads</a> to be baked into reforms of the region&#8217;s digital rules &#8212; calling for regulation to favor less intrusive, contextual forms of advertising which do not rely on mass surveillance of Internet users.</p>
<p>While even Google has said it wants to depreciate support for tracking cookies in favor of a new stack of technology proposals that it dubs &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; (although its proposed alternative &#8212; targeting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">groups of Internet users based on interests</a> derived from tracking their browsing habits &#8212; has been criticized as potentially amplifying problems of predatory and exploitative ad targeting, so may not represent a truly clean break with the rights-hostile adtech status quo).</p>
<p>The IAB is also facing another major privacy law challenge in Europe &#8212; where complaints against a widely used framework it designed for websites to obtain Internet users&#8217; consent to being tracked for ads online led to scrutiny by Belgium&#8217;s data protection agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">Last year </a>its investigatory division found that the IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) fails to meet the required standards of data protection under the GDPR.</p>
<p>The case went in front of the litigation chamber <a href="https://twitter.com/Jausl00s/status/1403329423819018241">last week</a>. A verdict &#8212; and any enforcement action by the Belgian DPA over the IAB Europe&#8217;s TCF &#8212; remains pending.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot of the focus in recruitment these days has been on better technology to connect people to job opportunities at new organizations, but that also leaves a wide opening to focus on one of the other big funnels for finding work: internal transfers. Today, a startup that is building tools to improve that experience is announcing a big round of funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gloat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gloat</a>, which has built an AI-based platform that it sells to organizations to power their internal job boards, has picked up $57 million in funding, money that it will be using both to continue both for business development, but also to continue adding more features to its own platform, for example to expand deeper into openings for contractors and to open up more opportunities for secondments at other businesses, and to extend into front-line positions alongside the knowledge worker roles for which the AI is currently optimized &#8212; in short, to improve career agility for people embedded at, and valued by, an organization, who may want to explore opportunities there instead of, or even alongside, looking elsewhere.</p>
<p>Accel is leading this Series C round, with previous backers Eight Roads (a part of Fidelity), Intel Capital, Magma Venture Partners, and PICO Partners also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gloat is not (ahem) gloating about its valuation, but we understand that it is in the region of around $400 million (but note, it&#8217;s a wide region so might be as low as $300 million or as high as $500 million: we&#8217;ll update when and if we learn more). The Tel Aviv-based startup has raised $92 million to date and counts big companies like Unilever, Pepsi, MetLife, HSBC and ADP among its customers.</p>
<p>Ben Reuveni, Gloat&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the business with Amichai Schreiber and Danny Shteinberg, said he got the idea for the company while working as an engineer focusing on storage at IBM after IBM acquired a smaller company where he was working. This was his first job after spending time in the Israel&#8217;s IDF, and so after six years of working first for the startup and then IBM in effectively a similar role, he had itchy feet and wanted to do more.</p>
<p>But the problem, he said, was that although IBM did have internal job boards, it was hard to see how his expertise mapped on to the opportunities that were available. And that is before you consider the interface or any of the other aspects of user experience of using these tools. On top of this, when you are considering large enterprises the size of IBM, chances are that they are not focusing too much on individualized career development or talent retention for most people at the lower end of the wider pay scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really had only two options available to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Look for new jobs outside the company, or try to look internally. The fact was that exploring outside was easier than looking internally.&#8221;</p>
<p>It turns out that his experience was not unique. Internal job boards, he said, typically have atrocious engagement, in the single-digit percentage of staff.</p>
<p>Reuveni eventually did move on from IBM, to start Gloat. The company&#8217;s central premise is to build a job board tool that it sells to bigger enterprises &#8212; the kind that employ thousands of people and already have job boards &#8212; so that they can better hold on to talent rather than losing it to others because they &#8212; the employee and the employer &#8212; haven&#8217;t found the right role for a particular person who wants to switch gears.</p>
<p>It does this first of all by way of making the barrier to using Gloat very low: it initially can be integrated with whatever recruiting software or tools that an organization might already be using to source and internally advertise their job openings, which it then channels through its system and algorithm.</p>
<p>Secondly, it starts to build profiles not just of jobs, but of people in the organization and the skills that they have to match with those jobs. That is to say, Gloat&#8217;s taken what has typically been a very one-sided, and one-directional effort and turned it into one that goes both ways. To source information on employees &#8212; who can signal to Gloat that they would like to look for new opportunities &#8212; it looks at employment records, resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and perhaps a little input from the employee directly: all of this is ingested into its AI to help match a person to openings.</p>
<p>In cases where those skills are not quite right for what an employee wants to do, they get guidance on what they need to learn, and might also get options for &#8220;part-time&#8221; work within the organization where they can pick up experience they may still lack. (This is not unlike the career development tools that LinkedIn has built to bolster job hunting on its platform.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the department looking for a new person is getting sent referrals through the system, but it can also proactively use the Gloat database to find people to tap.</p>
<p>All of this is interesting but it leaves out a tricky variable, in the form of a manager.</p>
<p>What if you are working in a tense environment or simply don&#8217;t get along with the person to whom you directly report? Or what if the manager is possessive and doesn&#8217;t want to encourage you to leave? Considering that management is often evaluated not just on their own performance but on how well their teams do, it can be a risk to lose someone good.</p>
<p>Gloat&#8217;s system requires managers to endorse a worker as part of the process, so while some might be genuinely happy to see people they value continue to go upwards and onwards, couldn&#8217;t that also blow up this whole system in a bad way in those other cases?</p>
<p>Reuveni brushed that scenario aside when I brought it up, describing Gloat as a &#8220;win win situation&#8221; for managers, too, who will be motivated to help because the platform helps them find the right replacements. &#8220;Every manager can open a part-time project or internal job with their product,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not fully convinced that may always be the case. But on the other hand, if you&#8217;re in a tough situation in your current placement, maybe looking at other organizations, or just using the more standard job board approach (which remains active, from what I understand), both would be better options anyway.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the company is looking to keep stretching the concept of &#8220;internal hires&#8221; into a much wider set of circumstances.</p>
<p>That will include providing openings to existing contractors looking for new contract roles when their current assignments end; or moving from a company to a similar role at another organization, as long as it&#8217;s non-competitive with your current employer (something that also comes up, Reuveni said, when a company is conducting a mass restructuring and is attempting to help affected employees find jobs elsewhere); or providing more analytics to HR teams, managers and other higher-ups who want a better look at the state of talent at their companies.</p>
<p>With talent retention and brain drain continuing to be big issues in a number of industries, it seems like a ripe time to address all of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;As companies are adapting their workforces to be more flexible and take advantage of remote workers, new tools are needed to optimise productivity and ensure equality of opportunities,&#8221; said Philippe Botteri, Partner at Accel, in a statement. “Gloat pioneered the Talent Marketplace to solve that, and it’s now becoming a strategic tool for global enterprises. Some of the world’s largest, most forward-looking companies are benefiting from the workforce agility enabled by Gloat’s AI-powered platform. The Accel team is looking forward to partnering with Gloat on the next stage of its journey, bringing this fundamentally new way of developing talent and managing work to every global enterprise.”</p>

<p>The automaker said Wednesday that the Polestar 3 will be assembled at a plant shared with Volvo Cars at a factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina. The Polestar 3 follows the all-electric Polestar 2 sedan and the hybrid grand tourer Polestar 1. Production of Polestar 3 is expected to begin globally in 2022.</p>
<p>Polestar COO Dennis Nobelius said production in the U.S. will reduce delivery times, the environmental impact associated with shipping vehicles around the world and the price of the Polestar 3.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;All of this makes the brand even more competitive in the critical American sales market,&#8221; Nobelius said.</p>
<p>Polestar also plans to open around 25 retail spaces in the United States this year, where customers can take test drives, free pick-up and delivery servicing and mobile service.</p>
<p>The Polestar 3 is being built for U.S. customers, making this the first vehicle from the brand to be manufactured in the country. The announcement comes two months since Polestar raised $550 million in its first external round led by Chongqing Chengxing Equity Investment Fund Partnership, Zibo Financial Holding and Zibo Hightech Industrial Investment. SK Inc., the South Korean global conglomerate, and a range of other investors also participated.</p>
<p>Polestar was once a high-performance brand under Volvo Cars. In 2017, the company was recast as an electric performance brand aimed at producing exciting and fun-to-drive electric vehicles &#8212; a niche that Tesla was the first to fill and has dominated ever since. Polestar is jointly owned by Volvo Car Group and Zhejiang Geely Holding of China. Volvo was acquired by Geely in 2010.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Polestar has opened a manufacturing facility in China, built a global sales and distribution operation, and launched two vehicles, the Polestar 1 and the all-electric Polestar 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Templafy.com">Templafy</a>, a Denmark-born B2B SaaS platform that does business document creation, has raised a $60 million D round of funding led by Blue Cloud Ventures. All previous investors also participated, including Insight Partners, Seed Capital, Dawn Capital and Damgaard Company. Templafy has now raised a total of $125 million.</p>
<p>To some extent, Templafy competes with PandaDoc. However, founder Christian Lund, told me: “The platform that we&#8217;ve built is very enterprise focused, so it is agnostic to use case. It’s really about helping employees produce pretty much any type of business document or content that they need to have, allow them to start from any application where they work. It might be Office or Google but it could also be Salesforce or teams or slack. Others are very vertically focused against particular use cases for example around sales. We are horizontally focused and helping out on a series of use cases across large enterprises.”</p>
<p>Mir Arif, Managing Partner at Blue Cloud Ventures said: “Templafy is solving an all-too-common, yet frequently overlooked problem for organizations: disconnected content. While the term may be new, the problem itself is not. When company content isn’t integrated to the applications where employees work, organizations experience disconnected content which can cause several damaging issues including loss of compliance, a drag on efficiency and ultimately a negative impact on business performance. The ambition to solve disconnected content for all enterprises combined with a ripe market, an operationally strong team and a powerful, user-friendly platform makes Templafy an exemplary partner.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Templafy’s <a href="https://info.templafy.com/blog/templafy-raises-25m-to-continue-scaling-globally">Series C round of $25 million</a> was 14 months ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Amazon continues to expand its self-service, computer-vision-based grocery checkout technology by bringing it <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-fresh-grocery-store-meet-just-walk-out-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to bigger stores</a>, an AI startup out of Israel that&#8217;s built something to rival it has picked up funding and a new strategic investor as a customer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trigo.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trigo</a>, which has produced a computer vision system that includes both camera hardware and encrypted, privacy-compliant software to enable &#8220;grab and go&#8221; shopping &#8212; where customers can pick up items that get automatically detected and billed before they leave the store &#8212; has bagged $10 million in funding from German supermarket chain REWE Group and Viola Growth.</p>
<p>The exact amount of the investment was not being disclosed (perhaps because $10 million, in these crazy times, suddenly sounds like a modest amount?), but Pitchbook notes that Trigo had up to now raised $87 million, and Trigo has confirmed that it has now raised &#8220;over $100 million,&#8221; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/trigo-raises-22m-for-an-automated-grocery-check-out-platform-similar-to-amazon-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A</a> in 2019, and a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201221005337/en/Trigo-Raises-60M-to-Scale-Its-Frictionless-Checkout-Grocery-Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $60 million</a> that it raised in December of last year. The company has confirmed that the amount raised is $10 million today, and $104 million in total.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation. We have asked and will update as we learn more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trigo is immensely proud and honored to be deepening its strategic partnership with REWE Group, one of Europe’s biggest and most innovative grocery retailers,&#8221; said Michael Gabay, Trigo co-founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;REWE have placed their trust in Trigo’s privacy-by-design architecture, and we look forward to bringing this exciting technology to German grocery shoppers. We are also looking forward to working with Viola Growth, an iconic investment firm backing some of Israel’s top startups.”</p>
<p>The REWE investment is part of a bigger partnership between the two companies, which will begin with a new &#8220;grab and go&#8221; REWE store in Cologne. REWE has 3,700 stores across Germany, so there is a lot of scope there for expansion. REWE is Trigo&#8217;s second strategic investor: Tesco has also backed the startup and <a href="https://retailanalysis.igd.com/news/news-article/t/tesco-launches-trial-of-check-out-free-shopping/i/22554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been trialling its technology</a> in the U.K.. Trigo&#8217;s also being used by Shufersal, a grocery chain in Israel.</p>
<p>REWE&#8217;s investment comes amid a spate of tech engagements by the grocery giant, which recently also announced a partnership with Flink, a new grocery delivery startup out of Germany that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently raised a big round of funding to expand</a>. It&#8217;s also working with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/yamo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yamo</a>, a healthy eating startup; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/whisks-a-i-powered-recipe-app-lets-you-send-the-ingredients-to-your-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whisk</a>, an AI powered buy-to-cook startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;With today’s rapid technological developments, it is crucial to find the right partners,&#8221; said Christoph Eltze, Executive Board Member Digital, Customer &amp; Analytics REWE Group. &#8220;REWE Group is investing in its strategic partnership with Trigo, who we believe is one of the leading companies in computer vision technologies for smart stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>More generally, consumer habits are changing, fast. Whether we are talking about the average family, or the average individual, people are simply not shopping, cooking and eating in the same way that they were even 10 years ago, let alone 20 or 30 years ago.</p>
<p>And so like many others in the very established brick-and-mortar grocery business, REWE &#8212; founded in 1927 &#8212; is hoping to tie up with some of the more interesting innovators to better keep ahead in the game.</p>
<p>“I don’t actually think people really want grocery e-commerce,” Ran Peled, Trigo&#8217;s VP of marketing, told me back in 2019. “They do that because the supermarket experience has become worse with the years. We are very much committed to helping brick and mortar stores return to the time of a few decades ago, when it was fun to go to the supermarket. What would happen if a store could have an entirely new OS that is based on computer vision?”</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how widely used and &#8220;fun&#8221; smart checkout services will become in that context, and whether it will be a winner-takes-all market, or whether we&#8217;ll see a proliferation of others emerge to provide similar tools.</p>
<p>In addition to Amazon and Trigo, there is also Standard Cognition, which earlier this year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/amazon-go-rival-bets-pandemic-bolstered-case-for-cashierless-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised money at a $1 billion valuation</a>, among others and other approaches. One thing that more competition could mean is also more competitive pricing for systems that otherwise could prove costly to implement and run except for in the busiest locations.</p>
<p>There is also a bigger question over what the optimal size will be for cashierless, grab-and-go technology. Trigo cites data from Juniper Research that forecasts <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/smart-checkout-technologies-to-process-$387-bn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$400 billion</a> in smart checkout transactions annually by 2025, but it seems that the focus in that market will likely be, in Juniper&#8217;s view, on smaller grocery and convenience stores rather than the cavernous cathedrals to consumerism that many of these chains operate. In that category, the market size is 500,000 stores globally, 120,000 of them in Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars wants to be climate-neutral by 2040, and it has set its sights on a major vehicle component that’s notoriously difficult to decarbonize: steel. The automaker has partnered with Swedish company SSAB, which manufactures “fossil-free” steel, for a limited amount of the material to be used in a concept car as early as 2025.</p>
<p>A climate-neutral car is considered by many to be a moonshot goal, not least because of the challenge in decarbonizing components like steel. The steel industry, which sits at the heart of industrialized economies, accounts for around 8% of worldwide carbon emissions. In vehicles, steel and iron production amount to around 35% of emissions in an internal combustion engine vehicle and 20% in a battery electric car.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s steel, it&#8217;s aluminum and it’s factories,” Volvo’s head of procurement Kerstin Enochsson explained to TechCrunch. “If we are solving the supply chains and making those supply chains much more sustainable, we are solving the absolute vast majority of the CO<sub>2</sub> issues with cars.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Recent innovations in green hydrogen production mean that fossil-free steel may soon become a reality. SSAB has developed a process to make steel using hydrogen, rather than coal. The hydrogen is produced via electrolysis, a process that uses renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>The steel will be produced at a pilot plant in Luleå, Sweden. The plant was started by SSAB under its HYBRIT initiative, a joint venture with Swedish utility Vattenfall and mining company LKAB. SSAB said it hopes to become a commercial-scale supplier of decarbonized steel by 2026.</p>
<p>Once it receives the material, Volvo will perform tests on its characteristics, such as its durability and heat resistance, Enochsson said. While Volvo declined to specify the exact amount of steel it will be receiving from SSAB, Enochsson specified it was a “project size,” rather than an amount for mass manufacture. But Volvo is also thinking long-term.</p>
<p>“From, say, 2025 and onwards, we can talk about, how do we industrialize? Because obviously, we want not only to have fossil-free steel and a concept car, but we want to use it very broadly. But we can&#8217;t take decisions today for industrialization, because we first need to see how this steel behaves,” she explained.</p>
<p>Enochsson said it was too early to say whether moving to decarbonized steel would raise the cost of a vehicle, but she expressed confidence that sustainability was an important factor to consumers. She also alluded to conversations Volvo was having with other sustainable steel manufacturers, but she declined to provide any details as to whether those conversations would yield future partnerships.</p>
<p>Volvo is not the only automaker that has expressed interest in sustainable supply chains. Polestar, the electric vehicle brand spun out of Volvo Car Group, said it wanted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/polestar-will-have-to-question-everything-in-order-to-build-the-first-climate-neutral-ev/">create a climate-neutral car by 2030</a>. EV startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/ev-startup-fisker-sets-moonshot-goal-of-making-a-climate-neutral-ev-by-2027/">Fisker has set a similar goal</a>, for 2027.</p>
<p>“This is definitely a movement,” Enochsson said. “There are more and more OEMs expecting higher sustainability targets and it&#8217;s moving in the right direction. But it is a tremendous job to simply secure it all across.”</p>

<p><a href="https://thefund.vc/">The Fund</a>, the early-stage investment firm focused on pre-seed and seed startups, is going Down Under for its latest expansion. The Fund was founded in New York in 2018, before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/the-fund-la-london/">launching in Los Angeles</a>, London, the Rockies and the Midwest, too.</p>
<p>Co-founder Jenny Fielding, who is also managing director at Techstars New York, said The Fund decides on new areas for expansion based on demand from the local startup ecosystem, and earlier this year, it heard from a group of founders and operators who wanted to launch it in Australia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to participating in first check rounds, The Fund also builds communities of founders and other leaders from successful startups, who not only provide mentorship, but also capital as limited partners. The Fund now has a network of about 400 founders and has made around 120 investments across its funds.</p>

<p>Deacon told TechCrunch that The Fund Australia’s focus on very early-stage startups is important because of the growing pre-seed/seed funding gap. He points to a <a href="https://crossroads.startupaus.org/analysis/capital/seed-capital">report by StartupAus</a>, an advocacy group for Australian startups, that angel and seed investment in Australia has fallen over the past few years, both in terms of number of deals and aggregate value.</p>
<p>The Fund’s hypothesis is that many early-stage funds, in Australia and other parts of the world, shift their focus to later stages as they raise larger funds, Deacon added. This happened in New York City, too, and was one of the contributing drivers for the creation of The Fund in the first place.</p>
<p>“There’s been this gap in early-stage funding. There’s those two points of building a really strong community—helping founders and then the funding gap, which we can help to solve to a certain degree. We’re bringing in checks in the early stage with a lot of power in providing founders access to that network,” he said.</p>
<p>Writing early checks lets The Fund see deal flow before other venture firms and limited partners, and small check sizes gives it an advantage with startups.</p>
<p>“We don’t take a huge proportion of their raise, yet we come with really high quality capital,” said Deacon. “We’ve got that investor network. For why some of our [LPs] are interested, it’s to generate a return, but they also want to give back and make Australia and New Zealand companies prosper.”</p>
<p>Being able to tap into The Fund’s international network is helpful for startups in Australia, where many companies eye international expansion from the start.</p>
<p>Australian unicorns like Atlassian and Canva are also helping strengthen Australia’s startup ecosystem, said Vidler. “It feels like an inflection point for me in the startup ecosystem, where now there’s all these original founders and a community of senior operators who are keen to give back and create and bolster the ecosystem here.”</p>
<p>The Fund Australia is sector agnostic and wants to create a diverse portfolio. The Fund has focused on gender parity since the start. Each region’s investment committee is comprised of two men and two women, about half of its LPs are women and over 40% of its total capital has gone to female founders. Vidler says this was a major draw for her.</p>
<p>“The pull for me, and I think for a big part of the network in Australia, and a lot of women in tech in Australia, is that they’re going to be super interested in investing in the next generation of female founders as well,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV battery swapping startup Ample has locked in two partnerships this month that will help fuel an expansion into Japan and New York City after years of working on the technology. The startup, which was founded in 2014 and came out of stealth in March, said Tuesday it has partnered with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese petroleum and energy company Eneos </span>to jointly deploy and operate battery swapping infrastructure<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Japan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next year, the two companies will pilot Ample’s fully automated swapping technology with a focus on ride-hailing, taxi, municipal, rental and last-mile delivery companies. Ample and Eneos will also evaluate whether </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">swapping stations can offer other uses, such as a backup source of power for the energy grid.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> It is still early days for the partnership and few details have been disclosed; Ample, for instance didn&#8217;t share when the pilot program would begin or where in Japan it would initially launch. However, even with these scant details, Eneos&#8217; interest signals that battery swapping — at least for Ample — is gaining some believers. </span></p>
<p>The Eneos announcement comes a few days after Ample launched a separate partnership with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally, a New York City-based EV rental company for ride-hailing, taxi and last-mile deliveries. Ample and Sally will roll out five to 10 stations in NYC by the fourth quarter of this year, with plans to expand into other markets in 2021, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khaled Hassounah, founder and CEO of Ample</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;From the ashes of nearly a billion dollars, Ample resurrects Better Place&#8217;s battery swapping business model&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/from-the-ashes-of-nearly-a-billion-dollars-ample-resurrects-better-places-battery-swapping-business-model/embed/#?secret=S6ATDQSchM" data-secret="S6ATDQSchM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ample&#8217;s partnership with Sally will also expand to San Francisco in the next couple of months. Depending on the cost of using both services, this might be an advantageous deal for ride-hailing drivers in California, at least, where the state just decreed </span><a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2021/05/uber-lyft-electric-cars-california-mandate-weighed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90% of Uber and Lyft drivers must be in EVs by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The goal is to ultimately make swapping stations as ubiquitous as gas stations,” Hassounah told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ample came out of stealth this March with five operational stations in the Bay Area and a partnership with Uber that entails drivers renting vehicles directly from Ample that have been retrofitted with the startup&#8217;s battery technology. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Ample architecture is designed to be integrated into any modern electric vehicle,&#8221; Levi Tillemann, VP for policy and international outreach at Ample, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Unlike a standard electric vehicle, where you have a battery pack that is never meant to be removed from the car, with the Ample system, you replace the battery pack with an adapter plate that essentially shares the exact same dimensions as the OEM designed battery pack. That adapter plate is the architecture that allows for battery swap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ample&#8217;s standardized battery modules work with every vehicle that has been configured to run on the Ample platform, says Tillemann. With Ample&#8217;s partnership with Sally, the company will begin stepping away from running its own fleet, which it essentially launched to prove its business model. The company will work with Sally and probably other fleet and rental companies in the future to make vehicles Ample-enabled.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ample&#8217;s battery swapping works with any electric vehicle and dramatically reduces the cost and time it takes to install EV infrastructure by being a drop-in replacement for the OEM battery and does not require any modification to the car (either hardware or software),” said Hassounah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the concerns that puts ride-hailing drivers off switching to EVs is the amount of time it takes to charge a battery. Hassounah says swapping a battery only takes 10 minutes, but that the company aims to reduce that to five minutes by the end of the year. Having a more efficient and seamless process might help ride-hailing drivers and logistics companies make the switch.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/embed/#?secret=URBYL9BLjC" data-secret="URBYL9BLjC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Currently, drivers pay 10 cents per mile for swapping services, including energy, and the range varies based on the car model and battery size,&#8221; said Hassounah. &#8220;The price of the service varies depending on the price of electricity, but our goal is to have it be 10% to 20% cheaper than gas.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When drivers want to swap a battery, they&#8217;ll use Ample’s app to find nearby stations and then initiate the autonomous swap. Each station can serve about five to six cars per hour, but the company expects to be able to serve double that by the end of the year. That said, this also depends on the amount of available power at a given site.</span></p>
<p>Tillemann says as Ample expands, the company aims to one day work with existing OEM partners to offer consumers the choice of having Ample production plates installed into their new vehicles on the production line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our unit costs are very favorable for the battery swap systems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They do not cost a lot to deploy, and that means, with a relatively low number of vehicles our battery swap architecture is economical and profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eneos, which previously invested in Ample, according to the company, is committed to providing the next generation of energy supply. The company is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/toyota-partners-with-eneos-to-explore-a-hydrogen-powered-woven-city/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also exploring hydrogen and recently partnered with Toyota’s Woven City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a futuristic prototype city that’s being built in Japan, to power the metropolis using hydrogen. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian cities are home to hundreds of millions of low-skilled workers who hail from villages in search of work. Many of them have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dec12470-894b-11ea-9dcb-fe6871f4145a">lost their jobs</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic that has slowed several economic activities in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p><a href="https://apna.co">Apna</a>, a startup by an Apple alum, is helping millions of such blue and gray-collar workers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/apple-alum-jobs-app-apna-for-india-workers-raises-12-5-million/">upskill themselves, find communities and land jobs</a>. On Wednesday it announced its acceptance by the market has helped it raise $70 million in a new financing round as the startup prepares to scale the 16-month-old app across India.</p>
<p>Insight Partners and Tiger Global co-led Apna’s $70 million Series B round, which valued the startup at $570 million. Existing investors Lightspeed India, Sequoia Capital India, Greenoaks Capital and Rocketship VC also participated in the round, which brings Apna’s to-date raise to over $90 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, whose name is inspired from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGKJBPFdUA">a 2019 Bollywood song</a>, at its core is solving the network gap issue for workers. “Someone born in a privileged family goes to the best school, best college and makes acquaintance with influential people. Many born just a few kilometres away are dealt with a whole different kind of life and never see such opportunities,” said Nirmit Parikh, founder and chief executive of Apna, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Apna is building a scalable networking infrastructure, something that doesn’t currently exist in the market, so that these workers can connect to the right employers and secure jobs. “Apna’s focus on digitizing the process of job discovery, application and employer candidate interaction has the potential to revolutionize the hiring process,” said Griffin Schroeder, a partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>

<p>The startup’s eponymous Android app, available in multiple languages, features more than 70 communities today for skilled professionals such as carpenters, painters, field sales agents and many others.</p>
<p>On the app, users connect to each other and help with leads and share tips to improve at their jobs. The app also offers people the opportunity to upskill themselves, practice with their interview performance, and become eligible for even more jobs. The startup said it&#8217;s building Masterclass-like skilling modules, outcome or job based skilling, and also enabling peer-to-peer learning via its vertical communities. It plans to launch career counselling and resume building feature.</p>
<p>And that bet is working. The startup has amassed over 10 million users and just last month it facilitated more than 15 million job interviews, said Parikh. All jobs listed on the Apna platform are verified by the startup and free of cost for the candidates.</p>
<p>Apna has partnered with some of India’s leading public and private organizations and is providing support to the Ministry of Minority Affairs of India, National Skill Development Corporation and UNICEF YuWaah to provide better skilling and job opportunities to candidates.</p>

<p>More than 100,000 recruiters &#8212; including Byju&#8217;s, Unacademy, Flipkart, Zomato, Licious, Burger King, Dunzo, Bharti-AXA, Delhivery, Teamlease, G4S Global and Shadowfax &#8212; in the country today use Apna’s platform, where they have to spend less than five minutes to post job posts and are connect to hyperlocal candidates with relevant skills in within two days.</p>
<p>Apna has built the “market leading platform for India’s workforce to establish digital professional identity, network, access skills training, and find high quality jobs,” said Nikhil Sachdev, managing director, Insight Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Employers are engaging with Apna at a rapid pace to help find high quality talent with low friction which is leading to best in class customer satisfaction scores. We believe that our investment will enable Apna to continue their steep growth trajectory, scale up their operations, and improve access to opportunities for India’s workforce.”</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to scale across India and eventually take the app to international markets, said Parikh. Apna, which has recently seen high-profile individuals from firms such as Uber, BCG  and Swiggy join the firm, is also actively hiring for several tech roles in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Apna has built the infrastructure and brand awareness in the market that it can launch in a new city within two days and drive over 10,000 interviews there in less than two days, it said.</p>
<p>“Our first goal is to restart India’s economy in the next couple of months and do whatever we can to help,” said Parikh, who was part of the iPhone product-operations team at Apple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors has enough &#8220;binding orders&#8221; from customers to fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022, executives at the company said Tuesday, just a day after an executive shakeup that included the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">resignation of the company&#8217;s CEO and CFO</a>.</p>
<p>Reaching that goal will come at a cost.

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just focused currently on the Endurance truck,&#8221; Schmidt said at the event, according to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-shares-soar-after-new-chairwoman-says-production-plans-remain-on-track.html">report by CNBC</a>. &#8220;That&#8217;s our next goal for the next three months, to make sure we hit our production targets and stay within our budgets and drive forward to getting the vehicles ready for the market.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What was meant to be the &#8220;first mass produced all-electric RV&#8221; should have been revealed this month, but with its money woes, Lordstown has pushed back the reveal and removed mention of the van from its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000155837021008107/ride-20201231x10ka.htm#Item7ManagementsDiscussionandAnalysisof_">amended annual filing</a> — a change first noted earlier this month <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lordstown-motors-amends-annual-filing-with-going-concern-notice-11623181411">by the WSJ</a>.</p>
<p>Investors responded to the company&#8217;s &#8220;we have enough capital&#8221; and &#8220;binding order&#8221; comments and put less weight on the &#8220;we&#8217;re punting on the electric van&#8221; part. Shares of Lordstown Motors were up 11.34% on the news to close at $10.31.</p>

<p>Lordstown&#8217;s <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/f0d0d2f4-d298-4576-9344-61f82e345e19">Q1 report</a> filed with the SEC last week showed a startling lack of capital that would have gotten in the way of manufacturing and delivering the EV pickup. In the filing, the company warned investors that it had &#8220;substantial doubt regarding [its] ability to continue&#8221; in the next year. The automaker has faced scrutiny in the past after investment research firm Hindenburg Research said the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">misled consumers and investors</a> about Endurance&#8217;s preorders.</p>
<p>But Tuesday is a &#8220;new day&#8221; for the automaker-gone-SPAC, says Strand. Schmidt revealed the company has enough orders for limited production of the Endurance for 2021 and 2022, calling those orders &#8220;firm&#8221; and &#8220;binding.&#8221; The work truck will start at $55,000, he said. To compare, the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, another truck aimed at commercial customers, will start below $40,000.</p>
<p>Schmidt said the company has $400 million in the bank, but would need more to increase its ability to build more than 20,000 vehicles per year. Lordstown is actively seeking additional capital from GM, which owns a small stake in the startup, and other early investors. In a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lordstown-motors-orders/lordstown-has-binding-orders-for-first-two-years-of-production-president-idUSKCN2DR22V">statement to Reuters</a>, GM said, &#8220;we are comfortable with our current relationship with LMC but we are willing to listen to proposals that make sense for both parties.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As so-called neobanks continue to gain more traction in the market with their more modern takes on banking and other financial services, a startup that&#8217;s building technology to help incumbent players better compete is announcing a big round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.10xbanking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x Future Technologies</a>, a London-based fintech that helps larger, established banks build both next-generation services as well as tools to help their older services work more efficiently, has raised $187 million. We understand from sources close to the company that 10x&#8217;s valuation with this round is in the range of $700 million.</p>
<p>(The amount raised and valuation also roughly line up with the figures from Sky News, which reported earlier this month that 10x was raising new funding.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>10x will be using the funds both to expand into new geographies like North America, as well as to continue building more technology for its flagship platform. <a href="https://www.10xbanking.com/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuperCore</a>, as that platform is called, is an all-in-one system built from scratch to run a wide range of banking services such as payments, core banking, mortgages, analytics, security and marketing, which 10x&#8217;s bank customers can integrate into their existing tech by way of APIs, or 10x can use to build those clients new services from the ground up.</p>

<p>This Series C round is full of heavy hitters that speak to the credibility 10x has picked up in its five years in the market.</p>
<p>Co-led by BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), it also includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/10x-founded-by-the-ex-ceo-of-barclays-raises-46m-to-take-on-ancient-banking-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing investors</a> JPMorgan Chase, Nationwide, Ping An and Australia&#8217;s Westpac.</p>
<p>The latter four include strategic backers: Antony Jenkins, the founder and CEO of 10x who himself used to work at big banks (his last role was CEO of Barclays, and although he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left under a cloud</a>, his prominence and track record are likely reasons for the company&#8217;s clout), tells us that 10x is currently building services for Westpac and Nationwide.</p>
<p>10x has two other banks as customers that it is not disclosing yet, which will be leading to more soon, Jenkins added, since the industry is &#8220;at a transitional moment&#8221; right now. Some of 10x&#8217;s engagements are already live, with &#8220;volume going over the platform,&#8221; he said. Others have yet to launch.</p>
<p>The opportunity that 10x is targeting is big, but also elusive.</p>
<p>Neobanks and other new-generation fintech providers are slowly chipping away at incumbent banks&#8217; stronghold on consumer and business banking. They are typically doing this not by becoming fully fledged banks themselves, but by stitching together suites of traditional and more modern banking services by way of APIs from other fintechs; machine learning algorithms to personalise services to customers; and modern interfaces to make the whole experience more user-friendly than what you might get from a traditional bank.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=ZJrkURj76t" data-secret="ZJrkURj76t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Incumbent banks want to compete against these new upstarts with rival products of their own, but in many cases they can&#8217;t: their infrastructure is too old, and oftentimes the company culture is even older.</p>
<p>This is where 10x comes in, providing the tools and advice to help them get new services up and running.</p>
<p>Jenkins notes that currently, a lot of the engagements 10x is seeing involve banks bolting on completely new services rather than building services to replace those they already offer. One fitting analogy here is that it&#8217;s a little like putting a modern extension on a very old house, rather than remodelling and modernizing the whole of the old house from the ground up.</p>
<p>But, it seems that we are now, five years into 10x&#8217;s life as a business, starting to see the first signs of banks willing to explore how to migrate their core data to more modern systems to make it more extensible and usable in a wider range of new services, and 10x believes it can be a partner in that back-end transformation, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legacy systems are where banks&#8217; issues sit, because they are all architected around product, not customers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we believe that the industry is ready to contemplate the process of migration now.&#8221; The company is not yet working on any projects of this kind, he added, but it expects to in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>And even with other fintech startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/fintechos-nabs-61-5m-for-a-low-code-approach-to-modernizing-legacy-banking-and-insurance-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FintechOS</a>, also building services aimed at helping incumbent banks be more modern, that expectation spells opportunity for investors.</p>

<p>“We have been impressed with 10x’s strategy and ambition to play a key role at the heart of transformations taking place in financial services, driven by technology innovation, consumer expectations and regulatory reform,&#8221; said William Abecassis, BlackRock&#8217;s head of Innovation Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to be investing in the business as it scales into new markets.”</p>
<p>Leon Pedersen, MD and head of Thematic Investing, CPP Investments added: “10x is very well placed to change how big banks are built and deliver for their customers. 10x presents an attractive opportunity for a long-term investor like CPP Investments as we believe they will benefit from their exposure to the structural growth trend of financial institutions investing in digital initiatives and renewing core technology infrastructure, allowing banks to introduce new offerings and products much faster than using legacy platforms.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration is outlining new plans to combat domestic terrorism in light of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and social media companies have their own part to play.</p>
<p>The White House released on Tuesday a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf">national strategy on countering domestic terrorism</a>. The plan acknowledges the key role that online platforms play in bringing violent ideas into the mainstream, going as far as calling social media sites the &#8220;front lines&#8221; of the war on domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>&#8220;The widespread availability of domestic terrorist recruitment material online is a national security threat whose front lines are overwhelmingly private-sector online platforms, and we are committed to informing more effectively the escalating efforts by those platforms to secure those front lines,&#8221; the White House plan states.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Biden administration committed to more information sharing with the tech sector to fight the tide of online extremism, part of a push to intervene well before extremists can organize violence. According to a fact sheet on the new domestic terror plan, the U.S. government will prioritize &#8220;increased information sharing with the technology sector,&#8221; specifically online platforms where extremism is incubated and organized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Continuing to enhance the domestic terrorism-related information offered to the private sector, especially the technology sector, will facilitate more robust efforts outside the government to counter terrorists’ abuse of Internet-based communications platforms to recruit others to engage in violence,&#8221; the White House plan states.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Threat of inauguration violence casts a long shadow over social media&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/capitol-attack-social-media-inauguration-day/embed/#?secret=eeDxlInxsz" data-secret="eeDxlInxsz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/15/politics/white-house-strategy-domestic-terrorism/index.html">remarks</a> timed with the release of the domestic terror strategy, Attorney General Merrick Garland asserted that coordinating with the tech sector is &#8220;particularly important&#8221; for interrupting extremists who organize and recruit on online platforms and emphasized plans to share enhanced information on potential domestic terror threats.</p>
<p>In spite of the new initiatives, the Biden administration admits that domestic terrorism recruitment material will inevitably remain available online, particularly on platforms that don&#8217;t prioritize its removal — like most social media platforms, prior to January 2021 — and on end-to-end encrypted apps, many of which saw an influx of users when social media companies cracked down on extremism in the U.S. earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dealing with the supply is therefore necessary but not sufficient: we must address the demand too,&#8221; the White House plan states. &#8220;Today’s digital age requires an American population that can utilize essential aspects of Internet-based communications platforms while avoiding vulnerability to domestic terrorist recruitment and other harmful content.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Biden administration will also address vulnerability to online extremism through digital literacy programs, including &#8220;educational materials&#8221; and &#8220;skills-enhancing online games&#8221; designed to inoculate Americans against domestic extremism recruitment efforts, and presumably disinformation and misinformation more broadly.</p>
<p>The plan stops short of naming domestic terror elements like QAnon and the &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement specifically, though it acknowledges the range of ways domestic terror can manifest, from small informal groups to organized militias.</p>
<p>A report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in March <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2021/item/2194-unclassified-summary-of-assessment-on-domestic-violent-extremism">observed</a> the elevated threat to the U.S. that domestic terrorism poses in 2021, noting that domestic extremists leverage mainstream social media sites to recruit new members, organize in-person events and share materials that can lead to violence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How big is the market in India for a neobank aimed at teenagers? Scores of high-profile investors are backing a startup to find out.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://fampay.in">FamPay</a> said on Wednesday it has raised $38 million in its Series A round led by Elevation Capital. General Catalyst, Rocketship VC, Greenoaks Capital and existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Y Combinator, Global Founders Capital and Venture Highway also participated in the new round, which brings FamPay&#8217;s to-date raise to $42.7 million.</p>
<p>The size of the new investment makes it one of the largest Series A rounds in India. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">reported</a> early this month that FamPay was in talks with Elevation Capital to raise a new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/_SambhavJain_">Sambhav Jain</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/iamkushtaneja">Kush Taneja</a> (pictured above) &#8212; both of whom graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 2019 &#8212; FamPay enables teenagers to make online and offline payments.</p>
<p>The thesis behind the startup, said Jain in an interview with TechCrunch, is to provide financial literacy to teenagers, who additionally have limited options to open a bank account in India at a young age. Through gamification, the startup said it’s making lessons about money fun for youngsters.</p>
<p>Unlike in the U.S., where it’s common for teenagers to get jobs at restaurants and other places and understand how to handle money at a young age, a similar tradition doesn’t exist in India.</p>
<p>After gathering the consent from parents, FamPay provides teenagers with an app to make online purchases, as well as plastic cards &#8212; the only numberless card of its kind in the country &#8212; for offline transactions. Parents credit money to their children’s FamPay accounts and get to keep track of high-ticket spendings.</p>
<p>In other markets, including the U.S., a number of startups including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/">Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/">Step</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/forget-the-piggy-bank-till-financials-kids-spend-management-app-gets-gates-backing/">Till Financial</a> are chasing to serve the teenagers, but in India, there currently is no startup looking to solve the financial access problem for teenagers, said Mridul Arora, a partner at Elevation Capital, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It could prove to be a good issue to solve &#8212; India has the largest adolescent population in the world.</p>
<p>“If you’re able to serve them at a young age, over a course of time, you stand to become their go-to product for a lot of things,” Arora said. “FamPay is serving a population that is very attractive and at the same time underserved.”</p>
<p>The current offerings of FamPay are just the beginning, said Jain. Eventually the startup wishes to provide a range of services and serve as a neobank for youngsters to retain them with the platform forever, he said, though he didn’t wish to share currently what those services might be.</p>

<p>Teens represent the “most tech-savvy generation, as they haven’t seen a world without the internet,” he said. “They adapt to technology faster than any other target audience and their first exposure with the internet comes from the likes of Instagram and Netflix. This leads to higher expectations from the products that they prefer to use. We are unique in approaching banking from a whole new lens with our recipe of community and gamification to match the Gen Z vibe.”</p>
<p>“I don’t look at FamPay just as a payments service. If the team is able to execute this, FamPay can become a very powerful gateway product to teenagers in India and their financial life. It can become a neobank, and it also has the opportunity to do something around social, community and commerce,” said Arora.</p>
<p>During their college life, Jain and Taneja collaborated and built an app and worked at a number of startups, including social network ShareChat, logistics firm Rivigo and video streaming service Hotstar. Jain said their work with startups in the early days paved the idea to explore a future in this ecosystem.</p>
<p>Prior to arriving at FamPay, Jain said the duo had thought about several more ideas for a startup. The early days of FamPay were uniquely challenging to the founders, who had to convince their parents about their decision to do a startup rather than joining firms or startups as had most of their peers from college. Until being selected by Y Combinator, Jain said he didn’t even fully understand a cap table and dilutions.</p>
<p>He credited entrepreneurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/kunalb11">Kunal Shah</a> (founder of CRED) and <a href="https://twitter.com/amrishrau">Amrish Rau</a> (CEO of Pine Labs) for being generous with their time and guidance. They also wrote some of the earliest checks to the startup.</p>
<p>The startup, which has amassed over 2 million registered users, plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand its user base and product offerings, and hire engineers. It is also looking for people to join its leadership team, said Jain.</p>
