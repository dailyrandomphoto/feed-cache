	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There has been a rather fervent acceleration in planned biometric data collection in recent months. If you’re not worried about it, you should be.</p>
<p>In fact, silly as it sounds, try being <em>more</em> worried about it than seems normal. After all, for-profit biometric data collection has undergone an astounding degree of normalization in the last decade. The idea of Apple scanning your fingerprint on a daily basis once sounded startling. Now it’s how we unlock our banking app and our laptop — unless, of course, we do it with our face. It’s gone mainstream.</p>
<p>We embraced FaceID, thumbprint scanning and similar functions specifically because they are convenient. No passcode, no problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255218" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Corporations and businesses saw this, and now convenience is among the two biggest reasons typically given for the adoption of biometric data collection – the other is public safety, which we’ll get to later. Quick biometric scans, we’re told, make things faster and easier.</p>
<p>In a bid to save time, a number of primary schools throughout the U.K. recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/26/conditioning-an-entire-society-the-rise-of-biometric-data-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented facial scanning for lunch payment</a>. Several schools ended up suspending the program after data privacy experts and parents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/18/privacy-fears-as-schools-use-facial-recognition-to-speed-up-lunch-queue-ayrshire-technology-payments-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed back</a>. They argued convenience was not exactly worth the price of the accumulation of an entire database of young children’s faces stored on a server somewhere. And they’re right.</p>
<h2>Music for your ears, palm print for your ticket</h2>
<p>This September, U.S. ticketing company AXS announced a flagship program to use Amazon One palm-print scanners at Red Rocks Amphitheater as an optional alternative to print or mobile concert tickets (<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/09/14/amazon-palm-scanning-technology-red-rocks-concert-venue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with plans to expand into additional venues in the coming months</a>). The decision was met with <a href="https://www.amazondoesntrock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immediate resistance</a> from both privacy experts and musicians, and it was hardly the first flashpoint over biometric data collection within the live music industry.</p>
<p>In 2019, major promoters LiveNation and AEG (which coordinates major festivals such as Coachella) <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/30/ban-facial-recognition-live-events-music-festivals-concerts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stepped back from plans to invest in and implement facial recognition technology at concerts</a> after public outcry from fans and artists.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the fight over the use of biometric recognition during live entertainment is far from settled. When the coronavirus pandemic sent professional sports executives who depend on full stadiums back to the drawing board, their new plans often incorporated mass facial recognition. Faces would replace tickets, and this would ostensibly make everyone safer from the virus.</p>
<p>These executives are determined. The Dutch football team AFC Ajax is seeking to reinstall its pilot facial recognition program that was initially halted by data protection regulators. Henk van Raan, the chief innovation officer of Ajax’s home field, Amsterdam ArenA, was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facial-recognitions-next-big-play-the-sports-stadium-11596290400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quoted in The Wall Street Journal</a> as saying, “Hopefully we use this coronavirus pandemic to change rules. The coronavirus is a bigger enemy than [any threat to] privacy.”</p>
<p>This is terrible reasoning, as the risks posed to our privacy are in no way mitigated or lessened by our risk to a virus.</p>
<p>In the same article, Shaun Moore, CEO of facial-recognition supplier Trueface, described his conversations with professional sports executives as overwhelmingly concerned with touch points by sidestepping the handing over of credentials, citing the risk of virus transmission while scanning ticket barcodes.</p>
<p>This is a stretch, and you don’t need to be an epidemiologist to call it one. When the main event involves a big crowd of people yelling and cheering next to one another, it’s probably not the momentary masked interaction when an agent scans a ticket that is worth worrying about. As the safety argument falls apart, so does the convenience one. The simple fact is that our lives are not made exponentially and meaningfully better by the replacement of a mobile ticket with our palm print. Those extra five seconds are a moot point.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see van Raan speak so directly about using the pandemic to override privacy protections and concerns. But his reasoning is frightening and flawed.</p>
<p>Yes, the coronavirus is a real threat, but it’s not an “enemy.” It’s not embodied, nor does it have a motive. It’s a virus. It is outside human control. In insurance terms, it’s an “act of God.” And it’s being used to justify something that is very much in human control: The huge uptick in biometric data collection under the guise of public safety or convenience.</p>
<h2>Public safety and free societies</h2>
<p>Public safety is often the cause upon which increased biometric surveillance is foisted. In August, U.S. lawmakers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-bill-seeks-require-anti-drunk-driving-vehicle-tech-2021-08-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a mandate</a> that would require auto manufactures to include passive technology in new cars to prevent drunken drivers from starting vehicles. That “passive” tech could end up being anything from eye-scanning devices and breathalyzers to an infrared sensor that tests BAC levels through the skin.</p>
<p>Sure, this is a seemingly noble cause with a respectable motive. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drunken driving kills nearly 10,000 people per year; the European Commission <a href="https://www.heraldopenaccess.us/openaccess/alcohol-related-crashes-in-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lists a similar number for the EU</a>.</p>
<p>But where is all that data going? Where is it being stored? Who is it being sold to, and what do they plan to do with it? The privacy risks are too great.</p>
<p>The pandemic obliterated many of the obstacles standing in the way of the adoption of mass biometric data collection, and the consequences will be disastrous for civil liberties if it’s allowed to continue in this manner. The intensity of surveillance is ramping up in record time, making governments and for-profit corporations privy to that most private minutiae of our lives and bodies.</p>
<p>A mobile ticket is surveillance enough – it announces to the system you’ve entered the venue at an exact time, after all. Don’t fix it if it’s not broken! And don’t add biometric data collection just because you can under the shaky guise of not spreading germs.</p>
<p>Give out as little biometric data as possible, period. It’s not enough to avoid giving your biometric data to Google or Amazon specifically, given those corporations’ abysmal records when it comes to, say, basic human rights and civil liberties.</p>
<p>A smaller company unaffiliated with your typical tech giant might feel like less of a threat, but don’t be fooled. The moment Amazon or Google acquires that company, they acquire your and everyone else’s biometric data with it. And we’re back where we started.</p>
<p>A safe society need not be a heavily surveilled society. We built increasingly safe and healthy societies for centuries without the use of a single video camera. And beyond safety, heavy surveillance that is this detailed and individualized is the death knell of a society that values civil liberties.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s what this all comes down to. A free and open society is not without its risks – this is, arguably, one of the major tenets of Western political thought since the Enlightenment. Those risks are far preferable to those of living in a heavily surveilled society.</p>
<p>In other words, there’s no getting off the biometric grid we’re heading toward. The time to stop the slide by regulating and eliminating unnecessary biometric data collection, particularly when for-profit corporations are involved, is now.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CES is still a fantastic car show — but if you work at a hardware startup, it's time to rethink your media strategy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For fifty-four years, big and small hardware manufacturers that hoped to reach their target audiences rolled out new products at the Consumer Electronics Show.</p>
<p>The first CES event in June 1967 drew 17,500 attendees, where many in the crowd were absolutely dazzled by GE&#8217;s new 24-pound color television. In the intervening decades, the conference grew so much, it essentially created its own gravity. The last in-person CES held in 2020 attracted a total verified attendance of 171,268, according to organizers.</p>
<p>The trade show shifted to online-only in 2021, but CES returned last week, even though many exhibitors and publications (including this one) declined to send representatives, citing the ongoing omicron surge. &#8220;It’s time we return to making the world better rather than living in fear,&#8221; wrote Consumer Trade Association president and CEO Gary Shapiro <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/'">in an opinion column</a>.</p>
<p>But just 40,000 people attended, <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/conventions/ces/ces-attendance-down-more-than-75-organizers-say-2509439/">according to the Las Vegas Review Journal</a>. That&#8217;s a 75% decline.</p>
<p>If an event only attracts 25% of its usual crowd, for whom is it essential? Today, TechCrunch Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec, Hardware Editor Brian Heater and reporter Haje Jan Kamps shared their thoughts on CES 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kristin Korosec: CES hasn&#8217;t lost its automotive luster</li>
<li>Brian Heater: Hardware startups should reconsider their media strategies</li>
<li>Haje Jan Kamps: I missed it sorely this year</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Kristin Korosec: CES hasn&#8217;t lost its automotive luster</h2>
<p>Somewhere around 2014 or so, CES turned into a car show. And even with the latest variant of COVID derailing in-person plans for many companies, CES 2022 didn’t lose its automotive luster.</p>
<p>This year was different in a few respects, signaling that the automotive industry has taken a few cupfuls of we-really-need-revenue punch. Technology that is further away from commercialization showed up, but not in the same force as in previous years. CES 2022 was not the year for evtols, hyperloop, and to a lesser degree, autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The weeks following CES have traditionally been a desert for hardware news. Fill that vacuum.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Autonomous vehicle technology wasn’t absent from the show, and there were some key announcements and activities. A few of the notable ones included the head-to-head autonomous racecar competition at the Las Vegas Speedway, GM CEO Mary Barra’s intention to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/gm-personal-autonomous-vehicles/">sell personal autonomous vehicles</a> by mid-decade (although some key details were missing) and Intel subsidiary Mobileye’s plan to bring a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/intels-mobileye-autonomous-driving-chip-for-consumer-vehicles/">supercomputer to market</a> designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers. When automated driving did come up, it was often in the form of future promises, narrowly defined autonomous features like parking — or both.The Mobileye announcement points to one of the themes at CES 2022: compute.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The backbone of Indonesia’s economy are its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/how-can-indonesian-smes-scale-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated more than 60 million SMEs</a>. But many lack access to working capital and, especially before the pandemic, managed their finances using manual processes like spreadsheets. With COVID-19 prompting many to digitize, startups that focus on SMEs have been raising large rounds of funding to scale up quickly. <a href="https://koinworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KoinWorks</a> is the latest. The Indonesia-based financial platform for SMEs announced today it has raised $108 million in Series C funding led by MDI Ventures. The round included $43 million in equity and $65 million in debt capital for the working capital loans KoinWorks provides to its customers.</p>
<p>The round brings KoinWorks’ total raised to $180 million. Existing investors who returned for its latest round include Quona Capital, Triodos Investment Management, Saison Capital, ACV and East Ventures. The new funds will be used for hiring about 400 new employees and scaling KoinWorks’ latest suite of products, SME Neobank.</p>
<p>KoinWorks is headquartered in Jakarta, with holding in Singapore and tech offices in Yogyakarta, India and Vietnam. KoinWorks was originally created to help SMEs, which are often turned away by traditional financial institutions, get access to working capital. Since then, it has also developed a comprehensive platform of financial tools to help its customers, including e-commerce vendors and social commerce sellers, increase their sales.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255467" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/koinworks-indonesia-seriesb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first profiled KoinWorks in 2019</a> when it raised $12 million for its lending platform. Demand increased as more businesses went online during the COVID-19 pandemic and the startup says its user base tripled to 1.5 million customers, and a waitlist of 100,000 SMEs who are being onboarded onto its new financial software. Co-founder and executive chairman Willy Arifin told TechCrunch in an email that since 2019, monthly loan disbursements have also tripled to nearly $50 million and revenue had quadrupled.</p>
<p>KoinWorks focuses on SMEs that are underserved by traditional financial institutions and may not have a bank account or credit cards. On the platform, users can create an online bank account and card, borrow working capital, and access accounting, point-of-sale, early wage access and human resources management systems tailored for small businesses.</p>
<p>Arifin said that since KoinWorks’ monthly disbursement rate reached $50 million a month, its take rate has grown enough that the company became cash flow positive earlier this year, and its non-performing loan (NPL) percentage is lower than 2%. He says banks serving traditional SMEs have at least double KoinWorks’ NPL. “As many as 20% of businesses shifted their sales channels offline to online during the pandemic, and 89% of businesses now use online channels to sell their products and services,” he said.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, KoinWorks’ competitors have grown to include other neobanks and startups that started out as accounting software but are expanding to include working capital loans and other financial services. Two notable examples included rivals BukuWarung and BukuKas, both of which have raised significant rounds of funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“When we started out, we were among hundreds of traditional financial institutions. Fast forward to the present day, we are seeing those same banks now undergo digitalization,” Arifin said. “Despite that, Indonesia’s yearly funding gap is $80 billion USD, so those who remain unbanked or underbanked are still at a disadvantage. There’s still a lot of room for improvement”</p>
<p>He added that with tens of millions of entrepreneurs in Indonesia, “it’s not a winner-takes-all market.” The top five banks in the country have a combined market value of close to $160 billion USD. There will undoubtedly be fintech companies out there tackling the unbanked/underbanked space, however, KoinWorks has a best in class approach tailored to the needs of SMEs and entrepreneurs that we believe will have a significant impact on the future sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dallas council members will vote Wednesday on whether to approve an economic development agreement with Ford in the hopes of being home to the automaker&#8217;s next autonomous vehicle facility, reported <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/autos/2022/01/10/dallas-is-a-finalist-for-160-million-ford-and-argo-ai-self-driving-vehicle-facility/">The Dallas Morning News</a>.</p>
<p>Ford, an investor and customer of AV technology company Argo AI, is working with Argo to commercialize the self-driving technology. The two companies have established three test vehicle depots in Austin, Miami and Washington D.C. in a run up to its commercialization plans. The facility in Dallas, if the location is ultimately chosen by Ford, would be similar to those operations. (Argo also has its own test fleets and facilities in Pittsburgh, Detroit and Palo Alto).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/argo-ford-to-launch-self-driving-vehicles-on-lyfts-ride-hailing-app/">The two companies plan to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles</a> on ride-hailing company Lyft&#8217;s app in a number of cities over the next five years, beginning with Miami and Austin.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255962" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If the agenda item passes with Dallas&#8217;s Office of Economic Development, Ford might be looking at over $3 million in proposed tax breaks over the span of five years. The city would also commit a $250,000 grant toward the construction of the facility, which is proposed to be located at a 32,361-square-foot space at 2335 Burbank Street. To meet its end of the bargain, Ford would need to create a minimum of 250 new jobs and invest a minimum of $160 million, including the AV fleet, at the property.</p>
<p>The Dallas site is one of three final locations that Ford is scouting for its new AV facility, <a href="https://cityofdallas.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5375649&amp;GUID=F010CA62-4C89-4390-8305-50215E0DB6DA&amp;Options=&amp;Search=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to city documents</a>. The other two are in California, where Ford&#8217;s AV unit already has a presence. However, Ford might see the benefits of building in Texas, a state that doesn&#8217;t require permits to operate driverless autonomous vehicles. California, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires separate permits</a> for testing with a driver, testing without a driver, commercial autonomous delivery deployment and commercial robotaxi deployment.</p>
<p>Ford would not comment on the Dallas City Council&#8217;s agenda item, saying it has not made any decisions or chosen any additional cities to expand to, and that &#8220;this is all preliminary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ford is building its self-driving business for ride-hailing and goods delivery in Austin, Texas, Miami and Washington, D.C., and focused on building a profitable self-driving business,&#8221; the company told TechCrunch. &#8220;Scaling this technology is key, driving us to explore a variety of cities in the U.S. to expand our self-driving services. We will share more information about our self-driving business in the future.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle maker Rivian filed a <a href="https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4803:a7tkzo.2.1">new trademark</a> for bicycles and electric bikes, as well as their corresponding structural parts. The move might signal that Rivian is considering getting on the e-bike demand train and diversifying its portfolio with a product that is cheaper to produce at scale than electric pickup trucks and in line with its targeted &#8220;adventure&#8221; seeking demographic.</p>
<p>Rivian told TechCrunch it had nothing to share on the matter.</p>
<p>Companies often file trademarks for products they don&#8217;t end up using, but other automakers are beginning to see the value in the e-bike industry that saw a <a href="https://www.npd.com/news/blog/2021/the-cycling-market-pedals-ahead-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth rate in sales of 240%</a> over the 12 months leading up to July. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/porsche-unveils-two-new-electric-bikes-alongside-the-taycan-gran-turismo/">Porsche launched two new e-bikes that were designed with the spirit of the Taycan Cross Turismo</a>. BMW has also released plans to produce <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/06/bmw-unveils-high-speed-electric-bicycle-with-300-km-of-range-plus-an-electric-motorcycle/">several e-bikes</a> and other micromobility vehicles lately, as well, like its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/how-bmw-plans-to-corner-the-u-s-scooter-market-with-its-all-electric-ce-04/">all-electric CE 04 scooter</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255940" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Last month, Rivian shared plans to use some of the $13.7 billion it raised when it went public to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/rivian-to-invest-ipo-wealth-into-new-georgia-factory-battery-tech/">build a second factory in Georgia</a> (its first is in Illinois) to double its production capacity and produce battery cells – cells which can ostensibly be used in batteries for other types of vehicles, as well.</p>
<p>According to the filing, which was first revealed by <a href="https://www.rivianforums.com/forum/threads/rivian-e-bike-aspirations-revealed-by-trademark-filing.3328/">Rivian Forums</a>, Rivian wants to expand the use of its trademark to include the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bicycles; bicycle structural parts; electric bicycles; electric bicycle structural parts; electric bicycle components specially adapted for electric bicycles, namely, battery packs, motor controllers, electric motors, throttle controls, pedal assist sensors, display consoles, wiring harnesses, sprockets, cassettes, chains; bicycle frames; bicycle pedals; bicycle horns; bicycle brakes; bicycle chains; bicycle gears; bicycle wheels; bicycle seats; bicycle tires; bicycle cranks; bicycle tags; bicycle mudguards; bicycle motors; bicycle saddles; bicycle pumps; bicycle bells; bicycle handlebars; bicycle trailers; bicycle kickstands; bicycle seat posts; fitted bicycle covers; bicycle wheel spokes; bicycle wheel rims; bicycle stands; bicycle pedal straps; bicycle parts, namely, derailleurs; bicycle water bottle cages; bicycle carriers for vehicles; pumps for bicycle tires; inner tubes for bicycle tires; bicycle parts, namely disk wheels; bicycle parts, namely brake shoes</p></blockquote>
<p>Rivian also recently filed a patent for an <a href="https://uspto.report/patent/app/20210402911">integrated tailgate cargo system for automotive vehicle</a>, which is essentially a tailgate bike rack that will allow drivers to carry a bike in their pickup without losing bed space. Perhaps the company, which likes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/rivian-r1t-camp-kitchen-check-out-the-final-version-of-the-electric-pickups-outdoor-cooking-station/">provide accessories for its R1T truck</a>, wants to design the whole package for its target audience – the eco-conscious rugged American explorer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. electric automaker Rivian reported Monday it produced 1,015 vehicles in 2021 — a figure that is in line with expectations that the company lowered last month.</p>
<p>Rivian delivered 920 vehicles by the end of 2021, according to a release issued Monday. The production and delivery numbers combined with a WSJ report that Rivian&#8217;s COO <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivians-chief-operating-officer-departed-amid-production-ramp-up-11641849820">left the company</a> last month sent shares down. Rivian shares closed 5.6% lower Monday to $81.44; shares fell another 3.3% in after market trading.</p>
<p>Rivian has more than 71,000 &#8220;pre-orders&#8221; (meaning refundable reservations) for its R1T pickup trucks, according to its <a href="https://assets.rivian.com/2md5qhoeajym/3BYl8sLO3rzD9lluEwvXGE/754d4115dc0715d7e95e848556fc93cb/Rivian-Q3-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter to shareholders</a> posted in December.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Rivian had initially targeted production of 1,200 vehicles by the end of the year. Last month, company executives including CEO RJ Scaringe cut those expectations, saying it would likely fall a few hundred vehicles short due to supply chain issues and challenges of battery production.</p>
<p>During its earnings call in December, Scaringe referred to production as a complex orchestra on two occasions.</p>
<p>&#8220;In ramping up a production system like this, it is, as I said before, a really complex orchestra,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;So you have hundreds of suppliers providing thousands of parts, thousands of robots within the production facility operating to prescribe movements, and then thousands of team members assembling and working to put the vehicles together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite that lowered target, Scaringe noted during that call that the company is &#8220;ramping largely as expected.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The battery constraint is really an artifact of just bringing up a highly automated line,&#8221; he said in December. &#8220;And as I said, that doesn&#8217;t represent any long-term challenges for us. We have a second line that&#8217;s coming on that will put the battery module production way out in front in terms of capacity of the other areas of the plant.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Rivian races to ramp production, established automakers GM and Ford are preparing to launch their own electric pickup trucks. Ford said January 4 it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/ford-double-production-lightning-pickup/">nearly double production capacity</a> of its upcoming electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck to 150,000 vehicles a year by mid-2023 in response to customer demand. The first deliveries of F-150 Lightning pickup trucks are expected in spring 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of the hugely popular encrypted communications app Signal, announced today in a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that he is stepping down in a move that he says has been in the works for several months.</p>
<p>While unexpected, the move seems tied in some way to the rise of <a href="https://mobilecoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MobileCoin</a>, a cryptocurrency startup that counts Marlinspike as its earliest technical advisor.</p>
<p>Last spring, eight-year-old Signal, which has more than 40 million monthly users, began testing out an integration with MobileCoin, which says it&#8217;s focused on enabling privacy-protecting payments made through “near instantaneous transactions” over one’s phone. But as Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-cryptocurrency-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported last week</a>, a &#8220;much broader phase of that experiment has quietly been underway since mid-November. That&#8217;s when Signal made the same feature accessible to all of its users without fanfare, offering the ability to send digital payments far more private than a credit card transaction—or a Bitcoin transfer—to many millions of phones.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255851" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>MobileCoin founder Joshua Goldbard told the outlet that the rollout has spurred massive adoption of the cryptocurrency, telling Wired that &#8220;there are over a hundred million devices on planet Earth right now that have the ability to turn on MobileCoin and send an end-to-end encrypted payment in five seconds or less.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, one needs to load one&#8217;s wallet with the cryptocurrency first, and, as Wired notes, it is listed for sale on only a few smaller cryptocurrency exchanges, including FTX, and none yet offer it to U.S. consumers. (FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is one of many investors in MobileCoin through his quantitative trading firm and cryptocurrency liquidity provider, Alameda Research.)</p>
<p>Even Americans will have access to the currency shortly, however, Goldbard told Wired, pointing to recently signed agreements, including with the cryptocurrency payment processor <a href="https://zerohash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hash</a>, that should allow U.S. residents buy MobileCoin within the first few months of this year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MobileCoin closes on $66 million in equity in Series B round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/mobilecoin-closes-on-66-million-in-equity-in-series-b-round/embed/#?secret=haftyrfcdu" data-secret="haftyrfcdu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the meantime, going worldwide has been good for MobileCoin, which last summer raised $66 million in Series B funding at a $1.066 billion valuation and, according to sources close to the company, is in the process of raising a Series C round at a valuation that one source describes as &#8220;in the high single-digit billions&#8221; of dollars.</p>
<p>MobileCoin&#8217;s growth has also raised questions about Signal and about Marlinspike, who has seemingly tried to maintain some distance between himself and MobileCoin. One apparent reason why centers on Signal employees, some of who told reporter Casey Newton last year that they viewed Signal&#8217;s exploration of cryptocurrency as <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/-the-battle-inside-signal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risky</a> and an invitation for bad actors to use the platform.</p>
<p>A potentially bigger, but related, concern of critics is that integrating a privacy coin could cause legal headaches for Signal. As Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University, told Wired last week, &#8220;I&#8217;m very nervous they&#8217;re going to get themselves into a problematic situation by flirting with this kind of payment infrastructure when there&#8217;s so much legislation and regulation around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a valid concern. As we&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/">noted  previously</a>, cryptocurrencies and messaging apps haven’t historically mixed well owing to nervous regulators. Kik Messenger, the mobile messaging app founded by a group of University of Waterloo students in 2009, created a digital currency called Kin for its users to spend inside the platform. The project ultimately led to a years-long battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission that nearly decimated the company. Telegram, a much bigger messaging app than Signal — it claims more than 500 million monthly active users — similarly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoned plans</a> to offer its own decentralized cryptocurrency to anyone with a smartphone after years of battling with the SEC.</p>
<p>Even Facebook hasn&#8217;t been able to gain much traction with its own cryptocurrency project, with the longtime leader of that effort, David Marcus, announcing back in November that he was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810220/facebook-crypto-david-marcus-novi-diem-meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the company</a>.</p>
<p>If Marcus shows up at MobileCoin, we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised, but we&#8217;d be even less surprised to see Marlinspike get more involved in some capacity. Or not.</p>
<p>Neither Goldbard nor Marlinspike has responded to our requests today for more information. Asked if Marlinspike might consider taking over MobileCoin as CEO (the company does not have one), a source close to him says he is &#8220;not doing that&#8221; and that is he is right now just &#8220;taking a break.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Signal, Marlinspike writes in his post that he will remain on its board while Signal&#8217;s search for a new CEO continues. Its executive chair, WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, will serve as Signal&#8217;s interim CEO in the meantime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peer-to-peer car-sharing startup Turo has released its filing to become a publicly traded company in the United States, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/car-sharing-startup-turo-has-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">a process the company began confidentially in August</a>.</p>
<p>The S-1 document filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not include terms for its offering.</p>
<p>Turo, which was founded in 2010 and has been compared to Airbnb for cars, allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through the startup&#8217;s website or app. The company boasts 85,000 active hosts and 160,000 active vehicle listings in over 7,500 cities as of September 30, 2021. Car owners get the chance to offset ownership costs, and users get the benefit of affordable short-term rentals at a time when <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=increase+in+rental+car+prices&amp;oq=increase+in+rental+car+prices&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j69i65l2j69i61.2423j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">rental car prices are increasing due to pandemic-induced supply chain issues</a>. Challenges in the traditional car rental industry have certainly allowed Turo to gain some market share, despite steep competition, but that popularity has come with a cost at times, a reading of the risk factors portion of the S-1 shows.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Quick financial breakdown</h2>
<p>First let&#8217;s take a look at the financials.</p>
<p>In 2020, Turo generated net revenue of $149.9 million in 2020, a 6% growth from the previous year, according to the S-1. Net losses were $97.1 million in 2020, a slight improvement from the $98.6 million in net losses it had in 2019.</p>
<p>Turo points to a couple of drivers of its revenue growth, notably a digital tool called the Turo Risk Score. This feature, which launched in April 2020, dynamically adjusts the fees that Turo charges guests to complete a booking. Turo said this tool, along with hosts increasing the prices for vehicles that they charge to guests, contributed to its increased net revenue.</p>
<p>In 2021, sales and losses skyrocketed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Turo says it generated $330.5 million in net revenue in the first nine months of 2021, a whopping 207% increase from $107.8 million for the same period in 2020. Its net losses also expanded as well. Turo reported a net loss of $129.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $51.7 million for the same period in 2020.</p>
<p>The reason? Turo notes in its S-1 that revenue increased as the number of days booked rose along with gross booking value per day.</p>
<p>Scanning the S-1, it also appears that Turo tried to do more with less in 2020 and has since turned the financial faucet back on this year. The company tightened its spending in 2020 with operating expenses dropping from $133.9 million in 2019 to $95.8 million in 2020.</p>
<p>The first nine months of 2021 tell a different story. The company&#8217;s operating expenses in the first nine months of the year were $124.01 million compared to $71.6 million during the same period last year. Turo also says it hit adjusted EBITDA — a modified profitability metric  — of $69.8 million in the first nine months of 2021. It achieved that in spite of that $129 million net loss because of a $174.7 million change in the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability.</p>
<h2>Risk factors</h2>
<p>Risk factors facing the company include the obvious &#8220;what if people don&#8217;t use Turo&#8221; and &#8220;we face competition&#8221; from similar apps and traditional car rental companies. But a few others stick out.</p>
<p>For one, Turo notes that the COVID-19 pandemic added volatility to its business. The company was forced to layoff staff and even closed its operations in Germany in 2020, only to have the business come roaring back to &#8220;above pre-Covid levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car rental app notes it may face liability for criminal activities of its hosts. There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any lawsuits or fines, yet but in August last year, <a href="https://www.kvoa.com/news/n4t-investigators-peer-to-peer-car-rentals-being-used-for-human-smuggling-a-growing-trend/article_ec4477e4-5c73-11ec-8715-8701a56cffa4.html">Turo and other peer-to-peer rental apps were found to have been used by criminals for human trafficking</a> and other crimes, a trend that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection admits is a growing trend near the border.</p>
<p>Turo is also liable for lawsuits from cities — or more specifically airport authorities — that would require the long-time startup to obtain rental car permits. And in this area, Turo has in fact been sued and countersued. There have been four lawsuits regarding airport use and three of them, including one initiated by Turo versus the City of Los Angeles, have yet to be settled.</p>
<h2>Opportunities and growth</h2>
<p>Despite potential risks, Turo estimates its current serviceable addressable market to be $146 billion and its total addressable market to be $230 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate that our $230 billion TAM includes $134 billion in North America, $65 billion in Europe, and $31 billion in the rest of the world (which consists of selected countries in which we believe we have a medium- to long-term opportunity to onboard hosts),&#8221; according to the filing.</p>
<p>Notably, the company appears to be ready to expand its operations within its home U.S. market as well as internationally. It also is ready to make some strategic acquisitions and partnerships &#8220;to offer our hosts and guests services and features that we do not currently offer in-house.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 10, 2022! For those of you sad that it’s winter, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/bitcoin-slips-under-the-40000-mark/">bummed that bitcoin took hits today</a>, take heart. We have lots of neat news for you today, including the evolution of lab-grown meat, a mega-acquisition in the gaming space, and even some good news for startups hoping to land an accelerator spot! Don’t frown; it’s going to be OK! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/">Y Combinator boosts investment terms</a>: Gone are the days when seed-stage startups raise $37 and fuel themselves with ramen. With Big Tech salaries scaling into the stratosphere, the startup game is a different sort of wager than it once was, given that there are more pathways to tech wealth than there were in decades past. Y Combinator is following the times, boosting its traditional check to startups in its accelerator by tacking on $375,000 in the form of a SAFE. Other accelerators, it’s your move.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/take-two-to-acquire-mobile-gaming-giant-zynga-for-12-7b/">Take-Two buys Zynga</a>: Perhaps the biggest piece of business news in the tech world today not involving startups was the 11-figure deal that will see gaming company Take-Two buy Zynga. The latter company saw its share price skyrocket on the news, which will see it absorbed for a blend of stock and cash. Take-Two’s stock, in contrast, fell around 13% on the announcement.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/career-karma-lands-40-million-to-evolve-into-a-edtech-employee-benefit/">Career Karma lands $40M</a>: You might know Career Karma as a startup that helped folks find the right coding school for themselves. But the startup, now flush with a huge Series B, wants to become the “world’s largest staffing firm,” its CEO told TechCrunch. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> has the story.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>Before we jump into another crop of startup funding rounds, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/startup-fundraising-again-sets-records-as-public-markets-slash-tech-valuations/">want to note a little bit of dissonance in the market</a>. In short, we’re seeing the public markets sell off tech shares, leading to falling multiples and a perhaps less attractive exit environment. On the other hand, the private market appears content to push startup prices higher and higher. Forcing the private and public markets to line up in time could be a painful exercise for startups that miss their growth targets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255847" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/who-watches-the-watchers/">Who watches the watchers</a>? Our own Haje Jan Kamps wrote up a fascinating look at the world of corporate spyware. Your employer is probably watching what you are doing, and Haje has tips. Heck, Yahoo is probably watching me type this up. Hello, corporate overlords!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/with-funding-from-top-investors-gameto-is-aiming-to-delay-even-eradicate-menopause/">Gameto is taking on menopause</a>: Far from the world of enterprise SaaS, there is a universe of startups working on health. But not all of them are working on nootropics or the like. Gameto wants to “solve the problem of ‘accelerated’ ovarian aging to change the trajectory of women’s health and equality,” Connie Loizos reports. The startup is still pretty young, but it’s taking on a market that is, well, half the human population. One to keep an eye on.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/parrot-a-tool-for-digitizing-mexicos-restaurants-takes-in-9-5m/">Parrot wants to help Mexico’s restaurants thrive in the delivery era</a>: The move to a more delivery-and-pickup world has forced restaurants around the world to adapt. But not every market has the same tooling options or local demands. Parrot just raised $9.5 million for its work to help restaurateurs in Mexico use its point-of-sale software to “digitize and take advantage of the home delivery boom to accelerate growth,” we write.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/arive-raises-20m-for-an-instant-delivery-service-beyond-groceries-and-essentials/">Arive raises $20M to instantly deliver electronics</a>: Imagine the so-called instant grocery delivery market, but swap out the foodstuffs for larger, more expensive goods like headphones and beauty products. That’s what Arive wants to build, and it just raised $20 million for its work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/nigerias-thankucash-secures-5-3m-to-build-infrastructure-for-cashback-deals-and-bnpl-services/">ThankUCash raises $5.3M to bring loyalty programs to Africa</a>: The African startup market continues its impressive run of funding events this week, with ThankUCash – a great startup name – raising new capital to help stores on the continent offer loyalty programs and payment services. For the many offline stores in Africa, the startup could prove to be a boon.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/">Ankorstore raises epic $283M Series C</a>: French startup Ankorstore is a unicorn in the wake of its recent huge fundraise. The startup “operates a wholesale marketplace for independent retailers across Europe,” we noted today, which is proving to be a rapidly scalable enterprise.</li>

<p>If you’ve ever seen a lagoon filled with hog waste or driven on I-5 past the cattle feedlots in Coalinga, California, it’s easy to see why there’s so much interest in lab-grown meat.</p>
<p>Conventional factory farming practices cause widespread environmental damage, but industry and consumers have learned to live with in exchange for affordability and convenience. With consumption and population growth steadily increasing, one might even say meat is eating the world.</p>
<p>In a deeply researched report for TechCrunch+, reporter Christine Hall examines the state of the cell-cultured meat industry and identifies many of the startups innovating in the sector, along with related challenges regarding production, cost and consumer interest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Before the first week of the year was even out, Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 with 49 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 6, marking its first flight of the year. The company appears to be planning to keep up a quick clip when it comes to the pace of Falcon 9 flights in 2022, as it&#8217;s readying for a rideshare mission as early as January 13, and another three missions planned before even the end of the month.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255700" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s also making progress on its preparations for the first orbital test launch of its Starship vehicle, with a test of its <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1480326831031173124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1480326831031173124%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Fspacex-launch-tower-arms-starship-lift-simulation%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch tower this week</a> that showed how the tower&#8217;s robotic arms would operate in hefting Starship atop the Super Heavy booster that will provide it with the power to get to space. Depending on approvals, SpaceX could be ready to actually make use of that tower for an orbital test sometime around March.</p>

<h2>NASA&#8217;s new space telescope is all set up</h2>
<p>NASA&#8217;s James Webb space telescope, which should provide more detailed and distant imaging of galaxies beyond our own than ever before, has competed its final set of deployments, meaning all the parts that were supposed to unfurl and set themselves up post-launch have successfully done so.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s got to have the NASA scientists who&#8217;ve been working on Webb breathing a sigh of relief. The telescope now just has to complete some mid-flight thruster burns in order to place it in the planned and correct orbit, and then it&#8217;ll be ready to snap some photos and send them back for study.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>Starlink&#8217;s India woes</h2>
<p>Starlink ran into regulatory problems in India after it set up its own subsidiary to operate in the country. The company had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/spacex-starlink-to-refund-india-government-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refund preorders after the government ordered them to stop providing satellite connectivity</a> in the country without a valid license to do so. Elon Musk has previously been relatively brazen about his view that Starlink doesn&#8217;t necessarily need a license to operate in some global markets.</p>
<p>Shortly after news of the refunds came out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/starlink-india-head-steps-down-after-government-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starlink India&#8217;s lead Sanjay Bhargava announced he&#8217;d be stepping down</a>.</p>
<h2>Other news from TC and beyond</h2>
<p>President Biden nominated <a href="https://twitter.com/Sandra_I_Erwin/status/1480593336863965186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vice Admiral Frank Whitworth</a> as the next director of the <strong>National Geospatial Intelligence Agency</strong>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Understanding the health of your business starts with customer focus: Are you providing breakthrough value to your customers? Is it value that’s so far above and beyond other solutions that it’s worth a prospective customer’s time and effort to switch to you? Is it value that’s so clearly and increasingly a step ahead that they won’t consider other solutions?</p>
<p>That’s what matters most and what drives long-term growth.</p>
<p>Now, how do you measure that success and growth? You need to go beyond surface-level figures: You need to know the metrics that tell you what’s happening in every aspect of your business — the ones deeper than just your averages. Averages lie and can be dangerously misleading.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario: If Jeff Bezos walks into a bar with 100 people, suddenly, on average, the net worth of each individual in that bar is over a billion dollars. Is that useful? Would that lead you to take the right actions? No — averages hide true insights.</p>
<p>It’s convenient to focus only on your overall metrics and averages, like revenue and growth, especially when they look great, and even getting a little more sophisticated — looking at revenue and revenue growth by product, customer segment or geography — still paints an incomplete picture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We experienced this at Intercom, where segmented metrics looked good, yet there were hidden insights that would have held us back if we hadn’t found them and made deliberate changes.</p>
<h2>Time for a checkup: Diagnosing your revenue health</h2>
<p>So what deeper insights do you need to look for, and how do you find them? One of the most useful metrics you can look at for deeper insights is your revenue health by segment.</p>
<p>Every business tracks and reports on total revenue, but you also need to understand the health of your revenue. Revenue health is one way to look at the ongoing value that you are delivering to your customers, in addition to metrics like Net Promoter Scores.</p>

					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>If you’re a SaaS business, you track and report on your annual recurring revenue, and the best ways to measure your revenue health are gross revenue retention (GRR) and net revenue retention (NRR).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gross revenue retention is your ability to retain customers and revenue from those customers. You calculate GRR by taking your total revenue at the start of the period, minus revenue churn during the period, and minus revenue contractions during the period (customers who stay with you, but pay you less) — then divide that all by total revenue at the start of the period.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite facing numerous antitrust lawsuits and tighter regulations in certain markets, Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-services-enrich-peoples-lives-throughout-the-year/">reported</a> new figures indicating record App Store growth in 2021. The company in a press release said it has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-services-enrich-peoples-lives-throughout-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now paid out more than $260 billion</a> to app developers since the App Store first launched in 2008, a number that&#8217;s up from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 billion Apple reported</a> at the end of 2020 &#8212; meaning, in 2021 alone, Apple paid developers a total of at least $60 billion.</p>
<p>That number is a lot larger than the payouts reported in previous years.</p>
<p>For comparison, Apple<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/01/apple-rings-in-new-era-of-services-following-landmark-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> by the end of 2019 had paid</a> developers a total of $155 billion since the App Store&#8217;s debut. The year prior,<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/apple-entrepreneur-camp-kicks-off-as-app-developer-earnings-hit-new-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> it had said</a> that figure was around $120 billion. Reading between the lines, that means payouts to developers jumped by $35 million from 2018 to 2019, then grew by another $45 billion from 2019 to 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255825" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, the payouts number Apple shared no longer helps to provide clarity into the state of the overall App Store&#8217;s economy, as the percentages paid by individual apps will vary.</p>
<p>In more recent years, Apple has adjusted its commission structure to reduce its own cut of developer revenue amid increased <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/technology/antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html">regulatory</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrutiny</a> of its App Store business practices, antitrust complaints and lawsuits &#8212; including the ongoing case with Epic Games, now under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">appeal</a>.</p>
<p>With the launch of Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">Small Business Program announced in November 2020,</a> the company reduced its commission from 30% to 15% on qualifying apps (those that earned up to $1 million per year). In 2021, Apple also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">dropped commissions</a> for select news publishers&#8217; apps if they chose to participate in its Apple News Partner Program. Apple hasn&#8217;t said how many developers and publishers have actually taken advantage of these opportunities, only that a &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of apps would qualify for the small business discount.</p>
<p>In announcing another App Store record, Apple seems to be toeing a fine line between its usual self-promotion and not calling too much attention to its outsized gains. The company noted App Store customers had spent &#8220;more than ever&#8221; between Christmas Eve and New Year&#8217;s Eve in 2021, driving double-digit growth from last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, Apple didn&#8217;t offer any hard numbers to document this milestone as it had last year, when it had then noted consumers spent $1.8 billion on digital goods and services during the week between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve 2020, driven largely by spending on games.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s figures follow what has otherwise been a transitional year for the App Store.</p>
<p>The company has seen more developer pushback over App Store scams, which became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/apple-downplays-complaints-about-app-store-scams-in-antitrust-hearing/">a topic for a Congressional hearing</a>, as well as the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/28/app-store-review-process-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing difficulties with the App Review</a> process. Apple this year was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">ordered</a> to make App Store changes that would have permitted links to third-party payment options as a result of the Epic lawsuit ruling, but was later granted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">a last-minute reprieve</a> from the court order while the case is appealed. However, Apple has had to loosen its grip over the App Store in other markets, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/">Japan</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">South Korea</a>, where regulators pushed Apple to allow links to external websites and took other measures to curb its commissions.</p>
<p>In addition to its App Store figures, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-services-enrich-peoples-lives-throughout-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple also offered updates</a> on its other services businesses, including Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News+, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, Apple Pay and Wallet, Apple Maps and iCloud+.</p>
<p>Of note, Arcade now features more than 200 games, Apple Music now has 90+ million songs in lossless audio, Apple TV+ has won 190 industry awards, Apple Fitness+ has grown to include nearly 2,000 sessions of workout content, Apple News remains the No. 1 news app everywhere it&#8217;s available, Apple Pay has reached nearly 60 countries and regions, and customers used 30 million NFC tickets in Apple Wallet in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Be it virtual, in-person or some mix of the two, CES is a beast. How could you keep up with all of the news flooding out of the show? You can&#8217;t, really. The big outlets each put a small army on CES coverage and only really scratch the surface.</p>
<p>With that in mind, and with CES 2022 now wrapped, we figured it was worthwhile to bring it all together in one neat little box — a recap of our top stories of the week, the trends we noticed and some of our favorite bits. It&#8217;s by no means exhaustive, but it&#8217;ll give you a good sense of the show if you were too busy to pay attention in real time.</p>
<h2>The top stories</h2>
<p>We wrote up many, many, <em>many</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">news items from CES</a>. Can&#8217;t read them all? Here&#8217;s some of the stuff that folks read and shared the most:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255786" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2253428" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253428" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2253428" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bmw_flow.gif?w=680" alt="BMW color changing car CES 2022" width="680" height="309" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253428" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-shows-off-a-color-changing-car/">BMW shows off a color-changing car</a></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s like something out of a sci-fi flick: push a button, and your car changes color.

<p>Rather than any one headset or &#8220;killer app&#8221; making VR an overnight ubiquitous thing, its story so far has been one of incremental progression — and CES this year moved it a few more steps down the road.</p>

<p>Metaverse? Metaverse! &#8220;Metaverse&#8221; was by far the buzziest word at CES this year, even if a few companies&#8217; use of the word was&#8230; questionable.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/lets-talk-ces-gadgets/">Gadgets galore</a></strong></p>
<p>The organization behind CES might not want anyone to call it &#8220;Consumer Electronics Show&#8221; anymore (as it aims to broaden its scope to all of technology, not just the electronic bits), but there are still lots, and lots, and <em>lots</em> gizmos and gadgets to be found. Heater took a look at some of the most interesting ones.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/startups-at-ces-showed-that-age-tech-can-help-everyone/">Elder tech can help everyone</a></strong></p>
<p>As much as we&#8217;d love to pretend otherwise, we all get old. Before we know it, we&#8217;ll have a generation of seniors that grew up from day one with the internet always within reach. How can tech evolve to help older people live more comfortably? From robot companions to lightbulbs that might help detect falls, Catherine Shu rounded up the latest advancements in elder tech.</p>
<h2>Our favorite bits</h2>
<p>We spent the last week with our heads buried in CES news — and, for much of the CES team, it was our seventh or eight or zillionth time doing so. What stood out to us? Here&#8217;s some of the stuff we&#8217;re still thinking about.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/john-deeres-self-driving-tractor-arrives-later-this-fall/">John Deere&#8217;s self-driving tractor</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The average age of the American farmer is 57.5 years. Field work is backbreaking, intensive and increasingly difficult to staff. Farming is one of those roles that makes a lot of sense to automate, something John Deere has been working for several years to perfect. Available later this year in select U.S. Markets, the 8R finally brings full autonomy to the company’s popular tractor line, with a number of features currently in the works.</p>
<p>— Brian Heater</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/mercedes-benzs-vision-for-the-future-is-an-ultra-efficient-luxury-620-mile-range-ev/">Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s Vision</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This isn&#8217;t just a concept car that will never see the light of day. Mercedes tapped the expertise of its R&amp;D department, Formula 1 and Formula E teams to develop advanced components for this concept that will show up in future models, starting in 2024.</p>
<p>Of note, they improved the energy density of the battery by making &#8220;significant progress&#8221; in the chemistry of the anodes, which has higher silicon content and advanced composition that allow it to hold considerably more energy than commonly used anodes. Translation: More range packed into a tinier package. Another item that will show up in 2024 includes ultra-thin roof panels that feed the battery system for some extra range.</p>
<p>— Kirsten Korosec</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-shows-off-a-color-changing-car/"><strong>BMW&#8217;s color-changing concept car</strong></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Will you be able to buy BMW&#8217;s color-shifting car any time soon? Probably not. Is it super practical? Nope! Who knows how much it&#8217;ll cost to replace a door panel when someone bumps this thing with a full grocery cart. But one thing I dearly miss about in-person CES is the absurd, &#8220;we made this mostly just to flex&#8221; aspect of it all, and this one fits squarely in that category.</p>
<p>— Greg Kumparak</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/labrador-set-to-deliver-a-robotic-helping-hand-to-homes-in-2023/">The Labrador robot</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We hear a lot about the promise of robotics, but the most useful robots for people aren&#8217;t going to look like us.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re going to be things like Labrador, which is essentially a mobile table. It&#8217;s intended for elderly folks and those who may have trouble with everyday tasks, for example, carrying a plate and a drink from the kitchen to the dining room, or bringing the laundry hamper to the washer. With built-in voice controls you should be able to tell it &#8220;wait in the bedroom&#8221; or &#8220;come to me.&#8221; It&#8217;s the kind of thing that could make a lot of people&#8217;s lives easier, and something I hope we see more of in robotics.</p>
<p>— Devin Coldewey</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/why-it-matters-having-matter-support-for-your-new-smart-home-device/">Mui Lab&#8217;s &#8220;calm&#8221; smart home device</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the more interesting smart home devices at CES was the Mui Labs Matter-ready “muiPlatform” that turns smart home devices into “calmer ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more devices we add to our home, the more we have cluttering up our furniture. Mui Labs lets you embrace a minimalist lifestyle while also enabling your Amazon Alexa to function more like a piece of art on your wall with a visual interface.</p>
<p>— Christine Hall</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bob-the-magic-dishwasher-dragon/">Bob</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>To me, some of the most interesting technologies at CES are about how we can use our limited resources better. With California being in perma-drought, Bob caught my eye.</p>
<p>Bob is a tiny dishwasher aimed at households of 1-2 people, and uses a lot less water than washing dishes by hand. It even has a UV mode to clean items without using any water at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Call it the public service announcement to start off your year: If you&#8217;re working at a startup where IT is a little fuzzy, policies are evolving as the company is being built and the organization is evolving quickly, you&#8217;re at higher risk than usual that your employers are willing to move fast, do things and ask for permission later. It makes sense almost intuitively: Early-stage startups generally don&#8217;t have their crap together, and are moving at a breack-neck speed. Is it legal? Of course not, but in a lot of startup circles, it seems as if the attitude is that if the company is unsuccessful, it&#8217;s a moot point. And if it grows at the speed of a top-tier rapid-growth company, well, you will have enough money and lawyers to figure it out later.</p>
<p>This article was triggered by a conversation I had with a couple of startup employees that wished not to be named at a company you&#8217;ve almost certainly heard of. I wasn&#8217;t able to get enough corroborated information to name the company (don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll keep trying). For now, here&#8217;s a couple of annual reminders, as you&#8217;re leaping into 2022 all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful what you say in the company Slack</strong> &#8211; It may feel like DMs are private, but did you know that <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/1500001548241-Request-to-export-all-conversations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a company admin can export all the DMs that have ever been sent</a> on a Slack instance? Of course, there may be laws against exporting the data, but if you discussed something illegal or immoral in the DMs, you&#8217;re going to have as hard a time explaining that as your boss has explaining how they ended up with a copy of your DMs. Two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right, and you may have a case for suing your employer if your suspicious, over-eager head of IT decides to do some digging around, but that sort of thing is easily avoided by just keeping personal talk to personal channels, and work talk to work channels. Of course, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/elizabeth-holmes-private-text-messages-leak-during-theranos-fraud-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even your texts may not stay private</a>, but at least there&#8217;s a higher bar for getting access to those. And, y&#8217;know, if you are particularly paranoid, there&#8217;s always <a href="https://signal.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signal</a> or <a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram</a>, with expiring messages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Your bosses can monitor your company equipment</strong> &#8211; There&#8217;s often a clause in contracts about how you can and cannot use equipment provided by your company. Some of those things are obvious &#8212; don&#8217;t do illegal things &#8212; but others are more obscure. That&#8217;s all good and well, but read your contract carefully. There may be language that says that your company is allowed to monitor what you do on your computer. I don&#8217;t think that sounds particularly innocent, but it is worded obliquely in a lot of work contracts. In a world where AI tools are becoming more and more powerful, and where you sign a contract that says you&#8217;re completely cool with being tracked, there are a ton of companies (<a href="https://www.activtrak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AktivTrak</a>, <a href="https://activeops.com/lp/workiq-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActiveOps</a>, <a href="https://www.veriato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veratio</a>, to just name a few) that make software that can keep an eye on you, and your employers can install these on your computer with various degrees of stealth and permission from you.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255699" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/activtrak.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255699" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2255699" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/activtrak.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="481" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/activtrak.jpg 1336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/activtrak.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/activtrak.jpg?resize=300,141 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/activtrak.jpg?resize=768,360 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/activtrak.jpg?resize=680,319 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/activtrak.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255699" class="wp-caption-text">AktivTrak claims it is used by 9,000+ organizations, and that its tool can be used to &#8220;Reference detailed logs of user activities and security events to better understand what transpired, when and by whom, while simultaneously providing insights to help ensure compliance.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know about you, but I feel safer already. (Screenshot: <a href="https://www.activtrak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AktivTrak website</a>)</p></div></p>
<p><strong>HR is not on your side</strong> &#8211; The human resources department at your company might be friendly and helpful and lovely, and they may try their best to help resolve workplace issues, but they aren&#8217;t on your side: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/10/hr-has-lost-the-trust-of-employees-here-is-who-has-it-now/">HR works for the company</a>. They are there to protect the company&#8217;s interests. And when your interests and those of the company are at odds, remember that the people who work in HR &#8212; no matter how friendly they are &#8212; still need to pay their bills and have a good working relationship with <em>their</em> bosses after you&#8217;ve quit, been fired or otherwise get moved around within the company. And as James Altucher points out in his column, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/24/how-to-quit-your-job-the-right-way/">eventually, they will fire you</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t owe a company your loyalty</strong> &#8211; Especially in the U.S., where a lot of employment is &#8220;at will,&#8221; i.e. you can be laid off at any time for any reason, you remain employed for as long as the company can afford you, and you&#8217;re contributing to the bottom line. Especially in startups, this is a mercurial universe, because goals and targets can shift from board meeting to board meeting. One month, the engineering department is the be-all and end-all of a company&#8217;s life blood. But the amount of money in the bank account and the fundraising environment can change quickly, and the next month, it could all change. Especially when the going gets tough, it may become tempting for leadership to run the company to its KPIs, and focus only on growth and customer acquisition. In that universe, engineering is of low importance in the short term, and suddenly advertising spend and the sales operation becomes top priority. Even great leaders with solid long-term visions can be forced into making abrupt changes. Loyalty in the professional world is a myth that benefits only the employers; if they need to let you go, they will, so when a recruiter comes knocking, take the call to see how you are priced in the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t quit</strong> &#8211; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If a manager or someone from HR is trying to make you quit on your own accord, as a rule of thumb, it&#8217;s best to resist. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Don&#8217;t quit! A lot of mechanisms (including, in some states, unemployment benefits) </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/dont-get-fired-or-quit-get-laid-off-instead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only apply to you if you&#8217;re laid off</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. If you quit &#8212; and especially if you sign an agreement that you promise not to sue the company &#8212; you hugely weaken your options further down the line.</span></p>
<p><em>Did HR use your Slack DM messages or your emails against you? I&#8217;m talking to a number of startup employees at the moment &#8212; at a few different companies. I want to hear from you. Find me at <a href="mailto:tc@kamps.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tc@kamps.org</a>.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In what appears to be a politically and economically savvy move by General Motors, the automaker said Sunday it recognized California&#8217;s authority under the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/state-and-local-transportation/vehicle-emissions-california-waivers-and-authorizations">Clean Air Act</a> to set its own vehicle emissions standards. GM previously backed the Trump administration&#8217;s efforts to bar the state from enforcing its own rules for new vehicles, a position it reversed soon after President Joe Biden was elected.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s recognition of California&#8217;s much stricter carbon emissions standards, which other states can adopt, means the state will consider the company for fleet vehicle purchases. Other companies on the list include BMW, Ford, Honda, Tesla, Volkswagen and Volvo.</p>
<p>California is the most populous state in the nation,<a href="http://statista.com/chart/9358/us-gdp-by-state-and-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> contributing 14.8% of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product</a>; to be blacklisted from the state because of a cantankerous desire to continue producing cars with higher emissions would be economic suicide. TechCrunch reached out to GM to learn why the company decided to send the letter now and how it fit in with its broader strategy, but GM did not immediately respond.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255754" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Omar Vargas, VP and head of global public policy for GM, swore fealty to California&#8217;s emissions sovereignty in a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2022/01/09/gm-recognizes-calif-emission-standards-opening-door-fleet-sales/9153355002/">shared with The Detroit News</a> on Sunday, just days after the company&#8217;s commercial electric vehicle unit, BrightDrop, shared considerable growth plans over the next few years. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/gms-brightdrop-brings-on-walmart-as-new-ev-customer-fedex-ups-existing-order/">At CES, the company announced Walmart as its newest customer</a> with a reservation of 5,000 e-delivery vans. In addition, existing customer FedEx upped its order from 500 EVs to 2,000, many of which will hit the streets of Los Angeles first.</p>
<p>The OEM also committed on Sunday to speeding out its rollout of zero-emission vehicles in a letter to Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/electric-chevrolet-equinox-chevrolet-blazer-suvs-are-coming-in-2023/">GM added two more electric SUV models under its Chevrolet brand</a> to be produced by 2023, which would join the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/the-chevy-silverado-finally-goes-electric/">two upcoming versions of the Silverado EV</a> pickup. The company has started to deliver the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/first-drive-the-electrifying-gmc-hummer-ev/">GMC Hummer EV pickup truck</a> and is also introducing the Hummer EV SUV in 2023. An electric GMC Sierra is coming to market, likely in 2023 as well.</p>
<p>The letter to Randolph, signed by GM’s vice president of global regulatory affairs and transportation technology policy, David Strickland, also committed to ensuring affordability of its EVs for low-income communities. This would involve improving access to charging infrastructure by providing pre-paid charging cards and creating partnerships to build infrastructure, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the mobile app ecosystem, according to an annual retrospective released today by app intelligence firm <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/q4-2021-data-digest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensor Tower</a>. In the early days of the pandemic, a number of apps saw rapidly increased usage &#8212; like that focused on online shopping, entertainment, business and education, for example. Though much of the world has since opened back up, things aren&#8217;t quite back to normal on the app stores. Some app categories are still seeing download volume well above pre-pandemic levels, while others haven&#8217;t yet fully recovered, the new report found.</p>
<p>Travel apps, naturally, were dealt a major blow by the pandemic, as countries closed their borders to visitors and tourists and in-person events were canceled. In addition, the rise of remote work led to less need for ridesharing apps and others associated with a daily commute. Combined, the travel and navigation app categories were the hardest hit by the pandemic, with installs dropping around 40% in April 2020 compared with 2019 totals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255775" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255775" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255775 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="540" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg 1656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=768,610 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=680,540 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1221 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255775" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255688" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s clear the travel category, as a whole, still lives and dies by COVID&#8217;s ebbs and surges. As things began looking up in the summer months, for example, travel apps started to see a return to growth. And by the peak of summer travel in July 2021, travel apps had nearly reached their 2019 average, Sensor Tower said. But as the Omicron variant emerged, travel apps saw those gains start to subside. As of December 2021, travel apps were again down by 14% compared with 2019 levels, while navigation apps were down by 22%.</p>
<p>Other app categories were less impacted by the day-to-day battles with COVID surges, and may instead represent trends that have shifted for the long term. Business apps are a key example. Installs in this category remain high as many companies embraced full-time remote work &#8212; or have at least have delayed their return-to-office plans amid the Omicron surge. Overall in 2021, business app download growth was still more than double pre-pandemic levels (+102%).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255774" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255774" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2255774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="539" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg 1658w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=768,609 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=680,539 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1217 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255774" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Medical apps, obviously, also saw increased use during the pandemic. (And if they&#8217;re a proxy for how well the fight against COVID is going, then things are not looking good!) The category has climbed significantly from 2019 levels, with download growth up by 187% in December 2021, compared with the monthly average in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other app categories continue to benefit from the pandemic-driven growth, but to a lesser degree. The Games, Health &amp; Fitness and Education app categories, are still up by 39%, 31% and 19%, respectively, over their 2019 levels. Sports apps quickly bounced back when leagues reopened in the second half of 2020, and were up a more modest 3% in 2021 over their 2019 levels.</p>
<p>The normalization of app downloads over the course of the pandemic has varied from country to country, the report also noted. North America saw the quickest return to 2019 totals compared with other regions. Meanwhile, the pandemic&#8217;s impacts lasted longer in Asian markets where games are still nearly 40% higher than pre-pandemic levels as of Q4 2021 and travel app installs are still down by 25%.</p>
<p>In addition, some top U.S. travel apps are above pre-pandemic levels, including those for airlines, vacation rentals and travel agencies even as navigation and rideshare apps remained depressed. In European markets, growth is starting to return but the top apps in each travel subcategory were still lower than their pre-pandemic totals, as were navigation and ride-sharing apps. (See below.)</p>

<p>Sensor Tower notes that its figures don&#8217;t include Apple and Google&#8217;s own pre-installed apps or third-party Android app stores outside of Google Play.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s full report delves into other notable 2021 trends, including cryptocurrency&#8217;s move to mobile over the past year, driving 35% year-over-year growth for the finance category by Q4 2021. In gaming, Garena Fire finally came out on top in terms of downloads, beating out 2020&#8217;s top game Among Us, and 2019&#8217;s winner, PUBG Mobile.</p>
<p>Of course, install growth is only one way of examining the pandemic&#8217;s impacts on the app economy. The increased usage of apps overall has also helped drive consumer spending on apps to new levels. In the third quarter of 2021, apps stores saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/consumers-spent-record-28-billion-in-apps-in-q3-aided-by-pandemic/">record revenues</a> of $28 billion in consumer spending and were on track for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">$133 billion</a> for the full year.</p>

<p>We used to describe celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton as “famous for being famous.” But the TikTok megastars featured on the Netflix docu-soap “Hype House” are famous for being ordinary. Unlike the wealthy offspring of celebrities, this class of superstars shot to stardom virtually overnight, for seemingly arbitrary reasons, all dictated by a mysterious algorithm.</p>
<p>“I know it sounds so dumb. You’re a 20-year-old millionaire. What do you have to be depressed about?” says Alex Warren, a TikTok star with 14.7 million followers. “But that’s what I struggle with. I feel like I’m not allowed to be depressed.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255689" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On “Hype House,” these ordinary-teens-turned-icons agonize over the nature of their chance celebrity status, worrying that their fame will vanish as quickly as it appeared. The eponymous Hype House is one of TikTok’s longest-running <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/09/style/what-is-a-collab-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content houses</a>, where social media stars live together and film videos. This concept isn’t new &#8212; YouTube, Twitch and Vine stars have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/style/tiktok-collab-houses-quarantine-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented</a> with these collaborative, live-in projects for years.</p>
<p>Thomas Petrou (8 million followers) is the de facto manager, though he says he doesn’t take a cut of profits &#8212; he calls himself the dad of the house, but in addition to making sure everyone does their dishes, he makes sure that the Hype House brand can net at least $80,000 per month to stay afloat. His influencer friends like Vinnie Hacker (12.9 million followers), Jack Wright (8.8 million followers), Alex Warren (14.7 million followers) and others live rent-free in the <a href="https://www.redfin.com/CA/Santa-Rosa-Valley/13248-Nightsky-Dr-93012/home/4572146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5 million mansion</a> &#8212; all they have to do is post on the official Hype House TikTok once per month, which generates the venture revenue through ongoing branded content deals. Plus, TikTok now directly pays creators for the traffic they drive on the platform.</p>
<p>The Netflix series marks the end of an era for the Hype House, focusing more on the challenges that these influencers face than the antics of these young millionaires.</p>
<p>All things considered, the videos that these TikTokers post aren’t that different from what any average teenager would post (except that now they post from a mansion). With almost 20 million followers, the official Hype House TikTok features the stars experimenting with new filters, iterating on the latest trends and, of course, dancing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Throughout the eight-episode series, a cloud of anxiety hovers over the scenic Santa Rosa Valley home. Some Hype House members aren’t churning out content on behalf of the group as often as Petrou wants them to, because they feel uninspired and disillusioned. In one scene, some Hype House members try to come up with content ideas while lying on giant beanbags, but the best idea they can think of is to make up a “lit-ass handshake.” They might live rent-free in a beautiful mansion, but they don’t seem to be having fun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alex Warren is grasping at straws, staging stunts that aren’t getting as much online engagement as he wants. Even as he grapples with troubling family situations and a foot injury, he’s terrified to take a mental health break.</p>
<p>“When you stop posting in this line of work, you lose engagement,” Warren explains in a confessional. “You don’t get sick days in this job. If you get a sick day, you lose followers, which is a loss of revenue, which is, you know, your job.”</p>
<h2><strong>The influencer gold rush</strong></h2>
<p>TikTok stardom is becoming comprehensible as a career on the internet, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/not-every-creator-economy-startup-is-built-for-creators/">dozens of startups </a>crop up aiming to help these suddenly famous kids navigate brand deals and partnerships (for a cut of their riches, of course). On YouTube, most early creators found profit through ad revenue, but at least in the platform’s beginning days, there wasn’t the same attention to monetization as there is now. Other platforms are also eager to capitalize on the success of TikTok and its biggest stars &#8212; Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube have spent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> to incentivize creators to post on their platforms, rather than TikTok.</p>
<p>“As an influencer, our whole lives are put on this weird pedestal more so than a traditional celebrity,” Nikita Dragun (14.2 million followers) explains on the show. “You have to become a spokesperson, an activist, a model, a publicist, a manager… You have to be so many things at once.”</p>
<p>In most ways, the growth of creator monetization is a good thing &#8212; there are more tools than ever to help creative people make a living by doing what they love. Even LinkedIn has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedins-eic-talks-about-newsroom-growth-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a team of 40 staff</a> dedicated to working with creators. But at the same time, some creators feel pressure to monetize every aspect of their lives. Part of Warren’s following stems from his posts about his relationship with his girlfriend Kouvr Annon, also a TikTok star with 13.6 million followers &#8212; but Warren struggles to separate their private lives from the content they make, straining their (rarely) off-camera relationship.</p>
<p>In this era of the internet, accelerated by the growth of TikTok, it’s not just about posting videos. It’s about cobbling together as many different revenue streams as you can to make sure that if your platform died tomorrow (it’s happened before &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine/#:~:text=With%20Twitter's%20future%20still%20in,%2Dform%20video%20app%2C%20Vine.">R.I.P. Vine</a>), you’d still have a career. After all, TikTok stars don’t make the bulk of their income from TikTok itself. The fortune comes from brand deals, sponsorships, merch sales, podcasts, reality shows and unexpected forays into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKOptbo-QFw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellendurney/addison-rae-worked-harder-break-into-acting-from-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acting</a>.</p>
<p>“Hype House” emphasizes these creators’ self-awareness about their own mediocrity. They’re charismatic, funny and conventionally attractive enough to entertain the masses, but they know that their fame has more to do with luck than talent, so they worry that their good fortune can be snatched away at any second. They stress about what they would do if they had to return to their hometowns, where many of them have fractured families; they worry about being “canceled.”</p>
<p>“Social media is a numbers game. Your money depends on the numbers,” Warren explains. “If people stop watching as much as I’m putting out, it means I’m doing something wrong, so what am I doing wrong, and how can I get those people back?”</p>
<p>Warren’s anxiety isn’t unfounded &#8212; something as arbitrary as a change in TikTok’s algorithm could hamper his growth. When you’re used to explosive social media growth, how do you handle it when those numbers start to plateau, or worse, plummet?</p>
<p>In addition to worrying about TikTok&#8217;s algorithm, the business model of content houses is similarly unstable. Since starting the venture, the Hype House has faced a number of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/03/26/founders-feud-at-hype-house-gets-nasty-an-armed-guard-a-new-lawsuit-and-a-breakaway-group-of-tiktok-stars/?sh=1385132563f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits</a>, including a dispute with fellow influencer and former Hype House member Daisy Keech. In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5uiyv1EePo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video</a>, Petrou says he&#8217;s spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawsuits. Though the legal issues aren&#8217;t broached on &#8220;Hype House,&#8221; Petrou describes waking up and vomiting due to the stress of running the collective. These content houses should, in theory, ease the burden on independent creators &#8212; by being part of a collective, they have a team surrounding them to workshop ideas, collaborate on videos and bring in an additional income stream from the shared accounts. But instead, &#8220;Hype House&#8221; makes it seem like relying on each other without clear financial agreements only made the stress worse.</p>
<h2><strong>“I don’t get the hype either”</strong></h2>
<p>Among the Hype House social circle is Charli D’Amelio, the most followed person on TikTok with 133 million followers &#8212; Forbes estimated that she was also the highest-paid creator on the platform, earning <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2022/01/07/top-earning-tiktokers-charli-dixie-damelio-addison-rae-bella-poarch-josh-richards/?sh=5c7dc6ef3afa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$17.5 million</a> last year.</p>
<p>“I just like, post, as any other teenager in the world,” D’Amelio said on the reality show that Hulu made about her suddenly famous family. “I was just posting on social media… I don’t know.” As D’Amelio once joked in her TikTok bio, “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/26/charli-damelio-tiktok-star/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don&#8217;t worry i don&#8217;t get the hype either</a>.”</p>
<p>But even the creator economy’s biggest star has doubts about whether her stardom is sustainable. In the pilot of “The D’Amelio Show,” she reveals that she’s thought about what she’ll do if she doesn’t keep making millions, or if the pressure of her lifestyle becomes too much.</p>
<p>“Being on calls with CEOs of companies… I’m like, that’s kind of fun?” D’Amelio says. “So no matter what really happens with social media, I could always go into marketing, because I know how it works. I know the back ends of everything, which is cool.”</p>
<p>It’s bizarre for D’Amelio to have a backup plan when she makes more money in a year than most people will make in their lifetime (plus their children’s lifetimes, plus their grandchildren’s lifetimes… unless one of the grandchildren makes it big on TikTok). But for viewers, the entire point of shows like “Hype House” and “The D’Amelio Show” is to humanize these social media stars. For the production teams, the point is to make Netflix and Hulu money and for the stars themselves, it’s to get an extra paycheck, and help them maintain and bolster their fame&#8230; it’s all terribly meta. They leverage this semi-manufactured vulnerability to make themselves into even bigger stars.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest winner here is TikTok. This has been the app’s appeal all along: Like Alex Warren, you might go from living in your car to living in a mansion, all because people like your short video clips. But it’s lonely at the top, even when you’re living with 10 of the most famous people on the internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With every year, more scientists and academics are very specifically trying to lengthen the lifespan of humans and ensure that those extra years are worth living. Some of these teams are focused on detecting cancer earlier as a means of extending longevity; some are working to improve people&#8217;s metabolism.</p>
<p>A small but growing group is also beginning to focus on menopause, which impacts half the population and whose onset is associated with a long list of health conditions, from higher blood pressure, “bad&#8221; cholesterol and triglycerides, which is a form of fat in the blood, to, even more frighteningly, a greater risk of breast cancer, heart disease and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>The newest outfit focused on the cause is <a href="https://gametogen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gameto</a>, which says it wants to solve the problem of &#8220;accelerated&#8221; ovarian aging to change the trajectory of women&#8217;s health and equality.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255421" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As explained by the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Dina Radenkovic, who studied medicine at University College London and has spent most of her career in computational medicine, ovaries age up to five times faster than any organ in the sense that they stop working far earlier than, say, the liver, or brain, or even skin. While women are born with a certain number of ovocytes &#8212; an immature female sex cell that later gives rise to a fully mature ovum or egg cell &#8212; they eventually run out of these, at which point their ovaries stop functioning as an organ and stop producing the hormones that control women&#8217;s physiology.</p>
<p>One-year-old Gameto wants to help delay that process, or even push it off forever if a woman chooses, by developing a platform for ovarian therapeutics that will initially be used to improve the process of assisted fertility but hopefully, eventually, be used, too, to identify cell therapies that can prevent what Radenkovic describes as the &#8220;medical burden&#8221; of menopause.</p>
<p>How exactly? It&#8217;s still early days and Radenkovic is loath to dive into specifics, but she says that the young company has already begun testing whether ovarian supporting cells could help mature eggs and reduce the number of IVF cycles that women often endure currently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have strong preclinical evidence to believe in our platform,&#8221; she says of the outfit, which is chaired by serial entrepreneur Martin Varsavsky, whose last company, <a href="https://www.preludefertility.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prelude Fertility</a>, has created a nationwide network of fertility centers across the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some notable investors are willing to bet on that early evidence, and on Radenkovic. New York-based Gameto just raised $20 million in funding led by Future Ventures, whose co-founder, Maryanna Saenko, says the firm is &#8220;deeply excited about the prospect of a better standard of care for women undergoing menopause. The suffering caused by menopause is not a biological imperative, and the many complications that come along with menopause, particularly early-onset menopause, can be entirely avoided&#8221; along with today&#8217;s hormone replacement therapies, which she describes as &#8220;blunt hammers, lacking personalization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other participants include Bold Capital Partners, Lux Capital, Plum Alley, TA Ventures, Overwater Ventures, Arch Venture Partners co-founder Robert Nelsen and 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki.</p>
<p>Gameto had previously raised $3 million in seed funding, including from Atomic founder Jack Abraham, SALT Fund, FJ Labs, Yes VC, Coatue Management founder Dan Rose and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>Whatever happens with the startup, the market opportunity is huge, and the thesis &#8212; given that people are living longer &#8212; makes obvious sense. Indeed, look for other startups to begin focusing more squarely on delaying menopause as funding becomes available to them, especially given that researchers have been looking into menopause as a treatable disease for at least several years. (You can check an earlier paper from 2019 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366956/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Gameto already has some competition, including from Celmatix, a 12-year-old company that&#8217;s <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/19/celmatix-delay-menopause-womens-ovarian-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a drug program</a> to slow the depletion of a woman’s ovarian reserve and that similarly hopes to separate a woman’s endocrine function from reproduction.</p>
<p><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/19/celmatix-delay-menopause-womens-ovarian-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Fortune</a>, Celmatix company has already received some institutional support, including a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to work on nonhormonal contraceptives. Early last year, it separately announced a partnership with pharmaceutical giant Bayer and the drug development company Evotec.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startup accelerator Y Combinator <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-standard-deal/">announced</a> this morning that it has updated its terms, providing participating companies with more total cash. The group will now invest $500,000 in batch startups.</p>
<p>The money comes in two different forms. The first is the well-known Y Combinator equity deal, worth $125,000 for 7% of accelerated startups. The group will now also offer $375,000 in the form of an uncapped SAFE note &#8212; a simple agreement for future equity &#8212; with a &#8220;most favored nation&#8221; clause.</p>
<p>Uncapped means that there is no defined maximum price at which the $375,000 SAFE will convert to shares, while the &#8220;most favored nation&#8221; language ensures that Y Combinator gets as good a deal as anyone else in a later conversion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255659" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That Y Combinator is now offering more capital to startups is not surprising; indeed, that it took this long for the group to update its terms is the bigger surprise. Still, a half-million dollars is much more in keeping with where the pre-seed and seed-stage investing markets have headed in recent years, namely to larger dollar amounts at higher prices.</p>
<p>The updated terms do not mean that the accelerator itself will have any less preserved upside in portfolio companies. In fact, you could argue that Y Combinator&#8217;s updated terms are defensive in that it is offering more capital in addition, but not in place of, its traditional equity stake in companies that pass through its doors. So the accelerator may be better able to attract the best early-stage startups with larger checks, even as it puts its initial equity investment to work at a price point that has proven historically lucrative.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BqvjmAzRn6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-summer-21-demo-day-part-1/">Our favorite startups from YC’s Summer 21 Demo Day, Part 1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Our favorite startups from YC’s Summer 21 Demo Day, Part 1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-summer-21-demo-day-part-1/embed/#?secret=BqvjmAzRn6" data-secret="BqvjmAzRn6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As an institution, Y Combinator has been updating itself as the startup market has evolved. From a focus on in-person work, YC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">went remote during the pandemic</a>. The result of that switch was more participating startups from other countries and markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">by TechCrunch reckoning</a>. The group has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/citing-concern-over-covid-19-y-combinator-moves-demo-day-online/">moved to remote demo days</a>, something that we&#8217;ve appreciated here at TechCrunch as we no longer have to drive down from San Francisco to a large room with too few chairs.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how rival accelerators react, if at all, to Y Combinator&#8217;s updated terms set.</p>
