										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new auto-injecting pill might soon become a replacement for subcutaneous injection treatments.</p>
<p>The idea for this <a href="https://www.ranitherapeutics.com/technology/">so-called robotic pill</a> came out of a research project around eight years ago from <a href="https://www.incubelabs.com/">InCube Labs</a>—a life sciences lab operated by Rani Therapeutics Chairman and CEO Mir Imran, who has degrees in electrical and biomedical engineering from Rutgers University. A prominent figure in life sciences innovation, Imran has founded over 20 medical device companies and helped develop the world’s first implantable cardiac defibrillator.</p>
<p>In working on the technology behind San Jose-based Rani Therapeutics, Imran and his team wanted to find a way to relieve some of the painful side effects of subcutaneous (or under-the-skin) injections, while also improving the treatment’s efficacy. “The technology itself started with a very simple thesis,” said Imran in an interview. “We thought, why can’t we create a pill that contains a biologic drug that you swallow, and once it gets to the intestine, it transforms itself and delivers a pain-free injection?”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rani Therapeutics’ approach is based on inherent properties of the gastrointestinal tract. An injecting mechanism in their pill is surrounded by a pH-sensitive coating that dissolves as the capsule moves from a patient’s stomach to the small intestine. This helps ensure that the pill starts injecting the medicine in the right place at the right time. Once there, the reactants mix and produce carbon dioxide, which in turn inflates a small balloon that helps create a pressure difference to help inject the drug-loaded needles into the intestinal wall. “So it’s a really well-timed cascade of events that results in the delivery of this needle,” said Imran.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CSxVecwndY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/synthetic-biology-startups-ride-a-wave-of-investor-interest/">Synthetic biology startups are giving investors an appetite</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Synthetic biology startups are giving investors an appetite&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/synthetic-biology-startups-ride-a-wave-of-investor-interest/embed/#?secret=CSxVecwndY" data-secret="CSxVecwndY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite its somewhat mechanical procedure, the pill itself contains no metal or springs, reducing the chance of an inflammatory response in the body. The needles and other components are instead made of injectable-grade polymers, that Imran said has been used in other medical devices as well. Delivering the injections to the upper part of the small intestine also carries little risk of infection, as the prevalence of stomach acid and bile from the liver prevent bacteria from readily growing there.</p>
<p>One of Imran’s priorities for the pill was to eliminate the painful side effects of subcutaneous injections. “It wouldn’t make sense to replace them with another painful injection,” he said. “But biology was on our side, because your intestines don’t have the kind of pain sensors your skin does.” What’s more, administering the injection into the highly vascularized wall of the small intestine actually allows the treatment to work more efficiently than when applied through subcutaneous injection, which typically deposits the treatment into fatty tissue.</p>
<p>Imran and his team have plans to use the pill for a variety of indications, including the growth hormone disorder acromegaly, diabetes, and osteoporosis. In January 2020, their acromegaly treatment, Octreotide, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rani-therapeutics-announces-positive-phase-i-study-results-of-oral-octreotide-using-ranipill-300992818.html?tc=eml_cleartime">demonstrated both safety and sustained bioavailability</a> in primary clinical trials. They hope to pursue future clinical trials for other indications, but chose to prioritize acromegaly initially because of its well-established treatment drug but &#8220;very painful injection,&#8221; Imran said.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Rani Therapeutics <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/rani-therapeutics-nets-69m-to-transform-injections-into-easy-to-swallow-robotic-pill">raised $69 million in new funding</a> to help further develop and test their platform. “This will finance us for the next several years,” said Imran. “Our approach to the business is to make the technology very robust and manufacturable.”</p>

		<a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alradford">Alan Radford</a> is regional CTO of <a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/">One Identity</a> and has a passion for helping organizations solve unique challenges in the identity and access management space. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) is making a major impact across every industry. But many don’t know how common the technology is and may not realize that they are interacting with it regularly. RPA is a growing megatrend — by 2022, Gartner predicts that 90% of organizations globally will have adopted RPA and its received over $1.8 billion in investments in the past two years alone.</p>
<p>Due to the shift to remote work, companies across every industry have implemented some form of RPA to simplify their operations to deal with an influx of requests. For example, when major airlines were bombarded with cancellation requests at the onset of the pandemic, RPA became essential to their customer service strategy.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Throughout 2021, security teams will begin to realize the unconsidered security challenges of robotic process automation.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>According to Forrester, one major airline had over 120,000 cancellations during the first few weeks of the pandemic. By utilizing RPA to handle the influx of cancellations, the airline was able to simplify its refund process and assist customers in a timely matter.</p>
<p>Delivering this type of streamlined cancellation process with such high demand would have been extremely challenging, if not impossible, without RPA technology.</p>
<p>The multitude of other RPA use cases that have popped up since COVID-19 have made it evident that RPA isn’t going away anytime soon. In fact, interest in the usage of RPA is at an unprecedented high. Gartner inquiries related to RPA increased over 1,000% during 2020 as companies continue to invest.</p>
<p>However, there’s one big issue that’s commonly overlooked when it comes to RPA — security. Like we’ve seen with other innovations, the security aspect of RPA isn’t implemented in the early stages of development — leaving organizations vulnerable to cybercriminals.</p>
<p>If the security vulnerabilities of RPA aren’t addressed quickly, there will be a string of significant RPA breaches in 2021. However, by realizing that these new “digital coworkers” have identities of their own, companies can secure RPA before they make the headlines as the latest major breach.</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding RPA’s digital identity</strong></h2>
<p>With RPA, digital workers are created to take over repetitive manual tasks that have been traditionally performed by humans. Their interaction directly with business applications mimics the way humans use credentials and privilege — ultimately giving the robot an identity of its own. An identity that is created and operates much faster than any human identity but doesn’t eat, sleep, take holidays, go on strike or even get paid.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">&#x200d;Eco, which has built out a digital global cryptocurrency platform, announced Friday that it has raised $26 million in a funding round led by a16z Crypto.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Founded in 2018, the SF-based startup’s platform is designed to be used as a payment tool around the world for daily-use transactions. The company emphasizes that it’s “not a bank, checking account, or credit card.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re building something better than all of those combined,” it said in a <a href="https://www.eco.com/introducing-eco">blog post</a>. The company’s mission has also been described as an effort to use cryptocurrency as a way “to marry savings and spending,” according to this CoinList <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinlist-andy-bromberg-eco">article</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Eco users can earn up to 5% annually on their deposits and get 5% cash back when transacting with merchants such as Amazon, Uber and others. Next up: The company says it will give its users the ability to pay bills, pay friends and more “all from the same, single wallet.” That same wallet, it says, rewards people every time they spend or save.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After a “successful” alpha test with millions of dollars deposited, the company’s Eco App is now available to the public.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oen3RpJwWR"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/gemini-is-launching-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">Gemini is launching a credit card with bitcoin rewards</a></p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">A slew of other VC firms participated in Eco’s latest financing, including Founders Fund, Activant Capital, Slow Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Tribe Capital, Valor Capital Group and more than one hundred other funds and angels. Expa and Pantera Capital co-led the company’s $8.5 million funding round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CoinList co-founder Andy Bromberg stepped down from his role last fall to head up Eco. The startup was originally called Beam before rebranding to Eco “thanks to involvement by founding advisor, Garrett Camp, who held the Eco brand,” according to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinlist-andy-bromberg-eco">Coindesk</a>. Camp is an Uber co-founder and Expa is his venture fund.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For a16z Crypto, leading the round is in line with its mission.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/03/05/eco-crypto-fintech/">blog post</a> co-written by <a href="https://a16z.com/author/katie-haun/">Katie Haun</a> and <a href="https://a16z.com/author/arianna-simpson/">Arianna Simpson</a>, the firm outlined why it’s pumped about Eco and its plans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“One of the challenges in any new industry — crypto being no exception — is building things that are not just cool for the sake of cool, but that manage to reach and delight a broad set of users,” they wrote. “Technology is at its best when it’s improving the lives of people in tangible, concrete ways&#8230;At a16z Crypto, we are constantly on the lookout for paths to get cryptocurrency into the hands of the next billion people. How do we think that will happen? By helping them achieve what they already want to do: spend, save, and make money — and by focusing users on tangible benefits, not on the underlying technology.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Eco is not the only crypto platform offering rewards to users. <a href="https://www.lolli.com/">Lolli</a> gives users free bitcoin or cash when they shop at over 1,000 top stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Albertsons Companies, the grocery giant that owns Safeway and Jewel-Osco, has launched a pilot program that will test grocery delivery using remote-controlled delivery robots developed by Silicon Valley startup Tortoise.</p>
<p>The pilot will start at two Safeway locations in Northern California, although Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko said if successful, he expects the pilot to continue to scale to other stores in the state and possibly throughout the West Coast<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Safeway-branded delivery carts equipped with Tortoise&#8217;s sensors and software will be able to deliver goods to customers up to three miles from the store location. Remote-control operators located thousands of miles away will guide the delivery cart to its destination. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The delivery carts, which can </span>hold up to 120 pounds of groceries in four lockable containers, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">will initially</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> have a human escort. The aim is the remove the extra guide once the pilot is established. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Once the delivery cart arrives, the customer receives a text to come outside and pick up their groceries. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121617" style="width: 1070px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121617" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121617 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png" alt="Safeway Tortoise" width="1060" height="676" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png 1060w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1060px) 100vw, 1060px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2121617" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tortoise/Albertsons</p></div></p>
<p>The pilot is the latest example of large retailers adopting technology in a bid to get goods to customers faster. Amazon, Kroger and Walmart are just a few that are experimenting with delivery robots and using autonomous vehicles to shuttle goods to customers or within its distribution network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our team is obsessed with trying new and disruptive technologies that can bring more convenience for our customers,&#8221; Chris Rupp, EVP and chief customer and digital officer said in a statement. &#8220;We are willing to quickly test, learn and implement winning innovations that ensure we are offering the easiest and most convenient shopping experience in the entire industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal is also a validation of Tortoise&#8217;s move into delivery carts, a business pursuit that it kicked off less than a year ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea didn&#8217;t hit us until April,&#8221; Shevelenko said in a recent interview, who added that the first delivery cart was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/remote-controlled-delivery-carts-are-now-working-for-the-local-los-angeles-grocer/">launched in Los Angeles</a> in late October.</p>
<p>Tortoise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/ex-uber-exec-launches-startup-to-autonomously-reposition-electric-scooters-and-bikes/">got its start</a> by equipping electric scooters with cameras, electronics and firmware that allow teleoperators in distant locales to drive electric scooters and bikes to a rider or deliver it back to its proper parking spot. Last spring, as the COVID-19 pandemic raised demand for delivery services, Tortoise adapted its technology to a cart that could shuttle groceries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think about [Amazon] Prime, after that launched everyone expected two-day delivery, and seven days felt like a lifetime.&#8221; Now, two days feels like a lifetime as expectations shift to same-day delivery, he added.</p>
<p>Tortoise initially focused on neighborhood stores and specialty brand shops, through a partnership with an online grocery platform. Shevelenko&#8217;s strategy is to land contracts with big retailers while continuing to partner with online commerce platforms, which would allow it to reach smaller, independent stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech stocks are getting hammered today, with previously high-flying shares of software companies taking even more damage.</p>
<p>For a sector that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/what-the-hell-saas-valuations/">has enjoyed a year in the sun</a>, recent trading sessions have punctured a period of market adoration. It is too soon to say that the market is repricing tech stocks, but the selloff has reached the point of materiality and is therefore something we need to note.</p>
<p>As we write, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is off another 1.2% today after previous declines. The now-infamous ARK Innovation ETF is off 6.5% and the list of individual declines worth noting in the tech sector is very long indeed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The change in sentiment is clear in recent results. Here&#8217;s the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nasdaq Composite 52-week high: 14,175.12</li>
<li>Nasdaq Composite today: 12,561.13</li>
<li><strong>Percent change: -11.4%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And the damage intensifies if we consider just SaaS and cloud stocks. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bvp.com/bvp-nasdaq-emerging-cloud-index">the Bessemer cloud index</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bessemer cloud index 52-week high: 2,884.23</li>
<li>Bessemer cloud index today: 2,185.62</li>
<li><strong>Percent change: -24.2%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In more prosaic terms, the Nasdaq is in a technical <em>correction</em>, while SaaS stocks have reached <em>bear-market </em>territory. That&#8217;s quite a turnabout from recent all-time highs for both.</p>
<h2>Not just software</h2>
<p>Lost on the TechCrunch editing floor from late yesterday is a post we wrote noting the sharp declines in the value of insurtech stocks ahead of the impending public debut of Hippo, another neo-insurance company. The SPAC-led Hippo flotation will not touch down in a warm market. Instead, its contemporaries look like this today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lemonade 52-week high: $188.30</li>
<li>Lemonade current price: $84.72</li>
<li><strong>Change: -55.0%</strong></li>
<li>Root Insurance 52-week high: $29.48</li>
<li>Root Insurance current price: $12.38</li>
<li><strong>Change: -58.0%</strong></li>
<li>MetroMile 52-week high: $20.39</li>
<li>MetroMile current price: $10.04</li>
<li><strong>Change: -50.8%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The damage is widespread. Hell, recent IPO success-story Snowflake announced yesterday that it grew from revenues of $88 million in its year-ago quarter to $190 million in its most recent. And its stock is <em>off</em> more than 7% today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll leave it to you whether the changing public valuations are just a blip or a more staid change in the winds. But it does feel different out there.</p>
<p>For startups, this is all somewhat poor news. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/understanding-how-investors-value-growth-in-2021/">Valuations for public comps were strong in 2020</a>. To lose that halo in 2021 could crimp late-stage valuations, perhaps even reaching back to Series A and B rounds to limit some upside for growing upstarts. But such an impact will lag the public markets, so don&#8217;t expect things to change quite yet.</p>
<p>Still, every private investor has their eye on the exit when it comes to their deals. And if that exit is suddenly shrinking, so too might their interest in paying for quite so great a markup on their next deal.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s traditional around this time that startups in the accelerator reach out to say hello. Provided that they are willing to chat growth metrics, we&#8217;re willing to listen.</p>
<p>Pangea, based in Providence, Rhode Island, is one such company. TechCrunch previously covered the company when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/pangea-app-raises-400k-seed-round-to-help-connect-student-workers-with-businesses/">announced a $400,000 pre-seed round last April</a>. Now most of the way <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/22861">through the YC accelerator</a>, the company dished regarding its recent growth and the fact that it added more capital to its accounts late last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Via the company.</p></div></p>
<p>On the growth side of the coin, Pangea CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/the_pangean">Adam Alpert</a> told TechCrunch the company has grown its gross merchandise volume (GMV) sequentially by 35% in each of the last two months. That&#8217;s a steep pace of GMV expansion. And the growth is adding up to real numbers, with Pangea facilitating $50,000 in transactions between college freelancers and businesses in the last four weeks.</p>
<p>Alpert said that its year-ago number was around $3,000 or $4,000.</p>
<p>And the company has managed to expand its market take rate to around 25%, tinkering with how it charges for its service. The result is a model that might resonate with anyone familiar with Fiverr, and may help the company more rapidly expand its net revenue.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s recent growth comes after it secured another $350,000 in November 2020 at a higher cap to its previously known pre-seed round. And, of course, it raised $125,000 from Y Combinator, funds that landed in its accounts this January.</p>

<p>Pangea is now active in 600 campuses, Alpert said. And it has found where its service is most in-demand, namely among emerging brands and smaller tech startups. Those firms often need the types of services that college kids are good at &#8212; social media, design, etc. &#8212; making them a good fit.</p>
<p>The company was somewhat coy on upcoming product news but was clear that it&#8217;s looking for investing partners as it works toward Series A scale. Let&#8217;s see how Pangea does in a few weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re not digging into another IPO filing today. You can read all about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/first-impressions-of-applovins-ipo-filing/">AppLovin&#8217;s filing here</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/unraveling-thredups-ipo-filing-slow-growth-but-a-shifting-business-model/">ThredUp&#8217;s document here</a>.</p>
<p>This morning, instead, we&#8217;re talking about an old favorite: software valuations. The folks over at <a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a> have compiled a lengthy dive into the 2020 software market that&#8217;s worth our time &#8212; you can <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/497410287/Battery-Ventures-Software-2021-Report">read along here;</a> I&#8217;ll provide page numbers as we go &#8212; because it helps explain some software valuations.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There&#8217;s little doubt that there is some froth in the software market, but it may not be where you think it is.</p>
<p>The Battery report has a lot of data points that we&#8217;ll also work through in this week&#8217;s newsletter, but this morning, let&#8217;s narrow ourselves to thinking about rising aggregate software multiples, the breakdown of multiples expansion through the lens of relative growth rates, and cap it off with a nibble on the importance, or lack thereof, of cash flow margins for the valuation of high-growth software companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1995213 size-medium alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;ll look at the changing public market perspective, and then ask ourselves if the aggregate image that appears is good or not good for software startups.</p>
<p>I chatted through pieces of the report with its authors, Battery&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/brandongleklen">Brandon Gleklen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neerajvc">Neeraj Agrawal</a>. So, we&#8217;ll lean on their perspective a little as we go to help us move quickly. This is our Friday treat. Or at least mine. Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>Rising multiples</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with an affirmation. Yes, software valuations have risen to record-high multiples in recent years. Here&#8217;s the Battery chart that makes the change clear:</p>

It was yet another crazy week, but we did our best to get through as much of it as we could. Here&#8217;s the rundown, in case you are reading along with us!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">Square is buying Tidal</a> in a deal that some are skeptical of, but one about which we found quite a lot to like.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/how-capital-as-a-service-can-help-you-get-your-first-check-in-2021/?tpcc=ECTW2020">How capital-as-a-service can get you your first check in 2021,</a> and a nod to Indie.VC, a pioneer in alternative financing for startups that announced it is shutting down net new investments this year.</li>
<li>Oscar Health <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/oscar-health-prices-ipo-at-39-and-secures-a-9-5b-valuation/">priced its IPO above its raised range</a>, which was good for it in terms of fundraising. However, since its debut the company has lost pricing altitude. Its declines mimic those of other public neo-insurance providers in what could be a new trend.</li>
<li>And sticking to the insurtech beat, Hippo is going public via a SPAC. Because everyone else is?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/compass-files-for-ipo/">Compass filed its S-1</a>, which triggered a debate on how it&#8217;s different than Opendoor.</li>
<li>Coupang&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/coupang-may-raise-up-to-3-6-billion-in-its-ipo-at-a-potential-valuation-of-51-billion/">is also coming</a>, replete with huge growth, an improving profitability picture and a massive valuation. This is one to watch.</li>
<li>There was also a whole global news circuit around grocery delivery startups, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">Instacart raising at a $39 billion valuation</a>.</li>
<li>And we wrapped with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/surreal-profile/">the Surreal seed round</a> that we found to be more than a little spicy. As it turns out, commercialized deepfakes are not merely on the way; they are here.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The man who arguably ushered in the current SPAC rush with the merger of Virgin Galactic with his Social Capital Hedosophia holding company has divested the remainder of his personal holdings in the space tourism company. Chamath Palihapitiya, who serves as the chairman of Virgin Galactic&#8217;s board, still holds 6.2% ownership in the company in partnership with investor Ian Osborne, but his solo holdings are now at zero.</p>
<p>Palihapitiya provided the following statement to TechCrunch via Virgin Galactic:</p>
<blockquote><p>I sold 6M shares for $200M which I am planning to redirect into a large investment I am making towards fighting climate change. The details of this investment will be made public in the next few months. I remain as dedicated as ever to Virgin Galactic’s team, mission and prospects.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Palihapitiya sold 3.8 million shares in December 2020, noting that he was selling that equity &#8220;to help manage [his] liquidity&#8221; in order to provide funding for &#8220;several new projects starting in 2021.&#8221; At the time, Palihapitiya said he &#8220;remained committed and excited fore the future of SPCE [Virgin Galactic&#8217;s stock ticker on the NYSE].&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please note that I filed a Form 4 for the sale of 3.8M shares of SPCE. I sold these shares to help manage my liquidity as I fund several new projects starting in 2021. I remain committed and excited for the future of SPCE. Just wanted to be transparent.<a href="https://t.co/OsUaVgVwKF">https://t.co/OsUaVgVwKF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1339425375063953409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The sale this week comprised 6.2 million shares, netting Palihapitiya roughly $213 million in the process.</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic has had some setbacks in its testing program that pushed the projected date of its first paying commercial tourists flights out into 2022, from an earlier target of sometime this year. The company installed Disney Parks leader Michael Colglazier as its new CEO last July, replacing George Whitesides, who moved into a chief space officer role, before it was <a href="https://spacenews.com/whitesides-steps-down-from-virgin-galactic/">revealed Thursday that he&#8217;s departing the company</a>. Whitesides&#8217; decision is said to be due to a desire to pursue public service opportunities.</p>
<p>Space as a sector has been a hotbed of SPAC activity of late, with mergers from a number of companies including Astra, Spire, Rocket Lab, BlackSky and Momentus announced over the course of the past year. Virgin Galactic, as one of the earliest, will be closely watched by anyone looking for a yardstick by which to measure the tactic. The company&#8217;s share value is down just over 5% pre-market, and has been on a steady decline since reaching an all-time peak around mid-February.</p>

<p>Headquartered in San Francisco and Tokyo, <a href="https://scrum.vc/">Scrum Ventures</a> is known for its accelerator programs focused on sports, food and smart-city tech. Today it announced the launch of a new incubator program that will help startups form business partnerships with Japanese corporations.</p>
<p>Called Scrum Studio, it will be spun out as an independent entity from Scrum Ventures, and headed by Masami Takahashi, who was previously strategy officer and general manager for WeWork Japan. Before that, he led Uber’s operations in Japan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Takahashi told TechCrunch that Scrum Studio is currently focused on the startups in its current accelerator programs (Sports Tech Tokyo, SmartCityX and Food Tech Studio), but plans to launch new programs in the future that also center on specific verticals. Through Scrum Studio, startups will be able to establish subsidiaries in Japan, or form joint ventures with Japanese companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://startupgenome.com/article/rankings-top-40">Startup Genome</a>, Beijing, London, Silicon Valley, Stockholm and Tel Aviv are some of the world&#8217;s best startup ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data and research organisation uses factors like performance, capital, market reach, connectedness, talent and knowledge to produce its rankings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup ecosystems from emerging markets excluding China and India didn&#8217;t make the organisation&#8217;s top 40 list last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a known fact that these regions lag well behind in all six factors, and decades might pass before they catch up to the standards of the aforementioned ecosystems.</span></p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.pariti.io/">Pariti</a>, a Kenyan B2B management startup founded by<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/yacob-berhane-38981541"> Yacob Berhane</a> and <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/wayele">Wossen Ayele</a>, wants to close the gap on three of the six factors &#8212; access to capital, knowledge and talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These issues, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that of access to capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is heightened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, only 25% of funding goes to early-stage startups in Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://docs.preqin.com/reports/Preqin-Venture-Capital-In-Emerging-Markets-May-2018.pdf">compared to</a> more than 50% in Latin America,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MENA and South Asia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to build a solution that will help startups be successful that otherwise would not have been able to get the resources they needed,&#8221; CEO Berhane told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This problem is especially acute in Africa because it’s particularly nascent, but this platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is designed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for founders across emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anywhere that doesn’t have a mature, healthy startup ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how is the team at Pariti setting out to solve these problems? Ayele tells me that in one sense, Pariti is like an unbundled accelerator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a typical accelerator, founders will need to go through an intense program where they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are loaded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with information on all the things a startup will likely need to know at some point in their growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas with Pariti, founders get the needed information or resources that are immediately relevant to helping them get to the next stage of the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>A three-way marketplace</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a founder joins Pariti, they run their company through an assessment tool. There, they share pitch materials and information about their business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti then assesses each company across more than 70 information points ranging from the team and market to product and economics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Pariti benchmarks each company against its peers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies in the same industry, product stage, revenue and fundraising are some of the comparisons made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder gets a detailed assessment with feedback on their pitch materials, the underlying metrics that they can use to develop their business and their ability to raise capital down the line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This approach gives us an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> granular view of their businesses, its strengths, weaknesses and allows us to triage the right resources to the founder based on their particular needs,&#8221; Ayele said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn&#8217;t end there. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti also connects the founders for one-on-one sessions with members of its global expert community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their backgrounds, according to Ayele, run the gamut from finance and marketing to product and technology across a range of sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti also provides vetted professionals for hire from its community if a founder needs more hands-on support building a product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayele says founders can continue to go through this process </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> times, getting assessed, implementing feedback and connecting with resources and talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On another end, Pariti allows investors to sign up on its platform, thereby collating data on their preferences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So once a startup wants to raise capital, the platform matches them with investors based on their profile and preferences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’ve built an algorithm-based matching platform where we curate relevant deals to VC investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also simplify the investor reach-out process for founders, which is a huge pain </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">point &#8212; especially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this ecosystem,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Ayele added. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Pariti helps founders connect with affordable talent, access capital and develop their businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professionals can find interesting opportunities to mentor startups and get paid gig opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also get more exposure to the early-stage ecosystem while tracking their progress, verifying their skills and increasing earning potential. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nvestors can run </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lean operations with access to proprietary deal flow, automated deal filtering and on-demand experts to support due diligence, research and portfolio support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the COO, the company has seen a tremendous amount of value built through the platform so far. A testament to this is an experience shared by Kiiru Muhoya, founder of Kenyan fintech startup Fingo Africa with TechCrunch, on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the platform helped him raise a $250,000 pre-seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that after going through Pariti&#8217;s assessment ahead of a planned fundraiser, he realized that the market he was targeting was too small</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, he needed to learn more about what VCs were looking for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muhoya decided to switch to being at the other end of things. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the expert platform on Pariti, he began to review companies and provided feedback to other founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This led him to take some months off to pivot his business based on Pariti&#8217;s first feedback and what he had learned from the expert platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He took his startup through another assessment on the platform and thus closed the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has made significant strides since launching in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has over 500 companies across 42 countries, 100 freelance experts and 60 investors using its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane also adds that five funds currently use Pariti&#8217;s operating system for their deal management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we’re building the rails for how ventures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and scaled in emerging markets. We have partners in place across emerging markets, including Latin America and India. We also have a strong interest in the United States, where we see a real need for our platform,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Berhane said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It charges a subscription model for investors, but Berhane wouldn&#8217;t disclose the numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He says that Pariti will begin to charge a subscription fee for founders as well. Another revenue stream comes when</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors or founders pay a certain transaction fee when using Pariti&#8217;s freelance experts for projects. The same happens when there&#8217;s any fundraise executed from the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about fundraising, the company recently secured an undisclosed pre-seed capital from angels and VCs like 500 Startups, Kepple Africa and Huddle VC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it hasn&#8217;t been smooth sailing for Pariti, as one issue that has stood out in dealing with founders and investors is trust</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane says founders have shared some horror stories about engaging with investors, while investors have shared trust concerns about founders reporting false numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti tries to address this by providing NDAs for both parties where the company will not share founders&#8217; data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with investors until they want it to be shared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  And investors won’t get deals that Pariti hasn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thoroughly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vetted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both founders are of East African descent &#8212; Berhane from Eritrea and Ayele from Ethiopia &#8212; and crossed paths a couple of times but took different routes to be where they are now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Image Credits: Khadija M Farah &amp; Rebecca Ume Crook</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayele started his career at a consulting shop with offices across East Africa before moving back to the U.S. for law school</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, he got his first exposure to the early-stage startup world and worked with an emerging markets-focused VC fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I could see how technology and innovation could play a role in helping communities &#8212; whether it’s through financial inclusion, access to essential goods and services, connecting people at the base of the pyramid to markets,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon graduation and completion of his legal training, Ayele headed back to Nairobi to get involved with its growing African startup ecosystem, where he and Berhane founded the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO who studied finance and investment banking in the U.S. moved back to Africa to start a pan-African accelerator in Johannesburg, South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While he has worked in managerial positions for companies like the African Leadership University and Ajua, Berhane spent most of his time </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brokering deals for them, which ultimately led him to start Pariti. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After helping businesses raise more than $20 million and seeing how that money led to job creation and upward mobility for employees, I knew there was a path I could have that would be meaningful within finance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I continued to think about the growing asymmetry of access to capital, talent and knowledge in the startup ecosystem and the lack of infrastructure addressing it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pariti was how we wanted to solve it,&#8221; Berhane said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The annual meetings of the Chinese parliament and its advisory body are underway in Beijing this week. Top executives from some of China&#8217;s largest tech firms are among the thousands of delegates who attend and put forward their opinions. Here is a look at what the tech bosses are proposing for China&#8217;s digital economy.</p>
<h3>Pony Ma</h3>
<p>More regulatory scrutiny is needed for the country&#8217;s budding internet economy, Tencent&#8217;s founder and CEO Pony Ma says in one of his proposals, according to a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UhD7GBQiU_FsBYZ-bA9sAg">report</a> from the state-backed People’s Posts and Telecommunications News. As a delegate of the National People&#8217;s Congress, Ma has submitted more than 50 proposals during the parliament meetings over nine consecutive years, said the report.</p>
<p>Specifically, Ma calls for strict governance on peer-to-peer finance, bike sharing, long-term apartment rental and online grocery group-buying, fledgling areas that have also seen businesses go bust amid cash-hemorrhaging competition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ma&#8217;s comment comes at a time when regulators are tightening their grips on the country&#8217;s tech giants. In recent months, the government has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">launched probes into Alibaba</a> and other tech firms over anti-competitive practices and proposed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/chinas-internet-regulator-takes-aim-at-forced-data-collection/">a sweeping data law</a> that will limit how platforms collect user information.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fUE1jt2SsW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">China&#8217;s e-commerce titan Alibaba hit with antitrust probe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s e-commerce titan Alibaba hit with antitrust probe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/embed/#?secret=fUE1jt2SsW" data-secret="fUE1jt2SsW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h3>Lei Jun</h3>
<p>In China&#8217;s grand plan to move up the manufacturing value chain, Xiaomi, which makes smartphones and a slew of other hardware devices, has been keen to help factories upgrade.</p>
<p>Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, a delegate of the NPC, recognizes China is late to smart manufacturing, lacks home-grown innovation and is over-reliant on foreign technologies, he says in his <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xC1AvwdjzyEbFGaOryitCA">proposal</a>. Research and development efforts should be directed to key components such as cutting-edge sensors and precision reducers for factory robots, he says.</p>
<p>China also lacks the talent for advancing factory innovation, Lei points out, thus government policies should support corporations in attracting foreign talent and cultivating collaboration between industries and academia.</p>
<h3>Robin Li</h3>
<p>As part of its artificial intelligence pivot, Baidu, China&#8217;s biggest search engine service, has invested heavily in smart-driving tech. Regulation is a major hurdle for autonomous driving firms like Baidu that need large volumes of data to train algorithms, and the rate at which testing permits are issued varies greatly across regions.</p>
<p>Robin Li, CEO of Baidu and a member of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference, <a href="https://weibo.com/2525235360/K4se88o2o?refer_flag=1001030103_&amp;type=comment#_rnd1614923758760">urges</a> regulators to be more innovative and pave the way for legal and at-scale commercialization of autonomous driving. A mechanism should be created for various government agencies, industry players and academia to collectively promote the commercial deployment of autonomous driving.</p>
<p>In addition, Li calls for more senior-friendly technologies, greater public access to government data, and better online protection for underage users in China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sicepat.com/">SiCepat</a>, an end-to-end logistics startup in Indonesia, announced today it has raised a $170 million Series B funding round.

<p>In a press statement, The Kim Hai, founder and chief executive officer of SiCepat&#8217;s parent company Onstar Express, said the funding will be used to &#8220;further fortify SiCepat&#8217;s position as the leading end-to-end logistics service provider in the Indonesian market and potentially to explore expansion to other markets in Southeast Asia.&#8221; SiCepat claims to be profitable already and says that it was able to fulfill more than 1.4 million packages per day in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The logistics industry in Indonesia is <a href="http://www.gbgindonesia.com/en/services/article/2013/indonesia_s_logistics_sector.php">highly fragmented</a>, which means higher costs for businesses. At the same time, demand for deliveries is increasing thanks to the growth of e-commerce, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>SiCepat is one of several Indonesian startups that have raised funding recently to make the supply chain and logistics infrastructure more efficient. For example, earlier this week, supply chain SaaS provider Advotics announced a $2.75 million round. Other notable startups in the space include Kargo, founded by a former Uber Asia executive, and Waresix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>Insurance agents spend hours handling paperwork and grabbing client information over the phone. A new seed-stage startup, <a href="https://www.insurgrid.com/">InsurGrid</a>, has developed a software solution to help ease the process, and make it easier for agents to serve existing clients &#8212; and secure new ones.</p>
<p>InsurGrid gives agents a personalized platform to collect information from clients, such as date of birth, driver’s license information and policy declaration. This platform helps agents avoid sitting on long calls or managing back-to-back emails, and instead gives them one spot to understand how all their different clients function. It is starting with property and casualty management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup integrates with 85 insurance carriers, serving as the software layer instead of the provider. Using the InsurGrid platform, insurers can ask clients to upload information and within seconds be registered as a policyholder. This essentially turns into a living Rolodex that insurers can use to access information on the account, and offer quotes on a faster rate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121451" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121451" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121451 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png" alt="" width="1024" height="589" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png 4170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=1536,884 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=2048,1179 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121451" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: InsurGrid</p></div></p>
<p>There’s a monetary benefit in providing better service. Eden Insurance, a customer of InsurGrid, said that people who submit information through the platform converted at an 82% higher rate than those who don’t. Jeremy Eden, the agency owner of Eden Insurance, said they were able to show consumers that its plan was $300 cheaper than its existing rate.</p>
<p>At the heart of InsurGrid is a bet from the founding team that legacy insurance agents aren’t going anywhere. Co-founder/CEO Chase Beach pointed out that the majority of the $684 billion of annual property and casualty insurance premiums in the United States is distributed by approximately 800,000 agents working in 16,000 brokerages. So far, InsurGrid works with more than 150 of those agencies.</p>
<p>When asked if InsurGrid ever had plans to offer its own insurance, similar to insurtech giants Hippo, Lemonade and Root, Beach said that it is solely working on innovating around the sales process for now. He said that these big companies, which have either recently gone public or are planning to, still rely on agents to be successful.</p>
<p>“Instead of us replacing the insurance agent, what if we gave them that same level of technology of a Hippo or large carrier,” Beach said. “And provide them with the digital experiences so they can compete in 2021.”</p>
<p>As time goes on, he sees insurance agents taking the same role that financial advisors or real estate agents take: “very much involved in the process because they are that expert.”</p>
<p>Other startups that have popped up in this space include Gabi, Trellis and Canopy Connect. The differentiator, the team sees, is that Beach comes from a 144-year-old insurance legacy, giving him key insights on how to sell to agents in a successful and effective way. It is starting with sales, but expect InsurGrid to expand to other parts of the insurance process as well.</p>
<p>To help them compete with new and old startups, InsurGrid recently raised $1.3 million in pre-seed financing to help it fulfill its goal to be the “underdog for the underdogs,” Beach said. Investors include Engineering Capital, Hustle Fund, Vess Capital, Sahil Lavingia and Trevor Kienzle.</p>

<p>Backing the company is Blossom Capital, Creandum and Index Ventures, with Dija seemingly able to raise pre-launch.

<p>Over the last few months, a host of European startups have launched with the promise of delivering grocery and other convenience store items within 10-15 minutes of ordering. They do this by building out their own hyper-local, delivery-only fulfilment centres &#8212; so-called &#8220;dark stores&#8221; &#8212; and recruiting their own delivery personnel. This full-stack or vertical approach and the visibility it provides is then supposed to produce enough supply chain and logistics efficiency to make the unit economics work, although that part is far from proven.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this week, Berlin-based Flink announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt. The company didn&#8217;t break out the equity-debt split, though one source told me the equity component was roughly half and half.</p>
<p>Others in the space include Berlin’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, London’s Jiffy and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, and France’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo</a>, all of which also claim to focus on fresh food and groceries. There’s also the likes of <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, which is still in stealth and more focused on a potentially higher-margin convenience store offering similar to U.S. unicorn goPuff. Related: goPuff itself is also looking to expand into Europe and is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">in talks to acquire or invest in the U.K.’s Fancy</a>, which some have dubbed a mini goPuff.</p>

<p>However, let&#8217;s get back to Dija. Founded by Alberto Menolascina and Yusuf Saban, who both spent a number of years at Deliveroo in senior positions, the company has opened up shop in central London and promises to let you order groceries and other convenience products within 10 minutes. It has hubs in South Kensington, Fulham and Hackney, and says it plans to open 20 further hubs, covering central London and Zone 2, by the summer. Each hub carries around 2,000 products, claiming to be sold at &#8220;recommended retail prices&#8221;. A flat delivery fee of £1.99 is charged per order.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only competitors that we are focused on are the large supermarket chains who dominate a global $12 trillion industry,&#8221; Dija&#8217;s Menolascina tells me when I ask about competitors. &#8220;What really sets us apart from them, besides our speed and technology, is our team, who all have a background in growing and disrupting this industry, including myself and Yusuf, who built and scaled Deliveroo from the ground up&#8221;.</p>
<p>Menolascina was previously director of Corporate Strategy and Development at the takeout delivery behemoth and held several positions before that. He also co-founded Everli (formerly Supermercato24), the Instacart-styled grocery delivery company in Italy, and also worked at Just Eat. Saban is the former chief of staff to CEO at Deliveroo and also worked at investment bank Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>During Dija&#8217;s soft-launch, Menolascina says that typical customers have been doing their weekly food shop using the app, and also fulfilling other needs, such as last-minute emergencies or late night cravings. &#8220;The pain points Dija is helping to solve are universal and we built Dija to be accessible to everyone,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It’s why we offer products at retail prices, available in 10 minutes &#8212; combining value and convenience. Already, Dija is becoming a key service for parents who are pressed for time working from home and homeschooling, as one example&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite the millions of dollars being pumped into the space, a number of VCs I&#8217;ve spoken to privately are skeptical that fresh groceries with near instant delivery can be made to work. The thinking is that fresh food perishes, margins are lower and basket sizes won&#8217;t be large enough to cover the costs of delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be the case for other companies, but almost everyone at Dija comes from this industry and knows exactly what they are doing, from buying and merchandising to data and marketing,&#8221; Menolascina says, pushing back. &#8220;It’s also worth pointing out that we are a full-stack model, so we’re not sharing our margin with other parties. In terms of the average basket size, it varies depending on the customer&#8217;s need. On one hand, we have customers who do their entire grocery shop through Dija, while on the other hand, our customers depend on us for emergency purchases e.g. nappies, batteries etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>On pricing, he says that, like any retail business, Dija buys products at wholesale prices and sells them at recommended retail prices. &#8220;Going forward, we have a clear roadmap on how we generate additional revenue, including strategic partnerships, supply chain optimisation and technology enhancements,&#8221; adds Menolascina.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, TechCrunch has learned that prior to launching its own app, Dija ran a number of experiments on takeout marketplace Deliveroo, including selling various convenience store items, such as potato chips and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. If you&#8217;ve ever ordered toiletry products from &#8220;Baby &amp; Me Pharmacy&#8221; or purchased chocolate sweets from &#8220;Valentine&#8217;s Vows,&#8221; you have likely and unknowingly shopped at Dija. Those brands, and a number of others, all delivered from the same address in South Kensington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going direct to consumer without properly testing pick &amp; pack is a big risk,&#8221; Menolascina told me in a WhatsApp message a few weeks ago, confirming the Deliveroo tests. &#8220;We created disposable virtual brands purely to learn what to sell and how to replenish, pick &amp; pack, and deliver&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Square acquires Tidal</strong></p>
<p>Square announced this morning that it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">purchased a majority stake in Tidal</a>, the music streaming service founded by Jay-Z. It sounds like an odd fit at first, which Square CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged in a tweet asking, &#8220;Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His answer: &#8220;It comes down to a simple idea: finding new ways for artists to support their work. New ideas are found at the intersections, and we believe there’s a compelling one between music and the economy. Making the economy work for artists is similar to what Square has done for sellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Square is paying $297 million in cash and stock for the deal, which will result in Jay-Z joining Square&#8217;s board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">it was acquiring Auth0</a> yesterday for $6.5 billion, the deal raised eyebrows. After all, it&#8217;s a substantial amount of money for one identity and access management (IAM) company to pay to buy another, similar entity. But the deal ultimately brings together two companies that come at identity from different sides of the market &#8212; and as such could be the beginning of a beautiful identity friendship.</p>

			The deal ultimately brings together two companies that come at identity from different sides of the market &#8212; and as such could be the beginning of a beautiful identity friendship.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>On a simple level, Okta delivers identity and access management (IAM) to companies who use the service to provide single-sign-on access for employees to a variety of cloud services &#8212; think Gmail, Salesforce, Slack and Workday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://auth0.com">Auth0</a> is a developer tool providing coders with easy API access to single-sign-on functionality. With just a couple of lines of code, the developer can deliver IAM tooling without having to build it themselves. It’s a similar value proposition to what Twilio offers for communications or Stripe for payments.</p>
<p>The thing about IAM is that it’s not exciting, but it is essential. That could explain why such a large number of dollars are exchanging hands. As Auth0 co-founder and CEO Eugenio Pace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/auth0-founder-code-boss/">told TechCrunch’s Zack Whittacker</a> in 2019, “Nobody cares about authentication, but everybody needs it.”</p>
<p>Putting the two companies together generates a fairly comprehensive approach to IAM covering back end to front end. We’re going to look at why this deal matters from an identity market perspective, and if it was worth the substantial price Okta paid to get Auth0.</p>
<h2>Halt! Who goes there?</h2>
<p>When you think about identity and access management, it’s about making sure you are who you say you are, and that you have the right to enter and access a set of applications. That’s why it’s a key part of any company’s security strategy.</p>
<p>Gartner found that IAM was a $12 billion business last year with projected growth to over $13.5 billion in 2021. To give you a sense of where Okta and Auth0 fit, Okta just closed FY2021 with over $800 million in revenue. Meanwhile Auth0 is projected to close this year with $200 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>

<p>Among the top players in this market according to <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/access-management-leader-gartner-magic-quadrant/?gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpLGH3w8bVX7Ef3yCO0qSXSiLhb4rVHEdcjcI93oRewG942kAAWxH0BoCEIMQAvD_BwE&amp;utm_campaign=search_google_amer_multiple_ao_it_nb-priority_bmm&amp;utm_content=482009063244&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_page={url}&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=%2Biam%20%2Bmagic%20%2Bquadrant">Gartner’s November 2020 Magic Quadrant</a> market analysis are Ping Identity, Microsoft and Okta in that order. Meanwhile Gartner listed Auth0 as a key challenger in their market grid.</p>
<p>Michael Kelley, a Gartner analyst, told TechCrunch that Okta and Auth0 are both gaining something from the deal.</p>
<p>“For Okta, while they have a very good product, they have marketing muscle and adoption rates that are not available to smaller vendors like Auth0. When having [IAM] conversations with clients, Okta is almost always on the short list. Auth0 will immediately benefit from being associated with the larger Okta brand, and Okta will likewise now have credibility in the deals that involve a heavy developer focused buyer,” Kelley told me.</p>
<p>Okta co-founder and CEO Todd McKinnon said he was enthusiastic about the deal precisely because of the complementary nature of the two companies’ approaches to identity. “How a developer interacts with the service, and the flexibility they need is different from how the CIO wants to work with [identity]. So by giving customers this choice and support, it&#8217;s really compelling,” McKinnon explained.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s no overstating it: 2020 was a hell of a year. When future generations learn about 2020, the pandemic, social tension and political unrest will take up most of the oxygen. But for those learning about the history of cybersecurity, 2020 and a midsize company from Austin, Texas — SolarWinds — will take center stage.</p>
<p>Malicious code in one update of a trusted software provider was the Trojan horse that enabled access to petabytes of private data across <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-russia-sanctions-solarwinds-hacks/2021/02/23/b77039d6-71fa-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html">18,000 organizations</a>, including Fortune 500s and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">government entities</a>.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Why will SolarWinds be so generationally important, and why am I talking about it? Because the large (and growing) impact of the hack and the substantial (and mounting) losses mean that every business leader must acknowledge what many in cybersecurity have been saying — cyber strategy <em>is</em> company strategy. It is not an audit, but an important part of C-suite strategies and best practices ranging from employee onboarding to mundane everyday coding.</p>
<p>I believe generational startups will be created from this reckoning with cybersecurity, just as they’ve been created coming out of market disruptions in the past. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karanortman/2020/07/15/why-the-merging-of-the-devops-driven-cloud-and-cyber-security-will-create-dozens-of-new-category-leaders/?sh=7810663d347f">I’ve been thinking about this for a while</a>, but it is more clear than ever that we will see cyber go on a tear this next decade.</p>
<p>Forecasts suggest $100 billion of new market value by 2025 alone, putting total market size at close to $280 billion, but I think this figure is conservative. Cyber is — and will be — a massive business.</p>
<p>One key driver of growth in the cyber market is really easy to understand, but really hard to solve for: data. Cyber is often a second-order value proposition, after speed of development, managing IT assets or data. We’re familiar with the idea that “data is the new oil.” Since that phrase was coined by mathematician Clive Humby 15 years ago, the total amount of data in the world has increased 74x.</p>
<p>By 2025, IDC <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2018/11/27/175-zettabytes-by-2025/?sh=224587055459">forecasts</a> the data universe will consist of 175 zettabytes. In case you don’t know, one zettabyte is <em>1</em> <em>trillion</em> gigabytes. If you were to download 175 zettabytes of data on your computer, it would take you 1.8 billion years. Mind-boggling!</p>
<p>And it only increases exponentially from here. From likes, posts, profile views, follows and RTs for end consumers to time on site, conversion rate and bounce rate for websites to events, errors and anomaly tracking in IoT — all of this data is logged and tracked. We’ve seen billion-dollar companies built, taken public and acquired that ingest and visualize all of the data we capture.</p>
<p>The next generation of API startups is valuable proportionally to their ability to “talk” with apps in the ecosystem by sharing and ingesting data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For founder Najette Fellache, coming to the Bay Area a few years ago from Nantes, France was a way to grow a company she&#8217;d founded and which was already beginning to count major U.S. corporations like GE, Tesla, Amazon, and Medtronics as customers.</p>
<p>What that six-year-old outfit, <a href="https://speach.me/">Speach</a>, sells is essentially knowledge-sharing between colleagues via videos produced by the employees themselves, often to augment written instructions. The idea is to maximize learning, fast, and investors liked it enough to provide Speach with $14 million in funding.</p>
<p>But while the technology has only become more relevant in a world shut down by COVID-19, an internal project within the company began to interest Fellache even more after her children abruptly began attending school remotely from home. As she tells it, her aha moment came in the form of a drawing from her youngest son, who struggled to understand why his mother&#8217;s meetings kept taking precedent over him.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2121261" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121261" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121261 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121261" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credit:</strong> Najette Fellache</p></div></p>
<p>Like many parents trying to figure out how to balance work and family over the last year, Fellache wasn&#8217;t immediately sure of how to parent around the clock while also leading a company. Unlike a lot of parents, she had access to engineers who could create a technology that enabled her, along with other members of Speach&#8217;s team, to make short videos that could quickly communicate important information and be viewed at the recipient&#8217;s convenience &#8212; as well as saved for future reference.</p>
<p>In fact, as sometimes happens with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/"> internal projects</a>, the technology worked so well for Speach that it has since taken on a life of its own. Indeed, using a bit of that earlier funding from Speach &#8212; its backers are Alven and Red River West, a fund co-managed by Artémis, the investment company of the Pinault family &#8212; Fellache and a team of 10 employees this week launched <a href="https://beeweet.com/">Weet</a>, a new asynchronous video startup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y3ReoJo529"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/">The Slack origin story</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Slack origin story&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/embed/#?secret=y3ReoJo529" data-secret="y3ReoJo529" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s entering a crowded field. Fellache is hardly alone in recognizing the power of asynchronous meetings as an attractive alternative to phone calls, real-time meetings and even email, where tone is often lost and content can be misconstrued. <a href="https://www.loom.com/login">Loom</a>, for example, a six-year-old enterprise collaboration video messaging service that enables users to send short clips of themselves, has already raised at least $73 million from investors, including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Coatue.</p>
<p>Another, newer entrant is <a href="https://supernormal.com/">SuperNormal</a>, a year-old, Stockholm, Sweden-based work communication platform that employs video and screen recording tools to help teams create and send asynchronous video updates throughout the day and which raised <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/supernormal-funding/">$2 million</a> in seed funding led by EQT Ventures in December.</p>
<p>Still, if you believe that the future of work is remote, it&#8217;s clear that the opportunity here is a big one. Further, Weet &#8212; which is accessible for free via a browser extension and whose integrations with both Slack and Microsoft Teams are scheduled to go live next month &#8212; is fast becoming a better product than some of what&#8217;s available in the market already, says Fellache.</p>
<p>Weet already features instant recording, screen sharing, virtual backgrounds, video filters, emoji reactions, commenting options and auto transcription. For a premium paid version in the works, it is also developing features that will make it easier to organize discussions for users. Imagine, for example, a salesperson looking for communications about a potential client and wanting notes from those auto-transcriptions that are presented together in one email to that individual.</p>
<p>As for privacy, Fellache points to the data management expertise that Speach has developed over time working with clients like Airbus and Colgate-Palmolive that are acutely mindful of privacy. Weet &#8212; which Fellache says is already being used by units inside Colgate-Palmolive &#8212; employs the same standards and practices.</p>
<p>Weet is seemingly taking a different approach on the marketing front, too. Fellache says while some rivals enable users to publish one video at a time, Weet is a more conversational tool where teammates and contacts can create sections of the same video for a back-and-forth, sending video feedback, audio feedback, sharing their screen or reacting with emoticons.</p>
<p>Put another way, Weet enables not only the exchange of more critical information but can invite more interaction broadly and, presumably, strengthen team relationships in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a discussion, not a transaction,&#8221; Fellache offers, and that&#8217;s important, she suggests. As she has seen firsthand, in a world where teams are increasingly scattered around the globe, open communication is more central than ever to a company&#8217;s success &#8212; and that of its employees.</p>
