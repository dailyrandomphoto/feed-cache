										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dijanow.com/">Dija</a>, the London-based grocery delivery startup backed by Blossom Capital, Creandum and Index Ventures, has acquired Cambridge, U.K.-based Genie, in what looks in part like an acqui-hire.</p>
<p>The deal, for which terms remain undisclosed, will see Genie founders Tim Chan and Callum MacBeth join the Dija team and also includes company assets. Having launched Genie in Cambridge, a U.K. city known for its university, they&#8217;ll be tasked with supporting Dija&#8217;s growth outside of London.</p>
<p>Founded by Alberto Menolascina and Yusuf Saban, who both spent a number of years at Deliveroo in senior positions, Dija launched in London earlier this month and is just one of a host of European startups that promise to deliver grocery and other convenience store items on-demand. They do this by building out their own hyper-local, delivery-only fulfilment centres — so-called “dark stores” — and recruiting their own delivery personnel. This full-stack or vertical approach and the visibility it provides is then supposed to produce enough supply chain and logistics efficiency to make the unit economics work, although that part is far from proven.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other dark store operators include Berlin’s Flink, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt, and Berlin HQ’d <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, which has raised $44 million in Series A funding and recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-getir-int-idUSKBN29O1E7">expanded to London</a> in addition to Germany and Netherlands. Also operating in London are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-getir-int-idUSKBN29O1E7">Getir</a>, and <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, with Jiffy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/jiffy-grocery/">expected to launch soon</a>. The U.S. unicorn goPuff is also reportedly looking to expand into Europe and has held<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/"> talks to acquire or invest in the U.K.’s Fancy</a>.</p>
<p>Dija currently has four warehouse hubs operating in South Kensington, Fulham, Islington and Hackney that deliver groceries and other convenience products within a claimed 10 minutes. It plans to open 20 further hubs, covering central London and Zone 2, by the summer. Each hub carries around 2,000 products, claiming to be sold at “recommended retail prices”. A flat delivery fee of £1.99 is charged per order.</p>
<p>In a statement, Dija co-founder and CEO Alberto Menolascina said: “Our ambitions aren’t limited to inside the M25. I’m delighted that Tim and Callum are joining the Dija family to ensure more people can access this reliable and efficient service across the UK and Europe.”</p>
<p>Adds Genie co-founder and CEO Tim Chan: &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to join forces with the team at Dija and continue our shared mission to bring everyday items to your door in a matter of minutes. For our existing customer base this deal means access to more products, better prices and even faster delivery times. We&#8217;ve had a tremendous response in Cambridge so far, and look forward to bringing Dija to many more regions across the U.K. in the coming months.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoom, Microsoft and Google all rocketed to the top of the charts in the virtual meetings stakes during the pandemic but a plucky startup from Norway had others ideas. Video meeting startup <a href="https://whereby.com/">Whereby</a> has now raised $12 million from German VC <a href="https://www.pointnine.com/">Point Nine</a>, SaaStr fund and a group of more than 20 angel investors.</p>
<p>Angels investors include Josh Buckley(CEO, Producthunt), Elizabeth Yin (Hustlefund) and Jason M. Lemkin (founder of Saastr).</p>
<p>Øyvind Reed, CEO at Whereby said in a statement: “The past year has led many of us to question the future of work, with video meetings set to remain a big part of our lives. More than ever, the tools we use to connect have to enable effective and enjoyable meetings, providing focus, collaboration and wellbeing. .”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whereby’s platform has three pricing plans (including free) and allows users to embed tools like Google Docs, Trello and Miro directly in their meetings, unlike other video platforms.</p>
<p>Whereby was demonstrated to me by co-founder Ingrid Ødegaard on a coffee table during 2016’s Oslo Innovation Week. I immediately set-up my username, which has existed even as the startup changed it name from Appear.in. Ingrid told me during an interview that they &#8220;tried to be much more human-centric and really focus on some of the human problems that come with collaborating remotely. One of the big mistakes that a lot of people making is just replicating the behavior that they had in the office… whereas we think that you actually need to work in a fundamentally different way. We want to help people do that and by making it really easy to jump in and have a meeting when you need to. But our goal is not to push people to have more meetings, quite the opposite.”</p>
<p>The startup’s secret weapon is enterprise integrations. If you had a video meeting with a UK GP over video in the last year it was probably over Whereby (indeed, mine was!). Whereby won a contract with the NHS for its remote video patient consultations during the pandemic. Competitors for this include Jitsi and AccurX. The company claims it saw a 450% increase in users across 150 countries last year.</p>
<p>“Last year we saw the mass adoption of video meetings,” said Christoph Janz, Partner at Point Nine. “Now it’s about taking the user experience to the next level and Whereby will be leading that charge. It’s amazing to see a Scandinavian startup playing in the same league as the tech giants.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video streaming platforms have signed up more subscribers during Covid-19 lockdowns, and that <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-video-streaming-market">growth is expected to continue after the pandemic</a>, showcasing more international content. When subtitles are well done, they don’t take audiences out of the immersive experience of a good show or movie. This means as content providers tackle worldwide expansion, demand for localization services, including translated subtitles, is also growing.<a href="https://www.iyunomg.com/"> Iyuno Media Group</a> is one of the largest media localization companies, and works with clients including Netflix, Apple iTunes, DreamWorks, HBO and Entertainment One.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since Iyuno was started in 2002 by executive chairman David Lee while he was an undergraduate in Seoul. Back then it provided mainly English to Korean subtitles for television networks. &#8220;I started the business in my last year of university and, of course, back then we didn’t have any video streaming services,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our client base was mostly local and some regional broadcasters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Iyuno, whose investors include SoftBank Ventures Asia, provides localization services for about 600,000 hours of content on an annual basis, including translation, subtitling, dubbing, accessibility features and compliance with local content regulations, in more than 80 languages. It operates 35 facilities across 30 countries in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Iyuno also<a href="https://www.iyunomg.com/news/press-releases/iyuno-media-group-enters-agreement-to-acquire-sdi-media"> announced in January</a> that it has entered into an agreement with Imagica Group to acquire SDI Media, another localization provider.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In order to make the current scale of its services possible, Iyuno built its own cloud-based enterprise resource planning software. The platform enables uploading of files from content providers, and includes features for time coding, translation, content and technical quality control, and distribution back to Iyuno&#8217;s clients. It onboards, trains and assesses new freelancers, and gives teams working on the same project a central base.</p>
<p>Iyuno also built its own neural machine translation engines, which are trained on data from specific genres (for example, drama, animation, comedies, horror and documentary), and help its teams work more accurately and quickly.</p>
<h3>Localizing entertainment in a more connected world</h3>
<p>Being able to guarantee consistent results with fast turnaround times is especially important now that OTT services are erasing international and cultural barriers between audiences, and the shows and movies they watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good shows, even in non-English languages, perform well in other countries,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;Because of Covid, productions have been majorly affected. OTT providers need fresh content to keep subscribers and are licensing non-U.S. content in countries where it hadn’t been licensed a lot in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parrot Analytics <a href="https://www.axios.com/americans-consuming-foreign-entertainment-content-8b793e14-f493-4c13-ba4f-e4bddd7a96e1.html">recently told Axios</a> that non-American shows accounted for nearly 30% of demand in the United States during the third-quarter of 2020. That trend began before the pandemic, but production shutdowns meant many networks and streaming services began showing more international content to meet audience demands.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pandemic accelerated cord cutting, making 2020 the worst-ever year for pay TV&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/pandemic-accelerated-cord-cutting-making-2020-the-worst-ever-year-for-pay-tv/embed/#?secret=TgVpIOXJJ2" data-secret="TgVpIOXJJ2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means localization services are not only working with more shows and movies that were originally filmed in non-English languages, but also translating it into a wider array of languages, which involves a lot of teamwork.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a single language for a single hour of video running time, it usually takes around five or six different steps, and four or five different individuals,&#8221; including translators and quality control checkers, said Lee.</p>
<p>For content that is translated into a single other language, Iyuno hires people who can listen to the show and translate at the same time, without having to use a script. Files from Iyuno&#8217;s clients are uploaded onto its platform and proxy files are generated with watermarks and other security measures. Then the translator gets a link to the video. After they are done adding their translation, the subtitled content goes through a preset quality control process, and then is formatted and delivered back to the client.</p>
<p>The process for translating content into several different languages follows a similar procedure, except the original language is first transcribed into a script, and then sent to translators so they can work as a team. Then subtitled content is sent to a central quality control team to make sure it is consistent before being delivered to the client.</p>
<p>For some content, like live broadcasts or episodes of television dramas that are edited shortly before airing, Iyuno can provide very quick turnaround times, typically 24 hours, but sometimes as little as one or two hours. In those scenarios, Iyuno begins recording when the show starts airing. Then it divides the footage into 10-minute segments that are sent to teams of three people: a time coder, translator and quality control checker, who usually work from home and are logged into Iyuno&#8217;s ERP platform. It takes about an hour to translate each 10-minute section, so that means six teams are usually involved at the same time during an hour-long process.</p>
<h3>Preserving an immersive experience</h3>
<p>Quality control includes ensuring subtitles and other localization features for a show maintain consistent quality across languages, and also checking technical factors, since there are more than 100 subtitle formats. Iyuno&#8217;s quality checkers make sure subtitles are placed unobtrusively on the screen, don’t obscure important details and avoid overlapping between dialogue from different characters or scenes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to have buffers because reading speed is usually slower than hearing speed,&#8221; said Lee. Iyuno&#8217;s platform has scene detection tools, which analyzes video and automatically organizes subtitles so they don&#8217;t roll over into another scene.</p>
<p>Creating accessibility features currently accounts for about 5% to 10% of Iyuno&#8217;s business and is growing. That includes audio descriptions for people with visual impairments, which means adding narration that describes what is happening on screen, and closed captions with descriptions of all the sounds that are happening in a show.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a growing demand and it’s very important for clients, who are keen to serve those audiences,&#8221; said Lee.</p>
<p>One of the things translators need to do when working on shows is to keep the original intent of the creator in languages with different colloquialisms or cultural nuances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a subtitler, and it’s usually not a very dry job of translating the foreign language into ours, or the other way around,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;It’s really immersing yourself into the content, so at times you forget to translate because you’re watching the show and understanding the feeling, laughs, sadness or character dynamics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iyuno&#8217;s machine translation engines are able to help with the process by performing the initial translation, so human translators can focus more on a show’s creative aspects.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s more a subjective and qualitative thing. It’s hard to put into technical words, but we try to find efficiencies to reinforce that creativity,&#8221; Lee added. &#8220;At the same time, most of our translators had that learning and experience before they came to the company, so they’re aware that those are aspects they need to deal with and, in many cases, I think that’s where a machine can never substitute a human.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This Friday, the European Commission will be launching a ‘legislative instrument’ called the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/startup-europe">EU Startup Nations Standard</a> (SNS) at its annual <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/events/digital-day-2021">Digital Day</a>. Now, before you think I&#8217;m about to bore you to death, you might like to know that the SNS is a <em>huge political initiative</em>. It will aim to make the European Union the most attractive place to create a startup, in comparison with obvious global leaders like the US. Therefore, its significance is not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>The idea is for EU Member States to implement a set of ‘best practice’ policies for startups (many of which already exist in parts of the EU), ranging from startup visas to better implementation of stock options in company law. If EU member states all sign up to the EU’s ideas, the hope is that startups get better conditions, stay in the EU rather than leaving for the US (or, now, the UK&#8230;) and the SNS will mean more peer-pressure between Member States to get all these conditions right.</p>
<p>Sources close to the European Commission tell me that the &#8211; yet unreleased &#8211; SNS will be wide-ranging and call on EU member states to implement several startup-friendly policies, launched during the Portuguese Presidency of the EU, a country where startups are now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/lisbons-startup-scene-rises-as-portugal-gears-up-to-be-a-european-tech-tiger/">flourishing</a>. Member States which become signatories of the Standard will be expected to deliver on a number of policy areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I have seen leaked drafts of the SNS and it clearly includes some big proposals, assuming they are all contained in the final, published draft. They include the expectation that signatories will need to change national rules around stock options to ensure employee share ownership is not subject to capital gains tax until the moment of cash receipt. They will also need to allow startups to issue stock options with non-voting rights; fast-track the process of creating a new company to within one day for 100 EUR; accelerate visa processing for tech talent from outside the EU, and incentivize the return of EU tech-talent. There is also an exhortation to leverage the €750bn of Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) to support startups, and reduce regulatory red tape and the create regulatory sandboxes. For many EU countries, it should be relatively easy, for others, there will be some legislative hurdles to leap. But most observers say these provisions are over-due and necessary.</p>
<p>EU-based campaign groups are, generally speaking, wildly in favor of the SNS. <a href="https://alliedforstartups.org/">Allied For Startups</a> tells me they are “enthusiastic about the potential of the instrument”. They say the provisions are a collection of best practices that already exist, challenge member states to do more, and set ‘binary challenges’ that states can either fulfill or not (like launch a startup online in a day). But that depends if all the things they hope for come to pass. They are waiting with bated breath to find out if the provisions have been watered down or how many Member States sign up to it all.</p>
<p>There are other groups that are enthusiastic but also concerned. <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu">Not Optional</a>, a policy initiative funded by Index Ventures, has, this week, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jwXuER105ZW8PtK5vZk9G0ryUwcSUwA9kU25TYm0udI/edit">published an open letter</a> signed by many of Europe’s leading investors, startup associations and entrepreneurs including those who founded Stripe, Personio, Klarna, Wise, Trustpilot, UiPath and Alan.</p>
<p>The letter welcomes the EU’s Startup Nations Standard, in particular its specific recommendations to Member States on “changes to stock options rules designed to help startups attract talent, speed up tech visas targeting and procurement.”</p>
<p>However, the group is also urging EU Member States to turn the recommendations into actual national legislation, and not just stay on the books at the EU Commission.</p>
<p>Not Optional points out that its own <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu/en/country-ranking">ranking</a> of European nations’ stock options policies showed dramatically stark differences around how EU members states treat the issues, with, for instance, Latvia, Estonia and France ranking highly, while founders in Germany, Spain, and Belgium still face barriers when they try to use stock options to incentivize staff and attract talent.</p>
<p>But we are not out of the woods yet.</p>
<p>While there is enthusiasm emanating from the corridors of Brussels, my sources tell me that some countries, such as Germany, may be looking to water the SNS down in some aspects. In particular, Germany has been kicking up a fuss about the startup-in-a-day provision, on the grounds that identity checks may take longer. Given the UK, an EU member until only recently, has had this capability for at least 10 years, Germany&#8217;s protestations seem somewhat over-egged.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2019/09/19/crowdyvest-holding-launches-bus-hailing-service-plentywaka/">Plentywaka</a>, a Nigerian bus-booking platform, today announced that it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been accepted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/toronto">Techstars Toronto</a> accelerator program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will join nine other startups in the class of 2021 and secure funding from the accelerator as it sets its sights on global expansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lagos-based company, founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/onyekaakumah">Onyeka Akumah</a>, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/johnny-enagwolor-99b83766">Johnny Ena</a>, John Shaibu and Afolabi Oluseyi, operates an &#8216;Uber-for-buses&#8217; model connecting commuters with buses via an app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plentywaka launched in September 2019, and in the first two months, moved an average of six people daily, according to CEO Akumah. By its sixth month, this number increased to about 1,500 daily, and the company completed more than 100,000 rides within that timeframe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in March 2020, the pandemic-induced lockdown hit businesses across Lagos and other states within Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the nature of its business, Plentywaka had to make a slight pivot and began transporting essential services across Lagos, especially food items</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also opened a logistics service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the lockdown eased across the city and commuting resumed, the company moved 60% capacity while the operational cost remained the same</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although g</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rowth was steady and picking up, the company started seeking external investment. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> received $300,000 <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/08/04/bus-booking-platform-plentywaka-raises-300k-pre-seed-funding-as-it-expands-to-abuja/">pre-seed</a> from its parent company, EMFATO and other early-stage investors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction</a> and Niche Capital in August</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Early-stage African VC firm Microtraction reports portfolio boom despite the weight of COVID-19&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/embed/#?secret=y53OBaIwsW" data-secret="y53OBaIwsW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backed with the new funding, Plentywaka has since doubled down on its core offering &#8212; transporting people via buses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The logistics arm that it launched, as well as a car service, have since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been shuttered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akumah says the focus on a primary offering has paid a dividend. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has expanded its intrastate services into two other cities in Nigeria including the country&#8217;s capital city, Abuja and has moved about 300,000 people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this announcement though, there are immediate plans to launch an interstate service across different cities in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This service will see Plentywaka partner with some major bus travel companies, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have more than 2000 buses and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over 100 routes in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plentywaka acts as an aggregator, and commuters can see options of various transport companies, compare fares, and book on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Plentywaka is getting to a point where we&#8217;re now becoming more like an aggregator as we onboard transportation companies on our platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Interstate travel in Nigeria is data insufficient, and we want to be the first company to solve this.&#8221; Ena, co-founder and president of Plentywaka, said to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this and the new capital from Techstars, Plentywaka is looking to scale its platform across Africa and North America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Akumah says this global expansion plan will start with a city in Canada, most likely Toronto, on or before Q4 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/sunilsharmats">Sunil Sharma</a>, the managing director of Techstars Toronto, confirmed this to TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Sharma, Techstars is backing the Nigerian mobility startup because it&#8217;s solving a massive problem in Nigeria that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be likened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to urban transportation challenges in other populated cities worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know that Western cities have legacy transportation systems. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are many transportation challenges, even in a city like Toronto,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that Plentywaka&#8217;s technology and approach in improving the lives of citizens and their daily commute needs can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be brought</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over to cities in the West </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they are in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plentywaka plans to launch its intracity service first after engaging the country&#8217;s necessary stakeholders before introducing the intercity model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma thinks that most cities in Canada aren&#8217;t well serviced by buses, leading to a broken intercity transit infrastructure. Plentywaka&#8217;s presence will bring the much-needed option the city deserves, he says</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cities and towns here should have bus connectivity, but they quite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don&#8217;t have it, and my view is that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the arrival of Plentywaka will be an immediate option to the status quo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also resonate with people as a way to supplement existing transportation options,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>Techstars&#8217; relationship with Akumah also proved crucial in Plentywaka&#8217;s acceptance into the accelerator<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second-time Techstars-backed founder, Akumah co-founded Farmcrowdy, a Nigerian digital agriculture platform in 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having gone through the accelerator&#8217;s Atlanta program four years ago with the agritech startup, Akumah is doing the same with Plentywaka. He doubles as CEO at both companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The serial founder said the relationship with Techstars is one reason the company is expanding to Canada instead of neighbouring African countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If the opportunity we have in Toronto right now to expand was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what we had in Ghana or South Africa, of course we&#8217;ll be having those conversations already</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when we have the support system from Techstars, Sunil, and regulators in Toronto without even putting feet on the ground, I mean that makes it exciting for us to expand to Canada,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p>Nigerian or African startups, in general, rarely make their way into Canada. Plentywaka is on the verge of doing so, and <span style="font-weight: 400;">it will be looking to close a seed round from investors to carry out these expansion plans and further improve its technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">About four years ago, social impact organization <a href="https://www.norrsken.org/">Norrsken Foundation</a> launched a small program investing around EUR30 million in capital it had received from its wealthy patron, Klarna co-founder Niklas Adalberth.</p>
<p>Now, that initiative has become its own impact investment firm, <a href="https://www.norrsken.vc/">Norrsken VC</a> and, according to people familiar with the firm, is about to close on its first independent investment vehicle &#8212; a 125 million euro fund focused on investing in startups that are, as its website suggests, &#8220;solving the world&#8217;s biggest problems&#8221;</p>
<p>Norrsken VC did not respond for a request for comment about the firm&#8217;s fundraising plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Already, the young firm has invested in companies that would be standouts among any venture capital portfolio. Norrsken VC is one of the early backers behind Northvolt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/swedish-battery-manufacturer-northvolt-receives-a-14-billion-order-from-vw/">which just received a $14 billion order for its batteries</a> for electric vehicles from Volkswagen.</p>

<p>Electrification is actually a big theme for the early-stage firm, which counts the electric plane technology developer, <a href="https://heartaerospace.com/">Heart Aerospace</a>, and autonomous electric vehicle developer <a href="https://www.einride.tech/">Einride</a>, and the battery monitoring and data management startup, <a href="https://www.nortical.com/">Nortical</a>, among its other portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Einride scored another huge coup recently. TechCrunch reported that the company was close to closing on $75 million in new funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/while-eyeing-a-spac-swedish-autonomous-ev-company-einride-nears-75-million-in-new-funding/">even as it explored a potential SPAC for its business</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Norrsken Foundation&#8217;s work in investing presaged a surge in climate and sustainability-focused activity from both venture investors, public markets and entrepreneurs looking at how to aid in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable resources and other zero carbon sources of energy.</p>
<p>That thesis on energy consumption extends to other areas of the firm&#8217;s portfolio, including companies like the energy efficient data center designer and technology developer, <a href="https://submer.com/">Submer</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9vdkbFff5Z"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/submer-is-dunking-servers-in-goo-to-save-the-planet/">Submer is dunking servers in goo to save the planet</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If electrification and efficiency are one area of focus in the climate fight, Norrsken has also made moves to combat waste and improve efficiency in the food chain, as well. It&#8217;s probably the largest area of focus for the firm&#8217;s current portfolio outside of electrification, and there appear to be some early winners emerging in that category.</p>
<p>Those range from startups focused on agriculture like WeFarm and Ignitia, to consumer waste in the food industry through investments in Olio, Matsmart and Whywaste.</p>
<p>Taken together the climate and sustainability thesis has been the largest and most opportune investment target, but healthcare and wellness are also within the firm&#8217;s investment mandate. Startups like <a href="https://winningtemp.com/">Winningtemp</a> are an interesting indication of the firm&#8217;s thesis. That startup provides ways to monitor and support employees&#8217; mental health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber said Tuesday that drivers in the UK who use its ride-hailing app will be treated as workers, a designation that will give them some benefits such as holiday pay. However, even as Uber seemingly concedes to a Supreme Court ruling last month, a new fight could already be brewing over the company&#8217;s decision to calculate working time from the point a trip commences &#8212; rather than when drivers log on to the app.</p>
<p>Uber said that beginning Wednesday all drivers in the UK will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, which will be paid out every two weeks. Drivers will also be paid at least the minimum wage (called the National Living Wage) after accepting a trip request and after expenses, Uber said in a statement. Eligible drivers in the UK will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber. These contributions will represent approximately 3% of a driver&#8217;s earnings.</p>
<p>In the UK, there are three designations: self-employed, employed and worker. The &#8220;workers&#8221; designation doesn&#8217;t make them employees, but it is still entitles them to the minimum wage, holiday pay, and, if eligible, a pension.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uber said Tuesday that based on current expectations, the company is not changing its previously announced expectations for Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter or for 2021.</p>
<p>Uber has been entangled in fight over worker classification in the UK <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/uber-loses-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk/">since 2016</a>. Last month, the UK&#8217;s Supreme Court dismissed Uber&#8217;s appeal, which reaffirmed earlier rulings that drivers using the app are workers and not independent contractors. With no place to turn, Uber has conceded — sort of. Uber will only guarantee that drivers&#8217; working time and other benefits will accrue once they accept a trip and not based on when they have signed into the app to begin working. That already has labor activists fuming.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we welcome Uber’s decision to finally commit to paying minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions we observe that they have arrived to the table with this offer a day late and a dollar short, literally,&#8221; according to a statement from the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union and signed by James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two drivers who brought a case against Uber. &#8220;The Supreme Court ruled that drivers are to be recognized as workers with entitlements to the minimum wage and holiday pay to accrue on working time from log on to log off whereas Uber is committing only to these entitlements to accrue from time of trip acceptance to drop off. This means that Uber drivers will be still short-changed to the tune of 40-50%. Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement.</p>
<p>While Uber undoubtedly has made progress here, we cannot accept anything less than full compliance with legal minimums. We would also expect to see Uber make progress towards trade union recognition, a fair dismissals appeals process and a data access agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farrar told TechCrunch that the issue has not been resolved. The next step will be to go back to the Employment Tribunal to ensure that drivers are paid what they are legally entitled to,</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Even as Uber deals with continued labor issues in the UK, the company will likely turn much of its attention to cases are still playing out in courts in other European countries — decisions which could put pressure on Uber&#8217;s bottom line. Meanwhile, EU lawmakers are also consulting on how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">improve conditions for gig workers</a> so Uber&#8217;s concession in the UK is likely feed into pan-EU negotiations.</span></p>

<p>Prior to Construct, Holt was at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uber</a>, where she was one of the company&#8217;s first 30 employees.

<p><strong>The big story: Google Play halves commission on first $1M</strong></p>
<p>Following a similar move by Apple last year, Google said that it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">reducing its fee from 30% to 15%</a> for the first $1 million that developers earn through Google Play annually.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is slightly different from Apple&#8217;s approach, in that it applies to all developers — although the fee goes back to 30% for any money earned beyond that first million dollars.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard from our partners making $2 million, $5 million and even $10 million a year that their services are still on a path to self-sustaining orbit,” wrote Google&#8217;s Sameer Samat. “This is why we are making this reduced fee on the first $1 million of total revenue earned each year available to every Play developer that uses the Play billing system, regardless of size.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As enterprises around the world pour more money into research and invention to stay competitive, the need for analyzing the worthiness of R&amp;D expenses also grows.</p>
<p>One company serving that function is PatSnap. When co-founder Jeffrey Tiong was working in the medical devices industry more than a decade ago, he realized how critical intellectual property and patents were in the tech world.</p>
<p>In 2007, Tiong launched PatSnap in Singapore to build a global patent search database and overtime pushed the firm into adjacent realms. PatSnap&#8217;s more recent software, which Tiong dubs &#8220;innovation intelligence,&#8221; helps enterprises analyze their R&amp;D strategies, keep track of competitors, and identify potential partners by crunching data around the likes of scientific papers, government R&amp;D grants and startup funding news.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we found is that a lot of companies [treat] innovation as a department, as a function, as a KPI in an organization,&#8221; said Tiong. &#8220;Many companies are hiring people&#8230; who have to find out what kind of technology is out there and who is doing what. You cannot do everything by yourself nowadays. You need to partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors are paying attention to the R&amp;D boom. In PatSnap&#8217;s latest funding round, the company attracted SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund II and Tencent as lead investors. The Series E round totals $300 million, with participation from CITIC Industrial Fund, which is part of Chinese state-owned conglomerate CITIC Group; Sequoia China; Xiaomi founder Lei Jun&#8217;s Shunwei Capital; as well as Vertex Growth and Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia &amp; India, both part of the Vertex investment family.</p>
<p>Masayoshi Son spent less than half an hour on a call with Tiong before the billionaire founder of SoftBank hammered out a deal for PatSnap. In his early twenties, Son invented and patented a device that he sold for $1 million, so &#8220;he understands the importance of inventions, IP and innovation,&#8221; Tiong said.</p>
<p>Tiong declined to disclose PatSnap&#8217;s post-money valuation in an interview with TechCrunch but said the number has crossed $1 billion.</p>
<p>The United States is PatSnap&#8217;s largest market, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">although China is rapidly growing as a revenue stream amid the country&#8217;s patent filing spree. In 1999, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) received </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2020/article_0005.html">just 276 applications</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from China. By 2019, that number rose to 58,990, surpassing that of the United States.</span></p>
<p>But compared with their western counterparts, Chinese corporations are less inclined to pay big bucks for software, which makes it challenging for SaaS companies to monetize in the country. PatSnap operates under the brand <a href="https://www.zhihuiya.com/products/bio">Zhihuiya</a> in China, with customers ranging from retail brands, research institutes, AI firms to pharmaceutical giants.</p>
<p>The sheer number of patents doesn&#8217;t translate conveniently into technological clout. The U.S. is still ahead of China in terms of R&amp;D expenditure, Tiong observed. Furthermore, &#8220;the quality of the patents in China is not as strong and a lot of them are incremental innovation instead of groundbreaking types of invention,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>PatSnap says it now has more than 10,000 customers in over 50 countries, with a 700-person workforce spread across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Japan and China. Some of its notable customers include Tesla, General Electric, Siemens, Dyson, PalPal, Spotify and Megvii. With the fresh capital, the company plans to further develop products, acquire more domain expertise, expand global sales presence and invest in human capital.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Data is a gold mine for a company.</p>
<p>If managed well, it provides the clarity and insights that lead to better decision-making at scale, in addition to an important tool to hold everyone accountable.</p>
<p>However, most companies are stuck in Data 1.0, which means they are leveraging data as a manual and reactive service. Some have started moving to Data 2.0, which employs simple automation to improve team productivity. The complexity of crypto data has opened up new opportunities in data, namely to move to the new frontier of Data 3.0, where you can scale value creation through systematic intelligence and automation. This is our journey to Data 3.0.</p>

<p>Coinbase is neither a finance company nor a tech company &#8212; it’s a crypto company. This distinction has big implications for how we work with data. As a crypto company, we work with three major types of data (instead of the usual one or two types of data), each of which is complex and varied:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blockchain: decentralized and publicly available.</li>
<li>Product: large and real-time.</li>
<li>Financial: high-precision and subject to many financial/legal/compliance regulations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our focus has been on how we can scale value creation by making this varied data work together, eliminating data silos, solving issues before they start and creating opportunities for Coinbase that wouldn’t exist otherwise.</p>
<p>Having worked at tech companies like LinkedIn and eBay, and also those in the finance sector, including Capital One, I’ve observed firsthand the evolution from Data 1.0 to Data 3.0. In Data 1.0, data is seen as a reactive function providing ad-hoc manual services or firefighting in urgent situations.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squarespace has raised $300 million in a round of funding that values the company at a staggering $10 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New backers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dragoneer, Tiger Global, D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Spruce House. Existing backers Accel and General Atlantic also participated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squarespace founder &amp; CEO Anthony Casalena said the fresh capital will advance the company’s growth initiatives and help it scale its product suite.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move comes less than two months after the company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/squarespace-files-privately-to-go-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed confidentiality to go public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via a direct listing or initial public offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squarespace, which has helped millions create their own websites, was founded in 2003 and bootstrapped until a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/13/squarespace-raises-38-5-million-from-accel-index-ventures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$38.5 million Series A </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2010 that was co-led by Accel and Index Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The online website creation and hosting service &#8212; which has now expanded into e-commerce by hosting online stores &#8212; then raised another $40 million round in 2014. But it is perhaps best known for its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/squarespace-raises-about-200-million-at-a-1-7-billion-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">epic 2017-era $200 million secondary round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that General Atlantic financed. That round was raised at a $1.5 billion pre-money valuation. That means it has effectively upped its valuation by more than five times in just over three years.</span></p>
<p>At that time, TechCrunch reported that Squarespace was a profitable company, with revenues increasing 50% in the prior year, to about $300 million. Execs are declining to comment on the company&#8217;s latest funding round beyond <a href="https://newsroom.squarespace.com/blog/squarespace-raises-300-million-investment-round-at-10-billion-valuation">a post</a> on its website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wise.com/">Wise</a>, the London-headquartered company that made its name offering international money transfers and is reportedly planning an IPO, has accused its former banking partner in Brazil of a &#8220;smear campaign&#8221; after allegations of fraud &#8212; claims that Wise says are “false and unfounded.”</p>
<p>The war of words between Brazil’s MS Bank and Wise appears to have followed Wise securing its own FX broker license from Brazil’s Central Bank in January, meaning that its partnership with MS Bank would soon come to an end. The following month, without prior notice, MS Bank terminated its contract with Wise and informed customers that it was launching its own transfer service called CloudBreak.</p>
<p>Without a banking partner, Wise was forced to temporarily suspend its Brazil corridor. On March 12, Wise was able to open its Brazilian real (BRL) to U.S. dollar (USD) corridor again, under its own license, and then things got hostile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an email sent to customers the same day &#8212; and shared with TechCrunch earlier this week &#8212; MS Bank alleges that Wise had been committing fraud via customer accounts. Those allegations were also repeated in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXKcGs8xZL0&amp;t=3s">YouTube video</a> and text published on MS Bank’s own website and focussed on a discrepancy in the way transactions are registered on a customer’s account and with the Brazilian Central Bank.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8JffsH3G0v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">TransferWise rebrands as Wise ahead of an expected IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TransferWise rebrands as Wise ahead of an expected IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/embed/#?secret=8JffsH3G0v" data-secret="8JffsH3G0v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a subsequent blog post, Wise gives a <a href="https://wise.com/us/blog/updates-on-our-brazil-operation">detailed</a> and robust explanation of the discrepancy in the way transactions are recorded, categorically denying any wrongdoing, and calls out MS Bank for launching an alleged “defamation campaign.”</p>
<p>In a statement provided to TechCrunch, Wise says the accusations “have been timed to raise awareness of the launch of that ex-partner’s competing product. We are not aware of any investigation or accusations against Wise by any regulator or other authority, either in Brazil or anywhere else,” adds the fintech company. “We are certain that we are not responsible for any fraudulent or improper activity using customer data and/or funds. Wise is taking legal measures to address this matter.”</p>
<p>Wise’s statement in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>In recent weeks Wise has been the subject of a smear campaign by a former business partner in Brazil. The accusations have been timed to raise awareness of the launch of that ex-partner’s competing product. We are not aware of any investigation or accusations against Wise by any regulator or other authority, either in Brazil or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Wise maintains its commitment to the transparency and security of our operations for our more than 10 million customers around the world. We are certain that we are not responsible for any fraudulent or improper activity using customer data and/or funds. Wise is taking legal measures to address this matter.</p></blockquote>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Individual solutions to the collective crisis of climate change abound: backup diesel generators, Tesla powerwalls, “prepper” shelters. However, the infrastructure that our modern civilization relies on is interconnected and interdependent &#8212; energy, transportation, food, water and waste systems are all vulnerable in climate-driven emergencies. No one solution alone and in isolation will be the salvation to our energy infrastructure crisis.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			No one solution alone and in isolation will be the salvation to our energy infrastructure crisis.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the California wildfires last year and the recent deep freeze in Texas, the majority of the American public has not only realized how vulnerable infrastructure is, but also how critical it is to properly regulate it and invest in its resilience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What is needed now is a mindset shift in how we think about infrastructure. Specifically, how we price risk, how we value maintenance and how we make policy that is aligned with our climate reality. The extreme cold weather in Texas wreaked havoc on electric and gas infrastructure that was not prepared for unusually cold weather events. If we continue to operate without an urgent (bipartisan?) investment in infrastructure, especially as extreme weather becomes the norm, this tragic trend will only continue (with frontline communities bearing a disproportionately high burden).</p>
<p>A month after Texas’ record-breaking storm, attention is rightly focused on helping the millions of residents<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/22/us/texas-storm-recovery-monday/index.html"> putting their lives back together</a>. But as we look toward the near-term future and get a better picture of the<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1174-february-22-2021-over-20000-new-electric-vehicle-charging-outlets"> electric mobility tipping point</a> on the horizon, past-due action to reform our nation’s energy infrastructure and utilities must take precedence.</p>
<h2><strong>Emphasize energy storage</strong></h2>
<p>Seventy-five percent of Texas’ electricity is generated from fossil fuels and uranium, and about<a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/feb/16/natural-gas-not-wind-turbines-main-driver-texas-po/"> 80% of the power outages</a> in Texas were caused by these systems. The state and the U.S. are overly dependent on outdated energy generation, transmission and distribution technologies. As the<a href="https://5p860.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/nCI0DvoSg_08zd62g2Uxr3HDoBOF3pVnjdYrzMGKZSZcF77tHmY_5UsEgVTJMmDEzABG0HgaQRH0u2sUf68CJbl_UikqtBFhQckUAoJU7TKCHVTXeJok6lUZHSporb0JAkInZMjHqkNrq_Gjkh0cGXB9jOAEGn984Q7kgyuel_6NweqUhmdtP72AU96kayGaP3-fafix_dFPSnDOhO3jm6kEZQCZ240Eo1sLfldl7pPdz7c"> price of energy storage is expected to drop to $75/kWh by 2030</a>, more emphasis needs to be placed on “demand-side management” and distributed energy resources that <em>support</em> the grid, rather than trying to supplant it. By pooling and aggregating small-scale clean energy generation sources and customer-sited storage, 2021 can be the year that<a href="https://microgridknowledge.com/ohmconnect-virtual-power-plant-microgrids/"> “virtual power plants</a>” realize their full potential.</p>
<p>Policymakers would do well to mandate new incentives and rebates to support new and emerging distributed energy resources installed on the customers’ side of the utility meter, such as<a href="https://www.energytoolbase.com/newsroom/Blog/a-definitive-guide-to-the-updated-sgip-incentive-program-2020-edition"> California’s Self-Generation Incentive Program</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Invest in workforce development</strong></h2>
<p>For the energy transition to succeed, workforce development will need to be a central component. As we shift from coal, oil and gas to clean energy sources, businesses and governments &#8212; from the federal to the city level &#8212; should invest in retraining workers into well-paying jobs across emerging verticals, like solar, electric vehicles and battery storage. In energy efficiency (the lowest-hanging fruit of the energy transition),<a href="https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/cities_workforce_development_v2_0_2.pdf"> cities should seize the opportunity</a> to tie equity-based workforce development programs to real estate energy benchmarking requirements.</p>
<p>These policies will not only boost the efficiency of our energy systems and the viability of our aging building stock, creating a more productive economy, but will also lead to job growth and expertise in a<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/sustainability/pdfs/a_compelling_global_resource.ashx"> growth industry of the 21st century</a>. According to analysis from<a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/jobs-report"> Rewiring America,</a> an aggressive national commitment to decarbonization could yield 25 million good-paying jobs over the next 15 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Build microgrids for reliability</strong></h2>
<p>Microgrids can connect and disconnect from the grid. By operating on normal “blue-sky” operating days as well as during emergencies, microgrids provide uninterrupted power when the grid goes down &#8212; and reduce grid constraints and energy costs when grid-connected.

<p>For grid resiliency and reliable power supply, there is no better solution than community-scale microgrids that connect critical infrastructure facilities with nearby residential and commercial loads. Funding feasibility studies and audit-grade designs &#8212; so that communities have zero-cost but high-quality pathways to constructable projects, as New York State did with the<a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All%20Programs/Programs/NY%20Prize"> NY Prize initiative</a> &#8212; is a proven way to involve communities in their energy planning and engage the private sector in building low-carbon resilient energy systems.</p>
<p>Unpredictability and complexity are quickening, and technology has its place, but not simply as an individual safeguard or false security blanket. Instead, technology should be used to better calculate risk, increase system resilience, improve infrastructure durability and strengthen the bonds between people in a community both during and in between emergencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Multi-asset investing and trading platform and Robinhood competitor eToro announced Tuesday it will go public via a merger with SPAC FinTech Acquisition Corp. V in a massive $10.4 billion deal.</p>
<p>Once the transaction closes sometime in the third quarter, the combined company will operate as eToro Group Ltd. and is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old Israeli company was founded on a “vision of opening up capital markets.” It launched its platform in the U.S. just over two years ago and has seen rapid growth as of late. Last year, eToro said it added over 5 million new registered users and generated gross revenues of $605 million, representing 147% year-over-year growth. In January alone, the company added over 1.2 million new registered users and executed more than 75 million trades on its platform. That compares to 2019 when monthly registrations averaged 192,000 and 2020, when they grew to 440,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>eToro said its platform is capitalizing on a number of secular trends such as the rise of digital wealth platforms, growing retail participation and mainstream crypto adoption. The company no doubt benefitted from the recent rise in retail investment interest, and in consumer investment apps and services specifically, which resulted from the so-called &#8220;meme stock&#8221; activity that began with Redditors trading GameStop stock in order to frustrate institutional short sellers.</p>
<p>The platform, which spans “social” stock trading and cryptocurrency exchange, in November 2019 acquired Delta, the crypto portfolio tracker app. EToro claims to be one of the first regulated platforms to offer cryptoassets. Its platform is regulated in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the U.S. and Gibraltar.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As Coinbase looks to list, Robinhood rides the crypto boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/as-coinbase-looks-to-list-robinhood-rides-the-crypto-boom/embed/#?secret=Bk4rQR0t79" data-secret="Bk4rQR0t79" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The transaction includes commitments for a $650 million common share private placement from leading investors including ION Investment Group, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Third Point LLC, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC and Wellington Management. The overall $10.4 billion implied equity value of the merger arrangement includes an implied enterprise value for eToro of $9.6 billion.</p>
<p>EToro currently has over 20 million registered users across 100 countries, and its social community is rapidly expanding due to the growth of its total addressable market, supported in part by secular trends such as the growth of digital wealth platforms and the rise in retail participation.</p>
<p>It expects to receive approval from FINRA for a broker dealer license, with plans to launch stocks in the U.S. in the second half of 2021. In a written statement, FinTech V chairman Betsy Cohen said that its sponsor platform Fintech Masala seeks out companies “with outsized growth, effective controls and excellent management teams.”</p>
<p>“EToro meets all three of these criteria,” she added. “In the last few years, eToro has solidified its position as the leading online social trading platform outside the U.S., outlined its plans for the U.S. market and diversified its income streams. It is now at an inflection point of growth, and we believe eToro is exceptionally positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital adoption in a way that no one could have ever anticipated, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd as more people conduct more services online and via mobile devices, businesses have had to work even harder to validate users and security. One company working to serve that need, <a href="https://www.socure.com/">Socure</a> — which uses AI and machine learning to verify identities — announced Tuesday that it has raised $100 million in a Series D funding round at a $1.3 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how much of our lives have shifted online, it’s no surprise that the U.S. digital identity market is projected to increase to over $30 billion by 2023 from just under $15 billion in 2019, according to</span><a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/"> One World Identity</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has led to skyrocketing demand for the services provided by identity verification companies. </span></p>
<p>The founding team set out on a mission to be able to verify 100% of &#8220;good IDs&#8221; in real-time while &#8220;completely eliminating&#8221; identity fraud across the internet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, Socure has been focused on the financial services industry, but it plans to use its new capital to further expand into “every consumer-facing vertical” including online gaming, healthcare, telco, e-commerce and on-demand services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s predictive analytics platform applies artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques with online/offline data intelligence (from email, phone, address, IP, device, velocity and the broader internet) to verify that people are, in fact, who they say they are when applying for various accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Socure has more than 350 customers including three top five banks, six top 10 card issuers, a “top” credit bureau and over 75 fintechs such as Varo Money, Public, Chime and Stash.</span></p>
<p>In 2020, Socure grew its customer base by over 85% year over year and expanded its workforce by over 50% to about 240 people today.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel led Socure’s latest financing, which included participation from existing backers </span>C<span style="font-weight: 400;">ommerce Ventures, Scale Venture Partners, Flint Capital, Citi Ventures, Wells Fargo Strategic Capital, Synchrony, Sorenson, Two Sigma Ventures and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round comes less than six months after the company raised $35 million in a round led by Sorenson Ventures, and brings the New York-based company’s total raised to $196 million since its 2012 inception.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure founder and CEO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnyayers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnny Ayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says his company’s identity management products can help B2C enterprises achieve know-your-customer (KYC) auto-approval rates of up to 97%. This means that financial institutions can more easily capture fraud, for example, via Socure’s single API. The company also claims that by more easily verifying thin-file (those without much credit history) and young consumers, it can help reduce the underbanked population.     </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The pandemic and resulting shutdowns resulted in a massive demand for trusted digital identity, Ayers believes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;This growth tracks with a larger trend marked by the broad migration of businesses to accept applications and onboard new customers online, with many companies accelerating their transformation from digital-first to digital-only,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall fraud attempts among Socure’s existing customer base nearly doubled in the second quarter of 2020 &#8212; with certain segments seeing rises as high as 150%, according to Ayers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;These instances did not involve actual fraud but instead were flagged by Socure as suspicious and blocked prior to inflicting damage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to also enhance its product offering as it continues to develop patents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel partner </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitabhjhawar/">Amit Jhawar</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will join Socure’s board as part of the funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://accel.com/noteworthy/enabling-innovation-without-fraud-our-investment-in-socure"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Jhawar described Socure as “a purpose-built solution designed to handle the wave of new online users because its machine learning models have learned from every identity it has already seen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As former COO at Braintree and general manager at Venmo, Jhawar knows a thing or two about the importance of identity verification, especially in the financial services space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wrote: “I knew immediately that the Socure solution would be a game-changer because the solution can be used in every step of the customer lifecycle, from account creation to login to transaction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure also has hinted that it has an IPO in its future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a written statement, Ayers said: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are incredibly grateful for the chance to innovate and partner to solve this problem with some of the greatest companies in the world and are energized for the opportunities that lay ahead for Socure, especially as we make our march to a potential IPO.”</span></p>
<p>Via email, he told TechCrunch that the company will &#8220;potentially&#8221; look at public markets in 2022 or 2023, when it feels &#8220;the time is right for the business.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://dutchie.com/home">Dutchie</a>, a nearly four-year-old, Bend, Oregon company that charges cannabis dispensaries a monthly fee to create and run their websites, process their orders and track what needs to be prepped for pick up, has raised $200 million in Series C funding at a $1.7 billion valuation. That&#8217;s roughly eight times the valuation the company was assigned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/cannabis-dispensaries-online-sales-are-thriving-and-dutchie-which-connects-them-to-their-customers-is-a-major-beneficiary/">last August</a>, when it closed on $35 million in Series B funding. In fact, $200 million is exactly how much backers thought it was worth last summer.</p>
<p>Why the massive jump in so short a period? Aside from general frothiness in startup investing, Dutchie just acquired two companies, Greenbits and Leaflogix, that will enable it to become even more of an all-in-one tech platform for its customers. Dutchie isn&#8217;t disclosing how, or how much, it paid for either outfit, but the two concerns &#8212; which make enterprise resource planning and point-of-sale software, respectively &#8212; are being folded into Dutchie along with their collective 150 employees, effectively doubling the size of Dutchie, which now employs 300 people altogether.</p>
<p>Dutchie is also benefiting from some fairly strong tailwinds. In addition to a lockdown that has driven many new users to cannabis, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1">five more states</a> voted to legalize recreational marijuana in the November elections, and the federal government, which still categorizes marijuana as an illegal Schedule I drug and has thus denied cannabis companies access to commercial banking and insurance, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug">appears closer</a> to decriminalizing marijuana than any administration previously.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given the way the company is evolving, and regulations are evolving, we talked with Dutchie co-founder and CEO Ross Lipson yesterday about whether Dutchie eventually begins to sell directly to consumers, rather than work with dispensaries. Once people no longer have to pay cash to the brick-and-mortar shops to which Dutchie sends them, will those outfits become less necessary?</p>
<p>Lipson insists they will not. While online orders have soared over the last year for obvious reasons and more shoppers grow accustomed to the ease of picking out products virtually, Lipson says that, &#8220;Longer term, this is a retail-first model. The nature of this industry lends itself to a hyperlocal model largely because of the way that plants are cultivated and processed, so I believe retail will remain intact and continue to be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see. In the meantime, Dutchie has $200 million more dollars from top backers to develop new products &#8212; including discovery and education tools &#8212;  and to begin to expand internationally, says Lipson.</p>
<p>Tiger Global Management led its newest round, joined by Dragoneer and DFJ Growth, two firms that are just now making their first forays into cannabis-related investing.</p>
<p>Dutchie&#8217;s earlier investors Casa Verde Capital, Thrive Capital, Gron Ventures and former Starbucks CEO and founder Howard Schultz also participated.</p>
<p>Asked if becoming publicly traded could be next for Dutchie as investor interest in the industry rises, Lipson says that Dutchie is right now &#8220;focused with what&#8217;s on our plate.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for any discussions with special purpose acquisition companies that might want to take the outfit public through a merger, Lipson says it &#8220;isn&#8217;t engaged in those talks right now,&#8221; but adds that the company will &#8220;weigh out the business opportunities as they come. We look at how does this decision bring value to the dispensary and the customer. If it brings value, we&#8217;d embark on that decision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Occasionally, it&#8217;s easy for startups to achieve so-called product-market fit, but more often, it&#8217;s a struggle. Perhaps no one knows this as well as Sean Lane, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://oliveai.com/">Olive</a>, a company whose software completes so many tedious administrative healthcare tasks for hospitals that it is currently valued by investors at <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/hospital-software-maker-olive-ai-reaches-1-5-billion-value">$1.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Somewhat amazingly, the nearly nine-year-old company raised $380 million of the $445 million it has raised altogether just last year. In fact, Olive is now growing so fast, and clicking along so well, that Lane just raised <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-columbus-ohio-insurtech-company-circulo-raises-50m-to-disrupt-medicaid-301231146.html">$50 million in funding</a> last month for a second startup that uses Olive&#8217;s same tech platform. He&#8217;s CEO of that startup, called <a href="https://www.circulohealth.com/">Circulo</a>, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impressive. It also took Lane around 28 big and small pivots to build the kind of high-growth, fast-scaling businesses that he always wanted to create &#8212; moves he&#8217;s going to discuss with us at TechCrunch&#8217;s upcoming two-day, all-virtual<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=seanlanepost"> TC Early Stage event</a> coming up April 1 and 2.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea: to save other founders from having to undergo the same anguishing twists and turns by sharing what he learned along his own path.</p>
<p>Lane had some help. Specifically, he has long credited one of his early investors, Mark Kvamme of Drive Capital, for helping identify a big opportunity amid of sea of smaller opportunities. As Lane told the outlet <a href="https://www.columbusceo.com/business/20180205/does-crosschxs-sean-lane-finally-have-his-billion-dollar-idea">Columbus CEO</a> a few year ago, before meeting Kvamme, he had a nice life in Baltimore, with a house on the water with his wife. Lane, who was once a U.S. Air Force and National Security Administration intelligence officer, was angel investing, co-running a tech incubator and had co-founded a company called CrossChx to link fingerprints to electronic medical records.</p>
<p>A chance encounter with Kvamme, a Silicon Valley VC who had moved to Columbus, would change everything. To wit, after Lane talked with him about his endeavors in Baltimore, as well as having bigger ambitions to create an &#8220;internet of healthcare,&#8221; Kvamme persuaded Lane to abandon his various projects, relocate to Columbus and focus entirely on a newer, better CrossChx.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s now looking like a smart bet by Kvamme, who wrote CrossChx &#8212; later renamed Olive &#8212; its first check. But even with Kvamme&#8217;s support, Olive&#8217;s success hardly happened overnight. Lane has said he met with plenty of resistance as he tried and scrapped numerous products. As with many growing startups that veer in a new direction, there were painful layoffs. He also eventually parted ways with his co-founder, Brad Mascho, who left the company in late 2017 in an apparent cloud of exhaustion. He&#8217;d &#8220;worked his butt off for a good four years,&#8221; as Lane told Columbus CEO.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s many of these tough points in Olive&#8217;s trajectory &#8212; and particularly those product pivots &#8212; that we&#8217;ll be talking about in a few short weeks at our upcoming event. Indeed, for those who&#8217;ve struggled with their own ambitions, or their own product roadmaps, or who&#8217;ve wondered what they could be doing better or smarter or faster to grow their own companies, this is one conversation that should not be missed.</p>
<p>Even better, our talk with Lane is just one part of a two-day event exploring the many aspects of early-stage startups &#8212; check out the entire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#b0807dca-a87a-47e9-903a-86c80adef221">agenda line up here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While there are plenty of companies selling data about physical locations, <a href="https://www.safegraph.com">SafeGraph</a> CEO Auren Hoffman said his startup is “one of the few companies to sell this data to data science teams.”</p>
<p>For the most part, location data has traditionally been sold to marketers, and Hoffman said, “In the marketing world, if your data is like 40% or 50% true, that’s actually amazing.” But that doesn’t cut it for the data scientist who needs to use it to build complex models and algorithms.</p>
<p>So SafeGraph takes what Hoffman described as a “very, very rigorous approach,” crawling and merging data like business listings, foot traffic and building polygons from 20,000 sources. He also noted that while other businesses treat this data as “an exhaust that they sell on the side of their core business,” it represents “100%” of SafeGraph’s revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hoffman told me that SafeGraph’s customers are using its data in sectors as varied as GIS/mapping, local search, financial services and logistics. Customers include investment company Ares Management, food distribution company Sysco and Choice Hotels — in a statement, Sysco&#8217;s senior manager of market, customer and competitive intelligence Ben Anderson described SafeGraph as “the most comprehensive and actionable POI dataset.”</p>
<p>The startup also says that its data is being used by more than 7,000 data scientists and has been cited in more than 300 academic papers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125719" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125719" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2125719" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/safegraph-brand-comparison.jpg?w=680" alt="SafeGraph screenshot" width="680" height="309" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/safegraph-brand-comparison.jpg 2456w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/safegraph-brand-comparison.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/safegraph-brand-comparison.jpg?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/safegraph-brand-comparison.jpg?resize=768,349 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/safegraph-brand-comparison.jpg?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/safegraph-brand-comparison.jpg?resize=1536,698 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/safegraph-brand-comparison.jpg?resize=2048,931 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/safegraph-brand-comparison.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125719" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SafeGraph</p></div></p>
<p>Today, SafeGraph announced that it has raised $45 million in Series B funding led by Sapphire Ventures, bringing its total funding to $61 million. Previous investors including Alex Rosen of Ridge Ventures, DNX Ventures and Peter Thiel also participated.</p>
<p>“What stands out about SafeGraph is how they’ve been able to quickly position themselves into a major player in the geospatial data industry,” said Sapphire Partner Cathy Gao in a statement. “By singularly focusing on providing the highest-quality places data to data science teams, they’ve earned the trust of some of the largest public and private institutions.”</p>
<p>Hoffman noted that the startup has been “extremely cash efficient,” only losing $3 million over the past two years, and that it raised the funding simply to “grow much faster.” Growth plans include international expansion — SafeGraph has been focused on the United States and Canada thus far, with a U.K. launch planned in April — as well as possible acquisitions.</p>
<p>He added that particularly with the pandemic forcing many businesses to close or change their hours, &#8220;having really accurate data is going to be a lot more important in a post-COVID world.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The importance of the pitch deck can’t be underestimated. It is often the first point of contact between a company and venture investors&#8230; but how investors consume a pitch deck (and what they <em>really</em> think) is also a bit of a black box.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Are they speed-flipping through the slides or taking their time? Do they prefer more information on the team or context on the industry? More numbers or more words? How many slides is the right number of slides?</p>
<p>There are too many questions to count, and often very few answers. But we’re popping the lid off of that black box with the Pitch Deck Teardown. We’ve done Pitch Deck Teardowns at events like Disrupt and Early Stage 2020, and this year we’re cranking it up a notch on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
