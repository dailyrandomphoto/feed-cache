										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;As a nerdy kid I loved tech and was fascinated by how business works,&#8221; says Cam Sinclair, founder of Australian growth marketing firm Ammo. &#8220;I always knew I wanted to find some way to help founders and innovators get their great ideas out into the world. After working in political campaigns, I realized that many of the skill sets overlapped with what startups need: moving fast, being lean, communicating well, being adaptable and staying flexible.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the latest installment of our ongoing interview series with top growth experts, Sinclair tells Anna Heim that his experience in politics &#8220;inspired me to grow an &#8216;anti-agency&#8217; where startup founders could genuinely feel like they had someone on their team who understood their challenges and the risks they were taking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The TechCrunch team has been hard at work the past two weeks. We had a wildly successful Disrupt conference, with all sorts of growth-related discussions that we&#8217;ve included links to below. We also renamed Extra Crunch, our subscription service for startups, to TechCrunch+ and expanded its availability to dozens of new countries (read more about that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">here</a>).</p>
<p>First up, though, here&#8217;s not one but two interviews that Anna did with top growth marketers. If you have a growth marketing expert that you think we should know about, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">let us know</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/growth-marketing-is-not-a-magic-trick-says-ellen-jantsch-of-tuff/">Growth marketing is not a magic trick, says Ellen Jantsch of Tuff:</a> Anna had the chance to speak with Tuff founder Ellen Jantsch, who shares how they hire for their team, some pros and cons of hiring a marketing agency versus an in-house marketer and more. &#8220;We work with more than just e-commerce businesses; we flex into SaaS, fintech and B2B industries and it’s forced us to truly develop a model/process for growth and not just a playbook, meaning our channel and tactic mix is always different,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/australian-growth-marketing-agency-ammo-helps-startups-calibrate-their-efforts/">Australian growth marketing agency Ammo helps startups calibrate their efforts:</a> Anna spoke with Ammo about their collaboration process with startups, how they know when a startup is ready to work with them and how they help startups develop a minimum viable brand. Sinclair, Ammo’s director, says, &#8220;In the past we have described our role as making ourselves obsolete — that our clients would grow large enough to be able to hire their own in-house marketing team. Today we still retain many of these client relationships in different ways by providing more strategic advice.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">(TechCrunch+) How Ryan Reynolds has mastered authentic marketing:</a> During Disrupt, Jordan Crook spoke with Ryan Reynolds about his marketing agency, Maximum Effort. Jordan says, “At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 this week, we sat down with Reynolds to discuss how startups can use &#8216;fast-vertising&#8217; (a term Reynolds coined), which involves treating real-time cultural moments as a springboard, to build their own brand buzz.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

She says, &#8220;The changes are a part of Google’s broader revamp of its ads business in the face of increased regulatory scrutiny and a broader shift across the tech industry to technologies that promote transparency and consumer privacy.&#8221;</p>

Schlein says, &#8220;While these developments threaten to upend how digital marketing is performed today, they signal a necessary, and effective, shift in the ways brands will understand their customers in the future.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It was almost exactly two years ago that a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) spearheaded by investor Chamath Palihapitiya took public the space tourism company Virgin Galactic.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was almost exactly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/virgin-galactic-set-to-trade-on-the-nyse-on-monday-as-the-first-space-tourism-stock.html">two years ago</a> that a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) spearheaded by investor Chamath Palihapitiya took public the space tourism company Virgin Galactic. It was the first human spaceflight company to trade on the NYSE &#8212; or any exchange, for that matter &#8212; and it was so successful, with the company&#8217;s shares trading higher and higher for so many months afterward, that it almost immediately kicked off the SPAC frenzy.</p>
<p>Consider that in the first three months of this year alone, SPACs raised $87.9 billion, exceeding the total issuance in all of 2020, according to data from SPAC Research. So far, according to SPAC Insider, 450 blank check companies have been successfully formed, compared with 15 just 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Palihapitiya has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the craze. Called the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/07/the-pied-piper-of-spacs">Pied Piper of SPACs</a>&#8221; by The New Yorker and the &#8220;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/the-king-of-spacs-wants-you-to-know-he-s-the-next-warren-buffett">King of SPACs</a>&#8221; by Bloomberg, he has formed at least 10 blank check companies and publicly shared plans to raise many more. (On the “All-In Podcast” that he co-hosts, Palihapitiya last year revealed he had reserved the symbols from “IPOA” to “IPOZ” on the NYSE.)</p>
<p>Of course, whenever market activity grows too feverish, retail investors <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spac-selloff-bruises-individual-investors-11621396808">get bruised</a>. Indeed, after a number of companies taken public via blank check companies were discovered to have fudged some of their numbers &#8212; in June, for example, Lordstown Motors admitted it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/lordstown-motors-reverses-claims-about-binding-orders-for-electric-pickup-truck/">did not</a> have binding orders from customers for its electric Endurance pickup truck after all &#8212; fears have grown that SPACs don&#8217;t feature enough disclosures and that they mostly benefit the people organizing them, like Palihapitiya, who joined us last week to talk about that concern and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://rivian.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rivian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the electric automaker backed by Amazon, Ford and a cornucopia of heavy-hitting institutional investors like T. Rowe Price Associates and Coatue, finally made its once-confidential IPO filing </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm#toc157488_15"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which started in 2009 as Mainstream Motors before adopting the Rivian name two years later, has exploded in terms of people, backers and partners in the past few years. Rivian operated in secret for years before it revealed prototypes of its all-electric R1T truck and R1S SUV at the LA Auto Show in late 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Rivian has raised about $11 billion ($10.5 billion of which was raised since 2019); expanded its Normal, Illinois, factory; hired thousands of employees; landed Amazon as a commercial customer; and, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/electric-vehicle-company-rivian-has-confidentially-filed-for-an-ipo/">filed confidentially for an IPO</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, its S-1 is revealing more details about the company and its operations. According to its IPO filing, Rivian is officially based in Southern California, a detail that, believe or not, wasn&#8217;t so clear a few months ago. The company’s headquarters previously were listed as Plymouth, Michigan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 30, 2021, Rivian had 6,274 employees across the United States, Canada, and Europe, according to its filing. The company has told TechCrunch more recently that it employs more than 8,000 people, an indication that its growth is accelerating. In addition to the Illinois factory and Plymouth office, Rivian has facilities in Palo Alto and Irvine, California as well as Arizona, Vancouver, Canada, the Netherlands and the U.K.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media reports indicate that the company could pursue a valuation as high as $80 billion in its debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, there are a host of backers hopeful that that number – bandied about today as pre-IPO pricing numbers often are in companies that attract significant media attention – becomes reality. The TechCrunch crew has executed an initial dive through the company’s IPO filing, looking for intricacies, gems, and possible headaches now that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’ve digested the news itself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s talk just how expensive it is to build an EV company, why market size estimates are bullshit, what sort of voting structure Rivian intends to sport post-debut, how Amazon is a blessing and a sticking-point for the company, why services matter, and where Tesla crops up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound good? Let’s have some fun.</span></p>
<h2>It’s expensive to build an actual EV company, despite what SPACs will tell you</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks love to say that it’s cheaper and easier than ever to found, and build a startup. They are talking about pure-play software companies. It’s still incredibly difficult and expensive to build an EV company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence of that fact can initially be spotted in the sheer scale of capital that Rivian raised while private, just to get to the point when it has started to manufacture vehicles. But the company’s income statements shared in its S-1 filing are even more illustrative of the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the company’s operating results for 2019, 2020, and the first two quarters of both this year and the last:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter wp-image-2211580 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png" alt="" width="880" height="375" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png 880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=768,327 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, we didn’t make a mistake and miss the revenue line from the above graphic. It doesn’t exist since. Because Rivian has essentially zero historical revenues to report; that of course makes sense because Rivian it is just starting to deliver the first R1T trucks (revenue yay!) to customers. You can spy a dribble of income in the interest section, but that’s effectively it; Rivian has only made money thus far from simply having lots of cash, some of which generated a paltry return. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A dispute over working conditions at &#8220;new media&#8221; properties like Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV and others may shut down productions across the country if a strike vote by the union succeeds. Thousands of workers on and off set claim they are not receiving appropriate wages, breaks, safety measures and other needs due to a contractual loophole exempting these companies from established film and TV production labor standards.</p>
<p>The conflict has been widely covered in the entertainment press, with celebrities and studios voicing their support and countless workers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ia_stories/">sharing horror stories</a> from jobs on these productions.</p>
<p>The issue, as explained by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, or IATSE, is a 2009 agreement made when companies like Netflix were just starting to get into original productions and didn&#8217;t have the kind of labor infrastructure that  established studios did. The economics of these &#8220;new media&#8221; companies being &#8220;uncertain,&#8221; it was decided that &#8220;greater flexibility&#8221; would be afforded to them in on-set matters where union rules might impede new and untested entrants.</p>
<p>But that same agreement noted that once these services became more economically viable, then a new agreement should take its place acknowledging that. <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-amptp-to-make-a-deal-with-behind-the-scenes-workers">That time, the IATSE says, has come.</a></p>
<p>And who could possibly disagree? Netflix is now an industry powerhouse, and billions are being spent by Disney, Apple, and Amazon on some of the most high-profile media productions ever attempted. Yet because they are &#8220;new media,&#8221; the gaffers and grips on, say, something like the next season of <em>Jack Ryan</em> or <em>Bridgerton</em> don&#8217;t have the same guarantees of lunch breaks, hour limits, or proper scale wages as an &#8220;old media&#8221; production. (Note: I originally listed the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> as an example but this was poorly chosen, as it is a New Zealand-based production and not using IATSE union workers.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211542" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211542" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2211542" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png" alt="Screenshot of Instagram posts describing bad conditions on TV and movie sets." width="1024" height="661" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png 1250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2211542" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IA_stories / Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that every production under these companies is hell — a lot depends on the producers — but the lack of guarantees has produced what many workers describe as systemic exploitation. It&#8217;s taken for granted that they will work longer hours than they are officially paid for, skip holidays and weekends, and so on, while earning less than they would for equivalent work on a production under, say, Universal or A24.</p>
<p>Much ink has been spilled on the huge production efforts of these companies, dropping billions to compete with one another over lucrative subscribers. Each company has dozens of shows being produced simultaneously and on breakneck schedule in order to satisfy the seemingly bottomless demand for content. If we don&#8217;t get a new <em>Stranger Things</em> season in time, there&#8217;s a good chance something will become &#8220;the new <em>Stranger Things</em>&#8221; and eat Netflix&#8217;s lunch, or rather popcorn.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r8SlYVtGDd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/netflix-growth-q3/">Netflix user growth slows as production ramps up again</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Netflix user growth slows as production ramps up again&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/netflix-growth-q3/embed/#?secret=r8SlYVtGDd" data-secret="r8SlYVtGDd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Comparatively little has been written in the tech world about the human cost of these productions — after all, that&#8217;s more on the &#8220;entertainment&#8221; beat. But it&#8217;s par for the course with tech companies to claim the benefits of &#8220;innovation&#8221; while washing their hands of the repercussions; hardly a week goes by that we don&#8217;t hear about some horrible new consequence due to a feature or policy at Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber, DoorDash or any number of other companies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising to hear that some of these same companies are fostering an exploitative work environment — many of them rely on one already!</p>
<p>At any rate, negotiations between the IATSE and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers have stalled and the union has formally asked its workers to vote on whether to initiate a strike. If it&#8217;s a &#8220;yes&#8221; when the votes are counted in a few days, there will probably be one last chance for &#8220;new media&#8221; to make a satisfactory proposal before a huge number of productions are halted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are united in demanding more human working conditions across the industry,&#8221; said IATSE president Matthew Loeb in a press release today. &#8220;If the mega-corporations that make up the AMPTP remain unwilling to address our core priorities and treat workers with human dignity, it is going to take the combined solidarity of all of us to change their minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly almost everyone involved would prefer not to have to strike, though it would be an impressive demonstration of organized labor&#8217;s power to disrupt a plainly hostile industry. Here&#8217;s hoping negotiations succeed at last and the production professionals being trodden on by this new crop of media overlords get the breaks they deserve.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 1, 2021! What a week, y’all. With the third quarter of 2021 now behind us, it’s time to gird ourselves for earnings season, new VC data drops and what we hope — pray? — is one more IPO cycle before the year ends. And with the holiday season starting in roughly 1.5 months, there’s not <em>that</em> much time left. So, make sure you’re reading your friendly neighborhood TechCrunch. We’ve got you covered. – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/twitter-ban-in-nigeria-to-be-lifted-if-platform-sets-up-a-local-office-and-pay-taxes-president-says/">Nigeria may unban Twitter:</a> </strong>After fail-whaling Twitter across the country, the Nigerian government may unblock the social service if it meets certain conditions. Some have been agreed to. Others appear less certain, like Twitter building an office in the country. We’ll see, but the Nigerian beef with Twitter matters as we have seen other nation-states quash the service to varying degrees; China does so fully, for example, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">India has leaned into the intimidation side of influence</a>. In other Twitter news, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/twitter-for-professionals-will-begin-to-roll-out-this-week-for-businesses-and-creators/">has a service for professionals coming out</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/startups-have-more-options-than-ever-to-lower-their-reliance-on-venture-capital/"><strong>Startups find money outside venture circles:</strong></a> TechCrunch spends quite a lot of time tracking the financial flows between startups and their venture backers. But not all dollars and yen that flow to startups come from the sale of equity. And the methods by which startups can raise alternative funds are becoming increasingly mature. This is good news for upstart tech companies around the world. (More on the pace at which capital is flowing <em>into</em> startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">here</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/softbank-backed-oyo-files-for-1-16-billion-ipo/"><strong>Oyo files to go public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Perhaps the Q4 IPO cycle will be, as they say, lit? Oyo is at least jumping into the mix with a public offering that could raise more than $1 billion. TechCrunch has a dive into the filing in the link; recall that Oyo is a SoftBank-backed company that hit some growth issues over the last few years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/all-day-kitchens-wants-to-expand-every-independent-restaurants-delivery-network/"><strong>Megabucks for ghost kitchens:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s a brand-new sentence, I reckon. Regardless, the news today is that All Day Kitchens, which operates a network of ghost kitchens for smaller restaurants to leverage for delivery prep, has raised a $65 million round. Precisely why <em>venture</em> capital is the right choice here is somewhat opaque, but the new capital brings All Day Kitchens’ historical fundraising to more than $100 million, a sum that is impressive for the food space.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/productwind-raises-1-67m-to-connect-your-brand-with-hundreds-of-influencers/"><strong>Smallerbucks for influence connecting:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The influencer economy is still going strong, it appears, with fresh evidence coming today in the form of a $1.67 million round being raised by ProductWind. The startup “aims to connect brands with influencers in one click,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/utopia-labs-is-building-an-operating-system-for-daos/"><strong>DAOs, utopial thinking and you:</strong></a> The DAO space, or the market for decentralized autonomous organizations, is hot in that it’s something that tech folks are thinking and talking about. And funding, it turns out, as Utopia Labs has put together $1.5 million for its infrastructure work for DAOs. DAOs are a hybrid of capitalism and democracy, implying a future where the two are in closer harmony. Hence “utopia” in the name. You won’t find snark about utopia in this newsletter, or aspirations thereof. As Oscar Wilde said, <em>“</em>A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at.<em>”</em></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/leadiqs-rapid-revenue-growth-snags-venture-attention-capital/"><strong>LeadIQ just landed a $30 million round for its sales software:</strong></a> LeadIQ helps save sales reps time by handling some of their rote entry, freeing those folks up for more creative work. And the startup has plans to better unite sales and marketing teams’ data, which its CEO reckons could help boost sales numbers.</li>
<li>From the TechCrunch+ side of things, we have pieces from Disrupt that cover <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/reid-hoffman-on-the-evolution-of-blitzscaling-amid-the-pandemic/">our talk with Reid Hoffman on blitzscaling</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/where-and-when-to-spend-your-recently-raised-dollars/">startups can spend their newly raised capital</a> (and what the hiring market is doing to profligacy!) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/battery-chemistry-company-silas-founder-gene-berdichevsky-on-the-science-of-scaling-up/">how to scale science</a>.</li>

<h2>Ben Rubin explains why the Web3 era of social media will help everybody get paid</h2>
<p>Web3 is still taking shape, so it is hard to define.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt, Houseparty founder Ben Rubin emphasized decentralization as Web3’s central feature. In today’s Web 2.0, individuals give money and personal data to network operators in exchange for access to information.</p>
<p>“In Web3 there is a possibility — not saying that it’s going to actually 100% gonna happen — but there is a possibility where the network owns the network,” said Rubin. “And that’s, I think, the simplest way, the shortest way I can explain it.”</p>
<p>In conversation with reporter Taylor Hatmaker, Rubin said NFTs show that individuals can benefit from Web3 adoption, while decentralized finance and cryptocurrency trading are more commercialized forms.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to be perfect, but it’s going to be a better incentive alignment than we have right now. And that will create competition on incentive alignments with their users,” said Rubin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Rivian, which started deliveries of its R1T pickup truck in September, released its filing to become a publicly traded company in the United States.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The S-1 document, which <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm#toc157488_1">was filed Friday</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, does not include terms for its offering.</p>
<p>The company filed confidentially for its IPO in late August, just two months after it had closed a $2.5 billion private funding round led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in that round.</p>
<p>The S-1 document provides a first look at Rivian&#8217;s financial data and other insights into the company as well as the risks and opportunities it faces.</p>
<p>Rivian reported a net loss of $426 million in 2019. Those losses more than doubled to $1 billion as the company built out its factory in Normal, Illinois, prepared to begin producing its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV and expanded its workforce. The company now employs more than 8,000 people across several facilities in California, Michigan, Illinois and the UK.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers have steepened since then. Rivian posted a net loss of $994 million in the first half of 2021 alone, far more than double its $377 million net loss the company posted in the same period of 2020.</span></p>
<p>Rivian also disclosed its long-tern business strategies, its plan to first sell its EVs and the United States and Canada and then soon expand to Western Europe. Sales in Asia will follow. Rivian said in its S-1 that it will build local facilities to support growth into those new markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rivian also disclosed it had 48,390 preorders for its R1T pickup trucks and R1S SUVs in the United States and Canada as of September. Pre-orders, which requires a refundable $1,000 deposit, don&#8217;t always convert to sales. However, they can provide an indication of demand for the product.</p>
<p>The company said in its S-1 that it has also established a philanthropic mission called <span class="il">Forever. Initially the company will fund the entity with shares of Rivian&#8217;s </span> Class A common stock equal to 1% of the company&#8217;s outstanding equity immediately preceding the completion of this offering.</p>
<p>For a more detailed breakdown of the S-1, check out:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most big accelerators tend to dedicate some of their resources to dauntingly hard science problems and the companies taking them on&#8230; but for SOSV&#8217;s <a href="https://indiebio.co">IndieBio</a>, it&#8217;s the primary focus.</p>
<p>Last time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/from-improving-cancer-treatments-to-saving-the-bees-these-are-the-companies-in-indiebios-latest-class/">we checked in with IndieBio</a>, their companies were working on everything from lozenges to treat gum disease, to vertical farms for the sustainable production of shrimp, to saving the bees.</p>
<p>While IndieBio&#8217;s next Demo Day is still a few months out, the companies in their next New York batch have been selected and are already chipping away at a whole new set of problems — things like battling opioid addiction, improving crop yields amidst climate change, or making better/safer leather alternatives from stuff we&#8217;d otherwise throw away.</p>
<p>I hopped on a call with IndieBio NY’s Chief Science Officer Julie Wolf, who told me a bit about what each company in this latest New York batch is working on. <strong>Here&#8217;s my understanding of each company in the new class, in alphabetical order:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://ceragengrow.com">Ceragen</a>:</strong> Making a microbe-based &#8220;inoculant&#8221; that improves crop production in hydroponic greenhouses, using beneficial bacteria to help plants increase heat resistance, battle root rot and more. The team says they&#8217;ve seen yield increases of up to 20% in tomatoes (think more fruit, not bigger fruit.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The purpose of your company is to sell your solution and generate revenue, but to do that you require customers. So how do you convince someone to bet on you?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New companies face innumerable challenges around fine-tuning their product and constructing the appropriate revenue model. You may be looking ahead to raising some funds and trying to juggle the administrative aspects of running a business, but before all that, the purpose of your company is to sell your solution and generate revenue.</p>
<p>But to do that requires customers, so how do you get someone to take a chance with you?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we convened a panel of three technology industry veterans at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week. The panel included Kate Taylor, head of customer experience at Notion; Pablo Viguera, co-CEO and co-founder of Belvo; and Vineet Jain, CEO and co-founder of Egnyte.</p>
<p>Beyond their body of experience in helping build successful startups, each of these panelists&#8217; companies have taken a very different approach to generating revenue. Egnyte, a content storage and management platform, is more of a straight enterprise sale, while Notion, a collaboration and content organization tool, uses the freemium model and then upsells to paid subscriptions with additional features. Belvo, for its part, is a financial services API provided to developer organizations and is monetized when the API is added to products and people use them.</p>
<p>Viguera says you shouldn&#8217;t try to do too much with the product initially. Get something out the door and get customers to tell you what they think. &#8220;In the early days, the v1 that you&#8217;re shipping, that you&#8217;re building, will hardly be anything like what you have two years down the road or 10 years down the road. So focus on getting a lot of feedback, not only in the early days, but over time. Really build in those feedback loops and be really deliberate about seeking feedback, even if it&#8217;s a complex business,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At the same time, Taylor says, you can&#8217;t let customer feedback push and pull you in too many directions. You have to find a set of committed users and let that core help you guide the product. &#8220;[You have to] manage the distractions, because there are a lot of different ways that you can take the product, and a lot of different feedback that you&#8217;ll hear. So find those engaged voices, and the people you&#8217;re going to bring in the circle that are helping you understand where to grow,&#8221; she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The possibilities of Web3 are fascinating, although I will admit that the notion of public networks where everyone is presumed to be trustworthy is still a bit of a mind-bender.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Web3 is still taking shape, so it is hard to define.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt, Houseparty founder Ben Rubin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/what-is-web3-disrupt-ben-rubin/">emphasized decentralization as Web3’s central feature</a>. In today’s Web 2.0, individuals give money and personal data to network operators in exchange for access to information.</p>
<p>“In Web3 there is a possibility — not saying that it’s going to actually 100% gonna happen — but there is a possibility where the network owns the network,” said Rubin. “And that’s, I think, the simplest way, the shortest way I can explain it.”</p>
<p>In conversation with reporter Taylor Hatmaker, Rubin said NFTs show that individuals can benefit from Web3 adoption, while decentralized finance and cryptocurrency trading are more commercialized forms.</p>

<p>“It’s not going to be perfect, but it’s going to be a better incentive alignment than we have right now. And that will create competition on incentive alignments with their users,” said Rubin.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting discussion that helped me better understand the topic, although I will admit that the notion of public networks where everyone is presumed to be trustworthy is still a bit of a mind-bender.</p>
<p>We have many more Disrupt recaps to come in the next few days, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>On a personal note: I celebrated my second anniversary at TechCrunch yesterday, and I’d like to thank the incredible team I work with for making all of this possible!</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading,</p>

<p>It’s the beginning of Q4, so Alex Wilhelm couldn’t help but get an early start on parsing Q3 data. For Thursday’s Exchange, he looked at preliminary data out of India and China.</p>
<p>“The trendlines appear clear,” he writes.</p>
<p>“One more great quarter from India and a modest decline in China could see the former dethrone the latter for second place in the global startup market fundraising ranks.”</p>

<p>It’s hard to find actionable, proven advice for scaling startups.</p>
<p>That’s because only 7% of the startups that raise seed rounds are able to grow their companies enough to land a Series C investment, according to a Dealroom study.</p>
<p>To create a framework for founders who are charting a path from $1 million to $25 million in annual revenue, Arthur Nobel, a principal at Knight Capital, conducted 47 interviews with founders and investors who’ve taken startups from Series A to C.</p>
<p>More than an overview, the article offers approaches for navigating the challenges of T2D3 (triple, triple, double, double, double) growth, specific hiring recommendations and other strategic insights.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the post also includes steps and visualizations you can use to create your own scaling roadmap.</p>
<p>“The takeaway is to initially figure out in which stage your company and departments are in and only do what is required for that stage,” writes Nobel.</p>

<p>Startup founders have more options than in years past when it comes to fundraising, thanks in large part to a surplus of liquidity. Besides traditional VC, crowdfunding, venture banks and venture debt funds are all viable options.</p>
<p>In a detailed overview of venture debt options, Andy Weyer, managing director of technology at Runway Growth Capital, shares three use cases depicting how debt capital can benefit borrowers hoping to retain leverage for future rounds or access working capital.</p>
<p>“Think of capital availability as a spectrum, from low risk and low return (venture banks) to high risk and high return (venture capital), with venture debt funds sitting somewhere in the middle,” advises Weyer.</p>

<p>There is no level playing field in capitalism, but it is easier than ever for a scrappy startup to go head-to-head with industry leaders.</p>
<p>Warby Parker is reshaping consumer expectations about eyewear, just as Poshmark and ThredUp made a direct run at eBay and the luxury resale market.</p>
<p>In a world where customers are more loyal to value than branding and 18-month roadmaps are the norm, startups that develop solid competitive plans have an advantage, says Sudheesh Nair, CEO of business intelligence company ThoughtSpot.</p>
<p>“Successful startups will inevitably draw the attention of powerful incumbents in their industry,” he writes for TechCrunch+. “They will fight you, but if you are positioned well for the challenge there has never been a better time to prevail.”</p>

<p>End users and regulators are increasingly unhappy about how tech companies slice and dice our personal data. Many countries and regions have been enforcing new privacy guidelines, and consumers are embracing privacy features that make it harder to track them for targeted advertising and market research.</p>
<p>According to Ted Schlein, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins who focuses on cybersecurity and enterprise software, companies should consider shifting to pattern analysis.</p>
<p>“Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), companies can process and interpret first-party data in real time and develop actionable behavioral intelligence,” he says.</p>
<p>“Real-time analysis can help companies identify patterns of behavior to understand how customers engage, and why — all while protecting their privacy.”</p>

<p>“What follows is a dive into the IPO pricing issue and how startups are looking to get around the matter through alternative listing mechanisms,” he writes, adding that the column closes with notes from an interview with Amplitude CEO Spenser Skates.</p>
<p>“If you care about the value of private companies and how they are priced, this is for you. If you do not, please read anything else; you are going to be bored out of your socks.”</p>

<p>Roham Gharegozlou has been betting on the potential success of NFTs for years. This year, it happened.</p>
<p>Gharegozlou and the team at his startup, Dapper Labs, shipped the blockchain world’s first popular game, CryptoKitties, back in 2017.</p>
<p>The startup then launched NBA Top Shot late last year, and it promptly caught fire and brought worldwide attention to the crypto collectibles space.</p>
<p>Lucas Matney caught up with the Dapper Labs CEO at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week to discuss the challenges facing the crypto space, the future of Ethereum and how quickly NFTs blew up this year.</p>
<p>“I knew it would be fast, but NBA Top Shot went from 4,000 to 400,000 users in a matter of weeks,” Gharegozlou said.</p>

<p>Two things are true: Edtech companies are looking for ways to grow their valuations, and a strikingly high percentage of employees are dissatisfied in their current jobs and hope to make a change.</p>
<p>“Employers are under fresh pressure to retain talent, which has made some turn to more comprehensive and creative benefits,” writes Natasha Mascarenhas in an article about new offerings from MasterClass and Outschool meant to help workers develop soft skills.</p>
<p>“Think a class on the art of negotiation by Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, or a lesson on effective and authentic communication by Robin Roberts, a ‘Good Morning America’ anchor,” she reports. “The value proposition, therefore, is more about complementary skills that could develop or upskill a workforce.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm takes a look at direct-to-consumer eyewear company Warby Parker, which direct listed this week.</p>
<p>“The company not only listed, but did so at a price point that was above its final private-market valuation, and its shares appreciated rapidly during its first day of trading,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“For the DTC market, the results partially combat the odor that 2020’s ill-fated Casper IPO left lingering around the startup business model category.”</p>

<p>Following last week’s TechCrunch Disrupt event, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim considered startups’ various options for fundraising beyond venture capital.</p>
<p>They pulled notes from a Disrupt panel on revenue-based financing “to help frame our thinking around venture capital investment, and when startups may want to pursue other methods of funding.”</p>
<p>“With alternative capital concerns like Pipe attracting top talent while expanding to new markets, and Clearbanc rebranding to Clearco while raising $100 million earlier this year, it’s clear that the market for funds outside of traditional venture checks is maturing. Let’s talk about it.”</p>

Thankfully, a fix is here and once you install it, you shouldn&#8217;t have to resort to Face ID (or worse, typing in your passcode) anymore. The latest iOS 15 update (iOS 15.0.1) is here and according to the changelog, it brings bug fixes &#8220;including an issue where some users could not unlock iPhone 13 models with Apple Watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple added the unlock with Watch feature in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-iphone-unlock-macos-tvos-homepod-181749610.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">watchOS 7.4 earlier this year</a> to make it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-5-face-id-mask-fitness-plus-developer-beta-182712559.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">easier to get into your iPhone</a> while you&#8217;re out and masked up. This feature later got broken with a subsequent iOS and update and required <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-7-1-apple-watch-unlock-with-iphone-fix-191917256.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">another over-the-air package</a> to fix. Apple recently acknowledged that this was also not working on some iPhone 13 models, and said it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-iphone-13-unlock-bug-fix-174529852.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">would roll out a solution soon</a>. The iPhone 13 only started being available on September 24th, so this issue was at least caught early. Though it&#8217;s nice that the update is here days later, it&#8217;s interesting to see the trouble the company has had with this feature in the last few months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Blitzscaling itself isn’t the goal," said Hoffman. "Blitzscaling is being inefficient; it’s spending capital inefficiently and hiring inefficiently; it’s being uncertain about your business model; and those are not good things."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman first coined the term &#8220;blitzscaling,&#8221; he kept it simple: It’s a concept that encourages entrepreneurs to prioritize speed over efficiency during a period of uncertainty. Years later, founders are navigating a pandemic, perhaps the most uncertain period of their lives, and Hoffman has a clarification to make.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blitzscaling itself isn’t the goal,&#8221; Hoffman said during TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. &#8220;Blitzscaling is being inefficient; it’s spending capital inefficiently and hiring inefficiently; it’s being uncertain about your business model; and those are not good things.&#8221; Instead, he said, blitzscaling is a choice companies may have to make for a set period of time to outpace a competitor or react to a pandemic rather than a route to take from idea to IPO.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean startups should avoid prioritizing breakneck speed, especially in industries like fintech and edtech, where the pandemic spotlighted a lot of potential. Instead, Hoffman thinks the pandemic’s real impact on his definition is that “the benchmark for what you may need to do in order to outpace your competitors to scale in an ecosystem may have changed.”</p>
<h2>A lot of new money</h2>
<p>Hoffman’s broadened view of blitzscaling blends well with his firm’s recent announcement of a <a href="https://greylock.com/firm-news/500m-for-seeds/">$500 million seed fund</a>. The close came weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/andreessen-horowitz-just-rolled-out-a-400-million-fund-thats-expressly-for-seed-deals/">Andreessen Horowitz closed its own $400 million seed fund</a>.</p>
<p>Greylock claims that its new fund is &#8220;the largest pool of venture capital dedicated to backing founders at one,&#8221; and explicitly said that it is &#8220;willing to write large seed checks at lean-in valuations, which gives companies more runway to hit milestones without taking on additional dilution.&#8221; It’s fair to say that Greylock&#8217;s checks could help seed-stage startups afford to blitzscale while still prioritizing runway and other business-oriented resources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re diagnosed with lazy eye &#8212; otherwise known as amblyopia &#8212; as a child, there are only a few options at your disposal. You can wear an eye patch, you can take eye drops or you can wear corrective lenses. Or, in the future (pending FDA clearance), you could watch TV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the central idea behind Luminopia, a four-person startup headed by Scott Xiao and Dean Travers. Xiao and Travers started Luminopia six years ago as undergrads at Harvard University, and first heard about the condition from a classmate who had struggled with amblyopia as a child. Lazy eye is the most common childhood form of vision loss, and affects about </span><a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/amblyopia-lazy-eye"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three out of every 100 kids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amblyopia can develop early in life when something causes one eye to struggle to keep up with the other. There might be muscle strength imbalances between eyes, which causes one to lag behind, one eye might be far stronger than the other or one eye might be deprived of clear vision, due to a cataract or other obstacle. </span><a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/amblyopia-lazy-eye"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the brain learns to depend upon vision in one eye, while the other gets weaker, eventually, in severe cases, leading to permanent vision loss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common treatments for lazy eye involve eye drops, corrective lenses or eye patching &#8212; which strengthen the weaker eye. Luminopia’s solution is different; kids watch TV through a VR headset with the parameters of the show slightly altered (the company has struck deals with Sesame Workshop, Nickelodeon, DreamWorks and NBC to provide over 100 hours of content). Contrast might be dialed up or dialed down, or parts of each image might be removed to encourage the weaker eye to keep up with the stronger one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re actually altering the image parameters in real time, with the goal of promoting weaker eye usage and encouraging patients’ brains to combine input from both eyes,” says Xiao. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, the company published results of a </span><a href="https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(21)00682-5/fulltext#secsectitle0100"><span style="font-weight: 400;">randomized controlled trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 105 kids. All the kids wore glasses full-time, but 51 of them also watched one hour of TV shows modified by Luminopia’s software six days per week for 12 weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the kids in the treatment group improved their sight by 1.8 lines on a standard eye chart, compared to .8 lines in the comparison group (though some kids saw improvements of two or more lines at the 12-week follow-up visit). </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study was published in &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ophthalmology.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminopia is still a small enterprise &#8212; there are just four employees. But the company has raised about $12 million so far with investment from Sesame Ventures (the Sesame Workshop venture capital arm), and angel investors like Robert Langer, a co-founder of Moderna (now Luminopia’s board director), and Jeffrey Dunn, the former president and CEO of Sesame Workshop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has distinguished itself by its unique approach to a common problem in amblyopia, and in healthcare in general: adherence to treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s some evidence that lazy eye treatments are hard to stick with. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3729804/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted in a hospital in Saudi Arabia surveyed 37 families with children who were using eye patches to treat amblyopia. The kids in the study only completed about 66% of the prescribed patching time. Families cited social stigma, discomfort and flat out refusal to wear the patch as some common reasons why they struggled to keep up with eye patching recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One  <a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2127884">2013 study</a> in &#8220;Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science&#8221; analyzed how well 152 kids complied with eye patch treatments, and found that on about 42% of days, kids skip patching altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminopia’s founders created their treatment for lazy eye by approaching the adherence problem first — a strategy borrowed from the consumer product world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve always seen such a huge gap in the experience of things in the consumer world, where things are so thoughtful and so delightful, and healthcare where so often we see poor experiences that lead to low adherence,” says Travers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for kids, there aren’t much more appealing things to do than watching TV, Xiao notes. And the trial appears to prove that thesis: The kids in the study completed 88% of the minutes of TV watching required of them. And 94% of parents said they were likely or very likely to use the treatment over an eye patch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key, though, is to have the data and FDA approval to prove that these “delightful” treatment experiences actually work and overcome the adherence problem. Luminopia’s most recently published trial follows </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02782117"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a single-arm pilot trial,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which evaluated the technology’s at nine sites, and on a total of 84 participants. In the first phase of that pilot trial, conducted on 10 kids, the team found that children completed 78% of the prescribed minutes of treatment. They also saw improvements in their vision that equated to about three lines on a standard eye chart. Those results were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65234-3">published</a> in &#8220;Scientific Reports.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminopia isn’t the first company to start evaluating game- or, for lack of a better word, fun-based treatments for diseases. The FDA has already been somewhat in support of other proposals in this vein. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another company, Akili Interactive, gained FDA approval </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-first-game-based-digital-therapeutic-improve-attention-function-children-adhd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in June 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the De Novo pathway for a video game used to treat ADHD in kids. That approval marked the first time the agency had approved a video game to treat a disease. In total, Akili Interactive has garnered about $301.1 million in funding,</span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/akili"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akili’s game, called EndeavorRx, does show a pathway to approval that Luminopia might be able to mimic. Luminopia, like EndeavorRx, is a prescription-only therapeutic service that doesn’t have a predecessor. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminopia, says Xiao, will also follow the De Novo pathway as it seeks FDA approval this year. The data from its most recent pivotal trial was submitted to the FDA last March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are anticipating a decision by the end of the year, and provided it’s a positive decision, we’re looking to launch the product early this year,&#8221; he says. </span></p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over a century ago, the advent of the internal combustion engine took us out of the age of the horse-drawn carriage and into the age of the automobile. With the horse leaving the equation, vehicle designs started to emerge that were oriented around the comfort and safety of drivers.</p>
<p>Since then, society has come to accept a particular kind of car design: gas-powered, inattentive to pedestrians and other road users, and often driven by a distracted human. Today, mobility is undergoing another major transformation, and we are building what comes next: the fully autonomous electric vehicle.</p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) now present a rare opportunity for transformational change by reimagining how vehicles are designed, how they’re used and whom they serve.</p>
<p>To support this transformation, we’re announcing the launch of<a href="https://www.savecoalition.com/"> the Coalition for Safe Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification (SAVE)</a>. SAVE’s founding members — Zoox, Nuro and Local Motors — are united around three core principles: building safe automated driving systems, deploying AVs on fully electric platforms and incorporating new vehicle designs that improve mobility and access for all.</p>
<h2>Traditional vehicle designs will not do enough</h2>
<p>Today, we have congestion driven by single-occupant vehicle trips, pollution from gas-powered cars, inequitable access and <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic">rising traffic fatalities</a>. SAVE will bring policymakers, industry leaders and advocates together to improve our communities with autonomy — and that includes rethinking the car.</p>
<p>After all, building an AV without any changes in vehicle design is like building a cell phone with a rotary dial.</p>
<p>SAVE’s members are designing vehicles for a mobility future that serves everyone. Zoox has developed an autonomous vehicle that is designed to be shared and contains over 100 <a href="https://zoox.com/safety/">safety innovations</a> not featured in conventional cars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nuro is building zero-occupant delivery AVs designed for the safety of people outside the vehicle, which can improve access to groceries in <a href="https://medium.com/nuro/serving-americas-food-deserts-a7442e922053">food deserts</a>.</p>
<p>Local Motors is building a shuttle that provides first- and last-mile connections to transit, with design innovations that can improve <a href="https://localmotors.com/press-release/new-accessibility-features/">accessibility</a> for people with disabilities.</p>
<h2>AVs will lead to vehicle designs that are safer for everyone</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/24-05-2016-scale-of-traffic-deaths-and-injuries-constitutes-a-public-health-crisis-safe-roads-contribute-to-sustainable-development">public health crisis</a> on our roads led to an <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic">estimated</a> 38,680 deaths last year. AVs can help reduce the 94% of fatal crashes in which a critical factor is driver error or choice — drunken driving, speeding and distraction — but if autonomy is paired with new vehicle designs, AVs will help achieve even greater improvements.</p>
<p>Today, our roads are <a href="https://www.ghsa.org/resources/Pedestrians21">more dangerous</a> for pedestrians than they’ve been since 1989. Vehicles have historically been designed for the safety and comfort of drivers, rather than the people outside, which has led to ever-increasing vehicle sizes that are<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212012221000241?dgcid=author"> more deadly</a> for pedestrians and cyclists. Pickups and SUVs now account for approximately 70% of new vehicle sales annually, and are two to three times more likely to kill a pedestrian in collisions.</p>
<p>AVs present an opportunity for a sea change in safety for people outside vehicles, just as seat belts and air bags significantly improved occupant safety. A recent Virginia Tech <a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/102365">study</a> found that zero-occupant delivery AVs can reduce fatal crashes and injuries by about 60%, based on design alone. Additionally, new <a href="https://zoox.com/wp-content/uploads/zoox_safety_report_volume2_2021.pdf">safety innovations</a> like the Zoox vehicle’s external lighting and sound system will enable AVs to communicate with pedestrians and other road users.</p>
<h2>Zero-emissions AVs will reduce emissions, improve efficiency</h2>
<p>The future of transportation must be zero emissions, which is why we’re building AVs from the ground up to be fully electric.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>, the transportation sector is the No. 1 contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and the pollution it causes <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/links-between-air-pollution-and-childhood-asthma">increases</a> the prevalence of life-threatening childhood asthma, disproportionately affecting communities of color.</p>
<p>Yet a congested street filled with single-occupant, gas-powered vehicles looks exactly the same as one with electric vehicles, which is why we also need to fundamentally shift how vehicles are used.</p>
<p>The widespread deployment of electric AVs in shared fleets, combined with transit and active transportation, can lead to an<a href="https://www.itdp.org/2017/05/03/3rs-in-urban-transport/"> 80% reduction</a> in CO2 emissions by 2050. Additionally, by going electric and “batching” deliveries to multiple people, delivery AVs could help <a href="https://www.steergroup.com/projects/economic-impacts-autonomous-delivery-services-us">avoid 407 million tons of CO2 emissions</a> from 2025 to 2035 — effectively offsetting the emissions from powering every home in the four largest cities in the U.S. for a decade.</p>
<h2>AVs should provide accessible, equitable mobility options</h2>
<p>Having access to a vehicle makes a person <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol17num2/ch3.pdf">four times more likely</a> to have a job, and access to affordable shared AV services can <a href="https://2uj256fs8px404p3p2l7nvkd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fostering-Economic-Opportunity-through-Autonomous-Vehicle-Technology.pdf">significantly reduce</a> household expenses and connect low-income Americans with new job opportunities.</p>
<p>Additionally, delivery AVs can help to improve access to fresh groceries for <a href="https://www.axios.com/autonomous-vehicles-mobility-poverty-795b9113-e279-4111-9aa3-c4a59c6dc192.html">14 million</a>, or 70%, of the 20 million low-income Americans living in food deserts.</p>
<p>Vehicles have traditionally been designed around the able-bodied, limiting the mobility options available to people living with disabilities and older adults. The introduction of AVs gives us another chance to design vehicles that are accessible for the <a href="https://www.bts.gov/travel-patterns-with-disabilities">25.5 million Americans</a> with travel-limiting disabilities, which could lead to an estimated <a href="https://rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Self-Driving-Cars-The-Impact-on-People-with-Disabilities_FINAL.pdf">2 million</a> new employment opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Modernizing regulations will unlock AVs’ full benefits</h2>
<p>This year, Congress is considering a generational reinvestment in our nation’s infrastructure that will fund sorely needed repairs and accelerate consumer adoption of electric vehicles. But using new roads in the same way will not be enough.</p>
<p>Congress must seize the opportunity to modernize federal policies and reimagine how our roads are used. Updating federal vehicle standards, while maintaining their safety intent, would foster the deployment of AVs that deliver on safer roads, expanded access, and a more sustainable and efficient transportation sector.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we’ll find ourselves once again kicking the can down freshly paved roads.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brands wanting to get into influencer marketing can use ProductWind's platform to set up campaigns with hundreds of influencers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some big brands spend millions of dollars on marketing each year and may only drive thousands of dollars in sales as a result. At the same time, influencers are steering thousands, or even millions, of their followers to certain brands.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.productwind.com/">ProductWind</a> aims to connect brands with influencers in one click. The company is building a platform to enable brands to launch influencer marketing campaigns. Today, it announced $1.67 million in seed funding led by Early Light Ventures.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Jason Kowalski is familiar with the marketing challenges facing brands. He was building Amazon’s self-service marketing platform and saw the disconnect between marketing and sales.</p>
<p>“We want brands to come in and have 100 or 200 influencers working with them,” he said. “Before, you might go on a platform and sort through a list of influencers and find them, but not know who would drive sales the best. It was mostly at the top of the funnel rather than the bottom.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u6tVq59rBF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing/">5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing/embed/#?secret=u6tVq59rBF" data-secret="u6tVq59rBF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kowalski brought in former Uber engineer Tom Hirschfeld as his co-founder, and together, applied automation and other proprietary technology to a database of influencers so that brands can join the ProductWind platform, describe what they want to achieve and set up a 100-influencer campaign within minutes versus the traditional weeks.</p>
<p>On the influencer side, they have their own platform and receive notifications when brands want to work with them. Rather than the old way of calling and texting with a brand, the influencer can see a list of available sponsorships, apply and get approved. They can purchase products online, or set up to receive them, and integrate with social media. ProductWind monitors when the posts appear and then pays the influencer through the platform.</p>
<p>As a result, ProductWind is able to generate better return on investment, for example, boosting a product from page 5 to page 1 on Amazon, because the platform creates a flywheel effect: the more value created brings in more sales and more influencers joining the campaign, Hirschfeld said.</p>
<p>For the company’s first 18 months, Kowalski and Hirschfeld bootstrapped the company, which was profitable from the first day, Kowalski said. During this period, revenue increased 10 times. The new funding will be invested in hiring more technology and sales employees to join ProductWind’s 15-person workforce.</p>
<p>“Profitability is key for us because we are producing big campaigns,” Kowalski added. “We are driving marketing and sales, and we want to be the next paradigm shifter.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Early Light principal Mike Leffer said the company’s profitability came as a result of not only Kowalski and Hirschfeld being scrappy, but also due to Kowalski attracting some of ProductWind’s early customers by walking through a trade floor and talking to companies even before there was a finished product.</p>
<p>The status quo in influencer marketing is slow, but ProductWind is able to unlock influencer sales predictions. When speaking to customers and potential customers, Leffer said they were already seeing value and ROI. On the influencer side, the company is able to democratize access to the creator economy so that the opportunities aren’t just limited to professionals, he added.</p>
<p>“The company was in the right place at the right time and bootstrapped from nothing to a lot of revenue,” Leffer said. “They hit upon a need in the market where brands are knocking on their door to launch campaigns and then a space for the creator economy where anyone can be an influencer.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the e-commerce aggregator market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/e-commerce-aggregator-rainforest-raises-20m-just-months-after-its-last-funding/">continues to heat up</a>, the U.S. e-commerce industry is on track for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/u-s-e-commerce-on-track-for-its-first-1-trillion-year-by-2022-due-to-lasting-pandemic-impacts/">first $1 trillion year by 2022</a>. At the same time, marketing channels are getting expensive: Amazon ad costs are up <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-ads-are-getting-more-expensive">30% since the beginning of the year</a>.</p>
<p>Joining Early Light Ventures in the round was Ben Narasin, who recently spun out of NEA to launch Tenacity Fund, and Broom Ventures.</p>
<p>Narasin says the influencer market is huge and considers ProductWind the “DoubleClick of influencer marketing.” He explained via email that the company reminds him of what he saw during the start of the internet in the early 1990s when DoubleClick allowed brands to aggregate relevant sites across a diverse and cluttered landscape with one relationship. Similarly, “ProductWind does that for the ‘wild west’ of influencer marketing,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audio social network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">Clubhouse</a>, video sharing platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/vimeos-new-app-helps-small-businesses-create-professional-social-videos/">Vimeo</a> and anti-ad fraud startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/doubleverify-a-specialist-in-brand-safety-ad-fraud-and-ad-quality-raises-350m/">DoubleVerify</a> are among a clutch of tech companies and organzations preparing to sign up to a beefed-up version of the European Union&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/">Code of Practice on Online Disinformation</a>, the Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_4945">said today</a>.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">May</a> the EU&#8217;s executive said it would be strengthening the (still) voluntary code which is aimed at driving joined-up industry action to counter the spread of harmful disinformation online.</p>
<p>It called on smaller digital services and adtech firms to sign up &#8212; saying it particularly wanted broader participation, not just the usual platform giants (some of whom were among the first group of signatories).</p>
<p>Facebook, Google, Twitter and Mozilla were among the first clutch of tech platforms to sign up to the EU disinformation code back in 2018, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/tiktok-joins-the-eus-code-of-practice-on-disinformation/">TikTok joined last summer</a>.</p>
<p>Eight newbies are said to be preparing to agree to the beefed-up code now.</p>
<p>In addition to the three aforementioned startups, the Commission said organisations that provide specific expertise and technical solutions to fight disinformation, such as Avaaz, Globsec, Logically, NewsGuard and WhoTargetsMe, are also preparing to join.</p>
<p>&#8220;Substantial additional efforts are needed to reduce the flow of harmful disinformation, as illustrated by recent electoral campaigns and by the signatories&#8217; reports on the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/covid-19-disinformation-monitoring">COVID-19 disinformation monitoring program</a>,&#8221; the EC writes in a press release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among the shortcomings the Commission has said it wants the revised code to address are: Inconsistent and incomplete application of the Code across platforms and Member States; gaps in the coverage of the Code&#8217;s commitments; a lack of appropriate monitoring mechanism, including key performance indicators; a lack of commitments on access to platforms&#8217; data for research on disinformation; and limited participation from stakeholders, in particular from the advertising sector.</p>
<p>So quite the laundry list, then.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iGtiTjLf7q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/eu-lawmakers-say-its-time-to-go-further-on-tackling-disinformation/">EU lawmakers say it&#8217;s time to go further on tackling disinformation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU lawmakers say it&#8217;s time to go further on tackling disinformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/eu-lawmakers-say-its-time-to-go-further-on-tackling-disinformation/embed/#?secret=iGtiTjLf7q" data-secret="iGtiTjLf7q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the intention is to beef up the code, it will remain self-regulated. So whether it will become a &#8220;strong EU instrument&#8221;, as the Commission puts it &#8212; without having any real legal teeth &#8212; remains to be seen.</p>
<p>For large internet platforms there will be, if not literal fangs then some threatening growling as compliance with the beefed-up code will be taken into consideration under wider, incoming digital regulations &#8212; aka, the bloc&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a> &#8212; which seeks to increase internet companies&#8217; accountability across a number of areas.</p>
<p>And if self-regulation still fails to move the needle on harmful online disinformation like bogus information about COVID-19 vaccines or election interference the Commission could still propose legislation. However it seems reluctant to do that in such a subjective and controversial area given the risks of being accused of censoring free speech.</p>
<p>Pan-EU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">rules for political ads transparency</a> are slated for introduction next year, in one targeted piece of planned legislation.</p>
<p>In a statement on the eight new &#8220;prospective signatories&#8221;, who have joined in the revision process as a beefed-up version of the disinformation code is drafted, Věra Jourová, the VP for values and transparency, said: “I am pleased to see new actors from relevant sectors answering our call and engaging in the overhaul of the Code of Practice. I encourage others, including platforms, messaging services and actors in the online advertising ecosystem, to join as soon as possible to co-shape the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The strengthened Code cannot fall short of the expectations we have set out in our Guidance from May,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Online players have a special responsibility regarding spreading and monetising disinformation. They must become more transparent, accountable and safe by design.”</p>
<p>Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for the internal market, added: “I welcome the fact that more and more online platforms, technology providers, civil society and expert organisations are formally committing to fighting disinformation. The private sector should be ambitious and anticipate the new EU rules on digital services (DSA). Now is the time to show they walk the talk.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith wasted no time responding to allegations of a hostile work environment, sending an internal letter to employees Thursday encouraging staff to speak to him directly or via an in-house anonymous hotline with their concerns. Of course, it&#8217;s standard practice for companies like Blue Origin to prefer handling complaints internally rather than in the public arena.</p>
<p>The letter from Smith, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/blue-origin-ceo-bob-smith-email-response-to-toxic-workplace-essay.html">which was first obtained by CNBC</a>, comes on the heels of an essay jointly <a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past">composed by 21 current and former Blue Origin employees</a> detailing serious concerns regarding safety and sexual harassment at the company.</p>
<p>Alexandra Abrams, former head of employee communications, is the sole named author of the essay. She told TechCrunch in a new interview that she decided to go public with her identity because she felt a sense of responsibility for other employees.</p>
<p>“I really felt like I had compromised my integrity at Blue Origin,” she said. “I did my best, but I was Bob&#8217;s executive communicator and helped make him look good.”</p>
<p>The essay details two instances of alleged sexual harassment by senior executives, including one instances of a senior leader being let go after groping a female employee — notably, Abrams said, only five of the 21 people who contributed to the essay are men. The essay also alleges that safety at Blue Origin took a backseat to speed of execution, with leadership insisting on a breakneck pace that wasn’t supported by adequate staffing or resources.</p>
<p>“SpaceX has always been much better staffed than Blue Origin,” Abrams said.</p>

<p>Blue Origin said in a statement that Abrams was dismissed “for cause two years ago after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations.” However, Abrams said she never received any warnings, verbal or written, from management regarding issues related to federal export control regulations.</p>
<p>Instead, she says her termination came after initiating a project to develop an internal employee app. Two weeks after that app, called Voyager, went live, it was discovered that part of its architecture was not secure — this is a major concern in the aerospace industry, as all communications tools must be compliant with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), a set of regulations governing tech related to defense and space.</p>
<p>Abrams says she immediately escalated the issue. While senior management conducted an investigation and found no export violations occurred, senior executives reportedly told her that “she could no longer be trusted” and fired her.</p>
<p>“As a communications professional, and part of the non-technical staff, I was not responsible for certifying or approving any compliance of any third-party software architecture. And to-date, as far as I’m aware, the software in question is still used by Blue Origin and Amazon,” she added.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration said it was “reviewing the information” detailed in the essay. Abrams said that the agency has not reached out to her, but that she would “very much welcome” that.</p>
<p>“I feel like I&#8217;m fulfilling my job description as employee communications for the first time.”</p>
<p>Bob Smith&#8217;s full internal team email on Abram&#8217;s letter follows below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Team Blue,</p>
<p>Today, you may have seen that some claims were made against our team.</p>
<p>As with any criticism, whether personal or professional, and whether the criticism is fair or baseless, it is never easy to hear. It requires reflection and humility to sort through what is useful and what is not.</p>
<p>It is particularly difficult and painful, for me, to hear claims being levied that attempt to characterize our entire team in a way that doesn’t align with the character and capability that I see at Blue Origin every day.</p>
<p>Yet, one of our Blue Leadership Principles states that “Leaders are sincerely open-minded, and examine their own strongest convictions with humility. They value diversity, in all of its forms, since different viewpoints result in novel ideas. Their openness enables them to trust those around them — and to earn the trust of others in turn.”</p>
<p>We wrote and published that principle, and others, and will today, and always, be self-critical and hold ourselves to the highest standard.</p>
<p>While we reflect on what we can learn and improve, I do want to reassure the team on a few points.</p>
<p>First, the New Shepard team went through a methodical and pain-staking process to certify our vehicle for First Human Flight. Anyone that claims otherwise is uninformed and simply incorrect. That team is appropriately proud of the work they’ve done and we should be as well.</p>
<p>It should also be emphatically stated that we have no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind. We provide numerous avenues including a 24/7 anonymous hotline for employees, we investigate and act on any findings, and we will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct. As always, I welcome and encourage any member of Team Blue to speak directly with me if they have any concerns on any topic at any time.</p>
<p>Finally, it should never be doubted that we have an amazing team that is doing amazing work.</p>
<p>Our team is comprised of the best and brightest professionals in the aerospace industry. People who are dedicated, work hard and are passionate about our mission.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to rapidly grow that talented team, stay focused on our efforts and support each other. And, step by step, we will make even greater strides.</p>
<p>Gradatim Ferociter,</p>
<p>Bob</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former Vice President Al Gore has invested $600 million of equity into U.K. energy startup <a href="https://octopusenergy.group/">Octopus Energy Group</a> via his <a href="https://www.generationim.com/">Generation Investment Management</a> vehicle, taking a stake of approximately 13% in the business. The investment means Octopus has attained a valuation of around $4.6 billion.</p>
<p>Octopus has made a name for itself in energy circles largely because of its &#8220;Kraken&#8221; technology platform, which it claims is able to reroute energy from renewable sources around a network far more efficiently than competitors. Octopus is now managing 17 million energy accounts in 12 countries in this manner.</p>
<p>Generation is a $36 billion fund management business with a specific remit to back sustainable businesses.  Octopus will use the proceeds of Generation’s strategic investment to push further into the U.S. market, where it already has a toe-hold in Texas.</p>
<p>The Generation investment follows an earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/ai-driven-energy-startup-octopus-hits-2bn-mark-after-200m-investment-from-tokyo-gas/">equity investment from Origin Energy</a>, Tokyo Gas and the acquisition of Upside Energy, specialists in smart grid technology. Octopus’s retail businesses are now in the U.K., U.S., Germany, Spain and New Zealand, plus it has licensing agreements with Good Energy, Hanwha Corporation, Origin Energy, Power and E.ON.</p>

<p>Octopus has also earlier launched Electric Juice, an electric vehicle &#8220;roaming network&#8221; of 100,000 charge points across Europe that allows users to charge their personal Octopus Energy account when they charge their EVs. It’s also partnered with Tesla to launch Tesla Power in the U.K. and Germany.</p>
<p>Speaking for Octopus Energy, founder and CEO, Greg Jackson said: “Whilst the U.K. energy market is currently in a tough state, it’s highlighted the need for investment in renewables and technologies to end our reliance on fossil fuels. So we are delighted to announce our agreement with Generation Investment Management, created to back sustainable companies changing the world for the better.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We run 300 stress tests, twice a week. For us, as a tech company, it’s just algorithmic. For rival companies, they&#8217;re … doing it on spreadsheets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking for Generation Investment Management, Tom Hodges, partner in the long-term equity strategy, said: “Octopus Energy has an extraordinarily good fit with Generation’s mission of investing over the long term to support system and climate-positive companies. The world is at the early stages of an unprecedented energy transition which is essential to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. This can be done in a way that is better for the environment and consumers.”</p>
<p>In an interview via Zoom, Jackson told me that there are two parts to the current global energy crisis: “One is the energy wholesale price crisis. Global gas prices have trebled or quadrupled in the last year. That&#8217;s not only causing gas to be expensive but because a lot of electricity comes from gas it’s pushing up electricity prices. I think this is really revealing the extent to which companies have been selling long and buying short. So companies that are currently folding are larger ones which had sold a one-year contract, but only bought six months worth of energy and they were keeping their fingers crossed for the rest of it.”</p>
<p>He said Octopus has “always been 100% hedged. For us, energy retail is just one of our businesses. And we&#8217;ve got 13 businesses in the group. What we&#8217;ve always sought to do is serve an outstanding service and a really, really risk-managed back end. We run 300 stress tests, twice a week on our hedging position. For us, as a tech company, it’s just algorithmic. For rival companies, they&#8217;re either not doing that or they are doing it on spreadsheets and it just doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>“The reality is this crisis is entirely a fossil-fuel crisis. And if we&#8217;d been using renewables as a primary source and then gas as a backup we wouldn&#8217;t be in this situation,” he added.</p>
<p>He said Octopus is an owner-operator of wind, solar and biomass renewable energy sources, with £3.5 billion in generation assets and plans to 10x that over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>The generation deal consists of a $300 million immediate investment, with $300 million to follow by June 2022, subject to certain further funding conditions.</p>
<p>Octopus has also established the <a href="https://www.centrefornetzero.org/">Centre for Net Zero</a>, an independent London-based research facility that is taking the fight against climate change to the government level and also invested £10 million into an R&amp;D and Training Centre for Decarbonisation of Heat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All good things must come to an end, and this proverb totally applies to our early-bird price on passes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=lastdayebsalespost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=lastdayebsalespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>. Today’s the final day you can save $100 on the price of admission, folks. Join the global SaaS community to connect, inspire, network and learn how to build a stronger startup — without reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=lastdayebsalespost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=lastdayebsalespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your TC Sessions: SaaS pass</a> by <strong>11:59 pm (PT) tonight</strong> to score the early-bird price and save $100.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from and engage with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#ab40f8e4-b236-4c11-8767-8fd7d75a618c">top leaders</a> in a sector that’s both evolving and expanding at a rapid pace. These presentations and breakout sessions are interactive, so bring your questions and opinions (we know you have plenty of both) and shape the conversation as you learn more about the direction of the next generation of SaaS products, platforms and technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">The TC Sessions: SaaS agenda</a> covers a range of topics. This discussion on open source is just one great example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Future Is Wide Open:</strong> Many startups today have an open source component, and it’s no wonder. It builds an audience and helps drive sales. We’ll talk with Abby Kearns from Puppet, Augusto “Aghi” Marietti from Kong and Jason Warner, an investor at Redpoint, about why open source is such a popular way to build a business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Automation is an essential SaaS element, and these two panel discussions take a deep dive into the role it plays now and in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now:</strong> One thing we learned during the pandemic is the importance of automation, and that’s only likely to be more pronounced as we move forward. We’ll talk with UiPath CEO Daniel Dines, Laela Sturdy, an investor at CapitalG, and Dave Wright from ServiceNow about why this is automation’s moment.</li>
<li><strong>Future Forward — How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation:</strong> Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle, with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving — too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, AKASA co-founder and CTO, will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries. Presented by AKASA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early-bird savings come to an end <strong>tonight</strong> <strong>at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=lastdayebsalespost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=lastdayebsalespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your TC Sessions: SaaS pass</a> before the deadline, and you’ll save $100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nine months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/autoleap-thinks-it-will-turn-chaotic-repair-shop-experiences-into-seamless-ones/">$5 million seed round</a>, Toronto auto repair software company AutoLeap is back with $18 million in Series A funding, this time led by Bain Capital Ventures.</p>
<p>Joining Bain in the round is existing investor Threshold Ventures, which led the seed round, to give the company $23 million in total funding.</p>
<p>Co-CEO Steve Lau told TechCrunch that AutoLeap is bringing the auto repair shop into the 21st century by reducing the double- or triple-entry shop owners typically have to do through the digitization of their workflow — customer quoting, invoices and job estimates — and the processing of all of that in the backend accounting. It also provides a sales and marketing component via customer relationship management, scheduling via app, customer texting or emails and online reviews.</p>

<p>Since the seed round and launching last year, the company has grown “well beyond expectations, Lau said. From a team perspective, the company has grown five times and increased 10 times in customer base. Revenue also continues to grow month over month.</p>
<p>“We are more convinced about the market opportunity and our fit in it,” he added. “One of our first customers also recently shared that in the first 10 months of using AutoLeap, his shop doubled its revenue. This is having a real impact in their lives.”</p>
<p>Growing a business is second nature to Lau, who with co-CEO Rameez Ansari spent four years as the co-CEOs of FieldEdge, a SaaS company that helps contractors run their small businesses. They grew the company to 200 employees in over three years, which allowed them to hit the ground running with AutoLeap, Lau said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s team is spread out in Canada, the U.S. and Pakistan. Most of its customers are in the U.S. — 85% — with the rest in Canada.</p>
<p>Lau estimates that the automotive aftermarket is a $700 billion industry, with 1 million technicians and 300,000 shops.</p>
<p>“We are only in the second inning of this market transitioning from pen to digital,” he said. “A  lot of the new capital will be used to capture that market opportunity and hire a world-class team to help us put out a better product and customer service.”</p>
<p>He expects to triple AutoLeap’s workforce in the next 12 months and will be focusing on creating a diverse employee base.</p>
<p>Ajay Agarwal, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said via email that “small businesses are the backbone of our economy” and as seen in other sectors, like consumer brands, restaurants and retail, business owners are seeking modern cloud software that enables them to remain competitive and deliver a better experience for customers.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be more excited to partner with Steve and Rameez as they tackle the enormous opportunity of helping the 300,000 independent auto repair shops move their businesses into the digital age,” Agarwal added. “AutoLeap is bringing a combination of a comprehensive SAAS platform with embedded payments and a marketplace to auto repair shops, one of the last verticals yet to make the leap to the cloud.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA['It’s easier to raise and harder to spend these days, because there’s such a high demand for talent.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market today has a lot of activation energy, even as the pandemic continues to play out. We&#8217;re seeing ample capital, a focus on distributed investing, more first-check investors than ever before, and, fittingly, a parade of new startups.</p>
<p>That said, momentum has a way of overwhelming even the most ambitious. For founders at the earliest stages of building a company, it’s imperative to spend in a balanced yet growth-focused manner. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week, Harlem Capital’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hpierrejacques">Henri Pierre-Jacques</a> and BBG Ventures’ <a href="https://twitter.com/Nish67">Nisha Dua</a> explained how founders should allocate their recently raised dollars in today’s environment.</p>
<p>Personal finance — even for founders — varies for everyone, but the investors drew from their experience with their portfolio companies and their own ethos to give general advice on everything from the importance of an emergency-day fund to how much energy to actually put into hiring new talent.</p>
<h2>Hiring 101</h2>
<p>Dua addressed the elephant in the room right away: Hiring. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/how-to-hire-is-the-new-how-to-conserve-runway/">As we’ve seen</a>, hiring has always been hard for startups, which are more strapped for resources than, say, a Facebook that can offer an engineer a $1 million signing bonus without blinking an eye. Founders and investors tell me that hiring is only getting harder as an increasing number of well-capitalized startups are rising up with impressive valuations.</p>
<p>Dua feels it&#8217;s right for hiring to be at the top of every founder’s list, but she urged those listening to start by thinking backward.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s easier to raise and harder to spend these days, because there’s such a high demand for talent. The answer for where to spend is going to be different for every company across many different industries.</p>
<p>I think a lot of us would admit that we&#8217;re not really great at planning or budgeting in our own lives. But we have to be great at that for our companies to succeed, to grow and to get to profitability. And so what we like to sort of challenge founders on is, ‘Can you articulate your North Star? And then what is your plan? And is that plan executable to get to that North Star?’ That’s really where the plan for how to spend comes in. You&#8217;re not going to reach that North Star in the first 18 months after your first check, obviously, but you&#8217;re going to have a set of milestones that get you to the first hurdle.</p>
<p>[So, think about] the things that are going to make this company most successful in the pursuit of achieving that greater North Star? Hiring is certainly going to be at the top of that list.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pierre-Jacques drew from his portfolio company, Miami-based Pangea, which recently raised a $70 million Series B, to illustrate one way he&#8217;s seen entrepreneurs navigate the talent wars. In short, founders should permit themselves to step away from the hiring process.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
