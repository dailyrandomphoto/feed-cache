										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://lounge.place/">Lounge</a> wants to reimagine work for the fully remote era where tools like Slack, Zoom, and Teams have fallen short in terms of helping companies build culture and creating relationships between employees who have never yet met in person &#8212; and now, it seems, never will. Instead of offering message boards and profiles that reduce a user&#8217;s identity to a photo and short bio, Lounge&#8217;s richer profiles aim to communicate more about the person, like their timezone, weather, location, team, and their participation in company events &#8212; like a steps or meditation challenge. It also offers tools that allow employees to get to know one another and connect on a more personal level, like drop-in audio chat and photo sharing.</p>
<p>The idea for Lounge comes from co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexyoungkwon/">Alex Kwon</a>, CEO, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=jason%20jardim&amp;origin=RICH_QUERY_SUGGESTION&amp;position=1&amp;searchId=cff5403e-0bb7-4a9b-9793-153091a4c6a3&amp;sid=h%3Bf">Jason Jardim</a>, CTO, who had previously worked together at Life360. During the pandemic, the two had been developing a family to-do list type of app while working remotely. While that project was scrapped, the co-founders learned a lot about remote work &#8212; and its pitfalls &#8212; during this time.</p>
<p>Kwon had never before worked remotely, he says, and found the experience lacking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing a once-a-day stand-up on a Zoom call and then just being chatty here and there with a one-hour delay on Slack was just way too lonely for me,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>He said it lacked the same magical spark you get from having real conversations with co-workers, which can also often lead to new ideas. That type of in-person collaboration is one key reason why many <a href="https://www.idropnews.com/news/apple-employees-are-leaving-over-inflexible-remote-work-policies/163620/">companies</a> want their staff back in the office, pandemic or not.</p>
<p>But Kwon believes in-person is not the only way to introduce camaraderie among a team and grow a company&#8217;s culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have been [forming] relationships online ever since the origin of the internet,&#8221; he says. &#8220;People meet in games and get married online in World of Warcraft. And the majority of my friends now have met their significant others on dating apps. And where do they start? Online.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So if friendship and love can happen online, Kwon argues, then work-related camaraderie can, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206712" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206712" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2206712" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206712" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lounge</p></div></p>
<p>The co-founders began experimenting with ways to feel more connected, including at one point, a 24/7 Zoom call so they could just chat as inspiration struck. But that felt too invasive and kids were often interrupting. Always-on audio had a similar problem. This ultimately led to the development of a simple app that allowed them to quickly connect over audio chats with just a tap, but while respecting each other&#8217;s privacy.</p>
<p>The success of this app to solve their own remote work issues led them to scrap their to-do list startup idea and work on Lounge instead.</p>
<p>Today, Lounge presents employees as visualizations of virtual desks which are grouped by teams, projects, or even by hobby or interests. That way, it&#8217;s easy to see who&#8217;s working on what, similar to how company org charts would work. But the desks offer a more personalized experience. The visualizations reflect the person&#8217;s time zone and even their weather, by including little windows that let you see if it&#8217;s nighttime or daytime, for instance. You&#8217;ll also see the person&#8217;s profile photo and other data &#8212; like the steps they&#8217;ve taken a company-wide challenge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206739" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206739" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2206739" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="394" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg 3042w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1186 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lounge</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the employees&#8217; own desks, Lounge also introduces the concepts of multi-person &#8220;rooms.&#8221; Unlike Slack channels focused only on topics or projects, Rooms can be designed to serve almost any purpose. They can even represent a virtual version of what in traditional offices would have been a physical space. You may join rooms for townhall meetings or whiteboard sessions or even hang out virtually with fellow teammates in a public room like the company cafeteria, for example.</p>
<p>Rooms can be locked or unlocked. If you&#8217;re heads-down on a project, you don&#8217;t have to respond to your visitors &#8212; you can lock the room instead. Visitors can then leave a private DM by typing into the chat, as you would with Slack. But if a room is open, you can click to engage with the co-worker synchronously over audio. This is the virtual version of walking up to someone&#8217;s desk and saying hi, except now you&#8217;re using an online tool to do so. The other person will hear your greeting then unmute themselves to respond and have an audio conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it as a combination of Zoom calls and Slack,&#8221; says Kwon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206713" style="width: 323px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206713" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2206713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?w=313" alt="" width="313" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png 776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lounge</p></div></p>
<p>Lounge is also working on a photo-sharing feature, inspired by Kwon&#8217;s earlier startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oneminute">Oneminute</a>, which allows people to snap and share random photos that would then appear on their virtual desks for a time and in other places in the app. The idea here is to give people a sense of what you&#8217;re up to or to share something more personal &#8212; like a photo of your dog or a weekend hobby. This is something employees already do in Slack channels today. But now they could contribute to an ongoing stream of shared photos that could help new hires learn about their teammates and find reasons to start chatting with them.</p>
<p>The startup has been in private beta with select customers since April but has hundreds of signups on its waitlist. So far, it&#8217;s been targeting smaller teams under 20 employees. Today, Lounge is launching into an open beta, with apps for Mac, web, and iOS being prioritized.</p>
<p>Lounge has raised $1.2 million in funding from investors including Unusual Ventures, Hustle Fund, Translink, Unpopular Ventures, and other angels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the first major Windows release in a half-dozen years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/windows-11-launches-october-5/">looming over the horizon</a>, Microsoft has just unveiled a big slate of new hardware. The Surface line has always been viewed as a sort of proof of concept line for an operating system that hasn’t always inspired the most cutting-edge hardware breakthroughs.</p>
<p>The brand affords Microsoft an opportunity to push the edge of what can be done with consumer hardware, generally with a focus on blurring the line between categories like laptop, tablet and, more recently, phone. The Surface track record has been a solid one, on the whole, though messing around with form factors means no one gets it 100% right 100% of the time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206648" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206648" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2206648" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Modes_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Modes_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg 8000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Modes_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Modes_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Modes_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Modes_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Modes_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Modes_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Modes_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206648" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Last year’s Surface Duo is one of the best examples of this phenomenon, barring, of course, its larger sibling, the Surface Neo. The two devices garnered a ton of buzz when they were announced at the same event back in 2019. Both eagerly anticipated devices were ultimately disappointments for two very different reasons.</p>
<p>The Neo simply never came out. Microsoft’s subsequent cancellation of Windows 10X earlier this year appears to be the final nail in that specific product. While the Duo did arrive, it failed to live up to the hype. The form factor was every bit as interesting as it was at launch, but the company essentially acknowledged lackluster specs as it opted to focus on other things. I called it a “work in progress” that didn’t come near justifying the $1,400 price tag.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206650" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206650" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2206650" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Reading_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Reading_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg 11648w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Reading_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Reading_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Reading_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Reading_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Reading_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Reading_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Surface-Duo-2-Reading_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206650" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft likely won’t outright say it, of course, but the new Surface Duo 2 represents something of a do-over. It’s the sort of thing extended to products that we all really want to be good &#8212; like, say, Samsung’s first-gen foldables. In the world of smartphones, we’re all pretty eager for those products that could eventually expand from the same basic form factor our mobile devices have been stuck in for roughly a decade and a half. The dual-screen device is nothing if not an interesting insight into what could be.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2206651" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206651" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2206651" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.54.37-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="723" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.54.37-AM.jpg 1420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.54.37-AM.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.54.37-AM.jpg?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.54.37-AM.jpg?resize=768,542 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.54.37-AM.jpg?resize=680,480 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.54.37-AM.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206651" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The top-line additions here are the screens, which have been expanded from 5.6 to 5.8 inches for a combined 8.3 inches (up from 8.1). The screens sport a 1344 x 1892 resolution at 401 PPI. The addition of a Snapdragon 888 processor is nice, as is the 5G connectivity, after last year’s LTE-only offering stuck out like a sore thumb. So did the camera situation, which was a pretty big mess last time. The Duo 2 adds a large camera model to the rear (in addition to the front-facing 12-megapixel), with three lenses: 12-megapixel wide and telephoto and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide.</p>
<p>One thing the Duo does maintain is that price point. It’s up for preorder now, starting at $1,500.</p>

<p>The other most interesting new device of the lot is the Surface Laptop studio. The device is a clever take on the two-in-one category that Microsoft has been bullish about forever, and the name fittingly pays homage to both the Surface Studio and Laptop, perhaps splitting the difference between the pair. It features a 14.4-inch touchscreen mounted on a kind of origami stand that allows it to be positioned in a number of configurations. It’s basically a laptop (and a very MacBook-esque laptop, at that) with a screen designed to move like a tablet mounted on top of a keyboard case. Also clever is the magnet on the underside of the product that lets you snap on the company’s new stylus.</p>

<p>The product is targeted firmly at creative professionals the company has long been working to siphon off from Apple. The Laptop Studio sports an 11th-gen Intel Core H35 in either i5 or i7 configurations. It’s up for preorder now and starts at $1,600.</p>

<p>The Surface Go, Pro and Pro X are all getting updates this time out. The Go 3 gets a new Intel Core i3, which the company promises will offer up to 60% faster performance. The 10.5-inch system starts at $400 and will also add an LTE option, which is set to arrive at some point in the coming months. The Pro 8 two-in-one sports a 13-inch screen, 11th-gen Intel Core processors and two Thunderbolt 4 ports. It starts at $1,100. The thin and light Surface Pro X, meanwhile, runs on a Microsoft SQ2 ARM chip and will start at $900.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206659" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206659" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2206659" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocean-Plastic-Mouse-Side_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocean-Plastic-Mouse-Side_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocean-Plastic-Mouse-Side_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocean-Plastic-Mouse-Side_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocean-Plastic-Mouse-Side_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocean-Plastic-Mouse-Side_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocean-Plastic-Mouse-Side_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocean-Plastic-Mouse-Side_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocean-Plastic-Mouse-Side_under-embargo-until-September-22.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206659" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>All of the above work with the new Surface Slim Pen 2, which sports a finer point, haptic feedback and magnetic charging. That runs $130. Also on the peripheral tip is the Microsoft Ocean Plastic Mouse, which is made from 20% recycled plastic that’s been recovered from the ocean. The Surface Adaptive Kit, meanwhile, features stick-on keycap labels, bump labels, port indicators and device openers, designed to increase accessibility for the devices.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2206663,2206666,2206667,2206664,2206660,2206659,2206651,2206637,2206638,2206639,2206647,2206648,2206650,2206636"]</p>
<p>On the whole, it’s a good balance for the company. The Laptop Studio finds the company exploring another fascinating corner of the two-in-one space. Is it a niche? Yeah, probably. It’s a big machine with a relatively narrow focus, but Microsoft’s been doing this long enough to understand the specifics of scale with a product like this. And hey, a major OS update doesn’t amount to much with some hardware working to push it forward.</p>
<p>The Duo 2, meanwhile, is a refinement of an eagerly anticipated new product that really didn’t pan out the first time around. Microsoft has been reasonably candid about the device’s failings and looked to address them here. You can make a pretty convincing argument that the device should offer more for the price, but it’s good to see the company sticking with an outside the box product like this, considering how many strange concept products (<em>cough</em> Neo) never make it that far.</p>

<p>The other new Surface products present a further sense of refinement to the line, in anticipation of Windows 11. Microsoft clearly wants you to upgrade your hardware to match, if the convoluted system requirements are any indication.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Ocean Plastic Mouse is, admittedly, a bit gimmicky as the company is pushing hardware upgrades. In a more ideal world, all of the company’s devices would be made of similar components. But hey, if it rescues plastics from the ocean, it’s a start. The Surface Adaptive Kit, is a consumer-facing piece of what has been among the industry’s leading accessibility efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember when OnlyFans said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">ban explicit content</a>, putting its creators&#8217; livelihoods in jeopardy, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">suspended</a> that ban less than a week later? Even though Patreon&#8217;s guidelines on adult content are far more limited than those for OnlyFans, the changing standards of credit card companies like Mastercard are affecting how its creators can make money online.</p>
<p>As part of its quarterly <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/announcing-our-new-creator-policy-engagement-program">Creator Policy Engagement Program</a> (CPEP), which invites creators to engage with Patreon&#8217;s Policy Team, Patreon wrote in a <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/fall-2021-creator-policy-engagement-update">blog post</a> that it will roll out tools to help its adult creators meet the new Mastercard standards. These standards, effective October 1, were <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/onlyfans-visa-mastercard">cited</a> as one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-policy-change-is-a-tale-as-old-as-the-internet/">many potential reasons</a> for OnlyFans&#8217; short-lived potential porn ban, though founder Tim Stokley <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b">blamed banks</a>. The impending Mastercard requirements involve consent documentation (verifying that all people involved in adult content are 18+ and consent to distribution), as well as age and identity verification (requiring creators to provide government-issued ID). Patreon will require creators to meet these guidelines for both new and existing posts.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/policy/guidelines">Patreon allows</a> certain kinds of NSFW content behind paywalls, like &#8220;works depicting real people in the nude in sexual contexts,&#8221; animations or illustrations of nudity and sexual encounters, and &#8220;audio content that features simulated sexual interactions.&#8221; But it blatantly bans pornographic material and &#8220;sexual services.&#8221;</p>
<p>The OnlyFans debacle was only the latest threat to the livelihoods of online sex workers, who have been repeatedly deplatformed. Patreon <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators">cracked down on NSFW content</a> in 2017, citing pressure from payment partners. While Patreon has stated that porn was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kqye3/patreon-porn-adult-content-guidelines-open-letter">never allowed</a>, its guidelines used to be less stringent, allowing more flexibility for adult creators, some of whom made the bulk of their income on the platform. So, like the recent backlash against OnlyFans, adult creators had <a href="https://openlettertopatreon.com/">protested</a> the sudden suspension of many sex workers who depended on the platform for income.</p>
<p>&#8220;You at Patreon have been our friends in the tech world, you have told us so. Imagine how hard it must be for us to survive without the tools you had to start your business. Remember that our fan bases have been a pillar of your community and supported that very business,&#8221; an <a href="https://openlettertopatreon.com/">open letter</a> to Patreon said.</p>
<p>Patreon told TechCrunch in a written statement that everything discussed in <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/fall-2021-creator-policy-engagement-update">the blog post</a> should be considered a work-in-progress. Patreon is hosting a <a href="https://events.patreon.com/connect-q4policylive">livestream</a> tomorrow for creators to share their thoughts about adult content on the platform, as well as the potential to distribute creator coins, marking Patreon&#8217;s first potential investment in crypto. Given the experimental nature of the CPEP program, it&#8217;s unclear if the platform will roll out additional protections for adult creators beyond its tools to help meet Mastercard standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patreon is committed to cultivating strong relationships with our creators and developing policies that support their business efforts,&#8221; the platform told TechCrunch. &#8220;The work involves constantly talking with our creators to ensure our policies will continue to help them create independent, sustainable income.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[The UK government has announced a national AI strategy &#8212; its first dedicated package aimed at boosting the country&#8217;s capabilities in and around machine learning technologies over the longer term. It says it hopes the strategy will lead to an increase in the number and types of AIs being developed and commercialized in the UK [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has announced a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy/national-ai-strategy-html-version#executive-summary">national AI strategy</a> &#8212; its first dedicated package aimed at boosting the country&#8217;s capabilities in and around machine learning technologies over the longer term.</p>
<p>It says it hopes the strategy will lead to an increase in the number and types of AIs being developed and commercialized in the UK over the next ten years.</p>
<p>The plan to prioritize and &#8216;level up&#8217; development and applications of artificial intelligence follows earlier industrial and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/uks-long-delayed-digital-strategy-looks-to-ai-but-is-locked-to-brexit/">digital strategies</a> &#8212; which talked up the promise of AI. But Boris Johnson&#8217;s government is now inching onward, announcing a ten year plan to invest in making Britain &#8220;a global AI superpower&#8221;, as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-ten-year-plan-to-make-britain-a-global-ai-superpower">government&#8217;s PR</a> puts it &#8212; by targeting support at areas like upskilling and reskiling in the hopes of reaping AI-driven economic rewards down the line.</p>
<p>Whether there&#8217;s much of policy substance here, as yet, looks debatable.</p>
<p>Notably there&#8217;s a lack of new money being announced to back up the strategy. For now the government highlights how much cash investors are ploughing into UK AI companies (£13.5BN into 1,400+ UK tech firms between January and June this year) &#8212; and flags a total government investment into AI of £2.3BN+ since 2014.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no word on how much funding the government might put into supporting the development of AI from here on in &#8212; such as through planned continued support for &#8220;postgraduate learning, retraining and making sure children from wide backgrounds can access specialist courses&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead the announcement is heavy on soundbites about &#8220;transform[ing] the UK’s capabilities in AI&#8221; &#8212; or positioning the UK as &#8220;the best place to live and work with AI&#8221;, whatever that means. (Presumably it&#8217;s a companion piece to the other government digital policy talking point &#8212; about making the UK the &#8216;safest place to go online&#8217;, as it works on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">online safety legislation</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The early phase of the strategy looks focused on data-gathering to inform future AI policies. And, there, perhaps the most interesting element is an AI-focused review of the UK&#8217;s current copyright and patent rules.</p>
<p>There is also some geopolitical standards setting ambition on show &#8212; with the government talking about putting AI provisions into trade deals &#8212; but whether the UK will be able to punch so hard on the global stage in this area remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Among the announced measures in the strategy are plans to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch a National AI Research and Innovation Programme &#8212; &#8220;to improve coordination and collaboration between the country’s researchers and help transform the UK’s AI capabilities, while boosting business and public sector adoption of AI technologies and their ability to take them to market&#8221;</li>
<li>Launch a joint Office for AI (OAI) and UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI) programme aimed at continuing to develop AI in sectors based outside of London and the South East. &#8220;This would focus on the commercialisation of ideas and could see, for example, the government focusing investment, researchers and developers to work in areas which currently do not use much AI technology but have great potential, such as energy and farming&#8221;</li>
<li>Publish a joint review with UKRI into the availability and capacity of computing power for UK researchers and organisations, including the physical hardware needed to drive a major roll out in AI technologies. &#8220;The review will also consider wider needs for the commercialisation and deployment of AI, including its environmental impacts&#8221;</li>
<li>Launch a consultation on copyright and patents for AI through the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to make sure the UK is capitalising on the ideas it generates and by best supporting AI development and use through the copyright and patent system. &#8220;This consultation will also include a focus on how to protect AI generated inventions which would otherwise not meet inventorship criteria as well as measures to make it easier to use copyright protected material in AI development&#8221;</li>
<li>Trial an AI Standards Hub to &#8220;coordinate UK engagement in setting the rules globally&#8221;, and working with The Alan Turing Institute to update guidance on AI ethics and safety in the public sector and &#8220;create practical tools to make sure the technology is used ethically&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s also notable that while the government&#8217;s strategy talks about wanting to establish &#8220;clear rules, applied ethical principles and a pro-innovation regulatory environment&#8221; for AI, the UK is already lagging on defining a regulatory framework &#8212; as it&#8217;s now outside the European Union which already has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">comprehensive proposal</a> for regulating high risk applications of AI on the table.</p>
<p>Instead of clarity vis-a-vis data use, current UK government policy is simultaneously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">querying the current data protection regime</a> &#8212; with ministers entertaining the idea of watering down rules in the hopes that weaker protections for citizen&#8217;s information will (somehow) boost people&#8217;s trust in and uptake of technologies like AI.</p>

<p>For AI startups and scale-ups specifically, the national strategy includes a plan to evaluate &#8220;private funding needs and challenges&#8221; &#8212; over the next six to 12 months.</p>
<p>While, over the same timeframe, the government says it will roll out a new visa regime &#8212; &#8220;to attract the world&#8217;s best AI talent to the UK&#8221;. (Of course the devil will be in the detail of what it announces there.)</p>
<p>But if UK startups were hoping the announcement of a national strategy to boost AI might mean gaining imminent access to all sorts of interesting government data-sets to train AI models the document only says that ministers will &#8220;consider what open and machine-readable government datasets can be published for AI models&#8221; &#8212; and will only turn their attention to that particular task over the next 12 months or later. So that&#8217;s a wait and see, then.</p>
<p>&#8220;This National AI Strategy will signal to the world our intention to build the most pro-innovation regulatory environment in the world; to drive prosperity across the UK and ensure everyone can benefit from AI; and to apply AI to help solve global challenges like climate change,&#8221; said (new in post) digital secretary, Nadine Dorries, in a statement accompanying publication of the strategy.</p>
<p>If Dorries&#8217; name is unfamiliar that&#8217;s because she recently replaced Oliver Dowden in the hot seat at the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) &#8212; after yet another ministerial reshuffle.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI will be central to how we drive growth and enrich lives, and the vision set out in our strategy will help us achieve both of those vital goals,&#8221; Dorries added.</p>
<p>Dowden only lasted just over a year in post at DCMS, presiding over the UK&#8217;s digital policy (and all the rest of the wide-ranging brief). That was still longer than his predecessor, Nicky Morgan &#8212; who was only there for a little over half a year.</p>
<p>Before that the digital brief was the responsibility of (now former minister) Matt Hancock &#8212; so there has been quite the parade of politicians pulling UK tech policy strings in recent years.</p>
<p>So perhaps, as a first step on its claimed &#8220;long term&#8221; commitment to nurturing the country&#8217;s deep tech powers, the government might consider a lasting ministerial appointment atop digital policy &#8212; to signal both a sustained focus on levelling up the country&#8217;s technical capabilities in areas like AI and, at the ministerial level, an appropriate <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42216622">ability to grasp basic best tech practices</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">FedEx has started to use self-driving trucks to haul goods between Dallas and Houston as part of a pilot program with autonomous vehicle startup Aurora and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer Paccar.</p>
<p>Paccar trucks that are equipped with Aurora&#8217;s technology will be used multiple times a week to complete the nearly 500-mile route along Interstate 45, the companies said Wednesday. The trucks will operate autonomously with a backup safety driver.</p>
<p>The partnership marks the latest progress by Aurora to meet its target to launch an autonomous trucking business that hauls loads between terminals without a safety driver by the end of 2023. It is also part of a <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/unveiling-the-toyota-sienna-powered-by-the-aurora">string of announcements and updates</a> made by the company in recent weeks ahead of a vote on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/">reverse merger</a> with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the SPAC launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Kodiak Robotics&#8217; founder says tight focus on autonomous trucks is working&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/kodiak-robotics-founder-says-tight-focus-on-autonomous-trucks-is-working/embed/#?secret=Kj1owfgkU6" data-secret="Kj1owfgkU6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The combined company, which will be listed on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol AUR, will have an implied valuation of $13 billion. Aurora was last valued at $10 billion following its acquisition of Uber’s self-driving unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is really about exploring and understanding the kind of changes that would need to be made to the truck,&#8221; Sterling Anderson, co-founder and CPO of Aurora told TechCrunch, adding that this includes how the self-driving system and the cloud services it provides fits with FedEx&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>The pilot will involve a small number of trucks, Anderson said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense to launch huge pilots right off the bat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With a handful of trucks operating regularly, we can really start to suss out any of the tweaks and refinements to the product in the interface.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There is no end date to the pilot, and Anderson expects it to evolve and extend beyond these handful of trucks on the Dallas-to-Houston route as the company gets closer to a driverless capable product.</p>
<p>The pilot, which was launched Wednesday, follows a strategic announcement earlier this year between Aurora and Paccar to develop, test and commercialize autonomous Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks.</p>
<p>The partnership also illustrates FedEx&#8217;s interest in autonomous and robotics solutions, as the company continues to experience record delivery volumes. In June, the logistics giant announced a multiyear, multiphased strategic partnership to test and ultimately deploy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro-moves-into-logistics-with-fedex/">Nuro’s next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle</a> within FedEx operations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Intuit Ventures will identify growth opportunities and trends beneficial for Intuit's key customers — small businesses and consumers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.intuit.com/">Intuit</a>, the business and financial tools company best known for its TurboTax software, made news last week for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">acquisition of Mailchimp</a>, and is now announcing a corporate venture capital arm, <a href="https://www.intuit.com/ventures/">Intuit Ventures</a>, to identify growth opportunities and trends beneficial for its key customers — small businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>The company is the latest to get into corporate venture, joining a group that includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/14/workday-launches-venture-arm-to-fund-machine-learning-startups/">WorkDay</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/salesforce-ventures-launches-100m-impact-fund-to-invest-in-cloud-startups-with-social-mission/">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/zoom-announces-first-startups-receiving-funding-from-100m-zoom-apps-investment-fund/">Zoom</a>. CEO Sasan Goodarzi spoke exclusively with TechCrunch about the new venture, which will focus its initial investments in the areas of fintech, e-commerce infrastructure, platforms and enablement, virtual experts/digital advice and AI/ML.</p>
<p>The initial idea for the venture arm came about a year ago, when Goodarzi and Intuit’s chief corporate strategy and development officer Anton Hanebrink were discussing the acceleration of internal and external company pipelines and how to align those with the company’s mission and identify big opportunities.</p>
<p>The VC arm is one of the ways they would do this, which would enable the company to accelerate innovation while also learning from companies, Goodarzi said.</p>
<p>“The conversation led to months of work and the decision to create Intuit Ventures,” he said. “Anton and Shveta [Mujumdar] now own this and come to Michelle [Clatterbuck] and I to walk us through their investment opinions.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bkGX6NjA1I"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">Intuit confirms $12B deal to buy Mailchimp</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Intuit confirms $12B deal to buy Mailchimp&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/embed/#?secret=bkGX6NjA1I" data-secret="bkGX6NjA1I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Intuit Ventures’ investment strategy will look across the company and touch on a number of areas:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Connecting people with experts &#8212; many customers want to digitize services like bookkeeping, accounting and taxes, so the company provides a virtual expert platform accessible at the touch of a button.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Capabilities to bolster platform using artificial intelligence, machine learning and knowledge engineering. This is an area where Goodarzi sees Intuit going beyond its current offerings to other industries.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Unlocking smart money decisions by being a platform where any consumer can run their financial life in one place. “That’s why we acquired companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/intuit-credit-karma/">Credit Karma</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/the-value-of-techcrunch50-mint-acquired-by-intuit-for-170m-two-years-after-winning-tc40/">Mint</a> — to be able to pull them together with TurboTax into one platform,” Goodarzi said. “We are now willing to invest in companies like stock trading platforms to add another layer.”</li>
<li aria-level="1">Helping small businesses get customers &#8212; with the Mailchimp acquisition, it is an investment that fuels customer growth, whether omnichannel or through other methods.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Talent and technology around cryptocurrency and blockchain &#8212; another area where Intuit can make an impact for customers, he added.</li>
</ul>
<p>The venture firm will look at coming into an investment in the Series B and C rounds and may lead a round, but will also work with other venture capital firms. Goodarzi said identifying potential investments will start with “the belief in the talent and the company” and an idea of how by Intuit infusing money into the company, it will be successful.</p>
<p>“We are boundaryless in terms of funds that we will be putting into this,” Goodarzi said. “We have told Anton and Shveta to bring us the investments until the time we say, ‘no,’ but I don’t think there will ever be a ‘no.’ Talent is scarce and good ideas are endless.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Intuit’s first investment was in <a href="https://clear.co/landing/for-founders/?utm_campaign=2020_as_na_google_search_brand_mca_na_na&amp;utm_content=2020_as_na_google_search_brand_mca_na_na_focused_exa--clearco--515971563321&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_term=clearco&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_ad=515971563321&amp;hsa_grp=65405063645&amp;hsa_kw=clearco&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_acc=3143805101&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_cam=1632587273&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-378026955757&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwvuGJBhB1EiwACU1AiXnnT0NGN2qbgTep6yxFz8_JxHvpWfwtJgbSQtyPdhA_VZFUN9vYoxoCWWQQAvD_BwE">Clearco</a>, an e-commerce investment company that was just infused with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/clearco-gets-the-softbank-stamp-of-approval-in-new-215m-round/">$215 million from SoftBank</a> in July. It is also an investor in <a href="https://www.meliopayments.com">Melio Payments</a>, which provides a platform for SMBs to pay other companies electronically using bank transfers, debit cards or credit. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/melio-raises-110m-on-a-1-3b-valuation-to-bring-b2b-payments-for-smbs-into-the-21st-century/">raised $110 million</a>, led by Coatue in January.</p>
<p>Goodarzi explained that Clearco was a good first investment because the company is representing diversity and diversity in the companies Clearco is helping. Secondly, its focus on e-commerce and omnichannel, also leveraging artificial intelligence capabilities, aligns with one of the five big bets identified by the company and stated above.</p>
<p>Having started a few companies of his own a few years ago, Goodarzi said he wants Intuit Ventures to be the kind of investor he looked for back then: one that will help get companies off the ground, give advice and be a partner to launch and fuel product growth. He intends investments to turn into partnerships and could lead to Inuit acquiring the company.</p>
<p>One of the best ways the venture arm will determine how best companies will fit into Intuit is by exposing them to its platform of <a href="https://investors.intuit.com/news/news-details/2021/Intuit-Reports-Strong-Full-Year-Results-and-Sets-Fiscal-2022-Guidance/default.aspx">more than 100 million customers worldwide</a>.</p>
<p>“Our platform is what makes us attractive to companies like Melio or Clearco,” he added. “Many of these companies are building out things we don&#8217;t have. The biggest way we can understand the places they want to play in is to give them access to our platform. That will be the key to seeing if the company is going to be successful.”</p>
<p>Shveta Mujumdar, vice president of corporate development at Intuit and head of the venture program, and Clearco’s co-founders Andrew D’Souza and Michele Romanow, will be on hand to discuss the fund further at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=rightrail">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> panel, “How to approach fundraising from corporate VCs” on September 22 at 2 p.m. PT.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[So, what I had done was turn $50 into less than $50 and locked the funds in an account on an art marketplace where I couldn't afford to buy something that cost nothing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Years and years ago, to get a better handle on the then-nascent crypto economy, I bought some bitcoin. About $50 worth, if memory serves. And then I moved it to BTC-E, at which point I bought some random coins to see how that would go.</p>
<p>BTC-E <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/07/27/btc-e-digital-currency/">eventually closed</a> after a massive money-laundering fine, so I presume that whatever coins I bought back then are lost to the void. That&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t had any disclosures in anything I&#8217;ve written about crypto since &#8212; I don&#8217;t own any that I can access, which is the same thing as not owning any crypto at all.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no longer the case. After chatting about the NFT craze once or twice on the podcast, I realized that the trend wasn&#8217;t going away, which meant that I needed to give it a try. Most folks who write about football have thrown a football. It seemed pretty reasonable to dip a single toe into the NFT waters if I was going to keep covering them.</p>
<p>After doing a little playing around, my impressions are that NFTs are neat and fun and silly &#8212; and that their on-ramp is still far too steep for most folks.</p>
<h2>Hello, I&#8217;m Alex and I am an NFT noob</h2>
<p>To get into the NFT game, I opened a Coinbase account and bought $50 worth of ether. My goal was not to buy lots of crypto, use it to purchase NFTs and reap stonk-like gains. I just wanted to run the process and figured I could find some sort of unloved NFT for $50 worth of Ethereum&#8217;s token. I even considered buying a piece from an artist I like, whose physical art I own and who makes NFTs.</p>
<p>So, I moved the funds from Coinbase to NFT market OpenSea, where I also had a wallet. The exact linkage between OpenSea and MetaMask wasn&#8217;t 100% clear during the process, but, hey, I&#8217;m here for a good time, so I rolled with it.</p>
<p>Sadly, fees from Coinbase and transferring my pittance of ether quickly ate into my crypto wealth:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2206641" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png?w=591" alt="" width="591" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></p>
<p>From this point, I figured I had paid the piper and was ready to buy something worth as little as possible, closing this chapter on my NFT mess-around.</p>
<p>Regular crypto users and traders know what&#8217;s coming, but let me explain for the rest of the crew. There&#8217;s a thing called gas fees in the ether ecosystem, the price that you pay to have your transaction executed. And it turned out that the gas fee alone for the purchase of an NFT that cost as close to zero as possible was more than the total ETH that I had in my account.</p>
<p>So, what I had done was turn $50 into less than $50 and locked the funds in an account on an art marketplace where I couldn&#8217;t afford to buy something that cost nothing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1437518114342805508">someone sent me a pity NFT for my live-tweeted troubles</a>, so I now own <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xf75140376d246d8b1e5b8a48e3f00772468b3c0c/3738">this</a>. Which I can&#8217;t sell because I don&#8217;t really want to get into the tax issues and because receiving a gift is against journalistic ethics.</p>
<p>At some point, I guess I&#8217;ll sell the NFT, explain to my spouse why our taxes are more complicated than usual, and donate whatever money it is worth at the time to charity. I&#8217;ve received a few offers for my free NFT for around $300, which is weird. It&#8217;s like someone handing you a small plastic chit that has a pretty color and then having folks queue up to offer you several hundred dollars for it.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1440032618221752327">minted my own NFT</a> of a Twitter thread discussing NFTs with a friend. No one wants to buy that one, but, again, it&#8217;s good to experiment.</p>
<p>This little saga closes with <a href="https://digitaleyes.market/collections/Thugbirdz">Thugbirdz</a>, an NFT project that sports highly pixelated images of birds. I looked these up on OpenSea and found one that <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/43129830942309892117831599888217540274730121224258835673118773888212505985025">had a bird smoking a cigarette for a very low price</a>. <em>And</em> it featured a &#8220;buy with card&#8221; option.</p>
<p>Bingo, I thought. I can just use one of my fiat cards to buy this bird, and then I will have actually managed my original goal of purchasing &#8212; as opposed to minting or receiving &#8212; an NFT. But after mucking around with the service to use a card &#8212; MoonPay &#8212; and verifying that I am in fact who I am, two of my cards hit fraud barriers.</p>
<p>No smoking Thugbird for Alex.</p>
<p>Anyway, all this is to say that I like buying art and I think NFTs are good fun. But the on-ramp to actually getting one is too high. Perhaps that&#8217;s why OpenSea has added 107,000 active users in the last week, <a href="https://dappradar.com/ethereum/marketplaces/opensea">per DappRadar</a>, instead of, say, a few million. Folks who want to eventually climb through the software web required, and the huge fees that must be paid, will manage. But if NFTs want the more regular types like yours truly, the barriers need to come down a little. Or at least the fees.</p>
<p>Perhaps proof-of-stake will fix this. Or Solana. Regardless, here&#8217;s to tinkering. And helping Coinbase&#8217;s next-quarter earnings report by a few dollars.</p>

It&#8217;s the same free-to-start MOBA with the same maps and monsters the launched on the Nintendo Switch in July, though the <em>Pokémon Unite</em> team recently rolled out a new update in preparation for its mobile debut. In a <a href="https://unite.pokemon.com/en-us/news/producer-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">post</a>on the game&#8217;s official website, producer Masaaki Hoshino detailed the new features, starting with full cross-platform support and account linking capability across mobile devices and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The game has also introduced Unite Squads, which allow Trainers to team up with squadmates. According to The Pokémon Company, Trainers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22685804/pokemon-unite-mobile-launch-ios-android-battle-pass-squads" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">can create</a>their own squads with this feature or search for existing ones. Teams will be able to use &#8220;tags&#8221; to describe themselves to give people with the same interests a way to find them. The update brings a second battle pass with all-new cosmetic items, new in-game events, new held items and support for more languages, as well.</p>
<p>Hoshino has also mentioned in the post that the team is currently developing a new mode designed &#8220;to level the playing field for all Trainers, regardless of their held items’ grades.&#8221; While Hoshino didn&#8217;t expound on the new mode, it could give people who don&#8217;t spend a lot of money (if at all) to buy held items on the game a bigger chance to win against others who do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV startup Workhorse Group is recalling 41 of its C-1000 cargo delivery vehicles and suspending the remainder of its deliveries for this model, telling regulators Wednesday that “additional testing” is needed to certify the vehicles under Federal safety standards.</p>
<p>All automakers must certify their vehicles under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, minimum safety performance requirements issued by the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). The additional testing should be completed in the fourth quarter, the company told the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001425287/000121390021049277/ea147777-8k_workhorse.htm">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The company also filed a safety recall report with NHTSA, and noted that it had not received any customer reports of safety issues relating to the C-1000.</p>
<p>Ohio-based Workhorse has been in the news lately, primarily for filing a legal complaint against the U.S. Postal Service for awarding a multibillion-dollar contract for electric delivery vehicles to defense contractor Oshkosh Defense. The EV startup dismissed its challenge voluntarily last week.</p>
<p>Losing the USPS contract doesn’t mark the end of its woes. The SEC also opened an investigation into Workhorse at the beginning of September, though the regulator hasn’t disclosed what the investigation concerns. The company appointed CEO Richard Dauch to replace Duane Hughes in July.</p>
<p>The notice from Workhorse sent its shares tumbling by around 10%.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to both Workhorse and NHTSA and will update the story if they respond.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today provided an update on how Apple&#8217;s privacy changes have impacted its ad business. The company had <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FB-Q2-2021-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">already warned</a> investors during its second quarter earnings that it expected to feel an even more significant impact in its ad targeting business by Q3. This morning, it reiterated that point, but also noted that it had been underreporting iOS web conversions by approximately 15%, which had led advertisers to believe the impact was even worse than they had expected.</p>
<p>According to Facebook&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/navigating-change-and-improving-performance-and-measurement">published</a> to its business blog, this exact percentage could vary broadly among individual advertisers. But it said the real-world conversions, including things like sales and app installs, are likely higher than what advertisers are seeing when using Facebook&#8217;s analytics.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s stock has dropped by nearly 4% on this news, as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Facebook has shared misleading metrics. In the past, however, it had inflated its video ad metrics and didn&#8217;t quickly act to correct the problem, leading to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/facebook-knew-ad-metrics-were-inflated-but-ignored-the-problem-lawsuit-claims.html">a class-action lawsuit</a>. In this case, however, the issue with the metrics isn&#8217;t making Facebook look better than it is, but worse. The company noted it&#8217;s been hearing from its advertising community that they are seeing a larger-than-planned impact to their ad investments on the network, raising concerns.</p>
<p>Facebook offered advertisers a few tips to help them better understand a campaign&#8217;s impact and performance in this new era. It suggested waiting a minimum of 72 hours or the full length of the optimization window before evaluating performance rather than making assessments on a daily basis, as before. It also said advertisers should analyze reporting at the campaign level, when possible, as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/micro_site/url/?click_creative_path[0]=link&amp;click_from_context_menu=true&amp;country=US&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F311705270326952&amp;event_type=click&amp;last_nav_impression_id=038HUuAMQx3vR9ZtP&amp;max_percent_page_viewed=34&amp;max_viewport_height_px=845&amp;max_viewport_width_px=1680&amp;orig_http_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2F&amp;orig_request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fnews%2Fnavigating-change-and-improving-performance-and-measurement&amp;primary_cmsid=4298554343565860&amp;primary_content_locale=en_US&amp;region=noam&amp;scrolled=true&amp;session_id=1BlWFa01oHOpSUeWp&amp;site=fb4b&amp;extra_data[view_type]=v3_initial_view&amp;extra_data[site_section]=news&amp;extra_data[placement]=%2Fbusiness%2Fnews%2Fnavigating-change-and-improving-performance-and-measurement&amp;extra_data[creative_detail]=FBBHelp_SomeEstimatedConversions">some estimated conversations</a> are reported with a delay. And it suggested advertisers choose web events (like a purchase or sign-up) that are most aligned with their core business, among other things.</p>
<p>To address the issues with improving its measurements, Facebook said it&#8217;s working to improve its conversion modeling, accelerating its investments to address reporting gaps, launching new capabilities to track web conversions, and extending its ability to measure in-app conversions in apps that have already been installed. The company said it would work quickly to fix bugs, including one that recently had led to underreporting of approximately 10%, which was previously shared with advertisers.</p>
<p>The company in August explained how it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/building-for-the-future">working</a> to adapt its personalized ads business in light of both Apple and Google&#8217;s privacy changes and the new regulatory landscape, but those efforts will take time, it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outside of the ad tech updates themselves, Facebook has also been working on new products that would allow advertisers to better position themselves in front of consumers browsing Facebook&#8217;s apps. Just last week, for instance, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-revamps-its-business-tool-lineup-following-threats-to-its-ad-targeting-business/">revamped its business tool lineup</a> with the introduction of new features and expansions of smaller tests that would offer businesses more ways to be discovered. One such test in the U.S. would direct consumers to other businesses and topics directly underneath news feed posts. It also now allows businesses to add WhatsApp buttons to their Instagram profiles and create ads that send Instagram users to WhatsApp business chats.</p>
<p>Facebook has been warning advertisers for some time that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">Apple’s new privacy features</a>, which allow mobile users to opt out of being tracked across their iOS apps, would cause issues for the way its ad targeting business typically operated. And it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/"> repeatedly argued that Apple’s changes</a> would impact small businesses that relied on Facebook ads to reach their customers. When the changes went into effect, Facebook&#8217;s concerns were validated as <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">studies found</a> very few consumers are opting into tracking on iOS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Toast and Freshworks both raised their IPO ranges and priced above the raised interval. If you are looking for an indication that it's a good time to go public, this is it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that Klarna is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/really-this-market-isnt-good-enough/">waiting for more favorable market conditions</a> before going public felt a little odd yesterday. Today, hesitation to go public feels downright strange. New pricing information from U.S. tech unicorn Toast and Indian tech unicorn Freshworks indicate that the IPO market is more than welcoming.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<p>Toast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/toast-raises-ipo-price-range-providing-a-monday-bump-to-fintech-valuations/">raised its IPO range</a> and priced above that raised interval. Freshworks also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/freshworks-valuation-could-crest-10b-in-upcoming-ipo/">bumped up its IPO price expectations</a> and then priced above <em>that</em> set of price targets.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>If you are looking for an indication that it&#8217;s a good time to go public, this is it. Sure, both companies have yet to start trading, but even flat debuts would represent strong fundraising tallies and strong upward mobility in valuation terms.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re going to run the final numbers, calculating how much the companies are worth and what those figures say about startup prices, especially in the payments space. And then we&#8217;ll close with one of the more humorous answers I&#8217;ve ever gotten from a startup executive. Sound good? Let&#8217;s talk money.</p>
<h2>Freshworks, Toast price well</h2>
<p>Toast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/toast-looks-toward-18b-valuation-in-upcoming-ipo/">first targeted</a> an IPO range of between $30 and $33 per share. The company then looked toward a $34 to $36 per share IPO price. It finally sold 21,739,131 shares <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921006179/en/Toast-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $40 apiece</a>, with its underwriters having the option to purchase another 3,260,869 shares at its IPO price if they so choose. The company&#8217;s IPO fundraise could be worth as much as $1.0 billion in its debut.</p>
<p>Freshworks set its IPO price range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">between $28 and $32 per share</a>. That didn&#8217;t last, with the customer support software company raising its range to between $32 and $34 per share. Freshworks <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/freshworks-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301382238.html">priced at $36</a> per share, selling 28,500,000 shares with an underwriter option of 2,850,000 more shares. The company&#8217;s IPO fundraise could be worth as much as $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Recall that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/">Renaissance Capital</a> valued Toast at $17.9 billion at $31.50 per share (the midpoint of its first IPO range), and Freshworks at $9.6 billion at $30 per share (again, the midpoint of its first IPO pricing interval), both calculated with <em>fully </em>diluted share counts. Simple math indicates that Toast is worth around $22.7 billion at its IPO price, and Freshworks at $11.5 billion, again using fully diluted share counts.</p>
<p>You will see lower numbers out there, likely calculated using a simple &#8212; more conservative &#8212; share count. Those are also valid.</p>
<p>In revenue multiple terms, Toast&#8217;s and Freshworks&#8217; final IPO prices are good news for the companies. With $424.7 million in Q2 revenues, Toast is worth 13.4x its annual run rate. Freshworks is worth 32.5x its own run rate. The differential that we see there is the difference between the two companies&#8217; business models. Toast is a majority payments/fintech company, while Freshworks is a more pure-play SaaS company. SaaS has stronger gross margins than payments revenues &#8212; and is stickier (i.e., recurring) than transaction incomes. So, it gets a higher multiple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airlines have a relatively straightforward goal &#8212; getting people in seats &#8212; but they’ve traditionally relied on inefficient and outdated statistical modeling methods to predict what prices and other conditions will sell tickets.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://flyrlabs.com/">FLYR Labs</a>. The company has developed a deep learning platform to forecast airline demand and set airfare prices, and it’s now secured $150 million in Series C funding to grow both its core business and expand into other verticals.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2013 by Alex Mans, Cyril Guiraud and Jean Tripier, originally started as a consumer-focused platform. It offered a product called FareKeep that let travelers lock in the price of a ticket for a week, for a fee (TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/flyr-raised-8-million-to-change-the-way-we-buy-plane-tickets/">wrote about it</a> back in 2017). Then, in 2019, the company made a hard pivot away from consumer into B2B, in part because of interest from airlines.</p>
<p>“We realized that these traditional forecasting and pricing systems that airlines used to use […] they only used inventory levels and booking arrivals as an indicator of demand, and they only used relatively simplistic forms of regression forecasting to draw the line from recent history into the future,” Mans told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The problem with that method, according to FLYR, is that the entire forecast is thrown off when a new variable is introduced, like a new competitor entering the market, for example.</p>
<p>“We were very surprised how little data directly feeds that decision-making, how simplistic their models were,” he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206251" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206251" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2206251" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flyr_alex_mans_02-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flyr_alex_mans_02-1.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flyr_alex_mans_02-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flyr_alex_mans_02-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flyr_alex_mans_02-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flyr_alex_mans_02-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flyr_alex_mans_02-1.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flyr_alex_mans_02-1.png?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flyr_alex_mans_02-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206251" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://flyrlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FLYR Labs <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>FLYR Labs has developed a deep learning platform called “Revenue Operating System” that ingests a whole host of data provided by the airline &#8212; bookings, accounting data, searches, capacity &#8212; as well as information like weather or promotions to predict demand, revenue and, most importantly, to set the price of the airline ticket that the consumer ultimately sees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also uses competitor schedules and capacity to inform its modeling, which is purchased from third-party sources. (FLYR doesn’t train its model for any individual customer using their competitor’s data, so one airline using the company’s service wouldn’t have to worry about its historical data being used to strengthen another airline’s revenues.) From all these sources, the model is able to understand trends &#8212; even across routes or flight times &#8212; that can then inform new flights that have never been flown by the airline before.</p>
<p>Because the system across airline customers is trying to solve for the same problem &#8212; how do I price a seat so that it will sell? &#8212; the model will get smarter over time, FLYR says.</p>
<p>The company estimates it is able to increase the revenue of airlines by 5-7%, and the company does so not by just raising prices across the board, Mans said. “We create opportunities, both lower and higher priced, in the market that overall increases revenue,” he said. He added that 70-80% of travelers pay the same or less than they would under airlines’ legacy forecasting system.</p>
<p>FLYR offers a relatively low-risk onboarding process for new customers, deploying its software and going live with it on a subset of the airline’s network, generally 20-40%. It then conducts an A/B test for around 3-4 months to prove that its platform increases revenue, and takes its payment as a percentage of that incremental revenue performance.</p>
<p>FLYR’s methods have started to pay off: the company has around $14 billion in airline revenue under management, meaning it sets the ticket prices for that amount of revenues. While the startup is staying mum on its specific customers, it anticipates managing around $100 billion of airline revenues by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>That explosive growth forecasting is reflected in the company’s actual growth over the past 12 months. FLYR is opening up three new offices in Los Angeles, Dallas and Amsterdam in September, October and November respectively, in addition to its headquarters in San Francisco and an engineering office in Krakow, Poland. Its workforce has grown from about 50 people nine months ago to 150 today, and it plans on adding another 100 by January. In all, 80% of its workforce will be in engineering and data science, Mans said.</p>
<p>Once FLYR started seeing traction with airlines, it started getting calls &#8212; from car rental companies, cruise lines, railway companies, even events businesses interested in FLYR’s platform. Mans realized that the data these travel and transportation companies work with, as well as what they’re optimizing for, is not so dissimilar to that of airlines. So growing into neighboring verticals will be a huge focus for the company looking to 2022, he said.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the company’s also aiming to scale the capacity of its product. As Mans put it, “We realized that we&#8217;re not just a pricing system.” He said that better forecasting can help companies understand “when to add or remove capacity, or where to spend your marketing dollars to have higher yielding returns, or for the executive team to understand earlier how the quarter has gone.”</p>
<p>The funding round was led by WestCap, with participation from Silver Lake Waterman, WndrCo, as well as Peter Thiel, Streamlined Ventures, JetBlue Technology Ventures and Gopher Asset Management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ironcladapp.com/">Ironclad</a>, a startup that helps legal teams manage and coordinate contracts in a digital context, announced the hiring of two new executives today.</p>
<p>For starters, the company is bringing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lseka/">Leyla Seka</a> as COO. Seka was most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/operator-collective-brings-diversity-and-inclusion-to-enterprise-investing/">a partner at Operator Collective</a>, and prior to that spent more than decade at Salesforce, where she helped launch the Salesforce AppExchange. In addition, the company has hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-wang-0677bb4/">Helen Wang</a> as the company&#8217;s first chief financial officer. Wang spent the previous seven years at eBay, most recently as CFO of Global Payments.</p>
<p>Seka, who is also a founder at the Black Venture Institute and on the board of Girls Who Code, says that she had been working with Ironclad in her capacity as an investor, and had known Ironclad CEO and co-founder Jason Boehmig for years. Recently she had been helping him find a new COO and they had a candidate in mind who was waffling about accepting the offer. That&#8217;s when she casually dropped the idea about hiring her instead.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Q6ipLvmKWL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/operator-collective-brings-diversity-and-inclusion-to-enterprise-investing/">Operator Collective brings diversity and inclusion to enterprise investing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Operator Collective brings diversity and inclusion to enterprise investing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/operator-collective-brings-diversity-and-inclusion-to-enterprise-investing/embed/#?secret=Q6ipLvmKWL" data-secret="Q6ipLvmKWL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I said to Jason, &#8216;I don&#8217;t understand why someone wouldn&#8217;t want to come build a sure thing. I don&#8217;t get it.&#8217; And as I said this [I was thinking], &#8216;Leyla why don&#8217;t you build this sure thing. What are you doing?!&#8217; I just really flippantly said something like, &#8216;I should come help you do this,'&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Boehmig jumped at that idea and the two began a series of meetings to discuss what that would really look like. Seka said she saw something in Ironclad that she wanted to be a part of. That&#8217;s a 7 year old software company that has raised $184 million along the way. Today it has 300 employees and 1000 customers. And, more importantly for her, it has the kind of energy she says that she hadn&#8217;t seen since her early days at Salesforce when it was a much smaller company than it is today.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, she admitted that as much as she had enjoyed her time as a venture capitalist, she missed being in the center of building a business. &#8220;I realized not only did I miss the work, I missed the community and being part of a company. I derive a lot of value from being with other people and working towards a big goal like that,&#8221; she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two came to an agreement over the ensuing months and in a final meeting Boehmig, who has a passion for vinyl records, gave Seka the offer to be COO in a copy of the Grateful Dead&#8217;s Live Europe &#8217;72 album.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206587" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206587" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2206587" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?w=680" alt="Grateful Dead, Live Europe '72 album cover with offer in it ." width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg 4030w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206587" class="wp-caption-text">Grateful Dead, Live Europe &#8217;72 album cover with offer in it. Photo credit: Ironclad</p></div></p>
<p>Wang on the other hand came through a more conventional search as the company was looking for an experienced CFO and she fit the bill. &#8220;We ran a search and we had all of these candidates and Helen was clearly the best candidate. So it&#8217;s actually interesting to compare the two processes. With Leyla, I wasn&#8217;t interviewing COOs. It wasn&#8217;t really an open role at the company, but it just kind of organically happened. And here we are,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wang says that she approaches the job strategically. &#8220;It&#8217;s my job is to tell you how much revenue we brought in last month. It&#8217;s part of my job to tell you how much something costs, but my job is really helping my operating partners make bigger core decisions faster,&#8221; she said. In her view that means &#8220;using the P&amp;L (profit and loss statement) as a bit of a North Star to help us make better decisions that will benefit the company, benefit our customers, and ultimately our stakeholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Boehmig recognizes that unfortunately female executives remain a rarity in Silicon Valley, he sees that blind spot as something that he can take advantage of to bring the best and the brightest into his company. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to say I&#8217;m bringing in Helen and Leyla for some like idealistic reasons, and I&#8217;m happy about the idealistic reasons &#8212; I believe in this and it&#8217;s great &#8212; but we&#8217;re hiring them because they&#8217;re the best in the world at what they do &#8212; and they are,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wang has been in the position for a couple of months now. Seka, who will remain Chair of the Board of Advisors at Operator Collective, is still in the process of coming and board, a process that should be complete in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Regulators typically seek industry feedback when forming new rules, particularly in industries where the pace of technological advancements mean that progress in the market has far outpaced the development of new, and amendment of existing, regulation.

<p>Armstrong clearly would prefer if there were an overarching federal framework that would alleviate the burden of dealing with independent state-by-state rules and agencies. But he also did seem aware that any proposal they put forward will definitely be just a single piece of a larger puzzle, which will include input from other industry entities working in crypto as well as guidance from existing related regulation.</p>

<p>Coinbase recently clashed with the SEC after teasing the launch of a &#8216;Lend&#8217; product that would allow its users to stake their crypto holdings in exchange for a return in the form of yearly interest. The SEC threatened to sue over the product since it signalled that this would represent a security, and be regulated as such, and C<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/following-sec-lawsuit-threat-coinbase-cancels-launch-of-lend-product/">oinbase quietly walked back its plans to debut the product for now shortly after making public the SEC&#8217;s threat and articulating its lack of comprehension about the potential regulatory backlash</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video is at the heart of how people use the internet today, and creators are at the heart of what is being made and watched on video. Today, a startup that has built a platform that helps them produce and monetize their work is announcing a big round of funding that underscores just how lucrative and big the creator economy has become.</p>
<p><a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StreamElements</a>, which provides production and analytics tools to people who livestream and make video-on-demand for platforms like Amazon&#8217;s Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook, has raised $100 million in funding &#8212; money that it will be using to continue building out the tools on its platform, to do more in on-demand alongside a big business in livestreaming, and for marketing, specifically to bring more creators to its platform, which is already being used by 1.1 million people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to be everywhere creators are, which means expanding to new platforms, such as using the new funds to build out our presence on Trovo,&#8221; said co-founder Gil Hirsch. &#8220;It also means going beyond the livestreaming space and bringing our proprietary audience experience-driven technology to YouTube videos where we are creating some industry firsts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company competes against a wide swathe of others in the so-called creator economy, including many of the video platforms themselves building their own production and monetization features, so the race for more talent is not a small one.</p>
<p>In keeping with that, to sharpen up their business focus, alongside the funding news, the Tel-Aviv/Los Angeles-based company is also announcing some significant executive changes. Co-founder Gil Hirsch is taking on the role of CEO, with co-founder <span class="s1">Doron Nir (who had been the CEO up to now) moving over to president. Yuval Tal as COO, Jason Krebs as CBO, and Udi Hoffmann as CFO are rounding out the executive bench. (The other two co-founders are Or Perry and Reem Sherman.)</span></p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is leading this latest round, which also includes new backers PayPal Ventures and MoreTech; as well as previous investors <span class="s1">State of Mind Ventures, Pitango, Menorah, and Mivtach Shamir. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">StreamElements is not disclosing its valuation, but this round is coming in the wake of very strong growth for the company, after a prolonged period where user-generated video consumption went through the roof. That was not just because of the popularity of apps like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube (now with <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-gaming-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 million gaming channels</a>, among other content) and Twitch (which passed <em>2 billion</em> hours of watched video in January 2021); but also because video became a pastime and lifeline for many people after other activities and sometimes even movement outside of the house became restricted after the rise of Covid-19.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic had a massive impact on our business,&#8221; Hirsch said in an emailed interview with me. &#8220;In addition to people in quarantine watching more content, more people started creating it. We know this because our monthly users went from a couple hundred thousand before the quarantine and less than a year later it is now over a million. In addition, brands had to move their marketing spends from in-person events to digital campaigns with livestreamers becoming more appealing as a promotional vehicle. As a result, we regularly hear from major brands more frequently about coordinating influencer-driven sponsorship activations since that is our specialty.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of StreamElements, the company said usage of its platform grew 233%, and it has especially seen some strong traction with some of the more popular creators. It said that over 60% of the top content creators &#8212; those with 20,000 or more views and followers across multiple platforms &#8212; use the  StreamElements dashboard.</p>
<p>While StreamElements has made its name up to now mostly with livestreaming and working with, say, gamers on platforms like Twitch to help them produce content, manage conversations, and build in ways of making money, it&#8217;s now looking to focus more attention on video-on-demand, the company said &#8212; an area where it had already provided some services but will be doubling down to address what it sees as an untapped opportunity, especially in contrast to livestreaming.</p>
<p class="p8">“YouTube currently has over <span class="s2">40 million active gaming channels</span>, making it the largest gaming platform in the world,” said Hirsch in a statement. “The bulk of this content [is] on-demand videos, which lack the real-time engagement functionality that has driven the success of the livestreamed market. We are focused on infusing on demand videos with dynamic interactive features to strengthen the communities around this type of content.”</p>
<p>Notably, currently, StreamElements&#8217; creator tools are 100% free to use, so as Hirsch described it to me, &#8220;The primary way we generate revenue is through brand partnerships. We offer influencer-driven sponsorship activations that rely on our proprietary technology which already powers the majority of the top creators’ channels and enables unparalleled depth in terms of the measurement brands are looking for.&#8221; This is one reason why the company is going to focus on bringing more of these high-volume creators to its platform. Currently, he said the majority of its creators are based in US, Europe, and Brazil although the aim will be to continue to tap more people in more markets internationally, a mass market play that is exactly the kind of business SoftBank likes to back.</p>
<p class="p8">“As online entertainment continues to develop as an immersive experience, the demand for authentic creator-driven content has grown exponentially,&#8221; said Nahoko Hoshino, a senior investor for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “Through a suite of broadcasting and engagement tools, StreamElements is helping creators deliver an enriched experience for audiences while monetizing content from the most popular social video platforms. This creates an exciting, new digital market between creators and fans, and we’re thrilled to be working with the company in building engagement across an ever-widening global community.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Longer term, it will be interesting to see how and where StreamElements develops, and whether it chooses to invest in its own streaming platform, or indeed if one of the big ones acquires it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&#8220;We are more focused on ubiquity than being aligned solely with one platform because we see transcendent creators as the future,&#8221; Hirsch said. &#8220;This is a person whose personal brand is more powerful than any one platform. Oprah is an example of reaching peak transcendence with her magazines, a television network, and more, all of which have succeeded because of her name more than the medium. To be transcendent, it means giving up the security of an exclusivity contract and betting on your own brand for success. Marketing is all about reach and frequency, so spending all day building a community primarily on one platform is not optimal for achieving that larger presence.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every few years all of the iPad mini lovers hold their breath as they wait to see whether this very specific device will keep on trucking or hit the chopping block. Well they probably needn’t worry for a while as the device just got a big modern makeover with Apple’s new iPad Pro-like design, an A15 Bionic SoC and new display tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also probably shouldn’t worry so much because the iPad mini actually sells extremely well to a handful of markets. Professionals, including pilots, health care workers and industrial workers all use tablet devices for essential job functions &#8212; and Apple’s iPad is essentially the only device out there with enough penetration and compatibility to be viable. There basically isn’t a cockpit in the sky without an iPad. And where space is a premium like strapped to a pilot’s leg or in the large pocket of a lab coat, the iPad mini reigns supreme. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are, of course, just a broad array of people who find the iPad mini to be the perfect portable travel size and much easier to hold in the hand for long reading or watching sessions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new iPad mini brings all of those people right up to date in hardware and software. The redesign of the mini to incorporate the iPad Air and Pro design language is a welcome unification of the design theory of Apple’s “top end” iPads. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2206574" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The iPad &#8212; the entry point &#8212; also gets a behind the scenes upgrade while staying at the same price, which is nice. It does not get any of the new design cues or compatibility with the new pencil, but it’s still a very capable machine for the price. Given that Apple basically owns the tablet market, Apple could have phoned in the entry model bigtime but it’s still very good for the price and in use still feels fast and familiar. An IPS display and A13 Bionic may not be the edge of the envelope but if your need is just “an iPad” it’s nice to be able to buy the basic model and not be sold short at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the iPad mini gets both barrels &#8212; and a price point to match. At $499, Apple is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aiming for the entry point with this. The message is clearly “this is the best iPad we can make at this size,” and not at all, “smaller, cheaper.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For users who love the form factor but don’t love to be stuck a generation or two behind, that is an ideal scenario. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2206573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest new behavior here is the top-mounted Touch ID, which debuted with the iPad Air. It’s fine &#8212; works fast and easily for the most part though it can lead to some awkward loops where you’re ‘resting to unlock’ but accidentally tap the power button to turn it back off. Overall I’d say it’s actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">easier</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use here than the Air, however, given that your hand fits around the edge of it that much easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some usability notes that aren’t that different from years past but still persist include that the split screen implementation is barely enough. It works but it feels a tad cramped at times, there could be a better solution here. Icon sizing is also a bit rough in vertical mode but feels perfect in horizontal. The sum is that there really needs a tweaked version of iPadOS specifically made for the iPad mini. At some points in its life I think that this definitely felt like more of a super long shot in the ‘will it happen’ department but now with the renewed and refreshed model on the table I’m willing to lobby for a 2022 bump that puts the iPad mini on its own plane of usability.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-6.01.27-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2206605" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-6.01.27-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything else about it is really enjoyable. The speed, lightness and increased screen size really make this feel like one of the most “iPad” iPads since the original. Looking back now the OG iPad was actually fairly heavy &#8212; but using it and touching it then, in context, really was shocking. A pure slab of computer. This version of the mini brings that feeling back for me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve done some reading, browsing and watching with it over the next couple of days and it’s been great. The addition of the new version of the Apple Pencil (made possible by the flat sides and magnetic charging) is a nice watershed, and makes this a great sketching tool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know you want an iPad mini you probably already know you want one &#8212; but if you’re on the fence, this is everything the iPad Air has to offer and more in a smaller package with all of the latest muscle. Very enticing on the whole.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber Eats is adding a new pickup map feature to its app that will allow users to search for restaurants or merchants close to them. The map localizes to the user, allowing them to type in what kind food they&#8217;re looking for using either words or emojis to see what&#8217;s nearby, including the exact distance from the user&#8217;s location.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206390" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206390" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2206390 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206390" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uber Eats</p></div></p>
<p>The new map feature is the latest example of Uber&#8217;s aim to build out Eats — a business unit the company believes will help it hit its profitability targets. Earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/uber-adjusts-third-quarter-forecast-in-light-of-increased-gross-bookings/">Uber said it could hit one measure of profitability</a> in the third quarter, earlier than expected. Uber said it anticipates an increase in gross bookings and stronger adjusted EBITDA in the quarter than it had forecasted for shareholders in its last investor presentation.</p>
<p>Eats says the new feature was inspired by feedback from as many as 8 out of 10 users who have switched to other map apps to search for nearby food. The map is rolling out globally and should be available now to most users, according to an Uber Eats spokesperson.</p>
<p>Within the Uber Eats app and the Uber app itself, users will see options to choose Delivery or Pickup at the top. The map is activated when a user selects Pickup specifically. Typing in a burger or pizza emoji should direct the user to nearby burger or pizza joints, which the company says creates increased functionality that is both a time-saver and a fun way to explore local commerce.</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">Uber Eats says there are 700,000 local restaurants and merchants on its pickup map. The company anticipates an international rise in pickup orders and said it wants to make it easy for customers to quickly visualize their search results.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The platform aims to give multi-channel brands a leg up when it comes to determining what the ideal stock level would be across all of their sales channels and inventory locations. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://flieber.com/">Flieber</a> wants to help e-commerce retailers get back to what they do best: selling.</p>
<p>The New York-based company announced Wednesday $12 million in Series A financing to continue developing its inventory optimization platform that uses analytics and machine learning to give multi-channel brands a leg up when it comes to determining what the ideal stock level would be across all of the sales channels and inventory locations.</p>
<p>The investment was co-led by GGV Capital and Monashees to bring the company’s total funding to $20 million since CEO Fabricio Miranda co-founded Flieber in 2019 with CTO Jair Vercosa.</p>
<p>Miranda, who previously founded and sold a water treatment company in Brazil before coming to the U.S. and working at a hedge fund, told TechCrunch the company’s predictive platform puts users in the driver’s seat for sales, supply chain operations and inventory decisions so that they can keep up with the pace of sales so that they avoid having too much, or not enough, inventory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was while he was at the hedge fund that he met someone opening an Amazon store and became interested in the process so much that he left the hedge fund and became an Amazon seller. His business became one of the top sellers, he said, and he learned the dynamics of the business and online retailing. In the course of opening several other businesses to support online sellers, like an advertising platform and financing business, Flieber was created to help retailers understand their inventory.</p>
<p>“When you open a retail business, you like selling, but in the end, you wind up spending 80% of your time with operations,” Miranda said. “Selling is so easy now with the marketplaces, but everything in order to sell is still from the 1950s, so we started studying it.”</p>
<p>He explained that inventory optimization is different from inventory management. Optimization makes sure a retailer has the right inventory at any given time to sell what needs to be sold. The approach is intelligence for decision-making, automation and supply chain layers, essentially telling the retailer what is the next best action with regards to inventory. Inventory management, on the other hand, is knowing what a retailer has to-date to be able to sell.</p>
<p>One of the main problems retailers often face is being out of stock. If a retailer is always out of stock of popular items and overstocked on lesser selling items, the retailer is consistently losing out on sales of the popular item while tying up revenue in inventory that isn’t selling, Miranda added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stockly lets e-commerce websites sell out-of-stock items from a shared inventory&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/stockly-lets-e-commerce-websites-sell-out-of-stock-items-from-a-shared-inventory/embed/#?secret=1JoH7dRfkv" data-secret="1JoH7dRfkv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Flieber’s technology gathers data to predict, for example, which products sell in a certain quantity and alerts the retailer to place an order for new inventory by a certain date in order to be able to sell it four months from that date. It also monitors sales so if those are accelerating or slowing down, retailers will know to either speed up or slow down the manufacturing process or reduce the sales.</p>
<p>“We are all the time projecting what you need and when to launch a new product,” Miranda said. “If a retailer’s product is similar to another product, the system is also able to predict how well that similar product will sell.”</p>
<p>Miranda said no other company was solving inventory optimization with this approach, so the opportunity “is a blue ocean.” He also sees the online retail world consolidating and moving back to the offline world, and the days of being “an Amazon seller” will be no more as retailers will sell where the consumers are, which will make inventory more complex.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Flieber now has clients selling in 15 countries and more than 400,000 products running on its platform. It has processed more than 20 million sales orders, and its system currently makes over 500,000 calculations daily.</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward accelerating that growth, improving the company’s data, hiring more data scientists and engineers and expanding its APIs.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Monashees will join GGV on the board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marketplaces and platforms have made selling products really easy,” said Carlo Dapuzzo, partner at Monashees, in a statement. “But everything that happens until you have the product in inventory ready to be sold is still extremely complex. Flieber&#8217;s mission to democratize that part of retail is a much needed step for the future of the retail industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Owners of Alexa devices will soon be able to use OnStar’s emergency services from their homes, under an expanded partnership between OnStar’s parent company General Motors and Amazon.</p>
<p>OnStar already expanded OnStar Guardian earlier this year with the introduction of the Guardian app, which lets customers access the service via their mobile device. This latest expansion will now bring customers’ voice-enabled home devices into that ecosystem.</p>
<p>While a customer could theoretically use the Guardian app inside their home today, GM’s head of Product Jeff Wajer told TechCrunch in a recent interview that there are many instances where people don’t have their phones on them but nevertheless may need to access emergency help. He noted that people with different accessibility levels, who may be unable to use a phone, could nevertheless shout for help using the OnStar-Alexa integration.</p>
<p>The integration will be rolled out gradually, first to an initial cohort of existing OnStar customers and then more broadly in 2022. Compatible Alexa devices include the Echo, Echo Dot or Echo Show. GM declined to provide further details on how many customers will have initial access to the service, or how much it might cost, but Wajer did say there would be an initial free trial for OnStar customers in the first cohort.</p>
<p>OnStar Guardian is available to customers regardless of whether they drive a GM vehicle. However, this is not GM’s first collaboration with Amazon. The company has already introduced Amazon Alexa to the infotainment systems of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/gm-is-bringing-amazon-alexa-to-2018-and-newer-cadillac-chevy-buick-and-gmc-vehicles/">select vehicles</a>, and this newest partnership marks a strengthening of the ties between the two companies.</p>
<p>It’s also an indication that the automaker is seeking to strengthen its software and subscription businesses beyond the vehicle itself. The new offering “demonstrates GM’s commitment to its growth strategy and innovating its software enabled services,” the automaker’s VP of global innovation, Pam Fletcher, said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sundayapp.com">Sunday</a>, a startup that didn’t exist just a few months ago, has raised a $100 million Series A funding round. Today’s funding round is led by Coatue with participation from partners of DST Global. Investors in the restaurant, hospitality and tech industries are also participating.</p>
<p>I already wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/sunday-raises-24-million-seed-round-to-build-a-fast-restaurant-checkout-flow/">lengthy profile</a> of Sunday when it announced its $24 million seed round back in April. I encourage you to read it in case you want to learn more about the company.</p>
<p>Sunday has been founded by Victor Lugger, Tigrane Seydoux and Christine de Wendel. The first two co-founders in this list are also the founders of <a href="https://www.bigmammagroup.com">Big Mamma</a>. Christine de Wendel was previously the head of France at <a href="https://www.zalando.fr">Zalando</a> and the COO of <a href="https://www.manomano.fr">ManoMano</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, the startup has developed a checkout system for physical restaurants. You can put QR codes on tables, customers can scan this QR code and browse the menu. When everyone is done, you can scan the QR code again to check the bill, leave a tip, split the bill and walk away. Customers can pay using Apple Pay, Google Pay, American Express, Visa and Mastercard.</p>

<p>The product connects directly with your existing cash register system. The company supports Oracle Micros, Brinks, Tiller, Zelty, Revo, CashPad, etc. Restaurants don’t pay any monthly subscription fee or setup fee. Sunday charges pay processing fees based on usage.</p>
<p>And it’s an easy sell as most customers choose to pay using the QR code. Restaurants can save in wait time and get a better table turnover rate as people tend to leave the restaurant more quickly. Of course, some people want human interactions when they go to a restaurant and Sunday thinks those interactions can create friction. Not everybody will be a fan of the product.</p>
<p>While Sunday launched its product just five months ago, 1.1 million people have used Sunday to pay for a restaurant bill already. Over 1,500 restaurants are using it around the world. The startup is executing at a rapid pace as it has hired 170 employees across five countries —&nbsp;the U.S., the U.K., Spain, France and Canada.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the startup plans to expand to new restaurants, launch new features, such as table booking, ordering and loyalty programs. And the company wants to increase its growth rate. By the end of 2022, Sunday hopes to work with 15,000 restaurants. The team will also double in size over the next twelve months.</p>
<p>“This new investment round is a remarkable opportunity for Sunday to build a powerful tech stack and develop new product features such as ordering &amp; loyalty programs. It also allows us to accelerate in the U.S. market by growing our sales, operations and partnerships teams. We are now in a very good position to hire top talent to drive the speed and stellar execution needed to succeed,” co-founder and CEO US Christine de Wendel said in a statement.</p>
