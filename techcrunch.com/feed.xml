										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Retail giant Walmart <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/05/13/walmart-announces-plans-to-acquire-zeekit-a-leading-virtual-fitting-room-platform-to-enable-enhanced-and-social-shopping-experience-for-customer">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s acquiring the Tel Aviv-based startup <a href="https://zeekit.me/">Zeekit</a>, which allows consumers to virtually &#8220;try on&#8221; clothing when shopping online. The company leverages a combination of real-time image processing, computer vision, deep learning and other A.I. technology to show shoppers how they would look in an item by way of a simulation that takes into account body dimensions, fit, size, and even the fabric of the garment itself.</p>
<p>Deal terms were not disclosed. According to data from Pitchbook, Zeekit had raised over $24 million in outside capital, including its most recent round of <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3828775,00.html">$15 million in May 2020</a>. The company had already been working with a range of retailers and brands at the time of its fundraise, including Walmart, as well Mary&#8217;s, Asos, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas, and others.</p>
<p>Zeekit had been founded in 2013 by CEO Yael Vizel, VP of Research and Development Nir Appleboim and CTO Alon Kristal, with the premise that if online shoppers could see how clothing would look on their own bodies, the technology could reduce the rate of returns due to non-fitting, non-flattering items.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2151668" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151668" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2151668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/download.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Walmart says customers will be able to use the Zeekit technology to virtually try on items brands including Free People, Champion, Levi’s Strauss, ELOQUII Elements, Free Assembly, Scoop, Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara, plus its own private label brands, like Time and Tru, Terra &amp; Sky, Wonder Nation and George.</p>
<p>When the technology goes live on Walmart.com, customers can choose to upload an image of their own or choose from a series of models that best represent their height, shape and skin tone in order to see themselves virtually in any item of clothing. The goal is to provide a similar experience to trying on clothing when shopping online as you would otherwise have had when in a retail store.</p>
<p>Shoppers will also be able to share their virtual outfits with friends for a second opinion, via the new integration, adding the social element back into online shopping.</p>
<p>In addition to the virtual try-on, Walmart says Zeekit&#8217;s technology may be used to build other fashion experiences over time, including a virtual closet experience where you could mix and match styles.</p>
<p>With the deal&#8217;s closure, Zeekit&#8217;s three co-founders will be joining Walmart.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re confident that with the team’s expertise in bringing real-time image technologies, computer vision and artificial intelligence to the world of fashion, we’ll identify even more ways to innovate for our customers in our continued effort to be the first-choice destination for fashion,&#8221; said Denise Incandela, Walmart U.S. EVP of Apparel and Private Brands, in an <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/05/13/walmart-announces-plans-to-acquire-zeekit-a-leading-virtual-fitting-room-platform-to-enable-enhanced-and-social-shopping-experience-for-customer">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Walmart in years past had heavily invested in apparel, including by acquiring online brands like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/16/walmart-to-buy-bonobos-for-310m-in-its-bigger-push-into-fashion-retail/">Bonobos</a>, ModCloth, Eloquii, and others, and even tried offering some brands, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/05/bonobos-and-nike-get-their-own-branded-shops-on-walmarts-jet-com/">Nike</a>, their own shop on Walmart. com. Not all of these efforts paid off. <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/walmart-sells-modcloth-to-financial-firm/564464/">Walmart sold ModCloth</a> only a couple of years after buying it, for example, after ModCloth customers balked at being owned by a retail giant, and the brand remained unprofitable.</p>
<p>In addition to the struggles around profitability, apparel more broadly been a harder area for online retail to get right, often because of the difficulties involved with picking out items that have to fit unique bodies and the non-standard sizing fashion designers use &#8212; meaning clothing can run smaller or larger, depending on given brand, even when shopping &#8220;your size.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walmart didn&#8217;t say when Zeekit would go live on Walmart&#8217;s website, only that it would show up &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blubracket.com/">BluBracket</a>, an early stage startup that focuses on keeping source code repositories secure, even in distributed environments, announced a $12 million Series A today.</p>
<p>Evolution Equity Partners led the round with help from existing investors Unusual Ventures, Point72 Ventures, SignalFire and Firebolt Ventures. When combined with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/blubracket-scores-6-5m-seed-to-help-secure-code-in-distributed-environments/">$6.5 million seed round</a> we reported on last year, the company has raised $19.5 million so far.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, being able to secure code in distributed environments came in quite handy when much of the technology world moved to work from home last year. BluBracket co-founder and CEO Ajay Arora says that the pandemic forced many organizations to look carefully at how they secured their code base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So the anxiety organizations had about making sure their source code was secure and that it wasn&#8217;t leaking, from that standpoint that was a big tailwind for us. [With companies moving to a] completely remote development workforce, and with code being so important to their business as intellectual property, they needed to get that visibility into what vulnerabilities were there,&#8221; Arora explained.</p>
<p>Even prior to the pandemic, the company was finding they were gaining traction with developers and security pros by using a bottom up approach offering a free community version of the software. Having that free version as a top of the funnel for their sales motion was also helpful once COVID hit full force.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight/embed/#?secret=zRMcejaEB6" data-secret="zRMcejaEB6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, Arora says the company has multiple thousands of developers, DevOps and SecOps users across dozens of organizations using the company&#8217;s suite of products. The big reference company right now is Priceline, but he says there are other big names that would prefer not to be public about it.</p>
<p>The company currently has 30 employees with plans to double that by the end of the year, and he says that building diversity and inclusion into the hiring process is part of the company&#8217;s core values, and part of how the executive team gets measured.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re big believers in putting our money where our mouth is and one of the OKRs for me and my co-founder [CTO Prakash Linga], or one of the things that we&#8217;re actually compensated for is how well we are doing in building diversity and inclusion on the team,&#8221; he said. He adds that the recruiters that they are using are also being held to the same standard when it comes to providing a diverse set of candidates for open positions.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2018 and the founding team came from Vera, a startup that helped secure documents in motion. That company <a href="https://www.helpsystems.com/about/news/helpsystems-acquires-vera-broaden-data-security-portfolio">was sold to HelpSystems in December 2020</a> after Arora and Linga had left to start BluBracket.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Companies across the United States should be closely following the California State Legislature hearings on the “Silenced No More Act,” which would prevent the use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence employees from speaking up about all forms of discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>The legislation was introduced in response to the stunning claims brought forward by former Pinterest employees alleging a pattern of racial and gender discrimination, harassment and retaliation. They courageously called attention to the hypocrisy of Pinterest’s aspirational comments on social issues even though the company had required them to sign NDAs.</p>
<p>As attorneys who work with shareholders to hold companies accountable for this misconduct, these allegations have deeply impacted our work. They formed the basis of an ongoing shareholder derivative lawsuit that a state pension fund we represent brought against Pinterest’s board of directors and top executives for participating in and otherwise protecting powerful executives who are alleged to have discriminated against Pinterest employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Failure to recognize this necessity will lead to future corporate scandals as multiple accounts of the same type of misconduct in the workplace come to light.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The Silenced No More Act would extend existing laws that limit the use of NDAs. Such laws are important because NDAs are intended to protect executives by keeping their harassment, discrimination and retaliation under wraps. That NDAs chill the voices of employees who have already been victimized makes them even more toxic. NDAs cause women to fear reprisal from the company, sometimes even incorporating financial penalty clauses, long after their individual claims have been resolved.</p>
<p>The Silenced No More Act should pass swiftly and be a model for other states, but this is what all companies throughout the country should be doing on their own, rather than waiting for legislation to drag an ethical NDA policy out of them.</p>
<p>Failure to recognize this necessity will lead to future corporate scandals as multiple accounts of the same type of misconduct in the workplace come to light. It will continue to uphold an unsustainable corporate system where executives in positions of power assume they will be protected no matter how unlawful their behavior toward others in the workplace.</p>
<p>We have seen from our investigations the compounding impacts of NDAs and how they allow problems to fester over years.</p>
<p>The two of us, working with others and on behalf of Alphabet shareholders, were part of the team that led a groundbreaking <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/alphabet-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-.html">$310 million settlement</a> with the tech company that led to historic diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) reforms at the company. That settlement was the result of a shareholder derivative lawsuit where stockholders alleged that executives and board members violated their fiduciary duties by enabling a double standard that allowed executives to sexually harass and discriminate against women without consequence.</p>
<p>In that case, we believe Alphabet’s “culture of concealment” was driven in large part by the silencing effects of NDAs.</p>
<p>The duration of misconduct, enabled by NDAs, goes far beyond Alphabet and Pinterest. There is no shortage of #MeToo scandals at powerful companies, many with presences in California, that were exacerbated by muzzling NDAs. Weinstein Company, Wynn Resorts, NBC and 21st Century Fox are prominent examples of companies that first tried to keep allegations quiet through the use of NDAs and later faced a firestorm of allegations from former employees.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the landscape surrounding discrimination and harassment in the workplace is changing. Shareholders, workers, customers and other key business stakeholders are becoming more active in demanding that companies stop protecting harassers.</p>
<p>All of this should send a message to boards and C-suite executives that they must set the tone from the top and they are far better off being proactive than reactive. That means actively creating a company culture where DEI is a foundational component &#8212; not an afterthought. It also means intentionally prioritizing transparency and proactively doing away with policies that are antithetical to that goal, like NDAs that are intentionally designed to suppress the voices of employees.</p>
<p>The public and shareholders want to be associated with companies that do right by their employees. Business should recognize this change from a culture of compliance to one of equity and inclusion and embrace this new reality by stopping the practice of requiring complainants to enter into NDAs and fostering a culture of inclusion and accountability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More money for the now very buzzy business of reshaping how people work: <a href="https://worksome.eu">Worksome</a> is announcing it recently closed a $13 million Series A funding round for its &#8220;freelance talent platform&#8221; &#8212; after racking up 10x growth in revenue since January 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a remote working boom.</p>
<p>The 2017 founded startup, which has a couple of ex-Googlers in its leadership team, has built a platform to connect freelancers looking for professional roles with employers needing tools to find and manage freelancer talent.</p>
<p>It says it&#8217;s seeing traction with large enterprise customers that have traditionally used Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to manage and pay external workforces &#8212; and views employment agency giants like Randstad, Adecco and Manpower as ripe targets for disruption.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Most multinational enterprises manage flexible workers using legacy MSPs,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Morten Petersen (one of the Xooglers). &#8220;These largely analogue businesses manage complex compliance and processes around hiring and managing freelance workforces with handheld processes and outdated technology that is not built for managing fluid workforces. Worksome tackles this industry head on with a better, faster and simpler solution to manage large freelancer and contractor workforces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worksome focuses on helping medium/large companies &#8212; who are working with at least 20+ freelancers at a time &#8212; fill vacancies within teams rather than helping companies outsource projects, per Petersen, who suggests the latter is the focus for the majority of freelancer platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worksome helps [companies] onboard people who will provide necessary skills and will be integral to longer-term business operations. It makes matches between companies and skilled freelancers, which the businesses go on to trust, form relationships with and come back to time and time again,&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;When companies hire dozens or hundreds of freelancers at one time, processes can get very complicated,&#8221; he adds, arguing that on compliance and payments Worksome &#8220;takes on a much greater responsibility than other freelancing platforms to make big hires easier&#8221;.</p>
<p>The startup also says it&#8217;s concerned with looking out for (and looking after) its freelancer talent pool &#8212; saying it wants to create &#8220;a world of meaningful work&#8221; on its platform, and ensure freelancers are paid fairly and competitively. (And also that they are paid faster than they otherwise might be, given it takes care of their payroll so they don&#8217;t have to chase payments from employers.)</p>
<p>The business started life in Copenhagen &#8212; and its Series A has a distinctly Nordic flavor, with investment coming from the Danish business angel and investor on the local version of the <em>Dragons&#8217; Den</em> TV program Løvens Hule; the former Minister for Higher Education and Science, Tommy Ahlers; and family home manufacturer Lind &amp; Risør.</p>
<p>It had raised just under $6M prior to thus round, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/worksome/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, and also counts some (unnamed) Google executives among its earlier investors.</p>
<p>Freelancer platforms (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/upwork-ipo/">marketplaces</a>) aren&#8217;t new, of course. There are also an increasing number of players in this space &#8212; buoyed by a <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">new flush of VC dollars chasing the &#8216;future of work&#8217;, whatever hybrid home-office flexible shape that might take. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So Worksome is by no means alone in offering tech tools to streamline the interface between freelancers and businesses.</span></p>
<p>A few others that spring to mind include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/lystable-takes-10m-top-up-to-tackle-freelancer-payments/">Lystable</a> (now Kalo), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/malt-raises-28-6-million-for-its-freelancer-platform/">Malt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/fiverr-business/">Fiverr</a> &#8212; or, for techie job matching specifically, the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/hackerrank-raises-30m-to-match-developers-with-jobs/">HackerRank</a> &#8212; plus, on the blue collar work side, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jobandtalent-tops-up-with-108m-for-its-workforce-as-a-service-platform/">Jobandtalent</a>. There&#8217;s also a growing number of startups focusing on helping freelancer teams specifically (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/collective-launches-a-saas-marketplace-for-freelancer-teams/">Collective</a>), so there&#8217;s a trend towards increasing specialism.</p>

<p>Worksome says it differentiates vs other players (legacy and startups) by combining services like tax compliance, background and ID checks and handling payroll and other admin with an AI powered platform that matches talent to projects.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not the only startup offering to do the back-office admin/payroll piece, either, nor the only one using AI to match skilled professionals to projects. But it claims it&#8217;s going further than rival &#8216;freelancer-as-a-service&#8217; platforms &#8212; saying it wants to &#8220;address the entire value chain&#8221; (aka: &#8220;everything from the hiring of freelance talent to onboarding and payment&#8221;).</p>
<p>Worksome has 550 active clients (i.e. employers in the market for freelancer talent) at this stage; and has accepted 30,000 freelancers into its marketplace so far.</p>
<p>Its current talent pool can take on work across 12 categories, and collectively offers more than 39,000 unique skills, per Petersen.</p>
<p>The biggest categories of freelancer talent on the platform are in Software and IT; Design and Creative Work; Finance and Management Consulting; plus &#8220;a long tail of niche skills&#8221; within engineering and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>While its largest customers are found in the creative industries, tech and IT, pharma and consumer goods. And its biggest markets are the U.K. and U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently trailing at +20,000 yearly placements,&#8221; says Petersen, adding: &#8220;The average yearly spend per client is $300,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worksome says the Series A funding will go on stoking growth by investing in marketing. It also plans to spend on product dev and on building out its team globally (it also has offices in London and New York).</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months the startup doubled the size of its team to 50 &#8212; and wants to do so again within 12 months so it can ramp up its enterprise client base in the U.S., U.K. and euro-zone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are a lot of freelancer platforms out there but a lot of these don’t appreciate that hiring is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to reducing the friction in working with freelancers,&#8221; argues Petersen. &#8220;Of the time that goes into hiring, managing and paying freelancers, 75% is currently spent on admin such as timesheet approvals, invoicing and compliance checks, leaving only a tiny fraction of time to actually finding talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worksome woos employers with a &#8220;one-click-hire&#8221; offer &#8212; touting its ability to find and hire freelancers &#8220;within seconds&#8221;.</p>
<p>If hiring a stranger in seconds sounds ill-advised, Worksome greases this external employment transaction by taking care of vetting the freelancers itself (including carrying out background checks; and using proprietary technology to asses freelancers&#8217; skills and suitability for its marketplace).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a two-step vetting process to ensure that we only allow the best freelance talent onto the Worksome platform,&#8221; Petersen tells TechCrunch. &#8220;For step one, an inhouse-built robot assesses our freelancer applicants. It analyses their skillset, social media profiles, profile completeness and hourly or daily rate, as well as their CV and work history, to decide whether each person is a good fit for Worksome.</p>
<p>&#8220;For step two, our team of talent specialists manually review and decline or approve the freelancers that pass through step one with a score of 85% or more. We have just approved our 30,000th freelancer and will be able to both scale and improve our vetting procedure as we grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>A majority of freelancer applicants fail Worksome&#8217;s proprietary vetting processes. This is clear because it says it has received 80,000 applicants so far &#8212; but only approved 30,000.</p>
<p>That raises interesting questions about how it&#8217;s making decisions on who is (and isn&#8217;t) an &#8216;appropriate fit&#8217; for its talent marketplace.</p>
<p>It says its candidate assessing &#8220;robot&#8221; looks at &#8220;whether freelancers can demonstrate the skillset, matching work history, industry experience and profile depth&#8221; deemed necessary to meet its quality criteria &#8212; giving the example that it would not accept a freelancer who says they can lead complex IT infrastructure projects if they do not have evidence of relevant work, education and skills.</p>
<p>On the AI freelancer-to-project matching side, Worksome says its technology aims to match<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> freelancers &#8220;who have the highest likelihood of completing a job with high satisfaction, based on their work-history, and performance and skills used on previous jobs&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This creates a feedback loop that&#8230; ensure that both clients and freelancers are matched with great people and great work,&#8221; is its circular suggestion when we ask about this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But it also emphasizes that its AI is not making hiring decisions on its own &#8212; and is only ever supporting humans in making a choice. (An interesting caveat since existing EU data protection rules, under Article 22 of the GDPR, provide for a right for individuals to object to automated decision making if significant decisions are being taken without meaningful human interaction.) </span></p>
<p>Using automation technologies (like AI) to make assessments that determine whether a person gains access to employment opportunities or doesn&#8217;t can certainly risk scaled discrimination. So the devil really is in the detail of how these algorithmic assessments are done.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why such uses of technology are set to face close regulatory scrutiny in the European Union &#8212; under incoming rules on &#8216;high risk&#8217; users of artificial intelligence &#8212; including the use of AI to match candidates to jobs.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">current legislative proposals</a> in this area specifically categorize &#8220;employment, workers management and access to self-employment&#8221; as a high risk use of AI, meaning applications like Worksome are likely to face some of the highest levels of regulatory supervision in the future.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FvJZwiQSXl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/embed/#?secret=FvJZwiQSXl" data-secret="FvJZwiQSXl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nonetheless, Worksome is bullish when we ask about the risks associated with using AI as an intermediary for employment opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We utilise fairly advanced matching algorithms to very effectively shortlist candidates for a role based solely on objective criteria, rinsed from human bias,&#8221; claims Petersen. &#8220;Our algorithms don&#8217;t take into account gender, ethnicity, name of educational institutions or other aspects that are usually connected to human bias.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;AI has immense potential in solving major industry challenges such as recruitment bias, low worker mobility and low access to digital skills among small to medium sized businesses. We are firm believers that technology should be utilized to remove human bias’ from any hiring process,&#8221; he goes on, adding: &#8220;Our tech was built to this very purpose from the beginning, and the new proposed legislation has the potential to serve as a validator for the hard work we’ve put into this.</p>
<p>&#8220;The obvious potential downside would be if new legislation would limit innovation by making it harder for startups to experiment with new technologies. As always, legislation like this will impact the Davids more than the Goliaths, even though the intentions may have been the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zooming back out to consider the pandemic-fuelled remote working boom, Worksome confirms that most of the projects for which it supplied freelancers last year were conducted remotely.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are currently seeing a slow shift back towards a combination of remote and onsite work and expect this combination to stick amongst most of our clients,&#8221; Petersen goes on. </span>&#8220;Whenever we are in uncertain economic times, we see a rise in the number of freelancers that companies are using. However, this trend is dwarfed by a much larger overall trend towards flexible work, which drives the real shift in the market. This shift has been accelerated by COVID-19 but has been underway for many years.</p>
<p>&#8220;While remote work has unlocked an enormous potential for accessing talent everywhere, 70% of the executives expect to use more temporary workers and contractors onsite than they did before COVID-19, according to a recent McKinsey study. This shows that businesses really value the flexibility in using an on-demand workforce of highly skilled specialists that can interact directly with their own teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether it&#8217;s expecting growth in freelancing to sustain even after we (hopefully) move beyond the pandemic &#8212; including if there&#8217;s a return to physical offices &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Petersen</span> suggests the underlying trend is for businesses to need increased flexibility, regardless of the exact blend of full-time and freelancer staff. So platforms like Worksome are confidently poised to keep growing.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you ask business leaders, 90% believe that shifting their talent model to a blend of full-time and freelancers can give a future competitive advantage (Source: BCG),&#8221; he says. &#8220;We see two major trends driving this sentiment; access to talent, and building an agile and flexible organization. This has become all the more true during the pandemic &#8212; a high degree of flexibility is allowing organisations to better navigate both the initial phase of the pandemic as well the current pick up of business activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the amount of change that we’re currently seeing in the world, and with businesses are constantly re-inventing themselves, the access to highly skilled and flexible talent is absolutely essential &#8212; now, in the next 5 years, and beyond.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX&#8217;s bourgeoning Starlink satellite-based broadband internet service just got a big boost from a significant new partner: Google Cloud. Thanks to a new partnership between the two, SpaceX will now be locating Starlink ground stations right within Google&#8217;s existing data centers, providing the Starlink network with direct access to ground-based network infrastructure to help facilitate network connections for customers who are on the edges of the footprint of existing network access.</p>
<p>Starlink&#8217;s entire aim is to provide reliable, broadband-quality connections to areas that have typically be hard or impossible to reach with legacy ground-based network infrastructure, including cellular networks. The tie-up with Google means that not only will business and public sector customers taking advantage of that new network reach have access to internet connections, but also to cloud-based infrastructure and applications, including AI and machine learning capabilities, analytics and more.</p>
<p>This should not only bolster Starlink&#8217;s reliability in terms of its consumer clients, but also provide key capabilities for serving enterprise customers — another key target demographic for the growing Starlink business, though much of the public focus thus far for Starlink&#8217;s roll-out has been on residential access across its expanding beta.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google and Starlink expect to begin to become available to enterprise customers soon — sometime pin the &#8220;second half of 2021&#8221; according to a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-cloud-and-spacexs-starlink-to-deliver-secure-global-connectivity-301290801.html"> press release</a> issued by the companies.</p>
<p>SpaceX has been very aggressive in building out the Starlink network in the past few months, launching 480 in just around there months. All that in-space infrastructure build out could well have been pre-amble to this collaboration and enterprise-focused service launch, in addition to helping SpaceX expand Starlink consumer service quality and availability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://liquiddeath.com/">Liquid Death</a>, a  four-year-old, L.A.-based canned mountain water startup that has steadily garnered market share and press coverage by promising, amusingly, to &#8220;murder your thirst,&#8221; just raised $15 million in Series C funding. The round brings the company&#8217;s total backing to date to $50 million.</p>
<p>The new financing &#8212; it follows a $23 million Series B round last fall &#8212; was seemingly about getting more strategic partners involved with the brand. Most meaningfully, Live Nation, the giant concert promoter, just became an equity investor and, as part of the deal, will only sell Liquid Death across its venues and festivals across the United States for a period of time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big deal. Though Liquid Death has done pretty well on its own in terms of its distribution &#8212; it says its water is now carried in 16,000 locations throughout the U.S. including bars, tattoo parlors, cafes, local liquor stores and &#8220;big box&#8221; stores like Whole Foods, Walmart and 7-Eleven &#8212; Live Nation connects the brand with a massive and captive audience. Specifically, Live Nation says that in a typical (not COVID) year, it brings in 100 million fans to events across more than 120 Live Nation-owned-and-operated venues and festivals across the U.S. (Because Liquid Death comes in recyclable aluminum cans versus far-less recyclable plastic bottles, the tie-up is a good look for Live Nation, too.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Liquid Death cofounder and CEO Mike Cessario, a former creative director and copywriter, declined yesterday to say how much Live Nation plans to charge for his products. But he did confirm that because the now 60-person company has &#8220;seen a ton of growth in retail and online in the past year,&#8221; it &#8220;didn’t need to raise a ton of cash right now.&#8221; In fact, he noted that as a &#8220;maturing&#8221; startup, Liquid Death now has &#8220;more access to favorable debt terms for working capital&#8221; should it go that route at some point.</p>
<p>Other investors in the new round include Tony Hawk, Wiz Khalifa, Steve Aoki, Hulu president Kelly Campbell and Dollar Shave Club founder Michael Dubin.</p>
<p>Cessario says the new funding won&#8217;t be used to expand internationally &#8212; not yet. Though Liquid Death is available in Canada and receives &#8220;tons of requests on social for international expansion,&#8221; the company is &#8220;focused on conquering the U.S. and Canada for the time being,&#8221; he tells us. As for branching out into new products, he says the team is &#8220;exploring some ideas like limited-release flavors for later this year.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era/">While a unicorn named Hopin</a> tends to dominate the virtual conferencing space, a new startup just raised millions of dollars by focusing on what it believes is an untapped niche in the same universe: academic conferences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.morressier.com/">Morressier</a>, a virtual conference and publishing platform specifically for the scientific community, announced today that it has raised $18 million in a Series A round led by Owl Ventures. Existing investors Cherry Ventures and Redalpine Venture Partners also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/samibln?lang=en">Sami Benchekroun</a> spent a lot of time at medical and scientific conferences while growing up thanks to his parents, who were both pursuing careers in medicine. Eventually, he began recognizing a pattern between all of the conferences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“People from around the world would come together and literally bring physical content like printed out posters [or] a presentation on USB keys, to these conferences, but after the three days, all that content is lost,” he said. “All the people [who] are working on cancer research and HIV research are coming to these conferences completely offline, sharing the ideas, and then everything is lost.”</p>
<p>The irony of it was distracting so, in 2014, he began trying to digitize the early exchange of knowledge at a conference.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pilSWYTrHi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/">Tired of &#8216;Zoom University&#8217;? So is edtech</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tired of &#8216;Zoom University&#8217;? So is edtech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/embed/#?secret=pilSWYTrHi" data-secret="pilSWYTrHi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Democratizing sounds cheesy but it&#8217;s really that,” he said. “People from Africa or Asia have no chance to really get access to these really high profile conferences that are mainly happening in the States or Europe, so by actually making everything digital, we can give back.”</p>
<p>The company began with a focus on content ephemerality, and nearly 7 years later, Morressier has built an end-to-end software layer that it hopes makes the academic conference experience as cutting edge as the research within it.</p>
<p>First, Morressier works with a society to create a landing page for an upcoming conference. Researchers can apply there to present their research at said conference. Morressier then aggregates all the research submissions and begins conducting a peer review process, with academics from the society validating the research and deciding if its relevant. The peer review process can often happen offline on excel sheets and word documents, so Morressier helps move the entire operations online. Once the peer review is done, the startup creates a content library to go along with a virtual or in-person conference where it can live indefinitely.</p>
<p>Finally, it gets to hosting the dissemination of that content to giving post-event analytics to event hosts to understand how research is being consumed.</p>
<p>“In order to make a compelling, end to end solution for every society out there, we added that live stream video component only in the beginning of 2020,” he said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2151587" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="904" height="634" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-1.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-1.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-1.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-1.png?resize=768,539 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-1.png?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-1.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p>Morressier has over 700,000 accounts on its service, and has held conferences with the American Chemical Society and the Society of Photo-optical Instrumentation Engineers among others. The company makes money by working directly with the societies and charging them a flat fee for using the platform conference organization and managing their peer review process. It also has a per document-based fee structure so as more research is uploaded to its database, Morressier makes more money.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151586" style="width: 849px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151586" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2151586" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="839" height="588" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-2.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-2.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-2.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-2.png?resize=768,539 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-2.png?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morressier-Screenshot-2.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151586" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Morressier</p></div></p>
<p>While growth is the obvious next step for the freshly-funded company, Morressier hasn’t been exactly sluggish in the meantime. The company had 6x growth in number of authors and 13x growth in number of documents on its platform, bringing on $4.5 million in sales in 2020. The early-stage startup began 2020 with a 28-person staff, and plans to grow to 100 people by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The founder, of course, accounts part of this growth to the pandemic, which took down some of the natural red tape that exists in education.</p>
<p>“I always try to play this down but quite frankly, in research and education, unfortunately things take longer [because of] government structures,” he said, of adoption speed. Indeed, the company took four years to raise its first check due to development. Now, three years after that, Morressier has closed another tranche of capital, thanks to a global understanding that virtual events are the future. Now, it&#8217;s just time for Morressier to prove its pandemic bump has paved a way for it to become a high-growth business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku today announced the launch of its own original programming, which will initially become available to viewers in the U.S., U.K., and Canada through the media platform&#8217;s free streaming hub, The Roku Channel, starting on May 20th. The debut lineup will include 30 titles, including both the scripted and reality programming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/roku-acquires-quibis-content/">Roku had acquired</a> from the short-form streaming service Quibi earlier this year, following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/quibi-is-dead/">shutdown</a>.</p>
<p>Quibi, of course, had launched at an inopportune time for a service that was designed for on-the-go viewing, when it arrived <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/05/quibi-launches-its-mobile-streaming-service-in-the-middle-of-the-quarantine-era/">in the middle of a pandemic</a>. But some <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/quibi-review/">have argued</a> that much of Quibi&#8217;s content <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/the-bites-are-quick-and-bad.html">wasn&#8217;t compelling</a> enough to pull in the number of subscribers to make the service a success. It will be interesting to see how well that same content now fares on Roku where it will no longer be &#8220;mobile-first,&#8221; but will more likely be streamed on a big-screen TV.</p>
<p>Among the better-known Quibi shows that will now be joining Roku are Chrissy Teigen&#8217;s &#8220;Chrissy&#8217;s Court,&#8221; Comedy Central&#8217;s &#8220;Reno 911!,&#8221; Kevin Hart&#8217;s &#8220;Die Hart&#8221; action series, <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/quibi-first-emmys-wins-1234774206/">Emmy-winning</a> &#8220;FreeRayshawn,&#8221; documentaries “Blackballed” and “Big Rad Wolf,” and reality show reboot &#8220;Punk&#8217;d.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These and others will become Roku&#8217;s first original programs, joining the over 40,000 other free movies and TV shows on <a href="https://therokuchannel.roku.com/">The Roku Channel.</a> This free streaming hub has been growing rapidly, in part due to the pandemic which forced people to stay at home, but also because of broader demand for free streaming content.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2020, The Roku Channel reached 63 million people in U.S. households, up more than 100% year-over-year. Streaming hours also doubled year-over-year &#8212; growth that&#8217;s twice as fast as the overall Roku platform itself, the company notes. In the first quarter of 2021, The Roku Channel grew to reach an estimated 70 million people.</p>
<p>The full list of Roku Originals includes available for the May 20th launch include: #FreeRayshawn,&#8221; &#8220;About Face,&#8221; &#8220;Bad Ideas with Adam Devine,&#8221; &#8220;Barkitechture,&#8221; &#8220;Big Rad Wolf,&#8221; &#8220;Blackballed,&#8221; &#8220;Centerpiece,&#8221; &#8220;Chrissy’s Court,&#8221; &#8220;Cup of Joe,&#8221; &#8220;Die Hart,&#8221; &#8220;Dishmantled,&#8221;Dummy,&#8221; &#8220;Fight Like a Girl,&#8221; &#8220;Flipped, &#8220;The Fugitive,&#8221; &#8220;Gayme Show, &#8220;Iron Sharpens Iron,&#8221; &#8220;Last Looks, &#8220;Let’s Roll with Tony Greenhand,&#8221; &#8220;Most Dangerous Game,&#8221; Murder House Flip,&#8221; &#8220;Murder Unboxed,&#8221; &#8220;Nightgowns,&#8221; &#8220;Prodigy,&#8221; &#8220;Punk’d,&#8221; &#8220;Reno 911!,&#8221; &#8220;Royalties,&#8221; &#8220;Shape of Pasta,&#8221; &#8220;Thanks a Million,&#8221; and &#8220;You Ain’t Got These.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roku will market the shows to viewers inside The Roku Channel, through an ad unit below the left-side navigation on the Roku home screen, and even through a coveted slot in the navigation menu itself.</p>
<p>In addition to the 30 new programs launching in May, more Roku Originals will roll out over the course of 2021. In total, Roku acquired more than 75 titles from Quibi, in a deal that reportedly valued the content at <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/roku-acquires-quibi-shows-free-streaming-1234881238/">&#8220;significantly less&#8221; than $100 million.</a> That means Roku users will eventually gain access to the Quibi shows that had been in the pipeline, but never got a chance to debut.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QuMIPIGN7Ug" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Quibi&#8217;s content made sense for Roku because it was designed for ad-supported viewing and not because of Quibi&#8217;s mobile gimmicks &#8212; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-08-quibi-mobile-video-turnstyle.html">like &#8220;turnstyle&#8221;</a> which made both portrait and landscape orientations look great, or horror shows that <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/steven-spielberg-quibi-jeffrey-katzenberg-horror-1203237395/">only stream after dark</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always unique &#8216;stunt-y&#8217; ways to bring shows to life, and we will explore those for shows that make sense,&#8221; noted Roku VP Sweta Patel, who leads the company&#8217;s Engagement and Growth Marketing. &#8220;But it&#8217;s going to have to make sense for how our viewers view &#8212; which is primarily on a [Roku] device,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>In other words, Roku viewers won&#8217;t care about all the Quibi tricks, just the content itself. However, the shows will stream through The Roku Channel mobile app, for the subset of viewers who do watch on the go.</p>
<p>Roku will also leverage the existing ad breaks Quibi had built into its content, it says. That means after every 8 to 10-minute long &#8220;episode,&#8221; a one-minute ad will play. That&#8217;s still a lighter ad load than traditional TV, Patel notes. The same ad-selling structure that The Roku Channel uses today will also apply to Originals, including the potential for brand sponsorships.</p>
<p>While Roku believes the Originals can help to bring in a younger, 18-34 year-old demographic, it&#8217;s not necessarily signaling a plan to increase investments in exclusive, original programming like this. Instead, Roku will watch to see how the new content performs and then use those insights to add more content to The Roku Channel&#8217;s library over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;This really It was a unique opportunity for us to get some incredible content for our growing base. We are always sourcing content and &#8212; whether that&#8217;s producing it or acquiring it &#8212; it has to make sense for our AVOD business model,&#8221; says Patel. However, now that Roku has its own programming to offer, it will make sense for the company to roll out The Roku Channel to its global markets outside the U.S., U.K., and Canada.</p>
<p>The company wouldn&#8217;t comment on those plans.</p>
<p>Alongside the launch of Roku Originals, Roku also announced a partnership with Laugh Out Loud, the comedy brand founded by Kevin Hart. It will now bring the linear channel LOL! Network to The Roku Channel, joining the now over 190 live, linear channels featured on the service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://blockset.com/">Blockset</a>, the blockchain infrastructure platform for enterprises by <a href="https://brd.com/">BRD</a>, announced early access to its Wallet-as-a-Service today. The white-label solution gives clients, like financial institutions, the ability to launch wallets that have the same features as BRD’s own mobile cryptocurrency wallet, which now has about 7 million users with over $20 billion assets under protection.</p>
<p>Blockset’s clients include some of the largest ATM networks and Japanese investment bank (and BRD investor) SBI Holdings, CoinFlip, Welthee, CoinSwitch, Coinsquare and Wyre. BRD’s other investors include Ripple and it has raised $56 million in funding so far.</p>
<p>One of Blockset’s selling points is access to real-time data about several kinds of cryptocurrencies. This not only allows users to see how their assets are performing, but also enables institutions to perform compliance tasks, fraud detection, anti-money laundering and other important services. Blockset also claims that its multi-chain API has up to 99.999% uptime.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform currently supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Tezos, Hedera, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, and will add more chains based on customer demand.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cryptocurrency wallet BRD reaches 6 million users, driven by growth in Latin America and India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cryptocurrency-wallet-brd-reaches-6-million-users-driven-by-growth-in-latin-america-and-india/embed/#?secret=kaLQ30imAL" data-secret="kaLQ30imAL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blockset already offered a white-label solution called WalletKit, before launching its current Wallet-as-a-Service with more features. BRD co-founder and CEO Adam Traidman compares its Wallet-as-a-Service to Google Maps, because both aggregate large amounts of constantly-changing data and can connect to other apps, while remaining user-friendly.</p>
<p>“The concept is really a result of learnings from working with our customers, tier one financial institutions, who need a couple things,” Traidman told TechCrunch. “Generally they want to custody crypto on behalf of their customers. For example, if you’re running an ETF, like a Bitcoin ETF, or if you’re offering customers buying and selling, you need a way to store the crypto, and you need a way to access the blockchain.”</p>
<p>“The Wallet-as-a-Service is the nomenclature we use to talk about the challenge that customers are facing, whereby blockchain is really complex,” he added. “There are three V’s that I talk about: variety, a lot of velocity because there’s a lot of transactions per second, and volume because there’s a lot of total aggregate data.”</p>
<p>Blockset also enables clients to add features like trading crypto or fiat or lending Bitcoin or Stablecoins to take advantage of high interest rates. Enterprises can develop and integrate their own solutions or work with Blockset’s partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s hard to recall a consumer electronics category that matured quite as quickly as the fully wireless earbuds. Things went from a handful of plucky startups to virtually every hardware manufacturer over the course of a year or two. When Amazon entered the category, it did so in an already arguably overcrowded field.</p>
<p>The first question you have to answer when you’re late to the party is what you’re bringing to the table. Ultimately, the original Echo Buds didn’t have a particularly compelling answer to the question in a world where you can pick up a pair of Ankers for $40. There were a smattering of other issues, as well, that ultimately ended in a pretty lukewarm write-up from me.</p>

<p>A little over a year later, the Buds are back. And to its credit, Amazon has both addressed some of the concerns with the original and offered a pretty solid upgrade over the original models. What’s more, the company added some features that other companies have saved for Pro models, while keeping the price at a reasonable $129.</p>
<p>I’ve been using the Echo Buds as my go-to headphones for several days now and can say, overall, I’ve enjoyed the experience. The product inhabits a kind of middle ground &#8212; I would still recommend a number of other products in the “Price Is No Object” category, and the Buds are not cheap enough to qualify for the low end.</p>

<p>The new Echo Buds occupy a similar price point as Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus &#8212; and in a number of ways compare favorably. Most notable is the inclusion of active noise canceling, which has thus far mostly been the domain of more premium models. Amazon’s latest don’t offer the best ANC &#8212; nor really the best of anything &#8212; but they do form a well-rounded offering for the price point.</p>
<p>As Amazon has experienced with Alexa, the company’s at a disadvantage when competing directly with the likes of Apple, Google and Samsung, which can build devices that tie directly into their handsets. Amazon’s attempts at creating its own handsets have thus far failed, so the company has been forced to find another way to differentiate itself.</p>
<p>That has largely meant Alexa &#8212; and frankly, at the end of the day, the Echo Buds are really another way for the company to serve up its smart assistant. Built-in Alexa is mostly a selling point if you’re already invested in that ecosystem. I tend to prefer Assistant &#8212; especially given all of the other Google software offerings it integrates with, but for many intents and purposes, the personal assistants are often interchangeable.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149814" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149814" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2149814" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9127.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9127.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9127.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9127.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9127.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9127.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9127.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9127.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9127.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149814" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The new Buds are a fair bit smaller than their predecessors &#8212; but they’re not small exactly. They’re still a bit on the bulky side, and while they stayed put when using them indoors, I found they came loose a few times on a five-mile walk I did over the weekend. In that case, you’ll probably want to opt for the silicone cover, which sports small wings to better keep them in place. Probably the best option as well, if you’re planning to exercise with them in.</p>
<p>A weird design oversight here, however: I found the charging case doesn’t close all the way when the covers are on. The case doesn’t fully snap shut, and I learned the hard way last night that charging can be a bit tricky (in fact, I just got a “battery below 10%” warning in the right ear, while the left if currently in the high 90s. If you do end up using the wings, it’s best to pull them off after your workout &#8212; they’re also a bit on the snug side for too much extended use.</p>

<p>As Matt recently noted, the case is strongly…inspired by Apple. The differences are more pronounced when the two are next to one another, but the similarity is pretty undeniable:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149818" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149818" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2149818" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9135.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9135.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9135.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9135.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9135.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9135.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9135.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9135.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9135.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149818" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The case is longer and a little cheaper to the touch. Though the different shape does have the added bonus of being able to sit upright. For this reason, the charging port (USB-C) is on the rear of the case, rather than the bottom. There’s also a wireless charging case option, though that’s going to run you an added $20 &#8212; but probably worth it if you’ve got a Qi charger handy. There&#8217;s an Amazon arrow logo on the case (the company can’t help itself with the branding), but it’s subtle and located on the bottom. You’ll also find a light arrow on one of the earbuds.</p>
<p>The pair Amazon sent are “glacier white,” which is really more of a light gray. Again, it’s that much more pronounced when compared to the AirPods. Perhaps it’s a subtle way to further distinguish the design from Apple’s? Who knows.</p>
<p>Pairing is fairly easy. It’s not quite like using AirPods on an iPhone or Galaxy Buds on a Samsung, but it’s a couple of quick taps in the Alexa app. The company made the app the focal point of the Echo Buds for good reason. It serves as ground zero for everything you do on all of your Alexa-enabled devices. At a certain point, however, it may be time to consider breaking the app up a bit. It’s a bit of a double-edged sword &#8212; nobody needs more apps, but the thing is extremely noisy at this point.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149816" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149816" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2149816" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9129.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9129.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9129.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9129.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9129.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9129.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9129.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9129.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9129.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149816" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The upshot is that when the Buds are opened and paired, it surfaces the devices to the front. Tapping in lets you toggle between ANC and Pass Through modes (to my annoyance, I found that it would often default to the mode I wasn’t using when I put the Buds on for the first time in a while), turn the mic on and off and start Workout mode, which is opt-in. For people looking for more consistent workout tracking, an always-on wearable like a band or watch is a better choice.</p>
<p>The sound is a nice upgrade over the previous models. As with noise canceling, you can get better audio on more expensive systems, but for where this sits on the price spectrum, you’re getting solid sound for music, podcasting or calls. By default, it leans too heavily on bass for my preferences, but a few taps will take you to some equalizer sliders, where you can futz around with that.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth connection is pretty solid. I found I was able to walk around my apartment while leaving the iPhone in one place &#8212; a test failed by a number of the earbuds I’ve tested. I did, however, encounter some sync issues from time to time between the left and right bud when I was walking outside for long distances, creating an echoing effect. They can also send a sharp bit of feedback when held next to one another, owing to the fact that they don’t always instantly switch off when pulled out of the ear.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149815" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149815" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2149815" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9128.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9128.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9128.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9128.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9128.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9128.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9128.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9128.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9128.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149815" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The stated battery is up to five hours on the Buds (6.5 with ANC off), and 15 total hours with the case. Compare that to the listed 4.5 and five hours on the AirPods and AirPods Pro and 24 hours with case. I certainly found I was able to get through a full day of use by dipping into the case once or twice.</p>
<p>The new Echo Buds present on upgrade over their predecessors on just about every level, making for a solid pair of mid-price earbuds. They don’t really address the &#8220;why&#8221; that their predecessor failed to. For Amazon, it’s about getting Alexa on more products. For consumers, the answer isn’t quite so easy.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing brings the total raised for the St. Paul, Minnesota-based startup to $25 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large group of investors participated in the round, including Concrete Rose VC, Avanta Ventures, Kapor Capital, Samsung Next, Massive, Backstage Capital, Awesome People Ventures, Draft Ventures, Matchstick Ventures, M25, Silicon Valley Bank and Uncommon VC, among others. A number of angels also put money in the round. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarence Bethea (pictured below) founded Upsie after realizing the significant markup that retailers were placing on warranties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His goal was to focus not on the retailer, but rather the end user and making the process more transparent, more affordable and simpler. For example, Upsie claims that it saves its customers anywhere from 50% to 90% compared to competitor warranty plans. Most other companies in the space, such as SquareTrade, offer warranties at the point of sale via retailers.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151362" style="width: 293px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151362" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2151362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PD5_1834-e1620852150189.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="283" height="424" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Upsie</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve walked into a Best Buy or a Target, and when you&#8217;re checking out somebody at the register is offering you a warranty. But what most customers don&#8217;t know is that you&#8217;re paying as much as 900% more for that warranty than you should,” Bethea said. “There&#8217;s no transparency at the register and you never get to ask what&#8217;s covered and what&#8217;s not covered, or what should you do if you need to make a claim.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like many other companies, Upsie saw a bump in business last year thanks to the COVID-pandemic and resulting increase in consumer electronics sales (17%, according to the NPD Group Retail Tracking Service). In particular, there was a </span><a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/12/25/shortages-laptops-pc-high-demand-last-till-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spike in demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for laptops, desktops and tablets for distance learning and remote work. As a result, Upsie’s revenue surged by 2.5x over the past 12 months, although Bethea declined to reveal hard revenue figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With people working from home, devices were no longer a luxury but a necessity,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than at the point of sale, Upsie gives consumers an opportunity to purchase a warranty for a product via its website or mobile app after the transaction has taken place. The company offers protection for thousands of devices &#8212; from smartphones to appliances to gaming consoles to lawn and garden tools &#8212; or about 60% of the warranty market, according to Bethea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers have up to 120 days to purchase smartphone protection, 11 months to purchase appliance, TV and fitness equipment protection and up to 60 days for other consumer electronics. All warranty information, including a copy of the product receipt, is stored and accessible on demand. Upsie says it also aims to offer same-day repairs on many devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process, according to Bethea, is straightforward. Consumers need only upload an image of their receipt and provide purchase price and serial/IMEA numbers. When they need to file a claim, it’s a matter of pressing a button. And to make the process even easier, it will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">give consumers the ability to say, take their items directly to the Apple store for repair, and then get reimbursed afterwards by Upsie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want more people to be able to protect what they buy with their hard-earned money,” Bethea said. “Removing the worry around paying out of pocket to repair, say, your kid’s laptop is huge for families who have had to go with remote learning when the system doesn’t make this easy for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upsie plans to use its new capital to increase customer awareness and continue building out its warranty product offerings and verticals, as well as to double its current headcount of 15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to continue to grow our presence online through digital channels such as Facebook and Google, for one thing,” Bethea told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puneet Agarwal, partner at True Ventures, says his firm doubled down on its investment in Upsie after witnessing its solid growth over the years. (True Ventures led the startup’s $5 million seed round in April of 2019.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True Ventures was initially attracted to the sheer size of the warranty industry (estimated at $100 billion globally) and “how broken it was from the consumer experience perspective.” The firm also viewed Bethea as a “very special entrepreneur” who “exudes authenticity,” which must be refreshing to VCs who get inundated with pitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We love to invest in old, staid industries where companies can disrupt from a business model and product perspective,” Agarwal said. “Upsie has done that in a big way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to describe Bethea’s move to go direct to consumer in the warranty space as “bold.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Upsie is the only one doing that, and it’s the biggest swing to take in this type of industry,” Agarwal said. “We believe he’s cracked the code and that’s why we doubled down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bethea’s background is not the same as a “typical” startup founder, which also was viewed as an advantage by True Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He came from the streets of Atlanta, Georgia, and had to overcome so much in his life,” Agarwal told TechCrunch. “Clarence is the type of person that when we started True, we wanted to fund. We admire his perseverance and grit to come to this point.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Internet of Things just got bigger. Four years after Ford Motor Company introduced an integration with Amazon’s suite of smart home devices, the automaker is beefing up its in-vehicle software offerings with built-in Alexa voice assistant and a wireless software update ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s over-the-air software updates, which it has branded Power-Up, will have the capability of updating &#8220;virtually all&#8221; of the computer modules in new Ford vehicles, not just the ones that focus on infotainment, the company said in a statement Thursday. Ford estimates that Power-Up will be able to update more than 110 computer modules on higher-end models. The automaker aims to manufacture 33 million vehicles equipped with this service and Alexa by 2028.</p>
<div class="c-message_kit__gutter">

<div class="p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper--first">
<div class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">
<div class="p-rich_text_section">Ford is clearly hoping shareholders and customers see the integration as a sign that the company can be a tech-forward automaker. One company executive in a media briefing Tuesday even referred to Ford as a “technology company.&#8221;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>“We believe that data is the new oil, since it&#8217;s essential to our electric future and enables us to have an always-on relationship with our customer,” Alex Purdy, head of Ford’s business operations for enterprise connectivity, said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That &#8216;data is the new oil&#8217; line is nothing new. Former Intel CEO Brian Krzanich made that very <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/krzanich-the-future-of-automated-driving/#gs.0oa5q8">declaration back in 2016</a>. New or not, data is seen as an increasingly valuable resource to automakers.</p>
<p>Purdy said the new software may reduce the need for repair trips and free up dealers to focus on more profitable services, like hardware repairs and maintenance. Many of the software updates will require little to no action from the driver, and they can schedule those updates that require a system reboot.</p>
<p>Using the built-in Alexa assistant, drivers will be able to use voice control to start or stop their engine, lock or unlock doors, defrost their windows, make a call or play music. Customers who have Alexa smart home devices will be able to connect the two systems so that they can, for example, turn on the lights in their home from their driveways. Ford aims to build Alexa software into 700,000 vehicles across the U.S. and Canada this year, though the company did not discuss rollouts in other countries.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of the customer survey – the new software ecosystem will give Ford data on how vehicle owners use their cars. “We can double down on the features people love, get rid of the ones people don’t,” Purdy said. Ford is giving all drivers complimentary access to Alexa for three years, suggesting that the automaker will likely receive mountains of very valuable information on the behavior of its customers from its use.</p>
<p>Ford and Amazon will work together on new features and commercial services for the next six years. It will be delivered via a Power-Up software update this fall beginning with F-150, Mach-E, Bronco, Edge, and Super Duty customers. The company will “work its way through” the remaining models until it’s available in Ford’s entire fleet of new vehicles, though Purdy acknowledged it will take many years to reach that goal.</p>
<p>The Power-Up system will also deliver BlueCruise, Ford’s Level 2 hands-free highway driving technology, though customers must purchase this upgrade. Drivers will be able to activate the technology on prequalified sections of divided highway. In the future Ford said it hopes to add more highway sections, lane change assist, and predictive speed assist that will adjust speed for road curves and other driving situations, similar to Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot.</p>
<p>Ford in February also announced a separate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/">six year partnership with Google</a> to bring Android apps and services to drivers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TiMi Studios, one of the world&#8217;s most lucrative game makers and is part of Tencent&#8217;s gargantuan digital entertainment empire, said Thursday that it has struck a strategic partnership with Xbox.</p>
<p>The succinct <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/l1tw3BcKm2VTsUkKkulzxw">announcement</a> did not mention whether the tie-up is for content development or Xbox&#8217;s console distribution in China but said more details will be unveiled for the &#8220;deep partnership&#8221; by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Established in 2008 within Tencent, TiMi is behind popular mobile titles such as Honor of Kings and Call of Duty Mobile. In 2020, Honor of Kings alone generated close to $2.5 billion in player spending, according to market research company <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pubg-mobile-tops-billion-dollar-mobile-games-2020">SensorTower</a>. In all, TiMi pocketed $10 billion in revenue last year, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-exclusive-idUSKBN2BP0FG">report</a> from Reuters citing people with knowledge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership could help TiMi build a name globally by converting its mobile titles into console plays for Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox. TiMi has been trying to strengthen its own brand and distinguish itself from other Tencent gaming clusters, such as its internal rival LightSpeed &amp; Quantum Studio, which is known for PUBG Mobile.</p>
<p>TiMi operates a branch in Los Angeles and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/19/china-roundup-wechat-paywall-tencent-us-game-studio/">said</a> in January 2020 that it planned to &#8220;triple&#8221; its headcount in North America, adding that building high-budget, high-quality AAA mobile games was core to its global strategy. There are clues in a <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/353527484">recruitment notice</a> posted recently by a TiMi employee: The unit is hiring developers for an upcoming AAA title that is benchmarked against the Oasis, a massively multiplayer online game that evolves into a virtual society in the fiction and film Ready Player One. Oasis is played via a virtual reality headset.</p>
<p>Xbox&#8217;s latest Series X and Series S are to debut in China <a href="https://weibo.com/5203472552/KfhIEANCR?from=page_1006065203472552_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime">imminently</a>, though the launch doesn&#8217;t appear to be linked to the Tencent deal. Sony&#8217;s Playstation 5 just hit the shelves in China in late April. Nintendo Switch distributes in China through a partnership with Tencent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/nintendo-switch-china-tencent/">sealed in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Chinese console players often resort to grey markets for foreign editions because the list of Chinese titles approved by local authorities is tiny compared to what&#8217;s available outside the country. But these grey markets, both online and offline, are susceptible to ongoing clampdown. Most recently in March, product listings by multiple top sellers of imported console games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/console-game-china-pulled-ecommerce/">vanished from Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao marketplace</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX private spaceflight ambitions got a big boost in 2018 when Japanese entrepreneur and billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced he&#8217;d be taking a trip aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon on a round-trip flight passing the Moon. Maezawa is still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spacexs-first-paying-moon-flight-customer-wants-to-give-away-eight-seats-aboard-his-spaceship/">on track to make that trip by 2023 according to current schedules</a>, but he&#8217;s so eager to get to space that he just announced he&#8217;ll make a visit to the International Space Station as a private astronaut this December.</p>
<p>Maezawa will go as a client of Space Adventures, on a Russian Soyuz rocket set to take off from Kazakhstan on December 8, and he&#8217;ll be accompanied by his production assistant Yozo Hirano. Space Adventures is the same company behind prior Soyuz commercial spaceflight missions, including the trip made by Anousheh Ansari in 2006 and Guy Laliberté in 2009, among others. Laliberté&#8217;s trip was the most recent, with space tourism at the station officially on hold since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 since Soyuz has been the only means to access the ISS. Now that SpaceX is flying regular astronaut shuttle missions, however, tourist trips are back on.</p>

<p>The trip that Maezawa plans to take will take place over the course of 12 days, and he&#8217;ll be doing three months of training prior to the mission in Russia to get ready for the experience. In addition to being the first private astronaut visit to the ISS in over 10 years, this is also the first time that two private astronauts will fly on board the same Soyuz at the same time. Maezawa and Hirano will also be the first Japanese citizens to make the journey as private individuals.</p>
<p>It may seem like overkill to get to visit space twice in a lifetime as a private astronaut, but Maezawa says he&#8217;s driven by a curiosity of &#8220;what&#8217;s life like in space?&#8221; which will of course be useful information to have on the planned Moon mission, which will spend three days getting there, make a loop around our natural satellite, and then spend three days coming back. He&#8217;s also planning to post the experience to YouTube, which is why Hirano is accompanying him to document.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has been fined just over €100 million (~$123M) by Italy&#8217;s antitrust watchdog for abuse of a dominant market position.</p>
<p>The case relates to Android Auto, a modified version of Google&#8217;s mobile OS intended for in-car use, and specifically to how Google restricted access to the platform to an electric car charging app, called JuicePass, made by energy company Enel X Italia.</p>
<p>Android Auto lets motorists directly access a selection of relevant apps (like maps and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/google-opens-android-automotive-os-to-spotify-other-media-app-developers/">music streaming services</a>) via a dash-mounted screen. But Enel X Italia&#8217;s JuicePass app was not one of the third party apps Google granted access to.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app is accessible via the smartphone version of the Android platform &#8212; but of course a driver shouldn&#8217;t be reaching for their phone when at the wheel. So barring access through Android Auto puts a significant blocker on relevant usage.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s market restriction of JuicePass has drawn the attention &#8212; and now the ire &#8212; of Italy&#8217;s competition watchdog.</p>
<p>The AGCM said today that Google has violated Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union &#8212; and has ordered it to make the JuicePass available via the platform.</p>
<p>It also says Google must to provide the same interoperability with Android Auto to other third party app developers.</p>
<p>The authority points out that the Google Maps app, which offers some basic services for electric vehicle charging (such as finding and getting directions to charging points), is available via Android Auto &#8212; and could, in future, incorporate directly competitive features like payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the Authority&#8217;s findings, Google did not allow Enel X Italia to develop a version of its JuicePass app compatible with Android Auto, a specific Android feature that allows apps to be used while the user is driving in compliance with safety, as well as distraction reduction, requirements,&#8221; the AGCM writes in a <a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2021/5/A529">press release</a> announcing the sanction [translated to English using Google Translate]. &#8220;JuicePass enables a wide range of services for recharging electric vehicles, ranging from finding a charging station to managing the charging session and reserving a place at the station; this latter function guarantees the actual availability of the infrastructure once the user reaches it.</p>
<p>&#8220;By refusing Enel X Italia interoperability with Android Auto, Google has unfairly limited the possibilities for end users to avail themselves of the Enel X Italia app when driving and recharging an electric vehicle. Google has consequently favored its own Google Maps app, which runs on Android Auto and enables functional services for electric vehicle charging, currently limited to finding and getting directions to reach charging points, but which in the future could include other functionalities such as reservation and payment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google denies any wrongdoing and says it disagrees with the order. But it did not confirm whether or not it intends to appeal.</p>
<p>The tech giant claims the restrictions it places on apps&#8217; access to Android Auto are necessary to ensure drivers are not distracted. It also told us that it has been opening up the platform to more apps over time &#8212; with &#8220;thousands&#8221; now compatible.</p>
<p>It added that its intention is to keep expanding availability.</p>
<p>Google did not comment on why Enel X Italia&#8217;s app for recharging electric vehicles was not among the &#8220;thousands&#8221; it has already granted access to, however.</p>
<p>Per the AGCM, Enel X Italia&#8217;s app has been excluded from Android Auto for more than two years.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Google&#8217;s statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The number one priority for Android Auto is to ensure apps can be used safely while driving. That&#8217;s why we have strict guidelines on the types of apps which are currently supported and these are based on driver-distraction tests and regulatory and industry standards. Thousands of applications are already compatible with Android Auto, and our goal is to allow even more developers to make their apps available over time. For example, we have<span class="m_6987432655142616341apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/01/expanding-reach-of-your-android-auto.html__;!!FMox2LFwyA!6fsrPNDbZJJw2gEAwD5drOQWTvklgqAMBjuPxPgw88as7l9m8umHKiJUSYwkp36M-BE$" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/01/expanding-reach-of-your-android-auto.html__;!!FMox2LFwyA!6fsrPNDbZJJw2gEAwD5drOQWTvklgqAMBjuPxPgw88as7l9m8umHKiJUSYwkp36M-BE$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620980647999000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5KPJq0jI4xF2VwPqj5T6oUncy5g">introduced templates</a><span class="m_6987432655142616341apple-converted-space"> </span>for navigation, charging, and parking apps, open for any developer to use. We disagree with the Authority&#8217;s decision and we will review our options.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Google has a dominant position in the market via the Android smartphone platform, with a marketshare in Italy of around three-quarters according to the competition watchdog.</p>
<p>Under European Union law, a finding of market dominance in one market puts a responsibility on a company not to restrict competition in any other markets where it operates &#8212; and the EU already found Google to be a dominant company in general Internet search in every market in the European Economic Area back in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_17_1785">2017</a>.</p>
<p>The AGCM said it&#8217;s concerned about the impact of Google&#8217;s restrictions on app access to Android Auto on the growth of the electric mobility market.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were to continue, [it] could permanently jeopardise Enel X Italia&#8217;s chances of building a solid user base at a time of significant growth in sales of electric vehicles,&#8221; it wrote, adding that Google&#8217;s action in excluding the JuicePass app meant it did not appear in the list of applications used by users &#8212; thereby reducing consumer choice and creating a barrier to innovation.</p>
<p>The authority suggests Google&#8217;s conduct could influence the development of electric mobility during a crucial phase &#8212; as recharging infrastructures for electric cars are being built out and can help fuel growth and demand for recharging services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consequently, possible negative effects could occur to the diffusion of electric vehicles, to the use of &#8216;clean&#8217; energy and to the transition towards a more environmentally sustainable mobility,&#8221; it warned, linking anti-competitive behavior to negative consequences for the environment.</p>
<p>The AGCM added that it will monitor Google&#8217;s compliance with its order to ensure it effectively and correctly implements the obligations to provide third party app developers with access to Android Auto.</p>
<p>The authority&#8217;s action could be a taster of what&#8217;s coming down the pipe for gatekeeper players like Google in Europe under the incoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA).</p>
<p>The flagship legislative proposal is intended to supplement ex post competition law enforcement with ex ante rules on how dominant platforms which intermediate others&#8217; market access can behave &#8212; including by imposing up front requirements that they support interoperability.</p>
<p>The idea with the DMA is to supplement the slow and painstaking work needed to bring competition investigations to fruition with proactive measures slapped on tech giants to prevent certain types of known market abuse in the first place. Although the regulation is likely years out from being adopted and applied across the EU.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile competition probes of big tech continue.</p>
<p>Italy&#8217;s AGCM opened one into Google&#8217;s ad display business <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/googles-display-advertising-business-is-under-antitrust-probe-in-italy/">last October</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Google has already faced a number of EU antitrust decision in recent years &#8212; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">$5BN penalty over how it operates Android</a>. Although search rivals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/googles-eu-android-choice-screen-isnt-working-say-search-rivals-calling-for-a-joint-process-to-devise-a-fair-remedy/">continue to complain</a> that the remedy Google devised for that 2018 decision still does not sum to fair competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nano Technologies, a startup that lets workers in Vietnam access their earned wages immediately through <a href="https://www.vuiapp.vn/">an app called VUI</a>, has raised $3 million in seed funding. The oversubscribed round was led by returning investors Golden Gate Ventures and Venturra Discovery, and included participation from FEBE Ventures, Openspace Ventures and Goodwater Capital.</p>
<p>Nano recently <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/nano-technologies">took part in Y Combinator’s accelerator program</a>. Golden Gate Ventures and Venturra Discovery both participated in its pre-seed funding. The startup was founded at the beginning of 2020 by Dzung Dang, formerly a general manager at Uber and chief executive officer of ZaloPay, and Thang Nguyen, who previously served as chief technology officer at Focal Labs and SeeSpace.</p>
<p>VUI launched six months ago, and now serves more than 20,000 employees from companies like GS25, LanChi Mart and Annam Gourmet. Nano Technologies claims that about 50% to 60% of employees sign up for VUI as soon as their employers offer it, and use the service about three times every month to withdraw their earned wages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Nano’s earned wage access features can be used by employers of all sizes, in all sectors, to offer flexible pay to their employees, but its focus is currently on retail, food and beverage, and manufacturing, especially for textiles, garments and shoes. The startup says companies in these sectors have seen recruitment costs increase, while worker retention drops. This is in part because many people are opting for gig economy jobs, like ride-sharing, where their earning are automatically deposited into their digital wallets or bank accounts.</p>
<p>Nano usually fronts wage advances, and then is paid back back by employers on their paydays through payroll deduction. Employers who have higher liquidity can also front wages through their own balance sheets. VUI is usually offered by employers as a benefit, and they can opt to cover fees, have their workers pay fees or use a co-pay model.</p>

<p>Nano is among a crop of companies across the world that offer earned wage access, meant to help companies retain workers by letting them withdraw earnings whenever they want, instead of waiting until payday. In Southeast Asia, this also includes GajiGesa in Indonesia. In the rest of the world, other companies that offer similar services include Square, London-based Wagestream and Gusto). Nano’s plan is to continue focusing on Vietnam, and develop new products for employers, including tools for managing staff and engagement.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Chi Phan, the CEO of LanChi Mart, a subsidiary of Central Retail with about 2,000 employees, said “On-demand salary via VUI is an obvious idea and practical HR initiative that LanChi team is pleased to roll out to our employees as a new voluntary benefit. VUI provides a much-needed financial lifeline from LanChi to our employees, keeping the employee morale up during the COVID-19 pandemic and reducing attrition rites post-Tet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Only four months after securing Series B fundraising of $310 million, Chinese autonomous driving company WeRide says it has achieved its Series C funding round that brings its post-money valuation to $3 billion.</p>
<p>This is first time the company has disclosed its value. The company did not share how much it has raised this round, only noting that it&#8217;s in the &#8220;hundreds of millions,&#8221; according to a statement released by the company. WeRide intends to use this funding round to invest in R&amp;D and commercialization as it works towards the next-generation of Level 4 driving, a term that means a vehicle can drive without human intervention in some environments and conditions. The company is also using the funds to prepare to commercialize its technology.</p>
<p>WeRide has scored a slew of large investments over the past year, including its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/weride-200-million-funding/">$200 million strategic round</a> in December from Chinese bus maker Yutong. The speed and scale of these investments signals that the company is burning through money and hungry for more, and that investors are banking on China&#8217;s tech. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/">Rival Momenta has also received large sums this year</a>, exceeding its $1 billion in valuation with recent investments of $500 million and total funding of more than $700 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;WeRide Master Platform (WMP), our core autonomous driving technology solution has helped to accelerate the company’s development,&#8221; Tony Han, founder and CEO of WeRide, said in a statement. &#8220;This drives the successful operation of our Robotaxi service in Guangzhou since 2019 and the introduction of the WeRide driverless Mini Robobus, a completely new product category to the autonomous industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>WeRide&#8217;s robotaxi pilot in Guangzhou began in 2019, but it began conducting test drives in the city&#8217;s Central Business District in January. Not long after, the company&#8217;s driverless Mini Robobus began road testing in Guangzhou and Nanjing. WeRide became the first autonomous driving company in China to secure an official license for online car-hailing operations in February, and in April, the California DMV issued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-weride-scores-permit-to-test-driverless-cars-in-san-jose/">WeRide a permit to test its driverless vehicles</a> on public roads in San Jose, California.</p>
<p>Many investors participated in this most recent round, including <span style="font-weight: 400;">IDG Capital, Homeric Capital, CoStone Capital, Cypress Star, Sky9 Capital and K3 Ventures, as well as existing investors CMC Capital Partners, Qiming Venture Partners and Alpview Capital.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO and self-dubbed Technoking is back-peddling on the company&#8217;s stance about bitcoin and has suspended purchases of its electric vehicles with the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The change of stance, which was delivered via tweet, comes just weeks after Tesla CFO and dubbed &#8220;Master of Coin&#8221; Zach Kirkhorn said the company believes in the longevity of bitcoin, despite its volatility. The tweet from Musk sent the price of bitcoin down more than 4% (and falling). The price of bitcoin is down more than 7% for the day, although some of that decrease occurred prior to Musk&#8217;s tweet:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment.</p>
<p>Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy. We are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use &lt;1% of Bitcoin&#8217;s energy/transaction.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tesla invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin this quarter and then trimmed its position by 10%, Kirkhorn said during the company&#8217;s quarterly earnings call in April. That sale made a $101 million &#8220;positive impact&#8221; to the company&#8217;s profitability in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Kirkhorn said Tesla turned to bitcoin as a place to store cash and still access it immediately, all while providing a better return on investment than more traditional central bank-backed safe havens. Of course, the higher yields provided by the volatile digital currency comes with higher risk.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re getting whiplash from this announcement, you&#8217;re not alone. Tesla originally announced in March that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/elon-musk-declares-you-can-now-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin-in-the-u-s/">accept bitcoin as a form of payment</a> in the United States. But Elon Musk, the Technoking of Tesla, is known for drastically affecting the crypto market with just a mere tweeting of his thumbs. Every time the man tweets an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/dogecoin-price-surges-after-tweets-from-elon-musk-and-mark-cuban.html">image of a Shiba Inu</a>, the joke coin called Dogecoin sores in the stocks.</p>
<p>In anticipation for Musk&#8217;s appearance on Saturday Night Live, many anticipated that the coin would reach $1, but when the &#8220;Dogefather&#8221; admitted (as a joke) to the currency <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/dogecoin-price-plummets-as-elon-musk-hosts-saturday-night-live-.html">being a hustle</a>, the price of the coin crashed 30%.</p>
<h2>Energy sucker</h2>
<p>When it first became public that Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, investors, analysts and money managers at some of the country&#8217;s largest banks noted that it presented risks for the company. Others noted it could damage its reputation.</p>

<p>Bitcoin functions using what is known as a “Proof of Work” consensus, which means the network relies on mining to continue operating. The bulk of bitcoin mining is conducted in Russia and China. Until the energy grid decarbonizes, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/teslas-bitcoin-investment-could-be-bad-for-the-companys-climate-reputation-and-its-bottom-line/">TechCrunch noted back in February,</a> mining bitcoin will remain a dirty business, though plenty of mining operations today do use renewable energies, in part. One investor told TechCrunch that the cost per transaction from an energy intensity standpoint has only gotten more intense.</p>
<p>Musk hinted that other cryptocurrencies are on the table. Those will likely be ones that use “Proof of Stake” consensus mechanisms, which networks like Ethereum have committed to transition to due to their energy efficiencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vitalik Buterin donated cryptocurrencies worth $1.5 billion to several non-profit organizations, including $1 billion to a COVID-19 relief fund in India, on Wednesday in one of the largest-ever individual philanthropy efforts.</p>
<p>Or at least that was the worth of the cryptocurrencies &#8212; many of which are dog-themed &#8212; when he made the donation.</p>
<p>Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb65bcbb85c1633b0ab4e4886c3cd8eeaeb63edbb39cacdb9223fdcf4454fd2c7">transferred</a> 500 ETH and over 50 trillion SHIB (Shiba Inu), a meme coin, worth around $1.14 billion at the time of transaction, to the <a href="https://cryptorelief.in">India COVID-Crypto Relief Fund</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The transaction prompted a panic among some investors, contributing to <a href="https://nomics.com/assets/shib-shiba-inu">over 35% drop in SHIB’s price</a> on Wednesday &#8212; and its value <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/">continues to fluctuate</a>.</p>
<p>SHIB, named after Shiba Inu, and Dogelon Mars (ELON), another meme currency Buterin donated on Wednesday, are alternative cryptocurrencies that have exploded in popularity in recent months. SHIB is a joke on Dogecoin, which itself was created as a joke.</p>
<p>SHIB has successfully courted retail investors in China and other markets following recent surges in the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. It has managed to garner billions (USD) worth of investment in recent days before Wednesday&#8217;s crash.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151557" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151557" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2151557 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shib-price.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="494" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shib-price.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shib-price.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shib-price.jpg?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shib-price.jpg?resize=768,379 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shib-price.jpg?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shib-price.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151557" class="wp-caption-text">The fluctuation in SHIB&#8217;s price over the last one month. (CoinMarketCap)</p></div></p>
<p>The causes Buterin is supporting are no joke, and the volatility of the meme coins could result in less liquid money for the relief fund.</p>
<p>Buterin’s offloading of several dog-themed meme coins &#8212; which were sent to him without his consent in the first place &#8212; comes at a time when India is grappling with a surge in the coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of crypto organization Polygon and who put together the Indian relief fund, late Wednesday <a href="https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1392562768692252673">assured</a> people that he won’t do anything that hurts “any community specially the retail community involved with SHIB.”</p>
<p>The relief fund, which has so far used the prior donation funds to send oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies to Indian hospitals, said it plans to do a &#8220;thoughtful liquidation&#8221; to meet its goals. &#8220;We have decided to convert the donation slowly over a period of time,&#8221; the official Twitter page of the fund <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoRelief_/status/1392559057764962304">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Buterin, who became the youngest crypto billionaire at the age of 27 earlier this month, also <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdab7634a04e3b7afb0d5a9faf9db59a05a04372234c0c960342102a4859aca16">transferred</a> Ethereum and Dogelon Mars (ELON) worth $336 million to Methuselah Foundation, a nonprofit that supports efforts in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapies; and over 13,000 ETH to Givewell, a nonprofit organization that works to curate the best charities around the world. Buterin also donated to Gitcoin Community, MIRI and Charter Cities Institute.</p>

<p>India has been reporting over 350,000 daily infections and over 3,500 fatalities for the last two weeks. The second wave of the coronavirus has overwhelmed the South Asian nation’s healthcare system, leaving countless people to scramble for hospital beds, medical oxygen and other supplies.</p>
<p>A number of entrepreneurs including Balaji Srinivasan have donated to the India Crypto Relief Fund, which <a href="https://cryptorelief.in/transparency">maintains a log of all the donations</a>. Buterin himself had donated about $600,000 in ether and maker tokens to the fund last month.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>By now everyone is familiar with the tech world’s talent crunch: Developers are scarce and expensive, while data scientists are maybe even scarcer and expensiver. Some folks I’ve spoken to think that rising acceptance of remote work may help reduce the supply-demand imbalance. Hell, every early-stage startup I’ve spoken to in weeks is remote-first. Many were born during COVID, but they all love the ability to hire anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But if a more distributed workforce is not enough to lower the pain that many companies feel when it comes to attracting and then <em>retaining</em> technical talent, good news could be coming. The sibling product philosophies of no-code and low-code are not only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">attracting lots of venture attention</a>, public companies that dabble with either are posting interesting results.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Perhaps the solution to needing lots more code is no code at all? &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p>Today’s TechCrunch Top 3 come from the three phases of startup life: Early stage, when startups are still getting their product and market in order. Late stage, when they are prepping for an eventual exit. And the exit stage, when a former startup is looking to spread its wings and fly the private markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/brazils-divibank-raises-millions-to-become-the-clearbanc-of-latam/">The anti-venture movement is global</a>:</strong> Today <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann</a></strong> reported that <strong>Divibank</strong>, a Brazilian startup offering revenue-based financing to other startups, has raised $3.6 million in a seed round led by Better Tomorrow Ventures (BTV). TechCrunch thinks it could build something akin to the <strong>Clearbanc</strong> of Latin America.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-fashion-portal-lyst-raises-85m-in-a-pre-ipo-round-reportedly-at-a-500m-valuation/"><strong>London’s Lyst looks to list</strong></a><strong>:</strong> When you raise a pre-IPO round, you’d best be heading toward the public markets. With fashion e-commerce app <strong>Lyst</strong> saying that its new $85 million funding round is pre-IPO money, well, we have big expectations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">Bird hopes to take flight</a>:</strong> Bird is going public via a SPAC. TechCrunch has the big news <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-to-go-public-via-spac-at-an-implied-value-of-2-3b/">here</a></strong>, and a more dorky financial analysis <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">here</a></strong>. I helped write the latter. The short version is that a business-model shakeup is helping the scooter unicorn lose less money over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>Scootin’ into startup mode, TechCrunch covered a huge number of funding rounds in the last 24 hours, so what follows is a sampling of the most interesting. Enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/argentinas-pomelo-raises-9m-to-build-a-new-payments-infrastructure-for-latam-fintechs/">Pomelo raises $9M to build a payments infrastructure for LatAm fintechs</a>:</strong> Building fintech infrastructure is a huge global task, so it’s not a surprise to see companies at work on the problem raising money. In this case, Pomelo is $9 million richer to tackle what might be the most interesting fintech market in the world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/collective-a-back-office-for-the-self-employed-raises-20m-from-ashton-kutchers-vc/">Collective, a back-office platform for the self-employed, raises $20M from Ashton Kutcher’s VC</a>:</strong> Going indie is not easy, despite what the Substack hype might have you believe. So, Collective is betting that it can make bank off of helping folks run their own microcompany. Both the company and the investment are a wager on the creator economy.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/stampli-raises-50-million-in-series-c-to-help-companies-intelligently-manage-invoices/"><strong>Stampli raises $50 million in Series C to help companies intelligently manage</strong> <strong>invoices</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The Stampli round stood out because it was more capital in a single investment than the startup had raised during all of its previous life &#8212; by around 50%. So, something is going on at the corporate-invoice optimization software shop that has investor attention.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/planck-the-insurance-data-analytics-platform-raises-20m-growth-round/"><strong>Planck, the insurance data analytics platform, raises $20M growth round</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Two of the three Planck co-founders are bald, so I had no choice but to include my follicle-deficient brethren in today’s newsletter. Jokes aside, Planck collects data that it sells to commercial insurance companies. And now it has fresh capital from 3L Capital, Greenfield Partners, Team8, Viola Fintech, Arbor Ventures and Eight Roads to help it grow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>For unicorns, how much does the route to going public really matter?</h2>
<p>Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm recently hosted Yext CFO Steve Cakebread and Latch CFO Garth Mitchell on an episode of TechCrunch&#8217;s Equity podcast.</p>
<p>In their discussion, &#8220;The morality and efficacy of going public earlier,&#8221; the group discussed the myriad paths startups are taking to go public and assessed the pros and cons of each method, and, importantly, the potential impacts on employees and business operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think when money’s chasing money, you don’t want to be the last guy holding the money. You want to be the chase,&#8221; said Cakebread.</p>
<p>Since Latch is currently going public via a SPAC and Yext followed a traditional IPO route a few years ago, the discussion is heavily weighted toward experience, not opinion.</p>

<p><em>(Extra Crunch is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/"> <em>You can sign up here</em></a><em>.)</em></p>
<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Turning to tech’s largest companies today, we have three things for you to chew on:</p>
<p>First, Waymo is losing key talent in a very public fashion. <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">Kirsten</a> reports that “Waymo’s chief financial officer Ger Dwyer and its head of automotive partnerships and corporate development Adam Frost,” both long-time execs, are “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/waymos-cfo-and-head-of-automotive-partnerships-are-leaving-the-autonomous-vehicle-company/?tpcc=ECTW2020">leaving this month</a>.” The exits come after the company’s former CEO also departed.</p>
<p>I guess we’ll have to drive ourselves for a bit longer.</p>
<p>Next up is a story that came out yesterday, but we missed in the newsletter. But after burning up the TechCrunch analytics all day, I decided to make sure that you saw it. With the simply excellent headline <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">Prime today, gone tomorrow: Chinese products get pulled from Amazon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ritacyliao">Rita</a> writes that several Chinese retailers have evaporated from the online megastore. “In total, the suspended accounts contribute over a billion dollars in gross merchandise value (GMV) to Amazon,” she reported.</p>
<p>Changes afoot at Amazon? We’ll have to see, but the news is driving mega-attention from, we presume, confused shoppers.</p>
<p>Finally, looping back to no-code for a hot second, Salesforce is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/salesforce-is-bringing-drag-and-drop-interactive-components-to-its-low-code-toolkit/">only adding to its own efforts</a>. It’s everywhere!</p>
