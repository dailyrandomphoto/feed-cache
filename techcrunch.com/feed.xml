										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dream of understanding, exploring and even settling other worlds is alive and well at</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Sessions: Space 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On December 14 – 15, some of this planet’s foremost experts will be in the house to talk about lunar samples and why they’re critical to determining whether humans can live on other planets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunar samples, in the form of rocks, regolith or dust, offer greater insight to the origins not only of the moon itself, but also of our planet and the inner solar system.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, rock samples collected by China’s Chang’e-5 (the first expedition to do so in more than 40 years) proved that lava flowed on the moon’s surface a relatively mere 2 billion years ago — when multicellular life began to evolve on Earth.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223739" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These substances have also been researched in the creation of lunar energy-storage regolith bricks which could enable lunar construction and potential eventual habitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extraterrestrial resource collection isn’t just for government agencies anymore. Instead, it will require collaboration among government, private and public entities. NASA hopes to return humans to the moon by 2024 and, as part of that effort, it’s accepting proposals from commercial companies to collect samples of rocks and substances from any lunar location. Compared to samples collected in the 1970s, today’s advanced analytical capabilities will provide deeper understanding and exciting possibilities</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/"> TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>, we’ll have a panel discussion with lunar expedition experts from iSpace, Masten Space Systems and Lockheed Martin Space to discuss recent lunar sample research and explore what the future of lunar sampling looks like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just one example of the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#56c4ffdf-04f9-4404-a33a-522de0e81ba5"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">stellar speakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we have on tap at TC Sessions: Space. We’re talking folks like Natalya Bailey, Accion Systems co-founder and CTO, who will talk about advancements in</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/learn-why-in-space-propulsion-systems-are-essential-for-a-sustainable-space-economy-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in-space satellite propulsion systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Plus, Chad Anderson (Space Capital), Jonathan Fentzke (Techstars), Tess Hatch (Bessemer Venture Partners) and Lisa Rich (Xplore) will have a lot to share about investing in space startups from the earliest stages and beyond.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[We can't help but read Rent the Runway's IPO pricing as not only good news for unicorns, but also for tech-enabled unicorns.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s early in the Wednesday trading session, meaning that we&#8217;re waiting on the first trades of Rent the Runway stock on the public markets.</p>
<p>But what we do know is that the company <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/rent-runway-ipo-goes-bigger-114955222.html">priced at $21 per share</a>, giving it a valuation of $1.33 billion using a simple share count, and around $1.47 billion on a fully-diluted basis. For a company last valued at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rent-the-runway-series-f--57b9ddfa">around $1 billion in 2019</a>, those figures may not sound too impressive. But I think that they are.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s earlier coverage of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">Rent the Runway IPO filing</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">pricing run</a> was, respectively, skeptical and pessimistic. And yet public investors not only had enough interest for the IPO to proceed, but also for the clothing rental company to price at the top of its range.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about why that&#8217;s bullish for unicorns more broadly.</p>
<h2>Tech-enabled versus Tech</h2>
<p>A software company is a tech company. And an e-commerce platform is a technology company. But a firm that merely employs e-commerce channels to sell its goods is not. It&#8217;s, instead, tech-<em>enabled</em>.</p>
<p>The difference is no small nuance. Tech companies can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">find themselves valued at 40x or 50x revenues</a> in today&#8217;s markets. Concerns that are merely tech-enabled, however, tend to trade at lower multiples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.gringo.com.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gringo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian startup that has built an app aimed at supporting drivers in a variety of ways, has raised $8 million in a new round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek led the financing, which also included participation from GFC and OneVC. Kaszek also led the company’s seed round in 2020. The latest investment brings its total raised to $10 million since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based Gringo’s self-proclaimed mission is to be “the Brazilian driver&#8217;s best friend.” What that means is that it has built an app &#8212; launched in early 2020 &#8212; to help drivers monitor and perform services related to their documents and vehicles. For example, users can use the app to monitor, manage and pay for documentation (such as their driver licenses and vehicle registration). They can also pay taxes and fines through the app, which today has about 2.5 million users (2 million of whom are in São Paulo).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224461" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started with documentation because we realized that it is the main pain point of Brazilian drivers,” said Rodrigo Colmonero, founder and CEO of Gringo. “Everything starts and ends with documentation. When a driver needs to buy or sell, or finance a vehicle or obtain contract insurance, for example, it is very painful for them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, he said, the startup’s goal is to become a “super app” for drivers. Today, the app offers real-time alerts on fines, annual taxes, points and license expiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of our competitors are focusing on selling products, while we are building a customer-focused company and as a consequence we are solving their pain points while monetizing,” Colmonero told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gringo must be doing something right. It has seen the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> number of drivers on its platform grow “10x” year over year, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colmonero. Its GMV grew 100x year over year, while revenue grew 150x year over year. (Of course we don’t know the base, but the multiples are impressive).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2224473" style="width: 219px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224473" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2224473 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?w=157" alt="" width="209" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg 1090w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=157,300 157w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=768,1470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=355,680 355w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=803,1536 803w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=1070,2048 1070w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224473" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gringo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to building out its app’s services, Gringo aims to also build community around the issues it addresses via WhatsApp and social networks. It shares content around auto-related topics such as notices of new legislation or anything “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">drivers need to know to have a practical routine in traffic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift to more digital everything has helped Gringo’s efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The driver and vehicle licenses became digital in Brazil,” noted Colmonero. “Drivers are becoming more digital and it is no longer necessary for them to solve their problems with brokers and physical locations.”</span></p>
<p>Gringo offers its services for free and is monetizing by charging<span class="s1"> a service fee for the issuance or renewal of digital vehicle registration. It also offers credit for the payment of fines and taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital mainly to expand into</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new services for drivers, toward hiring and to continue to expand within Brazil, and eventually into Latin America. In fact, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company is re-investing all of its profits in “growth into Brazil and later in Latin America,” according to Colmonero. Today, it has 100 employees, 5x more than a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek partner Santiago Fossatti said he was impressed by Gringo’s aim to help drivers manage “everything around car-related documentation,” including driver licenses, fines and annual registration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is uniquely positioned to become a trusted hub from which drivers manage every step of their journey as car owners,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p>He was also drawn to the fact that the founding team had solid experience in growing other companies previously.<span class="s1"> Colmonero co-founded an equity fund called NEO Future Fund and invested in several public companies. </span><span class="s1">Juliano Dutra was a partner at ifood and co-founded Rapiddo, a logistic startup sold to Ifood. And </span><span class="s1">Caique Carvalho co-founded tattoo marketplace My ink.   </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[While dozens of vertical farms have sprouted in the past decade, few have attracted the amount of attention that New Jersey-based Bowery Farming enjoys. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Farming is the most fundamental activity of civilization. Efficient, reliable and abundant food allows the great majority of people today to eschew cultivating plants and raising livestock and instead pursue every other activity that makes up an economy. It’s also an enterprise that has seen extensive innovation over the millennia, and farming has never been more efficient than it is today.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s no longer enough.</p>
<p>The skyrocketing global human population — expected to hit 10 billion sometime this century — coupled with the accelerating effects of the climate crisis are leading to a decisive crossroads: How can the world continually increase food production while also mitigating its overall environmental impact?</p>
<p>A growing chorus of researchers, activists and entrepreneurs believe that at least part of the solution is vertical, indoor farming. Once derided for tasteless vegetables and wild-eyed (read: unprofitable) schemes, vertical farms are increasingly compelling thanks to progressive technological improvements and more efficient designs.</p>
<p>While dozens of vertical farms have sprouted in the past decade, few have attracted the amount of attention that Manhattan-headquartered <b>Bowery Farming</b> enjoys. Founded in 2014, the company has raised nearly $500 million in venture capital — most recently at a $2.3 billion valuation — and is expanding from two experimental grow facilities to multiple scaled-up production hubs as it serves its leafy greens to customers at more than 850 grocery stores. The question the company asks is simple: Can it bring the newest and most innovative technologies to bear on civilization’s oldest and most optimized industry?</p>
<p>Answering that question in this TC-1 is <b>Brian Heater</b>, TechCrunch’s hardware editor. Heater has been writing about hardware and robotics for more than a decade and also hosts our annual TechCrunch Sessions: Robotics conference. As we’ll see shortly, hardware and robotics are key to making the Bowery model work at scale, profitably. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Bowery Farming had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Heater has no financial ties to Bowery Farming.</i></p>
<p>The Bowery Farming TC-1 comprises four main articles measuring 11,100 words and 44 minutes of reading time. Here are the topics we’ll be uprooting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">Bowery Farming is forcing us all to look up at the future of vertical agriculture</a>&#8221; (3,500 words/14 minutes) — explores the evolution of vertical farming, it&#8217;s expansion in Japan and how Bowery Farming was started to bring indoor farming to the masses in the United States.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food is the very nourishment of life, but it’s also becoming increasingly challenging to grow at scale. A combination of explosive and unsustainable population growth, human-made climate change and depleted sources of clean water is contributing to overcultivation across the world.</p>
<p>For its many advocates, vertical farming is a critical piece to solving that puzzle, even as skeptics cite its intensive power demands as a major hurdle toward achieving the long-term positive climate impact it promises.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Existential crises of climate change and substantial food shortages have fueled interest in alternative forms of food production, while innovations in technology have created the potential for delivering those ideas at scale.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The pursuit of sustainability was a key catalyst in the formation of <a href="https://boweryfarming.com">Bowery Farming</a> — and, for that matter, the development of vertical farming as a whole. Global climate disasters have spurred companies and governments to increasingly explore large-scale solutions, and that’s why increasingly bullish investors are pumping money into the space — the company raised a $300 million round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/indoor-farming-company-bowery-raises-300m/">this May</a>.</p>
<p>Companies like Bowery have captured the imagination of the public for the role they might eventually play in helping reshape the 10,000-year-old practice of agriculture. It’s big talk, but it’s unsurprising in a world inexorably drawn to the notion that the solution to righting the wrongs of decades of harmful technologies can be found in technology itself. It’s a hopeful thought.</p>
<p>In the first part of this TC-1, I will look at the origins of Bowery Farming as well as the vertical farming movement as a whole. I’ll also discuss how Japan’s 2011 tragic earthquake catalyzed interest in the model and also explore how these new approaches to agriculture could usher in critical changes on an Earth with rapidly changing climates.</p>
<h2>We’re not in Kansas anymore</h2>
<p>The best way to understand a farm is to visit it, so I set up a tour to see what Bowery is building. I intend to arrive early, making some vague plans to walk to a nearby coffee shop, set up camp with caffeine and Wi-Fi, and prep for the day. As we approached the destination, however, that plan is quickly scrapped.</p>
<p>As the crow flies, Bowery Farming’s Kearny, New Jersey R&amp;D center is roughly five miles from Manhattan, but the surrounding neighborhood contains none of the trappings of bustling city life. Just industrial warehouses and little else as far as the eye can see.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["The first thing you notice is just the smell," chief science officer of Bowery Farming Henry Sztul says excitedly. "It's got that smell, right?"]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;The first thing you notice is just the smell,&#8221; chief science officer of Bowery Farming Henry Sztul says excitedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s got that smell, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>There’s a kind of visceral sense memory that hits you as you enter Farm Zero, a Proustian moment that overtakes the senses after years of living in a major city. It smells like greenhouses and grow rooms: fresh, alive and a dramatic contrast from the world immediately outside the building here in Kearny, New Jersey.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Years of indoor farming breakthroughs have made it possible for leafy greens to be grown at larger and larger scales — and, eventually, at a profit.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As I walk through Bowery Farming’s three active vertical farm and research facilities, my mind is teeming with questions about climate change and the potential of sustainable vertical farming. Yet, when it comes right down to it, it’s the taste and, yes, that smell that will drive the company’s — and the industry’s — success.</p>
<p>We’re decked out in clean room coveralls and hairnets. Watches and jewelry are off, the soles of our shoes still damp from standing in sanitizing solution. “In here, we have a fully enclosed environment,” Sztul continues. “We control temperature, humidity, CO2, water flow, nutrients, light levels. When I say light levels I mean the color of the light spectrum, the intensity of the light, the photo period, the day/night cycles.”</p>
<p>Unlike traditional software products, inventing produce is an entirely different endeavor. Perturbations in the inputs of Bowery’s vertical farm can lead to radically different flavor profiles in the leafy greens it distributes.</p>
<p>In the second part of this TC-1, I’ll look at how the company experiments in Farm Zero and what it dubs Farm X, how it develops new produce lines as it expands outside of leafy greens and how it transforms farm work for the urban 21st century while scaling up at its newer Farm One production facility.</p>
<h2>Tilling concrete</h2>
<p>The smell is the first sense to hit, but it’s the visual that really grabs you. Right in front of me are the grow systems that give vertical farming its name. It’s a kind of scaffolding setup with row atop row of leafy greens nestled in long trays and lit by bright LEDs. PVC piping snakes up and down, delivering the water that cycles through the systems — saving 15 to 20 million gallons of water per farm over traditional growing each year, according to the company’s estimates.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223088" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223088" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2223088 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg" alt="" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223088" class="wp-caption-text">Grow trays bask in light at Bowery Farming. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>This entire room is part of one closed irrigation system, circulating the nutrient-rich liquid to all the plants. Bowery says that even the water lost from natural plant perspiration can be captured with its HVAC system and recirculated back into the loop.</p>
<p>The glowing lights are a stark contrast to the gloomy industrial park outside, but even indoors, the visual is somewhat difficult to reconcile. The little pods of bright green vegetation exist in almost a laboratory setting, a strange juxtaposition of the natural and the synthetic that speaks to the heart of what vertical farming attempts to do — effectively hacking 10,000 years of agricultural knowledge.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For Bowery Farming, no technology is too small to optimize, and no data is too insignificant to track. Combined together, the startup hopes to orchestrate the future of farming and build a moat.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Agriculture has a 10,000-year history, and it’s predominantly a history of technology. Developments from the plow and wheel to enclosures and the modern mechanical miracles of gas-powered tractors and sorters have consistently improved crop yields, allowing humanity to expand from tens of millions of people to a global population projected to top 10 billion this century.</p>
<p>When it comes to the next stages of that long course of innovation, vertical farming would seem to have all the right properties. Precise controls backed by data analysis can calibrate food quality, leading to further improvements in yields while reducing raw inputs like water. That’s critical at a time when the world’s climate is increasingly at a breaking point.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The energy efficiency of lamps or production systems can be improved, but not infinitely, so indoor crops will always be heavily dependent on electricity and other industrial support. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For Bowery Farming, no technology is too small to optimize, and no data is too insignificant to track. Combined together, the startup hopes to orchestrate the future of farming — and build a competitive moat in the process. To ultimately create a company of value, it needs to not just build differentiated technology but also build a brand with consumers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-competition/">which we’ll turn to in the final part of this TC-1</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">parts one</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">two</a>, I covered the history of vertical farming, Bowery’s origins and how it develops produce. In this third part, I’ll look at the company’s core tech infrastructure, explore how developments of just one component, LEDs, made vertical farming viable and investigate just how much climate savings Bowery can be expected to wring out as it grows in scale.</p>
<h2>Lettux</h2>
<p>We can’t understand Bowery without describing BoweryOS. It’s the secret sauce that ties its automated systems, sensors and data collection together into a central nervous system. The company is tight-lipped about specifics but notes that it unlocks the ability to rapidly replicate its growth system at new farms.</p>
<p>“You could be the greatest farmer in the world in Salinas Valley, and I pick you up and bring you to New Jersey and that knowledge doesn&#8217;t transfer,” says Irving Fain, founder and CEO of Bowery Farming. “You put the Bowery operating system inside of that farm, and that farm now has the knowledge and understanding of every crop we&#8217;ve ever grown and every process we&#8217;ve ever run immediately available to it. In essence, what we&#8217;re really doing is building a distributed network of farms, whereby every new farm that enters that network benefits from the collective knowledge of the network that came before it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The size, the scope, the potential impact — the mind reels. Vertical farming may be a nascent space, but it is growing rapidly, and the greenfield is being taken quickly.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are several plastic clamshells sitting in front of me on a conference room table — around 20 or so boxes, labels facing forward, with a plate of turnips and a tub of those R&amp;D strawberries <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">we saw back in part two</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a nice photo opportunity, backdropped by Bowery Farming’s impressive grow system and a good visual representation of the product’s life cycle. More importantly, it’s a reminder of how most people will ultimately interact with the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223125" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223125" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2223125 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg" alt="" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223125" class="wp-caption-text">Bowery&#8217;s clamshells in the foreground and grow system in the background. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>My position at TechCrunch afforded me the grand tour, of course — the whole Willy Wonka, clean suit coveralls and taste-testing experience. In the company’s FAQ, the answer to “<a href="https://boweryfarming.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045552574-Can-I-visit-a-Bowery-farm-">Can I visit a Bowery Farm?</a>” is a simple, “At this time, we do not allow visitors to our farms.”</p>
<p>It’s understandable, of course. While the farms themselves are a great visual, there are too many resources and health precautions required to worry about giving tours to outsiders. On my own visit, my guides were extremely cautious about what could and couldn’t be photographed — trade secrets and all.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Given the novelty of vertical farming, and that some stigma still exists against the taste of indoor-grown produce, Bowery’s branding strategy largely revolves around blending in.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Press coverage, like this feature you’re currently reading, is part of the outreach. The company opens itself to journalists and the occasional video camera knowing that putting its farms on visual display is a powerful way to unlock the fascinating story of vertical farming.</p>
<p>Ahead of my own visit, I watched a broad range of videos featuring vertical farms from all over the world. My playlist featured everything from Nordic Harvest’s newly opened 75,000-square-foot facility in Copenhagen, to the modular urban farming setups Brooklyn-based Square Roots creates inside a shipping container you can purchase for just $80,000.</p>
<p>The size, the scope, the potential impact — the mind reels. Vertical farming may be a nascent space, but it is growing rapidly, and the greenfield is being taken quickly.</p>
<p>Most consumers will never interact with a Bowery farm beyond reading an article or watching a clip online, and there’s nothing particularly wrong about that. The truth is that urbanites will almost never set foot in the place where our food is grown — that there’s a connection at all is a kind of win in and of itself.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, building that individual connection with consumers will determine the fate of Bowery in the ultra-competitive produce market. Branding is a high priority for the firm, particularly as it battles competitors like AeroFarms, which recently announced that it will go public via SPAC before failing to secure investor approval.</p>
<p>In this fourth and final part of the TC-1, I’ll look at how the company is trying to invent brand loyalty in the produce section, figure out its packaging, design its supply chain and, finally, seek a path to profitability against a broad competitive landscape.</p>
<h2>Lettuce have a taste</h2>
<p>Bowery sees opportunity in the boutique clamshells that have begun propagating across produce shelves in recent years — first in upscale markets and then more mainstream grocery stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram announced on Wednesday that all users now have access to its Link Sticker feature in Instagram Stories. The expansion comes as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/instagram-is-ditching-swipe-up-links-in-favor-of-stickers/">recently ditched</a> the “swipe-up” link in Instagram Stories in favor of the new Link Stickers. Both the previous “swipe-up” link and new Link Stickers have been historically limited to businesses and high-profile creators.</p>
<p>The company says link sharing is helpful in many ways to accounts of all sizes and types, which is why it&#8217;s expanding access to enable everyone to share what they want in their Stories. In the past, link sharing has been largely used by creators and businesses to direct their viewers to a website to learn more about a product, read an article, sign up for a service, and more.</p>
<p>“We made this decision based on feedback we heard from the community about how impactful it would be for creators and businesses of all sizes to benefit from link sharing to grow in the same way larger accounts do,” Instagram said in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224847" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You can access the feature by selecting the sticker tool from the top navigation bar when you capture or upload content to your Story. After selecting the “Link Sticker,” you can add your chosen link and then tap “Done.” From there, you can place the sticker anywhere on your Story and tap on it to see the other color variations.</p>
<p>Instagram previously noted that the decision to expand Link Sticker access to everyone had to be made carefully, as it could impact the app’s integrity and safety. For instance, if Link Stickers were to be adopted by bad actors, they could be used to spread misinformation or post spam. It&#8217;s worth noting that accounts that share misinformation and hate speech will be blocked from using Link Stickers.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s expansion is the first step in broadening access to link sharing on Instagram for all users. It&#8217;s worth noting that Instagram still doesn&#8217;t allow direct linking in posts, which is why &#8220;link in bio&#8221; platforms like Linktree, Shorby, and Linkin.bio have become popular over the past few years. However, with this latest expansion, users now have an additional way to share links through their accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In September, <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-poised-overtake-apple-podcasts-this-year">analysts at eMarketer</a> predicted Spotify was poised to overtake Apple Podcasts in U.S. listenership sometime this year. Today, Spotify announced for the first time it may have succeeded on that front. During the company&#8217;s Q3 2021 earnings call, the company said that according to Edison Research and its own internal sources, it &#8220;recently became&#8221; the No. 1 podcast platform U.S. listeners use the most. Given the U.S. is the largest global podcast market, the milestone is significant and speaks to the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/spotify-continues-its-podcast-shopping-spree/">sizable investment</a> Spotify has made in podcasts over the past few years.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t break down its podcast listener numbers specifically, however. Instead, it shared its monthly active users overall grew 19% year-over-year to reach 381 million in the quarter, up from 365 million last year. Premium subscribers also grew 19% to reach 172 million, up from 165 million last year.</p>
<p>According to eMarketer&#8217;s recent data, Spotify and Apple Podcasts have been neck and neck in terms of U.S. podcast listeners. Its <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-poised-overtake-apple-podcasts-this-year">analysts said</a> last month Spotify would reach 28.2 million monthly U.S. podcast listeners by year-end, topping Apple Podcast&#8217;s 28.0 million by a thin margin. (The firm <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-podcast-listener-numbers-will-surpass-apples-this-year">had predicted these same numbers</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">earlier</a> in 2021, as well.) It forecast Spotify&#8217;s number of U.S. podcast listeners would continue to grow to reach 43.6 million by 2025.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224825" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Reached for comment, Edison Research confirmed the podcast milestone is based on usage, not downloads.</p>
<p>The data is from the firm&#8217;s second-quarter Podcast Consumer Tracker, its subscription service that covers the podcast industry. Respondents were asked &#8220;what platform or service do you use <em>most</em> to listen to podcasts?&#8221; and Spotify came in at No. 1, at 24% of weekly podcast consumers. This put it ahead of Apple Podcasts for iOS (21%) and YouTube (18%). Edison Research says its sample is in excess of 8,000 weekly podcast consumers.</p>
<p>But without hard numbers from Spotify or Apple, it&#8217;s hard to specifically confirm how close the race still is at this time.</p>
<p>Spotify attributed its podcast listenership growth not only to its content slate, but also to its product improvements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We started our journey three years ago in podcasting with a catalog of about 185,000 podcasts. And we were really nowhere, compared to the largest players in the industry. Today, we have 3.2 million podcasts on the platform, a growth rate of over 1500%,&#8221; noted Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. In the prior quarter, Spotify had 2.9 million podcasts.</p>
<p>&#8220;So why did we succeed this fast? Well, obviously our content investments have helped a great deal,&#8221; said Ek. &#8220;But it&#8217;s also another proof point of the impact our platform improvements and product innovations are having on our business overall. And the velocity of shipping matters &#8212; from the recent launch of interactivity and enhancements like polls and Q&amp;A, to the release of enhanced listening features and new original programming around the world. We fought hard to gain new listeners. And our success is not attributable to just one thing, but literally hundreds, if not thousands, of improvements that we&#8217;re working on in parallel for the benefit of creators, users, and advertisers alike,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ek said that the company&#8217;s culture of innovation, which leads to an improved user experience, brings more creators to the platform to share their content. This is in turn, brings more advertisers.</p>
<p>&#8220;And all of these things coupled together &#8212; users, creators, and advertisers &#8212; unlock the power of our flywheel,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>However, Spotify&#8217;s milestone in U.S. podcast listenership (which Spotify confirmed to TechCrunch had not yet been shared until now), comes shortly after a revamp of Apple&#8217;s Podcasts app which was criticized by creators and end users. Podcasters <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/report-details-podcaster-complaints-surrounding-new-apple-podcasts-subscriptions-platform/">complained</a> of bugs, errors, and a confusing interface. Apple <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/apple-podcasts-bug-fixed.html">issued a fix</a> for one critical bug related to automatic downloads in an update this summer, but the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/07/apple-podcasts-reliability-problem-is-turning-into-an-image-problem/">damage to its reputation</a> may take longer to recover.</p>
<p>During the quarter, the percentage of monthly active users remained strong, Spotify said, and was up 20% year-over-year on a per-user basis. Podcasts&#8217; share overall consumption hours also reached an all-time high in the quarter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, podcasts are helping Spotify boost its bottom line. Spotify noted it had its biggest-ever quarter for ads in Q3, partially fueled by its growing podcast slate, and said 2021 would mark the first time it surpassed one billion euros in advertising revenue. It did not break out how much of its ad revenue is now generated by podcasts, but said its podcast advertising growth rate was &#8220;in the triple digits.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the product side, the company released a number of updates to its podcasts platform in the quarter, including the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">paid podcast subscriptions</a> in the U.S., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/spotify-rolls-out-podcast-polls-and-qas-to-creators-and-users-worldwide/">new interactive features</a> for Anchor creators, an expansion of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/spotify-expands-its-radio-dj-like-format-music-talk-to-global-creators/">Music + Talk podcast format</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/spotify-opens-up-access-to-video-podcast-publishing-to-anchor-creators/">video podcast support</a>, among other things. It also released 32 new Originals &amp; Exclusives, including &#8220;Armchair Expert&#8221; with Dax Sheppard and &#8220;Call Her Daddy&#8221; in July, and announced a multi-year content partnership with The Ringer and WWE for original and exclusive content. Internationally, Spotify release 76 new Originals &amp; Exclusives.</p>
<p>Overall, Spotify revenue was $2.9 billion in the quarter, up 27% year-over-year, with ad sales rising 75% to reach $374 million, at the top end of its guidance.</p>
<p>The company added that it had not been significantly impacted by the iOS privacy changes that had impacted other ad-supported businesses, like Snap and Facebook, as it had &#8220;a ton of first-party data&#8221; thanks to all its users being logged in.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Robinhood's crypto revenues dropped like a stone. And that matters quite a lot for other companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom/"> impressive growth run</a> on its way to the public markets, when Robinhood did finally price its IPO, the result was a bit slack. The consumer-friendly trading platform priced at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">the lower end of its IPO range</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/robinhoods-stock-drops-8-in-its-first-days-trading/">traded lower in its opening session</a>.</p>
<p>For a company that rode a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">boom in consumer saving and investing activity</a>, it was a sort of odd final entry in its private life.</p>

<hr />
<p>Now public, Robinhood is writing a new book, adding a first chapter last evening when it reported its Q3 2021 earnings. The results were lackluster, leading to the company trading sharply lower this morning.</p>
<p>Robinhood <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/robinhood-drops-10-25-to-below-ipo-price-as-investors-worry-about-bleak-outlook/ar-AAQ0FWq">greatly missed expectations</a>, and its guidance was far from inspiring. What happened to the company that once posted sequential revenue gains that raised eyebrows and popped eyeballs? It&#8217;s worth a little time to understand.</p>

And Robinhood and Coinbase are hardly alone in doing so. There are other richly valued equities-and-cryptos trading platforms out there, including WeBull and FTX. Could they face similar issues? It will serve us well to pay attention to what Robinhood&#8217;s Q3 performance may be able to tell us.</p>
<p>Into the numbers!</p>
<h2>Q3 by the numbers</h2>
<p>Before we get into the why, let&#8217;s talk raw figures. In the three months concluding September 30, 2021, Robinhood <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf">generated</a> $365 million in revenue, up 35% from its year-ago quarter. The company generated options-related transaction revenues of $164 million (+29% YoY), cryptocurrencies-related revenues of $51 million (+860% YoY), and equities transaction top line worth $50 million (-27% YoY).</p>
<p>Robinhood&#8217;s net loss came to $1.32 billion, though seeing companies take huge losses in the quarter following their IPO is not uncommon. In adjusted EBITDA terms, Robinhood turned in -$84 million worth of the stuff in Q3, off sharply from a year-ago $59 million adjusted profit.</p>
<p>Robinhood expects to post yet another quarter of sequential revenue declines in Q4, noting that it will have revenues of less than $325 million. That&#8217;s not good. Especially for a company that posted revenues of $565 million in Q2 2021, or given that analysts<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOOD/analysis?p=HOOD"> expect</a> Robinhood to generate $497.99 million in Q4 revenue.</p>
<p>How did it all get so weird so fast?</p>
<h2>Down, to the right</h2>
<p>In simple terms, Robinhood saw its user base, crypto trading revenues and revenue per user metrics fall. The combined whack to its overall revenue led to the company&#8217;s profitability picture taking a beating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm, one of India’s most valuable startups, is seeking to raise as much as $2.4 billion in what is shaping to be the biggest initial public offering in the country at a valuation of $20 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter and internal documents seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Paytm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">filed the paperworks for an IPO with the local regulator in July this year</a>. The startup, which has raised over $3 billion over the past decade and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">last valued at $16 billion</a>, said at the time that it was looking to raise about $2.2 billion. In an updated filing this week, Paytm said it is seeking to raise $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>The startup is moving to price its share in the range of 2,080 to 2,150 Indian rupees ($27.7 to 28.6), a person familiar with the matter said, adding that the subscription will be available from November 8 to 10, and the trading will begin on November 18 &#8212; or thereabout.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224919" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A successful listing would make Paytm the biggest IPO in India, surpassing a record $2.07 billion initial public offering by government-owned coal mining and refining firm Coal India 11 years ago.</p>
<p>Paytm, which is backed by Alibaba, Berkshire Hathaway and SoftBank among others, launched in 2009 to help users easily make digital payments from their phones and top up credit. It has since expanded to a wide range of services such as payment gateway, e-commerce marketplace, movie and travel ticket booking, as well as insurance and digital gold.</p>
<p>The startup, led by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, describes itself as having “created a payments-led superapp, through which we offer our consumers innovative and intuitive digital products and services.” The startup says it has amassed over 330 million users across its services, more than a third of whom transact annually.</p>
<p>In the new filing, Paytm disclosed that it clocked $118 million in revenue from its operations in the quarter that ended in June this year, up 62% from the prior quarter. In Q2, the startup’s losses surged to $50.9 million, Paytm said, citing additional marketing and promotional campaigns in the run up to the IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paytm’s imminent IPO comes at a time when the pandemic has fuelled India’s digital economy and local stock exchanges are showing growing appetite for consumer tech stocks. Indian food delivery giant Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">made a stellar debut earlier this year</a>. Nykaa, a fashion e-commerce startup, is scheduled to list on Thursday. Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/indian-online-insurer-policybazaar-files-for-ipo-seeks-to-raise-over-800-million/">insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar</a> is scheduled to list next week.</p>
<p>In its filing, Paytm said that it plans to deploy over $250 million of the total capital it is seeking to raise in the IPO to enter new initiatives and explore acquisition opportunities. The startup&#8217;s offerings compete with a range of services including Google Pay, WhatsApp Pay, PhonePe, MakeMyTrip, and BookMyShow.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s now clear why Hertz is buying a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">so many Tesla cars</a>. The company is <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/hertztesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">making</a> up to 50,000 Tesla EVs available for rent solely to Uber ridesharing drivers in the US starting on November 1st. Workers in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Washington, DC will have the option of paying $334 per week (eventually dropping to $299 &#8220;or lower&#8221;) for a package that includes a Model 3, insurance and maintenance.</p>
<p>Drivers will initially need at least a 4.7-star rating and 150 trips to be eligible. The program will expand across the country in the &#8220;following weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company saw the Hertz deal as helpful for both the environment and, potentially, drivers&#8217; bank accounts. It should reduce vehicle emissions and expose many people to EVs for the first time, Uber said. However, it could also lower some running costs. Drivers won&#8217;t have to pay for fuel, after all, and Uber has incentive programs that offer more money per trip (up to $1.50, if it&#8217;s an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-green-us-climate-change-impact-162446386.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">Uber Green</a> ride) to EV operators.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224903" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Uber has strong motivations to adopt EVs. They could help the company reach its goal of zero emissions by 2040, and may tackle complaints that ridesharing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-uber-lyft-climate-pollution-study.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">makes CO2 emissions worse</a>. The firm could burnish its image with eco-friendly cars roaming the streets. Even so, it&#8217;s a big deal both for curbing car-based emissions and for EV adoption — 50,000 cars is a large chunk of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-posts-a-wildly-profitable-q3-despite-difficult-car-market-210905631.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">Tesla&#8217;s production</a>, and likely one of the largest single-customer EV purchases to date.</p>

They’re ready to share their experience to help startup founders, developers and investors move their business forward.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223323" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">packed agenda</a> features 25 stellar presentations and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/partner-sessions-are-going-all-out-at-tc-sessions-saas-2021/">breakout partner sessions</a>, and we’ll point out a few highlights below. Your pass includes video-on-demand, which means you can access any sessions you missed once the event ends. No FOMO!</p>
<p>First off, do not miss this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/announcing-the-startups-exhibiting-at-tc-sessions-saas-2021/">pack of innovative early-stage startups</a> exhibiting at the show. Visit their virtual booths and start a conversation or request a product demo. What’s more, exhibiting founders will take part in the <strong>Startup Pitch Feedback Session</strong>. Tune in to watch them pitch to, and receive feedback from, TC staff. You might pick up a few ways to improve your own pitch.</p>
<p><strong>SaaS Security, Today and Tomorrow:</strong> Enterprises face a constant stream of threats, from nation states to cybercriminals and corporate insiders. After a year where billions worked from home and the cloud reigned supreme, startups and corporations alike can’t afford to stay off the security pulse. Security experts Edna Conway (Microsoft), Wendy Nather (Cisco Secure) and Olivia Rose (Amplitude) discuss what SaaS startups need to know about security now, and in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now:</strong> One thing we learned during the pandemic is the importance of automation, and that’s only likely to be more pronounced as we move forward. We’ll be talking to UiPath CEO Daniel Dines, Laela Sturdy, an investor at CapitalG and Dave Wright from ServiceNow about why this is automation’s moment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Was the Pandemic Cloud Productivity&#8217;s Spark:</strong> One big aspect of SaaS is productivity apps like Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Drive. We’ll talk with executive Javier Soltero about the role Google Workspace plays in the Google cloud strategy.</p>
<p><strong>The Future is Wide Open:</strong> Many startups today have an open-source component, and it’s no wonder. It builds an audience and helps drive sales. We’ll talk with Abby Kearns from Puppet, Augusto “Aghi” Marietti from Kong and Jason Warner, an investor at Redpoint about why open source is such a popular way to build a business.</p>
<p><strong>How Microsoft Shifted from on Prem to the Cloud:</strong> Jared Spataro has been with Microsoft for over 15 years and he was a part of the shift from strictly on prem software to one that is dominated by the cloud. Today he runs one of the most successful SaaS products out there, and we’ll talk to him about how Microsoft made that shift and what it’s meant to the company.</p>
<p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s happening today at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=eventtodaypost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eventtodaypost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>.

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1215439780">Equity</a>.</p>
<p>This is a special, if somewhat bittersweet episode. It marks the final official podcast with our own <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny Crichton</a>, who is off to other pastures in short order. Danny stepped in when we lost a host a few years back, and has been both a staple and a pillar of the show since. We&#8217;re going to miss the ever-loving <em>heck</em> out of him.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224321" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the show must go on, so we spent this episode discussing issues core to our remit: The venture capital market, startups, and the interplay between each.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and Danny and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> got together for this particular Wednesday edition of Equity, the part of the week when we niche down to a single topic and discuss it at length.</p>
<p>This time &#8217;round we tackled the very small of whether today&#8217;s pace of venture capital investment is sustainable, and whether the current structure of venture capital funds will survive. It was the right time to do so, given that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiger is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/tiger-global-raises-8-8-billion-in-first-close-of-biggest-fund">reloading with even more capital</a>. Danny noted that its rising asset base is a good indicator of just where things are today.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">Venture capital is at all-time highs</a>. Natasha and Alex riffed through the numbers, noting just how crazy things have become.</li>
<li>And as we were collecting our notes, Sequoia announced (<a href="https://www.axios.com/sequoia-capital-fund-venture-capital-model-36425923-deff-430e-9945-09b0ccb69c78.html">after Primack scooped them</a>) that they are revolutionizing their firm into a new sort of vehicle.</li>
<li>We also discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/venture-capital-is-going-to-need-a-record-breaking-run-of-ipos-to-clear-its-own-decks/">the unicorn traffic jam</a>, which gave Alex a chance to jump atop his favorite hobby horse one more time.</li>
</ul>
<p>With more money than ever bouncing around startup-land, the question of whether the sums, and their resulting valuations, make any sense is a conversation that we are not done with. But we hope that after this short podcast, you are at least up to speed.</p>
<p>Bon voyage, Danny. We love you. And a regular shoutout to the folks who have helped host Equity in the past: <a href="https://twitter.com/KateClarkTweets">Kate Clark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Katie_Roof">Katie Roof</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattlynley">Matthew Lynley</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/cookie">Connie Loizos</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Puffco is announcing a new upgrade to its over-the-top Peak Pro vaporizer that increases the smoking experience and improves battery life. This upgrade requires users to swap the cooking chamber of their Peak Pro, but a sleek design makes this easy. The new chamber comes just after announcing a clever battery-powered hot knife that makes loading the vape clean and easy. No one said smoking dabs should be this high tech.</p>
<p>Called the 3D Chamber, this chamber is a significant part of the Puffco Peak Pro (this is where the magic happens). Inside, the cannabis material is quickly heated and turned into a vapor. Puffco designed this part so the user can unscrew the chamber for cleaning or replacing or upgrading.</p>
<p>Like the name implies the 3D Chamber heats the material on sides. Because of this more efficient heating arrangement, Puffco says the Peak Pro’s battery life is increased by 30%. The user has to update the firmware of the Peak Pro to use the 3D Chamber.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224837" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This new chamber will cost $89.99 when it’s available starting in late October 2021.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/puffco.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="613" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2224843" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/puffco.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/puffco.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/puffco.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/puffco.jpg?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/puffco.jpg?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/puffco.jpg?resize=1536,919 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/puffco.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>This is the first major accessory for the $399 Puffco Peak Pro, its second generation concentrate e-rig. The device has users deposit a nug of concentrated cannabis, where it quickly heats, and sends the vapor through a water bong. It’s quick, easy, and provides amazing taste and vapor. The new chamber improves the experience. The company sent me a 3D Chamber to try out and I love it. The 3D Chamber improves the Puffco Peak Pro in every way.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the company unveiled a novel battery powered dabbing tool that features a ceramic tip that quickly heats, causing the concentrate to slide off.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Puffco was founded by Roger Volodarsky in 2013 and is still held privately. The company says it’s on track to hit $100m in revenue in 2021. It has two main product lines: portable water rigs with the $249 Peak and $399 Peak Pro, and the tiny $89 Puffco Plus concentrate vape pen. Puffco says its sold over 1 Million of the Puffco Plus since launching it in 2016, and newer products are selling at at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Puffco’s products are widely praised for their design and function. Their fit and finish is as good top-tier electronics from any vendor. The company says its targeting a demographic that wants to get closer to the cannabis plant. For validation Puffco to the growing ecosystem of third party accessories and its highly engaged fanbase especially on Instagram where it has 448k followers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned platform for those connecting with others in their fields of work and those looking for work, has been known best in recruitment for sourcing candidates and advertising job openings for permanent work. Now, to complement that, LinkedIn is opening up a new front in the job market for freelancers.</p>
<p>Today it is taking the wraps off its Service Marketplace, a new feature that will let people advertise themselves for short-term engagements to those looking to hire people for such roles, competing against the likes of Fiverr and Upwork for sourcing skilled knowledge workers.</p>
<p>The launch of its freelancer platform is coming alongside a few other key updates from LinkedIn around other job-hunting tools, underscoring how the company is looking to adapt to new currents in the job market and how we work. They include new search filters to find jobs (permanent jobs, that is) that are remote, hybrid or on-site; and these can also now be indicated on your &#8220;Open to Work&#8221; indicator if you have that turned on to invite recruiters to contact you<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. Alongside this, you can now also check out companies&#8217; vaccination requirements as part of how you evaluate jobs (if the employer has indicated those details itself).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service Marketplace was first leaked out as a small test in <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-new-gig-a-linkedin-freelancer-market-rivaling-upwork-fiverr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February</a> this year. Since then LinkedIn has been running a quiet beta of the service in the U.S., which has already picked up 2 million users from among the nearly 800 million users (as of yesterday&#8217;s earning report) that LinkedIn now has globally. As of today, Service Marketplace is going to be turned on for everyone globally: to set up a freelancer profile, you go to your own profile page, find the button near the top and follow the script to set it up and flag what you might be interested in working on.</p>
<p>The new feature marks an interesting turning point for LinkedIn under the wing of Microsoft, which picked up about 25 million new users in the last quarter.</p>
<p>The company has long been building out what it has described as the &#8220;economic graph,&#8221; the idea being that you can build a bigger understanding of the global economy by mapping out how people interconnect in their professional relationships. Its intention in doing so, of course, is to help provide a stronger underpinning for the very commercial aspects of its business, namely its recruitment business, where the platform sells premium subscriptions to recruiters to source more data about potential candidates, advertise jobs, and help those looking for jobs find work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That business has been growing at a steady clip: LinkedIn said in yesterday&#8217;s earnings call that c<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">onfirmed hires on the platform increased more than 160% year over year, with advertising revenue overall up 61% in the same period; and it is managing to upsell those doing recruiting to its wider suite of training content, too:</span> LinkedIn Learning now has more than 15,000 enterprise customers.</p>
<p>But in doing so, LinkedIn has cut out a big chunk of the market: the last decade has seen a huge surge of people moving away from full-time, long-term employment into more short-term freelance roles. While there has been nothing to keep them from using LinkedIn to network, stay in touch with others in their field, and maybe find jobs, until now LinkedIn hasn&#8217;t had any formal way to engage in the latter of these, and specifically to monetize it.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2224870,2224871,2224872,2224873,2224874,2224876,2224877"]</p>
<p>Although Service Marketplace is not currently charging any fees, as it does for its other recruiting products, this will lay the groundwork for how over time LinkedIn can.</p>
<p>The Service Marketplace is launching with 250 job categories, and the plan is to expand that to 500, product manager Matt Faustman told me in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are barely scratching the surface,&#8221; he said. Marketing has been one of the stronger categories to date, he added.</p>
<p>(Sidenote: Faustman joined LinkedIn when his previous startup, legal tech specialist UpCounsel, was acquired by LinkedIn. His first project there was to build a marketplace to help source lawyers for short-term jobs, which has naturally evolved into him working on the wider Service Marketplace.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Barely scratching the surface&#8221; may be the operative phrase here: For now, there is no way of negotiating a fee for work, nor for invoicing, and those looking to find people are not required to give any specific guidance on fees until they get into a deeper conversation with a candidate. When it comes to reviews, clients can review those they have engaged, but the individuals cannot leave a review for the clients.</p>
<p>And, those listing themselves on the Marketplace have no way of finding jobs themselves: they are there to be discovered, not to search for work themselves.</p>
<p>Clients looking to fill jobs will be able to look for people by way of LinkedIn&#8217;s bigger drop-down search menu: for example, looking for specialists in brand marketing, you can start to type in that phrase in the search window, and LinkedIn will suggest &#8220;in Service Marketplace&#8221; as an auto-complete, which will take you to a list of candidates in that category. Those candidates will be sorted based on how closely you the client might be connected to each individual, either via a work or personal connection.</p>
<p>But those who are brand marketing specialists will not be able to scan a wider list of opportunities. Faustman said that this is intentional: they have, for now, built this for the client experience, and the idea is that by letting them make targeted asks, they do not get inundated with applications that they then have to spend time triaging.</p>
<p>Over time this, plus all of the other features that are missing such as payments, will be re-evaluated, he said. That will be critical if LinkedIn hopes to get the credibility of the workforce that it&#8217;s trying to cultivate here. Freelancers often suffer from a lack of transparency on rates, and run the risk of being exploited as a result through low-balling, a point Faustman acknowledged is an issue and said was a point of contention within LinkedIn&#8217;s product team.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will address the pricing point, but we decided not to for now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Another interesting turn will be how and if LinkedIn will bring in other kinds of workers into the marketplace, covering the wide population of people who are working on the front line and other service jobs. There is no immediate roadmap to include them in the Service Marketplace, Faustman said, but &#8220;the long term is that we can extend this into any category that exists on LinkedIn.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This morning Brazilian neobank Nu, better known as Nubank, </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211027005661/en/Nu-Announces-Confidential-Submission-of-Draft-Registration-Statement-for-Proposed-Initial-Public-Offering"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it has filed to go public. Today its S-1 filing remains private, but the announcement of its existence implies that Nu is on track to go public soon, perhaps inside of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company filed with both the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM) in Brazi, it saidl. Per the company’s bulletin, Nu intends to list in the United States with intent to “negotiate a program of Brazilian Depositary Receipts” in its home country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Nu </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a $750 million round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Berkshire Hathaway at a $30 billion valuation, making it one of the most valuable unicorns in the world. Since its 2013 inception, Nu has raised $2.3 billion in capital, with investors such as Sequoia Capital, Tencent, Ribbit Capital, Kaszek, QED Investors and others,</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224850" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, Nu had 40 million users across Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Its sheer number of users makes Nubank the largest digital bank in the world in terms of customers. Notably, it had 25 million users in June of 2020 and 6 million in 2018 &#8212; so its pace of growth and acquiring customers is quite remarkable.</span></p>
<p>Earlier this month, Business Insider reported that Nubank had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nubank-turns-first-half-year-profit-in-brazil-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned its first-ever half-year profit</a> in its home market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colombian businessman and former Sequoia VC David Velez founded Nu with the mission of fixing the dated Brazilian banking system. The company set out to help serve the underbanked and unbanked in the country with a range of products and services. It is estimated that tens of millions remain unbanked in Brazil, so the opportunity for the neobank remains quite large, especially considering the increased use of smartphones and the move to digital overall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch dug deep into Nu in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><b>The Neobanking boom’s leading candidates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of Nu’s private IPO filing come on the heels of news that American neobank Chime is also targeting a public offering. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/10/23/chime-in-talks-to-go-public-at-35-to-45-billion-valuation/?sh=332d458732ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Per </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes reporting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Chime could seek a valuation of between $35 to $45 billion, and could go public next March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Q4 2021 Nu IPO followed by a Q1 2022 IPO would shift a simply huge fraction of global neobank equity from the private markets into the public. But the two companies’ respective transitions will bring risk along with potentially lucrative returns for their backers. If Nu or Chime struggle when they do list, or price at a valuation that underperforms expectations, we could see the value of yet-private neobanks slip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that while we are certain that private-market investors are smitten with the neobanking startup and unicorn cohort, we have yet to see how the public markets may react to the most valuable companies in the group. Though the fact that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chime was EBITDA positive in late 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implies that we’re not going to see every neobank file with yawning losses on its books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we’ll see when we get a public S-1 filing from Nu is less clear, though we are modestly bursting with curiosity. Just how strong of a business set has the neobanking industry managed to concoct with ample capital and plenty of time? We’ll know soon enough.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hinge is rolling out a new ‘Voice Prompts’ feature to give its users a new way to connect with their matches. Voice Prompts will allow users to answer a prompt through a 30-second voice recording. The new feature is rolling out globally starting today.</p>
<p>Hinge says the new feature allows people to give others a glimpse into their personality and perhaps hint at what a first date would be like. The feature will prompt users to discuss a certain topic or share a specific fun story. For instance, the prompts may ask users to discuss their biggest date fail or share a random fact that they love.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company says 65 percent of its users say they believe hearing someone’s voice would help them determine interest in a match, as 75 percent of users said it’s difficult to feel connected with a match when their conversation is limited to just text and photos.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224653" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hinge also plans to launch a new ‘Voice Notes’ feature later this fall. Voice Notes will make it possible for users to have a conversation that captures their personality while messaging each other. Hinge says both Voice Notes and Voice Prompts will allow people to better showcase who they are at different points in their dating journey.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hinge is updating its algorithm to help non-binary users better represent themselves while connecting with others on the app. To do this, Hinge will offer a “non-binary” gender category to ensure that their gender is acknowledged.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Hinge isn&#8217;t the only dating app to add voice features, as audio options are becoming more popular in the space. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/28/bumble-now-lets-you-call-your-matches-without-exchanging-numbers/">Bumble</a> and <a href="https://www.happn.com/en/">Happn</a> both have voice note features. Additionally, a new app called <a href="https://www.stringdating.com/">String</a> lets users only communicate through voice notes. It&#8217;s clear that dating apps are looking to leverage the convenience of voice notes to retain and garner more users, as the feature takes away the awkwardness of a phone call but takes the conversation a step further than texts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.groopit.co/">Groopit</a>, an early stage startup from a 20-year Microsoft veteran, wants to help companies crowdsource data from information supplied by employees working in the field. Today, the company announced a $2 million pre-seed round led by Ascend.vc with participation from a group of investors that includes Voyager Capital and Vulcan Capital. The startup has raised $3.1 million since inception, according to the company.</p>
<p>Groopit co-founder and CEO Tammy Savage says that when she was working at Microsoft she saw a problem around getting data to people where it was needed inside the organization. &#8220;What Groopit does is it combines data collection and real-time data sharing into one lightweight workflow. So it empowers everyone involved to understand a problem and tackle a problem,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She likens it to Waze, the crowd-sourced traffic app, where individuals on the road can report to a group of users what&#8217;s happening in real time. Savage believes that by giving teams this kind of insight from the field can be a real advantage to companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224477" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>She uses retail customer Stuckey&#8217;s as an example. It&#8217;s a company that sells nut products in retail stores across the country. As sales people go into stores to check supplies, they can take a photo of the display, note the location inside the store and rate how the merchandise is being presented, all from an app on their phones. They can even capture competitor product data including SKUs that appear to be selling faster than the company&#8217;s product. All of this gives executives quick access to data, which they can then share in other tools like a CRM or a collaboration tool. It also has the added benefit of saving time in meetings because salespeople no longer have to give status reports.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224494" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224494" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2224494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stuckeys-Screenshot.png?w=680" alt="Groopit data gathering example" width="680" height="487" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stuckeys-Screenshot.png 1122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stuckeys-Screenshot.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stuckeys-Screenshot.png?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stuckeys-Screenshot.png?resize=768,550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stuckeys-Screenshot.png?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stuckeys-Screenshot.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224494" class="wp-caption-text">Groopit web and mobile apps. <strong>Image Credits: </strong>Groopit</p></div></p>
<p>The product can be customized in a variety of ways to work for an individual business to gather the specific kinds of data it needs &#8212; and it works across mobile and Web.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2018 after Savage left Microsoft. She worked on it for a couple of years before releasing the first version of the product at the end of 2020. The company has 18 employees at this point, and has no plans to hire additional people for the time being, but she says that as a female founder she understands the need for diversity inside her organization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We actually have more women working on this business than men right now. I think one of the things that happens is we just naturally see talent in different places. So we recruit and hire the people we do because we&#8217;re looking in different places for the talent and&#8230;we just end up with a diverse team,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Savage says that her experience working at Microsoft all those years really helped inform her experience creating Groopit. &#8220;A lot of my understanding of that challenge that leaders have is from my leadership years at Microsoft, plus a lot of research, but that experience was just crucial. It&#8217;s what Groopit is really born out of &#8212; a collision between my experience as a leader plus my experience doing software design,&#8221; she said.</p>
