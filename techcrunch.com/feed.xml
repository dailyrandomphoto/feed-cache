										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">VerSe Innovation, the parent firm of popular news aggregator Dailyhunt and short video app Josh, said on Thursday it has raised over $450 million in a new financing round, just five months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/dailyhunt-and-joshs-parent-firm-raises-over-100-million/">securing $200 million</a>, as the Indian startup looks to expand its offerings to international markets.</p>
<p>Siguler Guff, Baillie Gifford, affiliates of Carlyle Asia Partners Growth II and others financed VerSe Innovation’s Series I round, while existing investors Sofina Group, Qatar Investment Authority and BCap participated.</p>
<p>VerSe Innovation said in a statement that its valuation has more than doubled in the past five months without disclosing a precise figure. The startup was valued at over $1 billion in its Series H financing round. <strong>Update</strong>: VerSe Innovation&#8217;s valuation is &#8220;nearing $3 billion&#8221; in the new round, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The Google and Microsoft-backed startup claimed that Josh, which has amassed over 115 million monthly active users, 56 million of whom use the app each day. Dailyhunt, the startup said, has amassed over 300 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>Josh competes with scores of short video apps including Moj and MX TakaTak. All these apps mushroomed after India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned TikTok over cybersecurity concerns</a> in mid-2020 to cash in on the opportunity. ByteDance&#8217;s app identified India as its biggest international market, where it had courted over 200 monthly active users.</p>
<p>Moj, which claims to have over 100 million users, is operated by Tiger Global-backed ShareChat that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/india-sharechat-valued-at-3-billion-in-145-million-fundraise/">valued at $2.88 billion in a financing round</a> it unveiled last month. MX TakaTak&#8217;s parent firm MX Player is also currently engaging with investors to raise a round that would value the startup at over $1 billion, according to three people aware of the development.</p>
<p>VerSe Innovation is betting on building a family of apps that serves users in scores of local languages. Dailyhunt, for instance, offers its content in 14 languages from over 100,000 content partners and creators. And it plans to replicate the same strategy as it looks to expand in international markets, VerSe Innovation said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup said it also plans to invest in broadening its AI / ML stack to offer users more personalized experience.</p>
<p>The new fundraise comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital from high-profile investors. India, which is the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, has produced over 20 unicorns this year, up from 11 last year and 6 in 2019. Some investors have also doubled down on the South Asian market after China, one of the other rare big growth markets, enforced a series of regulatory changes that has wiped hundreds of billions of dollars in recent weeks.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://appworks.tw/">AppWorks</a>, the Taipei-based venture capital firm focused on Taiwan and Southeast Asia, announced today it has closed its oversubscribed third fund, raising $150 million. AppWorks Fund III’s limited partners include Taiwan Mobile, Axiom Asia Private Capital, Fubon Life, TransGlobe Life, Hongtai Group, Wistron, Cathay Life, Phison Electronics and Taiwan’s National Development Fund. Many of these LPs also participated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/17/appworks-50m/">AppWorks’ $50 million second fund in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>AppWorks’ total assets under management (AUM) is now $212 million. As part of Fund III’s close, AppWorks is <a href="https://appworks.tw/works/">recruiting </a>new investment associates and analysts, especially ones who will focus on sourcing deals throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Jamie Lin, the firm’s chairman and founding partner, told TechCrunch that Fund III had an initial target of $100 million, but surpassed it because of the strong performance of AppWorks’ second fund.</p>
<p>Fund II’s portfolio includes Lalamove and 91APP, and at the end of July 2021, its total value to paid-in (TVPI), or the return multiple net of fees, reached 3.3x. By comparison, the top quartile of global VC and private equity funds launched around the same time have a TVPI of 2.4x, according to data from Cambridge Associates. Fund II also achieved internal rate of return (IRR) of 34.7%, compared to 26.1% for the other funds.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, AppWorks started its accelerator program before launching a $11 million debut fund in 2012. AppWorks’ ecosystem now includes 414 active startups that have collectively raised $4.3 billion, and have an aggregate valuation of $17.4 billion. Over the next 10 years, AppWorks’ goal is to increase that to 1,000 active startups with a collective value of more than $100 billion.</p>
<p>Lin said AppWorks has a strong incoming pipeline because many startups in its ecosystem, including ones run by accelerator alumni and its mentor network of about 100 seasoned entrepreneurs, have reached product-market fit, are scalable and need to raise funding to accelerate growth.</p>
<p>Fund III is earmarked for a portfolio of about 40 startups, split evenly between investments starting at $2 million in Series A to Series C rounds, and seed-stage investments. Seed-stage checks can range in size from about $50,000 to $200,000, depending on a startup’s needs. Part of the fund’s capital will also go toward AppWorks’ current portfolio companies as they reach maturation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AppWorks’ three main investment themes are Southeast Asia, blockchain and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Lin said that many of AppWorks accelerator graduates over the past three to five years are from Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and, increasingly, Indonesia and the Philippines. (AppWorks also serves as an LP in about 15 seed funds across Southeast Asia, which helped it maintain strong deal flow despite pandemic travel restrictions).</p>
<p>AppWorks’ current blockchain investments include Dapper Labs, Animoca Brands and Splinterlands. Lin is especially keen on NFTs and their “ability to bridge the physical world and digital world,” plus blockchain’s potential to change how people game (for example, the play-to-earn model Splinterlands is known for).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The explosive (and inclusive) potential of NFTs in the creative world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts/embed/#?secret=E4N7ZqDok1" data-secret="E4N7ZqDok1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Investing in a mix of seed- and growth-stage deals means Fund III’s schedule will be more evenly spread out. The approach is “better for LPs, but also mostly comes from our philosophy of putting founders front and center,” Lin said. “A lot of our accelerator alumni startups are by first-time founders, so they need help all the way from seed stage. Many of our mentors have already raised seed or Series A rounds, and they come to us when they need someone to lead a Series B of $10, $15 or $20 million. It stems from our particular deal flow, since we’re mainly supporting our alumni founders and mentors, so we have two very different types of deal flows.”</p>
<p>Fund III has already backed AppWorks accelerator alumni like Pickone, WeMo Scooter, Omnichat, XREX, Blocto, SoopahGenius and Docosan. Investments from its mentor network include Carousell, Dapper Labs, Tiki, Dcard, Yummy Corp and Animoca Brands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sydney, Australia-based <a href="https://fablefood.co/">Fable Food </a>is the latest plant-based food startup to announce funding. The company, which uses mushrooms in its meat alternatives, has raised $6.5 million AUD (about $4.8 million USD) in a seed round led by Blackbird Ventures, the Australian venture capital firm whose portfolio also includes Canva, Culture Amp and SafetyCulture. Other participants included agriculture and food tech venture firm AgFunder, sustainability-focused Aera VC and Better Bite Ventures, along with Singapore-based produce importer Ban Choon Marketing and former Sequoia Capital partner Warren Hogarth.</p>
<p>Fable is preparing to launch in the United States by the end of this year. In Australia, its products are available at retailers like Woolworths, Coles and Harris Farm Markets, along with restaurants including Grill’d, which recently started serving its Meaty Mushroom Burger Pattie at 136 locations. Fable’s products are also available at restaurants in Singapore and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The startup was founded in 2019 by fine dining chef turned chemical engineer and mycologist (mushroom scientist) Jim Fuller, organic mushroom farmer Chris McLoghlin and Michael Fox, whose previous startup was Shoes of Prey.</p>
<p>Fox, Fable’s chief executive officer, told TechCrunch in an email that after being a vegetarian for six years, he recently became a vegan “for a mix of health, environmental and ethical reasons.”</p>
<p>“Talking to my friends and family, a lot of people want to reduce their meat consumption for the same reasons but they find it challenging because they love the taste and texture of meat and giving it up is hard,” Fox said. He wanted to find a way to make it easier for people to transition to plant-based foods, and spoke to several chefs who suggested using mushrooms as a base ingredient. Then Fox met Fuller and McLoghlin, who were in the process of developing meat alternatives using mushrooms.</p>

<p>“When we met, we realized we shared the same values and goals and had complementary skill sets,” said Fox. “We shared a common desire to help end industrial agriculture and wanted to make our food system more ethical, healthy, sustainable and lower its greenhouse gas emissions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fable&#8217;s first products include a substitute for pulled pork, braised beef and beef brisket (Fuller grew up in Texas eating slow-cooked meats and wanted to recreate the experience), along with a line of ready-made meals. The company uses shiitake mushrooms, which Fox explained are “very flavorful with their natural umami flavors, they are a slow-growing mushroom so they naturally have the fleshy fibers that give the meaty bite you typically get from animal proteins, and have the right chemical composition that when cooked allow us to taste flavors that are found in animal products.”</p>

<p>Fuller serves as Fable’s chief science officer and the startup leverages his experience as a chef/chemical engineer/mycologist to create the right combinations of flavor, aroma and texture while keeping processing and ingredients to a minimum. For example, its braised beef alternative is made with shiitake mushrooms, seven other ingredients and salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Fable also announced today it has appointed Dan Joyce, who was previously safety and compliance software company SafetyCulture’s general manager of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as chief growth officer to head global sales and marketing. It will launch in the U.S. through a combination of partnerships with restaurants and meal kit companies.</p>

<p>Other startups that use mushrooms as basis for meat alternatives include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/i-cant-believe-its-not-meat/">Meati</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2021/04/15/maker-of-mushroom-sourced-bacon-raises-40-million-to-reach-grocers-at-scale/?sh=3e7d436a72d1">AtLast</a>. Fox said a main difference is that those two startups ferment mycelium, or the root structure of fungi, instead of using mushrooms, which are the fruiting body of fungi.</p>
<p>Fable’s new funding will be used for research and development, expanding its production and manufacturing capacity in Australia and other countries. The company is keeping its product pipeline under wraps for now, but Fox said it plans to develop mushroom-based substitutes for pork, chicken, lamb and other animal proteins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last year, Tinder has experimented with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/tinder-to-roll-out-new-48-hour-in-app-events-called-vibes/">creative ways</a> for people to connect beyond just swiping right. Pandemic or not, it&#8217;s hard to make the first move &#8212; so why not break the ice by weathering a virtual apocalypse with a potential date? Today, Tinder <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-11-Tinder-Orders-More-Swipe-Night-Following-Transformative-20-Million-Member-Turnout-and-26-Increase-in-Matches">announced</a> that it will launch its second &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series after its first installment garnered engagement from over 20 million users.</p>
<p>Tinder launched Swipe Night in 2019 as an interactive &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; story at a time when the app had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/tinders-interactive-series-swipe-night-could-bring-a-needed-boost-to-user-engagement/">experienced</a> a decline in one of its user engagement metrics and saw a dip in quarterly revenue. In the months since, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-match-group-results/match-quarterly-revenue-hit-by-slowing-tinder-growth-idUSKBN22H2VV">COVID slowed Tinder&#8217;s revenue</a> further, but more recently, it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/match-group-revenue-beats-estimates-delivers-positive-outlook?sref=gni836kR">rebounding</a>.</p>
<p>Noting that its user base was<a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/introducing-swipe-night"> half Gen Z</a> (ages 18-25), Tinder hired now 25-year-old director Karena Evans, who has also directed music videos for Drake, as well as the premiere of HBO Max&#8217;s &#8220;Gossip Girl&#8221; reboot. The Swipe Night story invited users to choose what they would do in the apocalypse, swiping left or right to indicate their decisions as a character in the story. Based on how they swiped, users would get matched with other Swipe Night participants, and their choices would appear on their Tinder profile.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of this new information will make for plenty of material for post-apocalyptic banter,&#8221; the company had <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/introducing-swipe-night">said</a>.</p>
<p>Skeptics might find this to be an inorganic way to boost user engagement and matches, but on Swipe Nights, there was a 26% increase in matches compared with a typical Sunday night, <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-11-Tinder-Orders-More-Swipe-Night-Following-Transformative-20-Million-Member-Turnout-and-26-Increase-in-Matches">Tinder now reports</a>. The interactive video series was even <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-25-Tinder-Wins-Entertainment-Grand-Prix-for-Swipe-Night-at-Cannes-Festival-2021">recognized</a> at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.</p>

<p>The next installment for Swipe Night will be a &#8220;Gen Z whodunnit,&#8221; Tinder announced today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The upcoming series will utilize Tinder&#8217;s &#8220;Fast Chat,&#8221; the quick chat feature that powers <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences">Tinder&#8217;s new &#8220;Hot Takes&#8221; experience</a> where users can talk before matching. On Swipe Night, Fast Chat will allow users to analyze clues and work together to solve the mystery, even if they haven&#8217;t already matched.</p>
<p>Tinder says Swipe Night will debut in the app&#8217;s &#8220;Explore&#8221; section, which is a newer part of the Tinder app that gives members different ways to meet beyond just swiping. The section was <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences">announced</a> last month as part of a group of features targeting Gen Z users, along with Hot Takes and video profiles.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 11, 2021. If you are a Twitter user, today has proven to be a divisive day, thanks to some design changes. We also have hardware news, mobility news, a few very neat funding rounds and even some startup media news. It’s a great day for a roundup. Also, if you are in the United States, you may have noticed a missive from FEMA today. FEMA is the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/fema-emergency-alert-system/">just ran a test of its emergency alert system</a>, or EAS. Given that the world appears to be constantly on fire, sick or underwater, it’s a good time for such an endeavor.</p>
<p>Before we go on, Disrupt is hosting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/hear-how-cityblock-healths-toyin-ajayi-carbon-healths-eren-bali-and-forwards-adrian-aoun-see-tech-impacting-access-to-health-at-disrupt-2021/">some of the most interesting founders in health tech</a>, and we’ll have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/dont-miss-these-special-breakout-sessions-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">some pretty darn cool breakout sessions to boot</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/twitter-redesigns-website-with-new-font-less-clutter-and-high-contrast-features/">Twitter’s redesign turns heads:</a> </strong>That Twitter is in the midst of something akin to a product renaissance is well known, with the social media provider working on a host of projects at once. Hell, Twitter is even working on <em>TweetDeck</em>. Today, however, Twitter stirred the pot with a web and mobile redesign that included a new font. <em>Quelle horreur !</em> No, but really, people are mad.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/heres-everything-samsung-announced-this-morning/">Here’s everything that Samsung announced today:</a></strong> As expected, Samsung held a hardware event today. What did the hardware giant show off? The Galaxy Watch 4, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 (the folding smartphone affair), the Galaxy Z Flip 2 (a smaller folding smartphone) and new headphones. If you are not into the iOS ecosystem, this is for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/vcs-unfazed-by-chinese-regulatory-shakeups-so-far/"><strong>China’s regulatory shakeup not harming venture investment. Yet.</strong></a><strong> </strong>After the Chinese government started a wide-ranging crackdown on a host of domestic industries that it either found too powerful, too unregulated or too monopolistic, what impact the changes would have on startups and venture capital have been open questions. Early Q3 data indicates that things haven’t changed too much, <em>yet</em>. But with SoftBank potentially pausing Chinese deals, larger startup investment could suffer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into our usual digest of the latest and greatest funding rounds from the worlds of venture capital and high-growth startups, two product-related notes.</p>
<p>First, Airtable just bought something! Yes, <strong>Airtable</strong>, the roughly $5.8 billion spreadsheet of the future is making deals. Well, one. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/airtable-makes-bayes-its-first-acquisition-to-up-its-data-visualization-game/">company bought <strong>Bayes</strong></a>, what TechCrunch called an “early-stage visualization startup” that also features a no-code focus. If you love Airtable, this could be good news.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>Medium</strong> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/medium-revamps-its-partner-program-launching-new-eligibility-requirements-and-referral-bonuses/">shaking up its business model yet again</a>. Again. Yes, one more time. This time, the company is changing its partner program. Now writers on Medium can drive their own subscriptions, snagging half the long-term revenue net of fees. This feels a little Substack-y, but not in a bad way. Despite Medium’s inability to decide what it is, I remain modestly hopeful for the company thanks to my profession of getting paid to make words appear on the internet.</p>
<p>Now, some funding rounds for your enjoyment!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/doxel-raises-40m-from-insight-a16z-to-become-the-waze-for-construction/"><strong>$40M for construction-focused computer vision:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the headline from Doxel’s latest round, led by Insight Partners. The Series B brings the company’s total raised capital to just over $56 million. Doxel uses computer vision to track the progress of construction sites. It’s a neat model, and, per the company, it still has its full Series A in the bank thanks to “growth and bookings traction” of sufficient size that it has been “cash flow neutral” since its last raise. Why would Doxel raise if it didn’t need money? Because it could pad its accounts at a new, higher price implying minimal dilution. And you always want to raise when you don’t need to. It’s far cheaper than waiting for a cash crunch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/e-commerce-as-a-service-platform-cart-com-picks-up-98m-to-give-brands-scaling-tools/"><strong>Cart.com raises $98 million:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Does the name Cart.com sound familiar? It might. Why? Because the Houston-based e-commerce tooling company has now raised three times this year. So you may recall it from the other two times it put capital onto its balance sheet in 2021. The company has now raised $143 million in total.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/founded-by-a-freshworks-alum-sales-commission-platform-everstage-gets-1-7m-seed/"><strong>Everstage raises $1.7M for sales commissions software:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The old startup adage of <em>build software to replace manual spreadsheet processes </em>is alive and well, it turns out. Everstage wants to take sales commissions, today “calculated on spreadsheets by finance teams” that provide limited visibility to salespeople, and turn them into highly limpid software. Salespeople will dig this, given how complex commissions can be and how critical they are to sales comp totals.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/pave-gets-y-combinator-to-back-better-startup-compensation-tools-again/"><strong>Pave raises $16M</strong></a> to help companies “benchmark, plan and communicate compensation to their employees.” Akin to how sales commissions can be Gordian in their heft, employee comp is a knotty issue. Pave wants to provide more data to companies so that they can make better &#8212; and, we hope, more equitable &#8212; compensation decisions and generally improve employee lives. We dig this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The gray revolution: Fundraising within the older adult space</h2>
<p>Although older adults are one of the fastest-growing demographics, they&#8217;re quite underserved when it comes to consumer tech.</p>
<p>The global population of people older than 65 will reach 1.5 billion by 2050, and members of this cohort — who are leading longer, active lives — have money to spend.</p>
<p>Still, most startups persist in releasing products aimed at serving younger users, says Lawrence Kosick, co-founder of GetSetUp, an edtech company that targets 50+ learners.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can provide a valuable, scalable service for the older adult market, there’s a lot of opportunity to drive growth through partnerships.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>All right, listen, public tech companies were more than busy today. So, we’re going to be brief so that we can cram as much news in here as we can:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/nortonlifelock-avast-merger/"><strong>NortonLifeLock is combining with Avast in an $8.1B deal:</strong></a> This is big news for the cybersecurity space. TechCrunch called this the third-largest cybersecurity acquisition of all time.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/google-launches-android-12-beta-4-hitting-the-platform-stability-milestone/"><strong>Android 12 reaches “platform stability” in its fourth beta:</strong></a> That means developers can build for the new Android without worrying about changing code. My real question: When was the last time that you or I got excited about a new mobile OS iteration? Frankly, Windows 11 is more exciting than anything Android or iOS has dropped lately.</li>
<li>And then there was<strong> a whole mess of transport news</strong>. TechCrunch has a review of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/ford-f-150-hybrid-the-2021-rumble-before-the-lightning-ev-strikes/">new hybrid F-150 truck</a>, if you are into moving things. We also have news that Hyzon Motors has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/hyzon-motors-has-begun-shipping-hydrogen-fuel-cell-trucks-to-customers/">started shipping hydrogen fuel cell trucks</a>, which is pretty cool. Amazon’s $1.5 billion cargo hub <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/amazons-1-5-billion-u-s-air-cargo-hub-is-open-for-business/">is now up and running</a>, which means faster package deliveries so that you don’t have to walk to buy razors. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/joby-aviation-makes-its-public-trading-debut-on-the-nyse/">Joby Aviation has completed its SPAC combination</a>, meaning that the VTOL taxi company is now public.</li>
<li>One more: I am excited to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/a-close-look-at-singapores-thriving-startup-ecosystem/">read this dive into Singapore’s startup scene!</a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The beleaguered EV startup Lordstown Motors is on track to begin production of its flagship electric truck Endurance, but only select customers will begin to receive vehicles early next year, executives said during a second quarter earnings call.</p>
<p>Executives struck a cautious tone in the second-quarter earnings call as they tried to assuage shareholder concerns and address the near-term realities of bringing its first vehicle to market without any revenue to offset its costs. Lordstown&#8217;s approach, at least this quarter, was to try and reduce operating costs from the previous quarter, helping it offset its increase in capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Lordstown reported a net loss of $108 million, a 13.7% improvement from the first quarter loss of $125 million. Its net losses are more than tenfold higher than the -$7.9 million it reported in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Lordstown cut research and development spending by 17% from the previous quarter to $76.5 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it increased its capital expenditures to $121 million from $53 million in the first quarter. Lordstown also increased its capital expenditure guidance for the year, from $250 million to $275 million to a $375 million to $400 million range, a spike related to its need to prepay for equipment.</p>

<p>The decline in R&amp;D expenses was due to declines in purchases of vehicle components, as many of those were acquired in prior quarters, Lordstown interim CFO Becky Long said during an investor call. However, legal expenses were $9 million higher than last quarter, due to costs related to a special committee and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation over whether Lordstown exaggerated pre-sales. (The fun doesn’t stop there — the company is also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000110465921092686/tm218118-5_posam.htm">under investigation</a> by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lordstown was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/troubled-ev-company-lordstown-motors-gets-400m-lifeline-in-stock-sale-agreement/">thrown a life vest</a> earlier this summer, when investment firm Yorkville Advisors agreed to purchase up to $400 million of Lordstown’s shares. The company is “now exploring a variety of other financing options, including non-dilutive private strategic investments and debt,” interim CEO Angela Strand said during an investor call. The company is also still pursuing a loan with the U.S. Department of Energy, Long said during the call.</p>
<p>Although the company said it was still on track to begin production of the Endurance at the end of September, only “select early customers” will begin to receive vehicles in the first quarter of 2022, followed by commercial deliveries in the second quarter. Strand said this deployment plan is to allow fleet customers time to build out charging infrastructure and to manage supply chain challenges.</p>
<p>One thing that distinguishes the company from some of its competitors is its manufacturing plant — a 6.2 million square foot former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio. It’s now looking like the company is exploring different ways to turn a profit off this asset. Strand said “serious discussions” were underway with potential partners to use Lordstown’s facility to manufacture their products, suggesting the company is eager to find additional sources of revenue to offset its mounting expenses. &#8220;This is a critical strategic pivot for us, a decision that we believe will lead to significant new revenue opportunities for Lordstown,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>“We are exploring multiple partnership constructs,” she added. “That includes contract manufacturing, that includes licensing, in addition to producing our own vehicles,” she added.</p>
<p>The Lordstown executive team has not had a smooth summer. The company announced in June the resignations of both CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez, who were replaced in an interim capacity by Strand and Roof respectively. Lordstown was founded as an offshoot of Burns’ company Workhorse Group — the same company that said it had sold 11.9 million shares, or nearly three-quarters of its stake, since the beginning of July. The company is actively searching for a CEO and CFO, Strand said.</p>
<p>Lordstown was riding high in late 2020, when it announced its SPAC merger with a value of $1.6 billion. Its shares soared to $31.80 apiece at their 52-week highs. They’ve since plummeted to $5.94.</p>
<p>“We still plan to be first to market, particularly in the commercial fleet space,” Strand said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of its earnings call this week, Desktop Metal announced <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005852/en">plans to acquire ExOne</a>. The Pennsylvania-based firm creates a variety of different industrial 3D printers for industries like aerospace, automotive, medical and defense. More recently, we wrote about the company’s portable 3D printing factories, which are effectively mobile additive manufacturing stations built inside of shipping containers.</p>
<p>We wrote about ExOne back in February, when the company was granted $1.6 million from the DoD, in hopes of taking the systems out into the field. Each unit contains a 3D scanning station with computer and a variety of different ruggedized industrial machines, including a metal and ceramic printer, curing oven, fiber-reinforced plastic printer and a compression modeling station.</p>

<p>“Over the last two years, we’ve really focused on providing our technology into government-type applications: DoD, NASA, DoE,” ExOne’s CEO John Hartner told TechCrunch when that news broke. “Sometimes people talk about disrupting the supply chain and getting decentralized manufacturing. This is decentralized and forward-deployed, if you will. Be it an emergency, humanitarian mission or frontlines for a war fighter.”</p>
<p>Today’s transaction, which is valued at $575 million, finds Desktop Metal purchasing all of ExOne’s common stock.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to bring ExOne into the DM family to create the leading additive manufacturing portfolio for mass production,” Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop said in a release. “We believe this acquisition will provide customers with more choice as we leverage our complementary technologies and go-to-market efforts to drive continued growth. This transaction is a big step in delivering on our vision of accelerating the adoption of additive manufacturing 2.0.”</p>
<p>Desktop Metal has been actively pursuing acquisitions to grow out its 3D printing portfolio since it announced plans to go public via SPAC last August. In January, it acquired EnvisionTEC for $300 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are excited to join forces with Desktop Metal to deliver a more sustainable future through our shared vision of additive manufacturing at high production volumes,” Hartner said of today&#8217;s announcement. “We believe our complementary platforms will better serve customers, accelerate adoption of green technologies, and drive increased shareholder value. Most importantly, our technologies will help drive important innovations at meaningful production volumes that can improve the world.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I want to extend an offer to an engineer who has been working in the U.S. on an H-1B for almost five years. Her current employer is sponsoring her for an EB-2 green card, and our startup wants to hire her as a senior engineer. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens to her green card process? Can we take it over?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Recruiting in Richmond</strong></p>
<p>Dear Recruiting,</p>
<p>Congrats on finding the right candidate for your role. Your startup’s ability to take over the EB-2 green card process for this candidate — or whether you have to start the green card process from the beginning — depends on where she is in the green card process and whether the position you are offering is similar to her current role.</p>
<p>Take a listen to my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/083-understanding-ac21-portability-h-1b-extensions-and-the-180-day-rule/">podcast</a> in which my colleague, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/gilberto-orozco-jr/">Gilberto Orozco Jr.</a>, an associate attorney at my firm, and I discuss the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act — or AC21 &#8212; including “green card portability.”</p>
<p>Enacted in 2000, AC21 gives international talent in certain situations the flexibility to change jobs during the green card process and the ability to extend an H-1B visa beyond the six-year limit to avoid having to leave the United States while waiting for a green card. I recommend discussing your situation and goals with an experienced immigration attorney to determine your options.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100312 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?w=680" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>The process for EB-2 green cards</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, what happens to the green card process if your candidate changes jobs depends on where she is in the EB-2 green card process. There are two types of EB-2 green cards that have slightly different processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-green-card-advanced-degree/">EB-2 green card for advanced degree professionals</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) for persons of exceptional ability</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The EB-2 green card requires an employer sponsor and has a three-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent">PERM</a> (Program Electronic Review Management) labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor.</li>
<li>Submitting a green card petition (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-140">Form I-140</a>) to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for approval.</li>
<li>Getting USCIS approval after filing an adjustment of status to permanent residence application (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-485">Form I-485</a>), which can be filed along with Form I-140 depending on whether an EB-2 green card number is available based on the candidate’s country of birth, and being interviewed by a USCIS officer <em>or</em> obtaining a green card abroad through consular processing and the State Department.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Archer Aviation is seeking $1 billion in damages from Wisk Aero, according to court filings Tuesday, significantly escalating the ongoing legal battle between the two air taxi rivals.</p>
<p>Wisk “deployed a knowingly false extra-judicial smear campaign that projected stand-alone defamatory statements about Archer to the world,” the filing says. On this basis, Archer claims that this “smear campaign” has negatively impacted its ability to access capital and has impaired business relationships, resulting in damages “likely to exceed $1 billion.”</p>
<p>The two companies have been locked in a heated legal battle for much of this year. The dispute started in April, when Wisk filed a suit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that Archer had misappropriated its trade secrets related to Wisk’s debut eVTOL aircraft, Cora. Wisk further alleged that a former employee, Jing Xue, downloaded thousands of proprietary files from his work computer prior to joining Archer.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Archer has hit back against the accusations in court. First it filed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/archer-aviation-pushes-for-dismissal-of-wisk-trade-secret-suit/">motion to dismiss</a> the suit in early June, and later that month alleged in a separate court document that Archer’s design <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/archer-aviation-hits-back-against-rival-wisk-aeros-request-for-injunction-in-trade-secret-suit/">was well-established</a> prior to Wisk’s having filed any patents with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p>Archer unveiled a prototype of its Maker aircraft in February, the same month that it announced (to much fanfare) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">it was going public</a> via a merger with blank-check firm Atlas Crest Investment Corp. for a pro-forma enterprise value of $2.7 billion. Late last month Archer slashed its valuation by $1 billion in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824502/000110465921097282/tm218061d22_ex99-1.htm">“strategic reset”</a> of the transaction terms with the SPAC. While this is the same amount Archer is seeking in damages, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that is just coincidental.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the spokesperson added that the planned merger remains on track. Speaking to the suit, they said, &#8220;We have no plans to drop our counter-claim regardless of any moves Wisk may make.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Wisk spokesperson said “Archer’s counterclaim is ludicrous and its troubles are purely self-inflicted,” and characterized the filing as “full of distortions and distractions from the serious patent and trade secret misappropriation claims it faces.” The spokesperson added that Wisk intends to continue its case against Archer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Full-size pickup trucks are the meat of the U.S. automotive business; it&#8217;s a red-hot category with the Ford F-150 leading the pack in sales and the Chevrolet Silverado and Ram pickups fast followers.</p>
<p>But the air is thin at the top. What&#8217;s often lost in truck coverage is how fiercely automakers compete to woo discerning customers with packaged bundles of optional and standard features. And now, more than ever, those packaged bundles rely heavily on in-car tech.</p>
<p>Ford, as the top seller, must add bells and whistles without alienating its most discerning clientele. The 2021 F-150 &#8212; as I was reminded during a recent test drive &#8212; epitomizes this effort and hints at what is to come with the upcoming all-electric Lightning pickup truck.</p>
<p>I tested the 2021 4&#215;4 SuperCrew Lariat equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 PowerBoost Full Hybrid engine in its native suburban Detroit, 20 miles from where it was developed and manufactured.</p>
<p>Getting the details right on pickup trucks is an art of custom packaging for car companies. It&#8217;s one of the reasons that options packages are dizzying; the F-150 I tested was no exception. The F-150 offers six different powertrains, three bed lengths and three cab options, and then there&#8217;s eight trim levels, two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive options.</p>
<p>This options-heavy strategy has paid off for automakers like Ford. However, as these companies add more tech and software, there is a risk of causing confusion among its most loyal customers.</p>

<p>What sets the F-150 apart from other vehicles in its lineup is how much functional tech matters to its core customers. On the new model I tested, a 12-inch display that houses the standard Sync4 infotainment system is the center of the dashboard &#8212; and the customer experience.</p>
<p>Sync4 was introduced on the Mustang Mach-E and on the new Ford Bronco. Sync has been steadily improving for a simpler user experience since its 2007 introduction. Sync4 doubles computational power and introduced over-the-air software updates.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/inrix-expands-its-digital-rule-book-beyond-self-driving-cars-to-help-cities-with-scooters-bikes-and-delivery-bots/">system sources data</a> from INRIX on traffic, construction (always in a Michigan summer), weather and parking space availability from data in 20,000 cities and 150 countries.</p>
<p>Natural language processing used in the system provided more accurate responses to my voice-based queries and incoming SMS messages. One caveat worth noting: It was difficult to judge the machine learning algorithm because my test vehicle had been used by multiple drivers in recent weeks.</p>
<p>For infotainment, I generally defer to Apple CarPlay, which along with Android Auto, is easy to call up, because it connects wirelessly in the F-150 and minimizes distracted driving. Ever since they debuted in production vehicles &#8212; 2014 for CarPlay and 2015 for Android Auto &#8212; it seemed inevitable that Apple and Google were going to dominate the middleware infotainment system game.</p>
<p>Sync also tees up supported apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-bets-on-google-cloud-for-its-digital-transformation/">Waze and Ford+Alexa</a>.</p>
<h2>Driving tech</h2>
<p>Driving a full-size truck for the first time can be intimidating, and Ford uses camera tech to make the big rig easier to maneuver. The split screen helps a timid driver feel confident navigating through tight spaces.</p>
<p>Five onboard cameras act as guides that assist with steering and parking. The vivid graphics incorporated into the 360-degree view from above helps to establish bearings where mirrors won&#8217;t suffice.</p>
<p>Behind the steering wheel is a 12-inch digital cluster. There&#8217;s part of me that misses the old-fashioned gauges of a classic pickup, but that&#8217;s not the direction Ford is heading. Ford is striving for future-forward vibes, encapsulated by Mustang Mach-E&#8217;s Apple-design-inspired aesthetic.</p>
<p>Through its in-car design, Ford is trying to make the case it&#8217;s a tech company first, and a 120-year-old automaker second. These earnest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/experts-from-ford-toyota-and-hyundai-outline-why-automakers-are-pouring-money-into-robotics/">aesthetic cues</a> may be a bit too on the nose as products age over time.</p>
<p>Ford is due to introduce Blue Cruise, an advanced driver assistance system it once called Active Drive Assist, on vehicles later this year by an automatic software update, which was not yet active on the model I drove in June, though the hardware was included.</p>
<p>The company claims the system allows for hands-free driving in zones that span 100,000 miles of North American road and will be standard on the F-150 Limited vehicles in the Ford Co-Pilot360 Active 2.0 Prep Package. It will be sold as an option on Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum models. The system uses a driver-facing camera to track eye gaze and head position to monitor concentration as an answer to GM&#8217;s Super Cruise.</p>
<h2>The doodads that matter most</h2>

<p>Under the foot-long screen are the old-school knobs and switches that show Ford knows its customers still favor a manual cue here and there. Below that is a shift lever that folds down and flat into a 15-inch workstation, which I used for some in-car laptop time.</p>
<p>There are ample charging stations and wireless charging throughout the cabin. While the F-150 interior is spacious, every inch of real estate is carefully thought through. Seats fold to 180-degrees for proper roadside naps or to add extra cargo space.</p>
<p>The dark grey leather seats felt more utilitarian than luxurious, especially for a fully loaded vehicle. (Crosstown competitor Ram tends to outdo Ford on driving joy and interior design aesthetics.) The exterior and interior design emphasizes functionality, pure and simple. I hauled two kayaks in the back and found thoughtful hooks to connect to my bungee cords in the truck bed.</p>
<p>A bevy of 240-volt outlets are in the rear of the truck bed and two more are onboard in the cabin. The truck bed also has a convenient ruler built in on the tailgate with both metric and imperial calculations. A 2.4 kilowatt generator is standard on the hybrid model, while the optional 7.2 kW generator functions for 32 hours on a full tank of gas.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t test out the F-150&#8217;s towing capacity, but for truck folks these numbers are essential. It has a payload of 2,120 pounds and can tow up 12,700 pounds (those numbers vary a bit depending on bed length and drivetrain). It also offers a backup towing assist function, which helps align the connection to a trailer. The model I drove was priced at $68,095, a significant leap from the $50,980 base price. In contrast, Ford produces an even higher-end F-150 trim called the Limited, which starts at $73,000.</p>
<h2>Function in form</h2>
<p>Before it goes all electric, the hybrid powertrain gives Ford a much needed boost to compete with Ram and Chevrolet, which already sell hybrid variants. The hybrid option is a logical compromise for customers who aren&#8217;t ready for the full Lightning EV that will go on sale in 2022, a launch that&#8217;s already generated buzz and 120,000 pre-orders. I clocked about 24 miles per gallon, an improvement over all-gasoline and best in its class for non-diesel. It&#8217;s still not enough to get Ford anywhere close to a stellar emissions report card, which is why the Lightning matters so much.</p>

<p>In order to court new EV customers, Ford must appease its current buyers who buy all those trucks we see on the road today. There&#8217;s two kinds of pickup truck customers: Those who rely on the functionality for their daily vocation or the weekend warriors and those who seek out the capability in case they might need it in a disaster scenario. The truck that I drove does the job of appealing to both.</p>
<p>The F-150 has always been suited to buyers who use it for home improvement projects, outdoorsy hobbies and towing. Pickup trucks also support laborers that require a rugged, functional vehicle. When Ford introduces anything new to this model, it creates hype and high stakes on how these customers feel about tweaks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188759" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_Lariat_Black.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188759" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2188759 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_Lariat_Black.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1048" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_Lariat_Black.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_Lariat_Black.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_Lariat_Black.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_Lariat_Black.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_Lariat_Black.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_Lariat_Black.jpg?resize=1536,805 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_Lariat_Black.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2188759" class="wp-caption-text">2021 F-150 Lariat interior in black. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford Motor Company</p></div></p>
<p>The buyer who seeks security came to mind while I had the F-150 on loan in late June, which is why I&#8217;ve saved the part about how it drives for last. My test drive period coincided with a summer storm that pummeled Michigan and shut down major highways and left vehicles stranded for days.</p>
<p>Before the storm, I zoomed around town, adjusting to the big loose steering and wide turns and the rhythm of stillness that occurs as the hybrid engine regenerates.</p>
<p>Once the storm came, I eased off the throttle and into a steady and sure pace, hands at 10 and two. Passenger cars and lesser capable crossover SUVs floated by me in two feet of water on the Lodge Freeway. The F-150 plowed through the muck, unbothered. I didn&#8217;t experience any skidding or stalling, in contrast to one friend who was forced to walk home because her Uber driver got stuck. The F-150 feels like a test case for a survivalist in an environmental catastrophe. The backup generator is the added security blanket.</p>
<p>Full-size trucks have an innate quality to make a driver feel invincible, which at the end of day is why people love their F-150s, and why the company has gotten so much mileage off that &#8220;Ford tough&#8221; tagline. It&#8217;s a delicate balance, keeping an unfussy truck at a price point that delivers power, substance and peace of mind.</p>

<p>Several inputs inform market timing: The skew of consumer preferences in response to a pandemic. The price of goods for a resource that is finite and becoming scarce. The creation of a novel algorithmic or genetic technique that enlarges the potential of what can be streamlined, repaired and built.</p>
<p>But market timing is also defined by a less discussed area that is born not in capital markets but in the public sector  —  the regulatory landscape  —  namely, the decisions of government, the broader legal system and its combined level of scrutiny toward a particular subject.</p>

<p>We can understand the successes and challenges of several valuable companies today based on their combustion with the regulatory landscape, and perhaps also use it as an optic to see what areas represent unique opportunities for new companies to start and scale.</p>
<h2>Looking back: The value in regulatory gray areas</h2>
<p>“The tech comes in and moves faster than regulatory regimes do, or can control it,” Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick said at The Aspen Institute in 2013.</p>
<p>The brash statement downplayed that the regulatory landscape had, in fact, driven a number of pivotal outcomes for the company up to that event. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/24/ubercab-ordered-to-cease-and-desist/">changed its name</a> from UberCab to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist order in its first market, California. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/7/3300244/uber-taxi-new-york-travis-kalanick-rogue">Several early employees left</a> because of the startup’s regulatory challenges and iconoclastic ethos. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/16/3451108/uber-taxi-pulls-out-new-york-tlc">shut down</a> its taxi service in New York after just a month of operations, and then in early 2013 received its lifeline in the city after being approved through a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4271490/uber-becomes-first-taxi-app-to-get-approved-in-new-york-city">pilot program</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present, and Uber has a market cap of about $82 billion, with the ousted Kalanick having a personal net worth in the neighborhood of $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>Still, even at its scale, many of its most important questions on growth centered around how favorably the regulatory landscape would treat its category. Most recently, this came with the U.K. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html#:~:text=Uber%20now%20treats%20all%2070%2C000,were%20workers%2C%20not%20independent%20contractors.">ruling</a> that Uber drivers could not be classified as independent contractors.</p>
<p>The regulatory fabric has had similar leverage over other sharing-economy companies. In October 2014, for example, Airbnb’s business model became viable in San Francisco when Mayor Ed Lee <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/10/27/mayor-lee-approves-short-term-rentals-in-san-francisco-homeaway-vbro-renting-housing-tech-cost-of-living-affordable-hotel-tax/">legalized</a> short-term rentals. In November 2015, Proposition F in the city aimed to restrict short-term rentals like Airbnb, and the startup spent millions in advertisements to mobilize voters in opposition.</p>
<p>Airbnb’s current market cap stands at $92 billion, and its CEO, Brian Chesky, has an estimated net worth over $11 billion. Like Uber, its regulatory tribulations continue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paris-court-fines-airbnb-9-6-million-for-illegal-listings/">most recently being fined</a> and judged to owe $9.6 million to the city of Paris.</p>
<p>The stories of these two companies and others in the sharing economy space demonstrate the value that the regulatory fabric can add or subtract from a company’s wealth, but also underscore the value  —  for founding teams, early employees, investors and customers  —  of navigating the gray areas.</p>
<h2>Looking around: The data economy</h2>
<p>The present regulatory fabric has precipitated market timing for ideas in a number of categories. Solutions that enable data privacy, like <a href="https://bigid.com/">BigID</a>, and ones that embed data privacy into larger customer value propositions, like <a href="https://blotout.io/">Blotout</a>, are on streamlined growth tailwinds from the GDPR in Europe and their inspired analogs in the U.S.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a year of <a href="https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81">editorial pivots</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">employee exits</a>, Medium announced today that it will make significant changes to its <a href="https://medium.com/earn">Medium Partner Program</a>, which allows writers on the platform to monetize their content.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Medium <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/medium-opens-up-its-partner-program-allowing-anyone-to-publish-behind-its-paywall/">launched</a> its Partner Program in 2017. Since then, the platform has paid out $28 million to over <a href="https://digiday.com/media/exclusive-medium-will-begin-offering-writers-a-50-cut-of-the-subscriber-revenue-their-content-generates/">200,000 contributors</a>. Initially, it offered payouts based on how much time Medium members spent reading a writer&#8217;s content. For $5 per month or $50 per year, Medium members could read all posts on the platform without hitting a paywall. Plus, part of each member&#8217;s subscription was split among the writers they read; so, if a Medium member spent 10% of their time reading one writer&#8217;s work, for example, that writer would get 10% of the subscriber&#8217;s revenue share.</p>
<p>Medium said that earnings based on read time will remain the same. But now, Medium will offer a new way to make money with the launch of a referral program.</p>
<p>Previously, if a reader converted to a paying member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210401002027/https://medium.com/earn">within 30 days</a> of reading a writer&#8217;s story, that writer would get credit for the amount of time the reader spent reading their work. Under the <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">new model</a>, Partner Program writers will now have a personalized referral landing page &#8212; for any reader who purchases a Medium subscription via their page, the writer will get half of that member&#8217;s subscription fee for as long as they remain a paying member, minus the standard 2.9% + $0.30 in payment processing fees. So, if a writer got 100 readers to sign up for a monthly Medium membership through their referral, that would net the writer $227 per month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188675" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188675" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188675" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=300,259 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=768,663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=680,587 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188675" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405927192215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>However, now it&#8217;s more difficult for a writer to join the Partner Program &#8212; writers must have 100 followers, at least one published Medium story, and they must live within <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187">specific geographic regions</a>. Even if a Partner meets the new eligibility requirements, they might lose their status if they don&#8217;t publish anything new in a <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">six-month period</a>. Still, under the previous structure, just becoming a Partner didn&#8217;t guarantee financial rewards &#8212; some Partners with smaller followings would make <a href="https://medium.com/menlo-office/writing-stories-on-medium-for-pennies-a5eec97dbeb7">pennies</a> each month. Existing Partners will retain their status through the end of 2021, and if they haven&#8217;t reached 100 followers by then, they will be removed.</p>
<p>Also, Medium will soon institute a <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">minimum payout threshold</a> of $10, meaning that if a writer makes less than $10 in a month, that pay will roll over to the next month until they amass at least $10.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Medium has been reticent about its member numbers in the past, but CEO Ev Williams told TechCrunch in November that its member numbers were in the &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/talking-techs-exodus-twitters-new-labels-and-mediums-future-with-founder-ev-williams/">high hundreds of thousands</a>.&#8221; In March 2021, Medium had <a href="https://www.axios.com/medium-subscribers-buyout-ev-williams-88549883-dd36-4bb6-88cf-089cf174648d.html?stream=technology&amp;utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=alerts_technology">725,000 members</a> per Axios, but <a href="https://digiday.com/media/medium-eyes-media-partnerships-pursuit-1-million-subscribers/">Digiday previously reported</a> that Medium had hoped to reach 1 million members by 2020. As of September, its competitor Substack, founded in 2017, had <a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-spurs-journalists-to-go-it-alone-via-email-613ca2d5-e8d5-4235-9582-48cc028e9d8b.html">250,000 paid subscribers</a> and raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">$65 million series B round</a> two months later.

<p>Platforms like Substack and the newer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/ghost-cms-adds-open-source-subscription-and-membership-options/">Ghost</a> pay writers based on how many paying subscribers they have. Medium&#8217;s new revenue sharing model similarly incentivizes writers to corral readers to the platform, but Medium takes about 50%. For direct subscriptions to a writer&#8217;s individual newsletter, Substack <a href="https://substack.com/going-paid">takes 10%</a>, and Ghost takes <a href="https://ghost.org/vs/substack/">$9 per month</a>. While Substack or Ghost readers might subscribe to multiple individual newsletters, Medium subscribers pay just one $5 monthly or $50 yearly fee to access all of the website&#8217;s content.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The newsletter business is competitive &#8212; in June, Facebook launched a newsletter platform called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin</a> with hand-picked contributors, and Twitter acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a> earlier this year.

Similar to Medium, Quora+ subscribers get access to all content any writer chooses to put behind a paywall, and writers are paid based on engagement with their content. But writers can also write paywalled posts on <a href="https://quorablog.quora.com/Introducing-Spaces">Spaces</a>, which are like user-created publications on Quora &#8212; Quora takes a 5% cut of those payments.</span></p>

<p>Did you hear it? FEMA just ran its first nationwide test of the U.S. emergency alert system since the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, tested both the Emergency Alert System (EAS), which broadcasts an emergency tone and message on televisions and radios, and the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), a newer system that sends emergency notifications to smartphones. This was the second nationwide test of the WEA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/fema-is-about-to-send-a-presidential-alert-to-millions-of-u-s-phones/">after its debut in 2018</a>, and the first test for all U.S. cell phones of users who chose to opt-in to receive test alerts.</p>
<p>The test began around 2:20 p.m. ET. If you opted-in to the test, you likely got a message on your phone that said: &#8220;THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.&#8221; (The FCC explains <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/weatest_opt-in_instructions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to opt-in</a> to test alerts.)</p>
<p>For the first time, the WEA test sent the same test message in Spanish to phones that have Spanish set as the default language.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188804" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188804" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188804" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg" alt="" width="650" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=768,536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188804" class="wp-caption-text">This is what the test WEA emergency alert looks like. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/waEMD/status/1425523462613856261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WA Emergency Management <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/fema-national-emergency-test/">last nationwide test</a> in 2019, FEMA <a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public/wireless-emergency-alerts#enhancements">said it has improved</a> WEA to send longer, detailed messages to the majority of phones that support it. The update also allows authorities to include tappable links, like web addresses.</p>
<p>FEMA runs these tests every year or two to ensure the system is working properly. It&#8217;s no small task: A national emergency alert system designed to broadcast the same message to potentially hundreds of millions of people at any given time is fraught with technological hurdles that require close co-operation from the cell carriers and broadcast networks.</p>
<p>The EAS system has been around since the late 1990s, but WEA was developed more recently as more Americans rely on their phones. WEA alerts, like EAS alerts, are designed to be sent by local and state authorities for public safety alerts, missing children and imminent threats, such as severe weather. More recently, FEMA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/fema-is-about-to-send-a-presidential-alert-to-millions-of-u-s-phones/">rolled out &#8220;presidential alerts,&#8221;</a> which are supposed to be sent to every phone in the U.S. in the event of a national emergency. Presidential alerts, unlike other alerts, can be issued by the sitting president for any reason, and Americans cannot opt out.</p>
<p>WEA broadcasts emergency notifications through the cell towers of an affected area — such as an area about to be hit by a storm — rather than sending tens of millions of text messages, which would grind the cell networks to a halt. The alerts are created by local, state or federal authorities and are authenticated by FEMA through the Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System, or IPAWS, and then passed to cell carriers to deliver the emergency alert.</p>
<p>The emergency alert system, though, is far from perfect. In 2018, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/13/inexcusable-false-ballistic-missile-alert-in-hawaii-was-caused-by-human-error/">erroneous alert</a> sent to Hawaii residents warned of an imminent ballistic missile threat,&#8221; and that &#8220;this is not a drill.&#8221; Minutes later, the alert was canceled. The false warning came as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea were at an all-time high, during which Pyongyang was regularly test-firing rockets used for its nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>Security experts have also long warned that the EAS systems pose security risks. Last year, researchers found <a href="https://securityledger.com/2020/01/seven-years-later-scores-of-eas-systems-sit-un-patched-vulnerable/">dozens of internet-connected, special-purpose servers</a> used by television and radio stations to interrupt their broadcasts to relay an emergency alert, which they said could allow a hacker to break in and compromise the servers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Orbital manufacturing startup Varda Space Industries is moving fast. Only a few weeks after announcing a $42 million Series A, Varda has signed a deal with launch company Rocket Lab for three Photon spacecraft to support the startup’s initial missions.</p>
<p>The first spacecraft will be delivered in the first quarter of 2023, with the second to follow later that year and the third in 2024. It’s an aggressive schedule for the eight-month-old Varda and would mark the company’s first three manufacturing missions to space. The contract includes an option for Varda to purchase a fourth Photon.</p>
<p>Partnering with a more established company makes sense &#8212; especially considering the Photon’s bona fides, which includes a NASA-funded mission to the moon at the end of the year. Rocket Lab was also awarded a subcontract by the University of California Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory to design two Photon spacecraft for a one-year mission to Mars.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2039801" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2039801" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2039801" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/photon-lab.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="580" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/photon-lab.jpg 1662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/photon-lab.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/photon-lab.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/photon-lab.jpg?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/photon-lab.jpg?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/photon-lab.jpg?resize=1536,871 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/photon-lab.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2039801" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.rocketlabusa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocket Lab <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Varda, which was founded by SpaceX veteran Will Bruey and Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov, is banking big on a manufacturing condition that you can only find in space: microgravity. They think that the potential market for bioprinted organs, specialized semiconductors, fiber-optic cables or pharmaceuticals &#8212; products that you can’t make in Earthbound-conditions &#8212; is high enough to make the costs of building a spacecraft and launching to space more than worth it.</p>

<p>Under this most recent deal, each Photon will be outfitted with two Varda-made modules: The first will be a microgravity manufacturing module, where the space production will actually take place, and the second will be a reentry capsule designed to bring those finished products back to Earth. Asparouhov told TechCrunch that the are designing the reentry modules to bring back “on the order of 40-60 kilograms of materials” for the first couple of missions, with the aim of quickly scaling up for subsequent launches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Varda says this approach is low-risk and incremental. “That’s why we&#8217;re seeing so much interest from the investment community, [the Department of Defense], NASA, et cetera, it’s this very pragmatic, one-step-at-a-time approach,” Asparouhov said. “We’ll prove this first space factory. And yes, as we start to scale it allows us to send a larger space factory and then eventually, yes, we might have something the size of the [International Space Station], 10 times the size of the ISS. But that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re starting with. We&#8217;re starting with a very small, near-term pragmatic approach.”</p>
<p>Each mission will last roughly three months from launch to landing, Rocket Lab said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterdesign/status/1425505308563099650?s=21">introducing</a> a revamped version of its website, which the company says will make the site more accessible, less cluttered and easier to use. Among the changes, which are also rolling out to iOS and Android, is the implementation of Twitter&#8217;s new font, &#8220;Chirp,&#8221; and changes to various elements that will make them more high-contrast, among other things. Soon, Twitter will roll out<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/role/role-a-new-kind-of-platform-for-the-rpg-community"> new color palettes</a> as well.</p>
<p>Chirp was first introduced in January as Twitter&#8217;s first proprietary typeface. In the past, the company had relied on fonts like SF Pro, Roboto and Helvetica Neue for its brand. The goal with Chirp &#8212; beyond giving Twitter its own form of visual expression &#8212; was to offer a typeface that&#8217;s sharp and legible for everyday use, but also one that would allow for more personality, including when put into motion or used for brand advertising.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want to give a bit more depth to Chirp, our new typeface.</p>
<p>Type, in 280 character doses, is the foundation of Twitter. In the history of the company we’ve either relied on someone else’s typeface, from SF Pro and Roboto, to Helvetica Neue in our brand. <a href="https://t.co/OrvlYsxF9g">pic.twitter.com/OrvlYsxF9g</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Derrit DeRouen (@DerritDeRouen) <a href="https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548649561186306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At the time of its debut, however, Twitter had not yet committed to making Chirp the typeface for its wider product, though the creative director for Twitter&#8217;s global brand, Derrit DeRouen, said it was his &#8220;personal desire&#8221; to do so.</p>
<p>Today, Twitter is making Chirp a core part of the new Twitter website, as well as iOS and Android devices, including mobile web.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also making all Western-language text align left, which the company says will make it easier to read as you scroll. (Non-Western text is unchanged.)</p>
<p>The colors on Twitter.com have been updated to be more high-contrast, too, as have the buttons. One notable change is that there&#8217;s a lot less of Twitter&#8217;s blue on the site. For example, the tweets and the navigation have now shifted to black when using the default Twitter theme with the white background. And the changes to buttons &#8212; like Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;Follow&#8221; buttons, for instance &#8212; are aimed at making the most important actions stand out, notes Twitter.</p>
<p>These tweaks may seem minor for now, but they could become more important as Twitter rolls out its expanded feature set &#8212; like the Super Follow and other features &#8212; as they give the company a way to emphasize particular actions it wanted the user to take.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9ai5rdoUTH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Twitter Spaces will be available for the web, including accessibility features</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter Spaces will be available for the web, including accessibility features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/embed/#?secret=9ai5rdoUTH" data-secret="9ai5rdoUTH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The redesign has removed some of the visual clutter on the screen, too, like what Twitter refers to as &#8220;unnecessary divider lines.&#8221; There are fewer gray backgrounds, as well as increased space to make text easier to read.</p>
<p>The changes prepare Twitter to make room for a different type of online experience that goes beyond just sharing text-based posts with the occasional photo or other media attached.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Super Follow</a>, Twitter is aiming to bring more creators onto the platform, and the company is also rolling out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/twitter-launches-u-s-e-commerce-pilot-that-lets-users-shop-from-profiles/">e-commerce shopping features</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/twitter-blue-a-3-monthly-subscription-service-could-be-coming-soon/">subscription service</a> for power users, live audio with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Spaces</a>, redesigned bookmark collections and more.</p>
<p>But adding features could lead to a more confusing experience, particularly for newcomers, as the new options could begin to crowd the screen. That&#8217;s why it makes sense that Twitter is redesigning its website now. However, whether Twitter users will appreciate the update remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The company says today&#8217;s changes are just the start of more visual updates to come, though it didn&#8217;t hint at what those future tweaks may include. It only noted that it would roll out more color palettes &#8220;soon.&#8221; This update will be about closely aligning palettes with Twitter&#8217;s updated brand look, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p><em>Updated 8/11/21, 4:30 PM ET to clarify changes extend to mobile and better explain plans for color palettes. </em></p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The technology industry is often thought of as being the domain of the young and the new. We see an emphasis on young founders (“40 Under 40”), innovative ideas and disruptive challenges to legacy brands, incumbent companies and “old” ways of thinking.</p>
<p>But one of the things I’ve learned on my journey in co-founding my latest startup is that technology should be enabling and accessible to all, and nowhere is this more critical than for empowering our older adults.</p>
<p>Older adults are one of the most underrepresented audiences for new technology products and platforms. There is a massive opportunity to provide products and services that will make life better for today’s seniors and future generations of older adults to come. Founders in every space, from edtech to healthcare, from financial services to robotics, can make a bigger impact if we recognize the opportunity of being of service to older adults.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			One of the best strategies for tech companies that want to serve the older adult market is to focus your value proposition on empowering older adults.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Don’t make a product &#8220;for old people&#8221;</h2>
<p>Older adults often get overlooked by tech companies. In fairness, it can be hard (and insensitive and uninspiring) to market products and services as being “for old people,” because people in this group don’t tend to think of themselves as “old.”</p>
<p>One of the best strategies for tech companies that want to serve the older adult market is to focus your value proposition on empowering older adults. Don’t make a product “for old people” &#8212; make a product that helps older adults lead a healthier, more active, more connected life.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the education tech space, financial services, health tech, consumer products or other innovative digital services for seniors, tech companies have big opportunities to empower older adults.</p>
<p>We are seeing some great examples, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://agebold.com/">AgeBold</a> is doing interesting work with at-home exercise programs for older adults to improve their balance, strength and mobility. The value proposition: Exercise for better aging. It’s a product “for” older adults, but the message is focused on empowerment and building strength, helping people live healthier, more active lives as they age.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eldera.ai/">Eldera.ai</a> connects children with vetted older adult mentors, for one-on-one or group conversations and remote learning activities. This concept is powerful because it helps older adults share their life experience and build relationships with other families.</li>
</ul>
<p>Older adults have so much to offer. Instead of approaching this market as a “problem” to be solved, startups should engage with older adults as an active, curious, ready-to-learn group of people who are eager to be empowered.</p>
<h2>Recognize the size of the opportunity of the older adult market</h2>
<p>It often seems like so many consumer-facing apps today are created for younger people. But there’s a big disconnect between where so much of the tech industry’s attention and investment is going and the spending power and lifestyle preferences of today’s older adults.</p>
<p>Older adults are the most underserved demographic for the tech world. They’re also one of the fastest-growing age cohorts. The number of people worldwide who are 65 and older is <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2017-06/global_health_aging.pdf">expected to grow</a> from 524 million in 2010 to 1.5 billion in 2050.</p>
<p>The “silver economy,” driven by the spending power of older adults, is <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2021/01/14/the-silver-economy-is-coming-of-age-a-look-at-the-growing-spending-power-of-seniors/">expected to grow into the 2030s</a> because the senior population is the wealthiest age group and their numbers are growing 3.2% per year (compared with 0.8% for the overall population).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has now taken another step toward the public release of the latest version of the Android operating system, Android 12. The company today released the fourth beta of Android 12, whose most notable new feature is that it has achieved the <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/overview#timeline">Platform Stability</a> milestone &#8212; meaning the changes impacting Android app developers are now finalized, allowing them to test their apps without worrying about breaking changes in subsequent releases.</p>
<p>While the updated version of Android brings a number of new <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features">capabilities</a> for developers to tap into, Google urges its developers to first focus on releasing an Android-12-compatible update. If users find their app doesn&#8217;t work properly when they upgrade to the new version of Android, they may stop using the app entirely or even uninstall it, the company warns.</p>
<p>Among the flagship consumer-facing features in Android 12 is the new and more adaptive design system called &#8220;<a href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you">Material You</a>,&#8221; which lets users apply themes that span across the OS to personalize their Android experience. It also brings new privacy tools, like microphone and camera <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#mic-camera-indicators">indicators</a> that show if an app is using those features, as well as a <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#clipboard-access-notifications">clipboard read notification</a>, similar to iOS, which alerts to apps that read the user&#8217;s clipboard history. In addition, Android 12 lets users play games as soon as they download them, through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/android-12-will-let-you-play-games-before-they-finish-downloading/">a Google Play Instant feature.</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">Other key Android features and tools</a>, like Quick Settings, Google Pay, Home Controls and Android widgets, among others, have been improved, too.</p>
<p>Google has continued to roll out smaller consumer-facing updates in previous Android 12 beta releases, but beta 4 is focused on developers getting their apps ready for the public release of Android, which is expected in the fall.</p>

<p>The company suggested developers look out for changes that include the new <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features#privacy-dashboard">Privacy Dashboard in Settings</a>, which lets users see which apps are accessing what type of data and when, and other privacy features like the indicator lights for the mic and camera, clipboard read tools, and new <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#mic-camera-toggles">toggles</a> that lets users turn off mic and camera access across all apps.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/overscroll">new &#8220;stretch&#8221; overscroll effect</a> that replace the older &#8220;glow&#8221; overscroll effect systemwide, new <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/splash-screen">splash screen animations</a> for apps and <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#bouncy-castle">keygen changes</a> to be aware of. And there are a number of SDKs and libraries that developers use that will need to be tested for compatibility, including those from Google and third parties.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new Android 12 beta 4 release is available on <a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">supported</a> Pixel devices, and on devices from <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices">select</a> partners including ASUS, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp and ZTE.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If there&#8217;s one thing that the ongoing COVID-19 crisis has proven, it&#8217;s that the healthcare system in the U.S. is in drastic need of major transformation. One of the biggest issues to be highlighted by the pandemic in particular is the iniquity in access to care, but there are signs that one of the effects of COVID-19 will be a stepping up of accessibility reform driven in particular by technology.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt 2021</a>, we&#8217;re thrilled to have three guests onstage for a panel discussion all about how tech companies are working to address access gaps in healthcare. From Cityblock Health, we&#8217;ll host co-founder and Chief Health Officer Toyin Ajayi; from Carbon Health, co-founder and CEO Eren Bali; and from Forward, CEO and co-founder Adrian Aoun.</p>
<p>Cityblock Health is the first tech-driven provider for communities with complex health and social needs &#8212; bringing better care to neighborhoods where it’s needed most. Cityblock&#8217;s goal is to foster a model of care that meets individuals where they are, delivering highly personalized primary care, behavioral healthcare and social services to its members, with a focus on those who access Medicaid, are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, and others living in lower-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Carbon Health has a goal of making good healthcare accessible to all, with same-day appointment booking, telehealth services and prescription delivery, facilitated through partnerships with some of the leading insurers and payers in the U.S. The company has taken a central role in vaccine administration in California, and continues to evolve its model of modular healthcare delivery to reach communities where primary care hasn&#8217;t traditionally been readily available.</p>
<p>Forward is an AI-based healthcare system combining world-class private doctors with new technology to enable proactive, data-driven primary care. Starting with cutting edge in-clinic and at-home biometric data measurement, Forward aims to tailor its primary care to individuals in a combination that delivers both scalability and personalization. The company also espouses a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based model of care that it argues avoids some of the traditional pitfalls of insurance-backed care.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to be able to dig in to these very different approaches to healthcare, that still all share the fundamental goal of making a higher-quality standard of care available to more people.</p>
<p>During the three-day event, writer, director, actor and Houseplant co-founder Seth Rogen will be joined by Houseplant Chief Commercial Officer Haneen Davies and co-founder and CEO Michael Mohr to talk about the business of weed, BioNTech co-founder and CEO Uğur Şahin will dive into what&#8217;s next for mRNA technologies after COVID, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong will dig into the volatile world of cryptocurrency and his company’s massive direct listing earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Too busy to tune in? Still asleep when it all went down? Here&#8217;s the slimmed-down version of everything you need to know.</p>
<h2>Galaxy Watch 4</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2188130" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188130" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188130" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188130" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Samsung is back with another set of smartwatches, this time with a twist: After years of focusing on their own operating system with Tizen, these latest watches are back on Google&#8217;s Wear OS. Or, at least, Samsung&#8217;s take on it — this software build will be called &#8220;Wear OS Powered by Samsung&#8221;, and will borrow some of the best bits of Tizen while being Wear OS at its core.</p>
<p>Samsung went deep on health metrics this time around, focusing much of the announcement on the Watch&#8217;s ability to constantly monitor things like blood pressure, blood oxygen and body composition.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s watch comes in two forms: Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The standard Watch 4 is a bit thinner and lighter, with a touch-sensitive bezel for controlling the interface; Watch 4 Classic bulks things up a bit, with a bezel that physically spins. Watch 4 starts at $250 and comes in 40mm or 44mm, while Watch 4 Classic bumps the base price to $350 and comes in 42mm or 46mm.</p>

<p>Pricey and with plenty of problems to work out of the earliest versions, folding smartphones haven&#8217;t exactly taken over the world. Hell, most people probably still haven&#8217;t seen a folding phone in person. But Samsung isn&#8217;t done in this space just yet!</p>
<p>This morning the company announced the Galaxy Z Fold 3, its third iteration on the hotdog-style folding phone approach. They&#8217;ve managed to drop the price tag a bit (from $2,000 to $1,800), while bumping up the overall build quality — it has a stronger aluminum frame, a more durable folding display and it&#8217;s waterproofed (a first for the Samsung foldables!) up to an IPX8 rating. (One catch: That &#8220;x&#8221; means it&#8217;ll survive an accidental dunk in the tub, but you still want to keep it away from dust/debris.)</p>
<p>The Fold 3 will be the first Samsung device with an under-display camera — an awesome trick, albeit one that generally comes at the expense of picture quality. The back of the device brings in three more (more standard, less hidden) lenses — ultra wide, wide-angle and telephoto, all coming in at 12 megapixels each. Oh, and it supports the S Pen stylus now!</p>
<p>Expect this one to start shipping on the 26th of this month.</p>

<h2>Galaxy Z Flip 3</h2>

<p>While the flagship Fold 3 took up most of the folding spotlight today, Samsung&#8217;s relatively entry-level (clamshell!) foldable gets an update too with the announcement of the Galaxy Z Flip 3.</p>
<p>The Flip 3 will get many of the same durability improvements coming to the aforementioned Fold 3, including the improved aluminum body, more durable display and IPX8 water resistance. It&#8217;s got a 10MP selfie cam on the inside, with two 12MP cameras (ultra wide and wide Angle) on the outside. At $999 — nearly $400 less than the last one — it&#8217;s the first time Samsung has managed to drag its foldable line into the sub-$1K price range. It&#8217;s got a bigger cover screen (the screen that shows whenever the device is folded shut) this time around, at 1.9&#8243; versus last-gen&#8217;s 1.1&#8243;.</p>

<h2>Less plastic!</h2>
<p>They kinda snuck this one in at the end, but it&#8217;s worth a highlight: Samsung is committing to eliminating all single-use plastic <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/phones-from-ocean-plastic-samsungs-plan-to-green-by-2025-will-apple-and-others-follow/">from its phone packaging by 2025</a>, with plans to dramatically increase its use of recycled material across its mobile products by the same year. Given that Samsung ships more phones per quarter than any other company on the planet, that&#8217;s huge — and, hopefully, an example others will follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck company Hyzon Motors said Wednesday it is ramping up operations in the wake of its merger with blank-check firm Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp., including shipping its first trucks to European customers.</p>
<p>The company, which reported second-quarter earnings Wednesday, said it is also preparing to start its first customer trials in the United States.</p>
<p>Like other transportation companies that have gone public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition fund, Hyzon doesn’t yet have any revenue to speak of. Instead, Hyzon is banking on the huge injection of capital from the transaction &#8212; more than $500 million &#8212; and growing customer orders to take it to positive cash flow.</p>
<p>As of now, the company reported a net loss for the quarter of $9.4 million, including $3.5 million in R&amp;D expenses. It had a negative adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 million. The company has $517 million in cash on hand, enough to reach free cash flow by 2024 without having to sell additional equity, Hyzon CFO Mark Gordon said during a second-quarter earnings call.</p>
<p>In addition to manufacturing hydrogen fuel cell powertrains, Hyzon is also investing in hydrogen fuel production hubs, a key piece of infrastructure for technology uptake. In April, the company signed an MOU for a joint venture with renewable fuels company Raven SR for up to 100 hydrogen production hubs. Gordon confirmed the first two will be in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>He also said that the company is on track to deliver 85 fuel cell vehicles by the end of this year, with the company’s first revenue coming next quarter. Orders and memoranda of understanding under contract has grown to $83 million from $55 million as of April, but many of the MOUs are non-binding. An agreement with Austrian grocer MRPEIS for 70 trucks next year is one such example. Similarly, Hyzon faces a slightly uphill battle in terms of technological adoption, as many of their customers have never seen or used a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Many customers are getting their hands on the first fuel cell vehicles they’ve ever seen in the next six to 12 months,” CEO Craig Knight said during the call. That is a genuine kind of technology validation process and the customers need to feel comfortable the vehicles function well in their use case.”</p>
<p>While many of Hyzon’s sales are for a small number of trucks, Knight said he sees the purchasing timeline from initial sale to fleet conversion growing shorter &#8212; at least in Europe, where there is significantly more hydrogen availability. “Whereas, earlier I would have said, it&#8217;s a 12-to-18 month process to go from getting your first fuel cell truck and trying it out and then maybe getting a few more and figuring out what fleet conversion would look like over time, and then kicking off that fleet conversion process &#8212; I actually think that&#8217;s compressing,” Knight said.</p>
<p>The company is focused mostly on back-to-base operations rather than long-haul freight haulage, as the latter requires a more extensively built-out hydrogen refueling network. The U.S. customer trial with logistics company Total Transport Services Inc. is a high-utilization (trucks can run up to 18-20 hours per day) use case, but the truck will only ever need to access the single refueling station in Wilmington, California. “It&#8217;s a good application for hydrogen, and we&#8217;re not introducing the complication of having to find hydrogen stations across the country,” Knight said.</p>
