										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish gaming giant Modern Times Group (MTG) has acquired Indian startup PlaySimple for $360 million, the two firms said Friday.</p>
<p>MTG said it will pay 77% of the acquisition sum to Indian game developer and publisher in cash and the rest in company shares. There’s also another $150 million reward put aside if certain undisclosed performance metrics are hit, the two firms said.</p>
<p>Friday’s deal marks one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">largest exits in the Indian startup ecosystem</a>. PlaySimple had raised $4 million Series A at a valuation of about $16 million from Elevation Capital and Chiratae Ventures in 2016. (The startup, which began its journey in Bangalore, raised just $4.5 million from external investors.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And it’s clear why. The revenues of PlaySimple &#8212; which operates nine games including “Daily Themed Crossword,” “Word Trip,” “Word Jam,” and “Word Wars” &#8212; grew by 144% to $83 million last year and it was on track to hit over $60 million revenue in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>“We’re very proud of the games we’ve developed over the years, and of the infrastructure and scale that we’ve achieved with our team. As we join the MTG family, we look forward to leveraging our proprietary technology across MTG’s gaming portfolio, expanding into the European market, investing in cutting-edge technology and building exciting new games,” PlaySimple co-founders and management team members &#8212; Siddhanth Jain, Suraj Nalin and Preeti Reddy &#8212; said in a joint statement.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great deal has changed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/nigerian-fintech-firm-teamapt-raises-5m-eyes-global-expansion/">since we last covered</a> Nigerian fintech startup <a href="https://teamapt.com/">TeamApt</a> two years ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the company had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> closed a $5.5 million Series A round from a single VC — Quantum Capital Partners, a firm owned by Zenith Bank billionaire Jim Ovia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeamApt has quite the story. CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tosin-eniolorunda-46833618">Tosin Eniolorunda</a> started the company in 2015 after leaving Interswitch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was going head-to-head with the billion-dollar company when TeamApt received a license to operate as a payment switch providing enterprise solutions for banks in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeamApt bootstrapped with revenue made on a per-project basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2017, the company, which optimized core bank back-office operations was servicing 26 financial institutions and processing $160 million in monthly transactions without raising a dime</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year later, TeamApt began releasing direct consumer and business-facing products targeted at driving financial inclusion in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moneytor</span> was <span style="font-weight: 400;">a digital banking service for financial institutions to track transactions with web and mobile interfaces;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monnify, an enterprise software suite for small business management and AptPay, a push payment infrastructure to centralize services used on banking mobile apps. And while t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hese products have been successful in their own right, it was Moniepoint, an agency banking platform launched months after the Series A, became the glaring instant hit because it interfaced with the public</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigerian fintech firm TeamApt raises $5M, eyes global expansion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/nigerian-fintech-firm-teamapt-raises-5m-eyes-global-expansion/embed/#?secret=1YYES0hOG5" data-secret="1YYES0hOG5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In developed markets where banking networks </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are sophisticated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and have an extensive reach, the concept of agency banking is foreign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But in developing markets like Nigeria, it&#8217;s necessary because the bank to population ratio in Nigeria is low. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to reports, there are 4.3 branches per 100,000 people compared to the global average of 11.7 branches</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agency banking serves as an alternative distribution strategy for traditional retail banking by using authorized personnel who acts as agents to expand the reach of the branch network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many Nigerians, agency banking represents a financial access lifeline and one of the most viable options for accessing the financial services they need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Moniepoint agents <span style="font-weight: 400;">use</span> mobile apps and point-of-sale terminals to offer these customers access to financial services like cash withdrawal, cash deposit, funds transfer, airtime purchase and bill payments. I<span style="font-weight: 400;">n less than two years, Moniepoint claims to account for 74% of agency banking transactions in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform also processes about 68 million transactions worth over $3.5 billion monthly through 100,000 agents and 14 million customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When transactions from Monnify </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, TeamApt said it processed $17.5 billion in the past 12 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the seeming success, TeamApt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add digital banking services to Moniepoint&#8217;s dominant agency banking play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;What is the reason behind this? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players, was the agency banking space becoming too crowded that Moniepoint couldn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221; I ask Eniolorunda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s still room for growth in the agency space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can actually grow more and take more share as more agents continue to enter the market and consumers embracing agency networks and point-of-sale networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the reason we&#8217;re trying to do this is for two reasons &#8212; a mission and commercial reason,&#8221; he answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most well-known digital banks in Nigeria cater to the already banked, neglecting the unbanked or underbanked consumers that banks do not serve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eniolorunda&#8217;s &#8220;mission reason&#8221; is to provide financial services for them via launching a digital bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The commercial reason? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to be the middle ground between banks and digital approaches to actually serve the next billion Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why we can do this is that we have demonstrated our traction in Nigeria to become the largest agency network </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the period of two years,&#8221; the CEO added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by the transactions made on Moniepoint and since existing digital banks capture the same customers as big commercial banks, TeamApt sits on a big opportunity if it can convert a chunk of its offline users online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Of course, this strategy isn&#8217;t new in itself. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is akin to what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">another </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital bank targeted at the unbanked, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly has adopted although it has a different business model. However, the good news is that s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hould any of these platforms show significant success, other platforms might widely adopt the approach </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and go a long way in providing digital banking services to the unbanked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To test out this strategy at scale, TeamApt has secured another round of investment. Two months ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO announced its participation in a new equity round with $2 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeamApt confirmed to TechCrunch that it is a Series B round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/novastar-ventures-becomes-200m-african-vc-fund-after-108m-raise/">$200 million Pan-African fund Novastar Ventures</a> led the round. Dubai-based Global Ventures, CDC Group, Soma Capital, and Pan-African VC firms Kepple Africa and Oui Capital participated alongside some</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> local angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeamApt, while continuing its switching business for enterprise, will be looking to extend its offerings </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers and micro-SMEs with Moniepoint</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, and s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ubject to regulatory approval, both agency and digital banking platforms will exist under Moniepoint</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/waswani">Brian Waswani Odhiambo</a>, the head of West Africa at Novastar Ventures, said the VC firm backed TeamApt after seeing the speed at which its agency network became the leading operator in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The firm, “by providing TeamApt with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sufficient</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capital to pursue its new phase of growth,” has no doubt the company will do the same with its digital banking platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past month, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeamApt has announced to that it&#8217;s currently in the process of closing another round. Eniolorunda confirmed this to TechCrunch that it would be a Series C round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While that is in progress,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TeamApt will be making expansion plans to other African countries with strong economies in every region &#8212; Central, East, North and South</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also keen on performing a few acquisitions along the way to tap significant opportunities for leveraging technology and offline distribution to provide financial services to Africa&#8217;s mass market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks have led the charge as regards venture capital funding for consumer fintech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while they have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dominated the fintech space, they don&#8217;t operate a monolithic model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/">five distinct models</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/">the one adopted by Nubank, the $30 billion behemoth</a>, is the credit-led model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks operating this model start by offering credit via cards or on an app and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer bank accounts as a gateway to other services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian fintech startup FairMoney operates this model. Today, it is announcing a $42 million Series B raise to diversify its offerings and expand to &#8220;become the financial hub for its users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Management led the round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investors from the company&#8217;s previous rounds, DST Partners, Flourish Ventures, Newfund, and Speedinvest, participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The investment comes after FairMoney raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/fairmoney-raises-11-million-for-its-challenger-bank-for-emerging-markets/">€10 million Series A</a> two years ago and €1.2 million seed in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by</span><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/laurin-nabuko-hainy-03a5b862"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Laurin Hainy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/matthieu-gendreau-22661a3a/en-us"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthieu Gendreau,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasberthozat/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicolas Berthozat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, FairMoney started as an online lender that provides instant loans and bill payments to customers in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CEO Hainy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/with-over-1-3-million-users-nigerian-based-fintech-fairmoney-wants-to-replicate-growth-in-india/">spoke to TechCrunch in February</a>, the company was six months into its expansion to India</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the highlights of that discussion was FairMoney&#8217;s impressive numbers in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million to over 1.3 million users who made more than 6.5 million loan applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also made some progress on the India front, processing more than 500,000 loan applications from over 100,000 unique users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what has changed since then? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, Hainy says FairMoney ticked one of the goals which was acquiring a microfinance bank license</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The license allows FairMoney to operate as a financial service provider in Nigeria.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have received our MFB banking license which now enables us to open current accounts for our users, and we&#8217;re doing that on quite a big scale,&#8221; Hainy said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We opened accounts for our repeated and new customers, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is quite a unique company strategy because we don&#8217;t need to burn millions of dollars of customer acquisition cost on users like other competitors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I think </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that has enabled us to become sort of the largest digital bank in Nigeria.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite the claim but behind it are figures to back it up. Of the company&#8217;s current 3.5 million registered users, 1.3 million are unique bank account holders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company says it is projecting to disburse $300 million worth of loans to them this year. How will it finance that? By raising bonds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FairMoney&#8217;s loan book is grown by its capital markets activity and has convinced some investment banks to invest a substantial amount in its unlisted bond</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit-led neobank offers loans to individuals from ₦1,500 (~$3) to ₦500,000 (~$1,000) ranging from days to six months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business loans have become a prominent service most digital banks have begun to offer in Nigeria&#8217;s retail sector, and FairMoney sees an opportunity there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hainy states that from now on, the company will start servicing loans to registered SMEs in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the works also is the issuance of cards. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unlike the credit cards operated by Nubank, FairMoney is shipping debit cards, the more prevalent one in the Nigerian market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The ambition is that by the end of the year, the customer has the full-fledged banking experience from P2P transfers and lending to debit cards and current accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to that, we are working on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> services from savings products, stock trading, and crypto-trading products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depending on where regulation is heading,&#8221; Hainy continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most African companies, after completing a Series B raise, think about expansion, it&#8217;s a different case for FairMoney</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hainy calls this a &#8216;focus round&#8217; and says FairMoney wants to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its position in Nigeria and India; therefore,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is not considering any expansion to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We feel that with India and Nigeria, we have tons of work to do and tons of problems to solve. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are doubling down on the Nigerian opportunity, which is building out more banking services and becoming one of the commercial banks in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And then India by building a large credit book there,&#8221; the CEO combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African fintech startups have attracted a lot of capital this year and they continue to do so. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the continent has seen three nine-figure raises, all from fintech companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">TymeBank</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/">Chipper Cash</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There&#8217;s also one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">reportedly in the works</a> from OPay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian fintechs are leading the crop as exciting startups keep coming from the country week in week out, gaining access to capital at an astonishing rate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not news that while local investors are cutting checks at pre-seed and seed levels, and sometimes Series A, international investors control the continent&#8217;s latter stages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. TymeBank cited U.K. and Philippines venture capital firms as investors. For Chipper Cash, it was SVB Capital, Ribbit, and Bezos Expeditions, while Avenir Growth Capital and Tiger Global invested in Flutterwave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In FairMoney, Tiger Global has made a return to the continent. Per public knowledge, it is the first time the U.S. hedge fund is investing in two African startups in a year after backing Flutterwave in March. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to partner with FairMoney as they build a better financial hub for customers in Nigeria and India,&#8221; Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were impressed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the team and the strong growth to date and look forward to supporting FairMoney as they continue to scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hainy calls the investment a great industry signaling for the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes Tiger Global decided to back FairMoney because the company has been able to scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tremendously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and shown that it can operate banking and lending while running a profitable business when most of its counterparts are not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think what most people have been discussing is the question of sustainability. How long can digital banks operate as financial service providers while making losses? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s another great signal for the market that we&#8217;ve actually managed to do that in a profitable manner, providing upside for our shareholders and also showing our clients that they can actually bank on us in the future,&#8221; Hainy added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>And to achieve its goal to become a financial hub for its customers’ banking needs, the CEO said the company is embarking on a hiring spree for top talent. “We are hiring worldwide, and there are 150 open positions out there right now that we’re trying to fill with strong talent to help us build the financial app for Nigerians.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two billionaires are neck and neck in the final sprint to the Kármán line, <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-announces-first-fully-crewed-spaceflight/">but Richard Branson may clinch it with a July 11 flight</a> on a Virgin Galactic spacecraft, narrowly beating out Jeff Bezos&#8217;s planned July 20 trip aboard a Blue Origin New Shepard capsule. Whoever wins, the real lesson here is that with enough money, you truly can do anything.</p>
<p>The news came today in the form of an announcement from Virgin Galactic stating that the launch window for its next test flight opens at 6 AM Pacific time on July 11, and that the mission will be the first to carry a full crew: two pilots, three specialists, and one billionaire. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">Blue Origin had its own announcement.</a>)</p>
<p>Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci will pilot the VSS Unity spacecraft; Chief Astronaut instructor Beth Moses will oversee the flight; Lead Operations Engineer Colin Bennett will monitor cabin equipment and procedures; Vice President of Government Affairs and Research Operations Sirisha Bandla will be handling a University of Florida microgravity experiment; and lastly, Sir Richard Branson &#8220;will evaluate the private astronaut experience.&#8221; In other words, he&#8217;s the first plain old passenger.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FAA clears Virgin Galactic for commercial astronaut spaceflight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/faa-clears-virgin-galactic-for-commercial-astronaut-spaceflight/embed/#?secret=bl0CUjUQMX" data-secret="bl0CUjUQMX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I truly believe that space belongs to all of us,&#8221; the billionaire founder and private funder of the space tourism company said in the company&#8217;s press release. &#8220;After more than 16 years of research, engineering, and testing, Virgin Galactic stands at the vanguard of a new commercial space industry, which is set to open space to humankind and change the world for good. It’s one thing to have a dream of making space more accessible to all; it’s another for an incredible team to collectively turn that dream into reality. As part of a remarkable crew of mission specialists, I’m honoured to help validate the journey our future astronauts will undertake and ensure we deliver the unique customer experience people expect from Virgin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mission will, like others in the Virgin Galactic style, involve being flown by traditional means to what is normally considered a high altitude, after which the rocket-powered VSS Unity will detach from the plane and zoom up to above 80 kilometers, generally (though not universally) considered the edge of space. Branson will have gone through all the same training that future Virgin Galactic space tourists will go through, and will of course wear the same special blue suit.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan, Branson will beat Bezos to space by a little more than a week, and probably win a long-running bet.</p>

<p>Bezos, for his part, will be going up July 11 (again, delays notwithstanding) on a more traditional launch vehicle, Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">accompanied by his brother</a> and a lucky ticket-holder — lucky and rich, that is, since the ticket ended up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-auctions-off-seat-on-first-human-spaceflight-for-28m/">selling at auction for $28 million</a> to an as-yet unannounced party.</p>
<p>The company did however today announce that <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/wally-funk-will-fly-to-space-on-new-shepard">the fourth passenger on the first crewed flight will be Wally Funk</a>, the first graduate of NASA&#8217;s Mercury 13 program that trained women astronauts in 1961 — but the mission was cancelled and Funk never went to space. After 50 years of waiting, it seems she&#8217;ll finally get her chance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is considering changes to the way it contextualizes misleading tweets that the company doesn&#8217;t believe are dangerous enough to be removed from the platform outright.</p>
<p>The company announced the test in a tweet Thursday with an image of the new misinformation labels. Within the limited test, those labels will appear with color-coded backgrounds now, making them much more visible in the feed while also giving users a way to quickly parse the information from visual cues. Some users will begin to see the change this week.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last year, we started using labels to let you know when a Tweet may include misleading information. </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For some of you on web, we’ll be testing a new label design with more context to help you better understand why a Tweet may be misleading. <a href="https://t.co/p1KONJz5Vo">https://t.co/p1KONJz5Vo</a> <a href="https://t.co/m55f4RlMDg">pic.twitter.com/m55f4RlMDg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1410646566885601280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Tweets that Twitter deems &#8220;misleading&#8221; will get a red background with a short explanation and a notice that users can&#8217;t reply to, like or share the content. Yellow labels will appear on content that isn&#8217;t as actively misleading. In both cases, Twitter has made it more clear that you can click the labels to find verified information about the topic at hand (in this case, the pandemic).</p>
<p>&#8220;People who come across the new labels as a part of this limited test should expect a more communicative impact from the labels themselves both through copy, symbols and colors used to distill clear context about not only the label, but the information or content they are engaging with,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172971" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172971" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2172971 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="580" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172971" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Twitter</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Twitter found that even tiny shifts in design could impact how people interacted with labeled tweets. In a test the company ran with a pink variation of the label, users clicked through to the authoritative information that Twitter provided more but they also quote-tweeted the content itself more, furthering its spread. Twitter says that it tested many variations on the written copy, colors and symbols that made their way into the new misinformation labels.</p>
<p>The changes come after a long public feedback period that convinced the company that misinformation labels needed to stand out better in a sea of tweets. Facebook&#8217;s own misinformation labels have also faced criticism for blending in too easily and failing to create much friction for potentially dangerous information on the platform.</p>
<p>Twitter first created content labels as a way to flag &#8220;manipulated media&#8221; — photos and videos altered to deliberately mislead people, like the doctored<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/facebook-will-not-remove-deepfakes-of-mark-zuckerberg-kim-kardashian-and-others-from-instagram/"> deepfake</a> of Nancy Pelosi that went viral back in 2019. Last May, Twitter expanded its use of labels to address the wave of COVID-19 misinformation that swept over social media early in the pandemic.</p>
<p>A month ago, the company rolled out new labels specific to vaccine misinformation and introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/twitter-vaccine-misinformation-labels-strike-system/?tpcc=ECTW2020">strike-based system</a> into its rules. The idea is for Twitter to build a toolkit it can use to respond in a proportional way to misinformation depending on the potential for real-world harm.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;&#8230; We know that even within the space of our policies, not all misleading claims are equally harmful,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson said. &#8220;For example, telling someone to drink bleach in order to cure COVID is a more immediate and severe harm than sharing a viral image of a shark swimming on a flooded highway and claiming that&#8217;s footage from a hurricane. (That&#8217;s a real thing that happens every hurricane season.)&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter broadly bans any COVID-19 tweets that could help the virus spread&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/embed/#?secret=zB28wgQbh8" data-secret="zB28wgQbh8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Labels are just one of the content moderation options that Twitter developed over the course of the last couple of years, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">warnings that require a click-through</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/twitter-may-slow-down-users-ability-to-like-tweets-containing-misinformation/">pop-up messages</a> designed to subtly steer people away from impulsively sharing inflammatory tweets.</p>
<p>When Twitter decides not to remove content outright, it turns to an a la carte menu of potential content enforcement options:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Apply a label and/or warning message to the Tweet</li>
<li>Show a warning to people before they share or like the Tweet;</li>
<li>Reduce the visibility of the Tweet on Twitter and/or prevent it from being recommended;</li>
<li>Turn off likes, replies, and Retweets; and/or</li>
<li>Provide a link to additional explanations or clarifications, such as in a curated landing page or relevant Twitter policies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In most scenarios, the company will opt for all of the above.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there is no single answer to addressing the unique challenges presented by the range of types of misinformation, we believe investing in a multi-prong approach will allow us to be nimble and shift with the constantly changing dynamic of the public conversation,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edtech startup <a href="https://www.microverse.org/">Microverse</a> has tapped new venture funding in its quest to help train students across the globe to code through its online school that requires zero upfront cost, instead relying on an income-share agreement that kicks in when students find a job.</p>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has closed a $12.5 million Series A led by Northzone with additional participation from General Catalyst, All Iron Ventures and a host of angel investors. We last covered the company after it had closed a bout of seed funding from General Catalyst and Y Combinator; this latest round brings the startup&#8217;s total funding to just under $16 million.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;VCs bet millions on Microverse, a Lambda School for the developing world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/investors-bet-millions-on-microverse-a-lambda-school-for-the-developing-world/embed/#?secret=1xDYoJo5zz" data-secret="1xDYoJo5zz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s vision has seen added pandemic-era traction as larger tech companies have embraced remote work that spans geographic boundaries and time zones. Microverse has now brought English-speaking students from over 188 countries through its program.</p>
<p>Since we last chatted, CEO Ariel Camus says the startup has landed some 300 early graduates in positions at tech companies including Microsoft, VMWare and Huawei. The company says its has above a 95% employment rate for its students within six months of graduation so far, pushing past one of the bigger issues that income-share-agreement-based schools have had stateside &#8212; getting graduates employed.</p>
<p>Microverse does have notably less generous terms than counterparts like Lambda School when it comes to when students begin loan repayment, the terms of both are actually quite different, as noted in my previous article:</p>
<blockquote><p>While Lambda School’s ISA terms require students to pay 17% of their monthly salary for 24 months once they begin earning above $50,000 annually — up to a maximum of $30,000, Microverse requires that graduates pay 15% of their salary once they begin making more than just $1,000 per month, though there is no cap on time, so students continue payments until they have repaid $15,000 in full. In both startups’ cases, students only repay if they are employed in a field related to what they studied, but with Microverse, ISAs never expire, so if you ever enter a job adjacent to your area of study, you are on the hook for repayments. Lambda School’s ISA taps out after five years of deferred repayments.</p></blockquote>
<p>The startup has made efforts to streamline their online program since launch to ensure that students are being set up to succeed in the full-time, 10-month program. Part of Microverse&#8217;s efforts have included condensing lesson segments into shorter time frames to ensure students aren&#8217;t starting the program unless they have enough free time to commit. Camus says the startup is receiving thousands of applications per month, of which only a fraction are accepted in an effort to ensure that the small startup isn&#8217;t overcommitting itself early on. The startup estimates it will usher 1,000 students through its program this year.</p>
<p>The startup has big plans for the future, including working more closely with tech companies to ensure that students have easier access to job placement once they graduate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have data now that the day we launch a partner program &#8212; which we haven&#8217;t done yet but we will eventually &#8212; it opens up the market by 5x,&#8221; Camus tells TechCrunch. &#8220;To get 10,000 students per year in a world where 90% of the world&#8217;s population doesn&#8217;t have access to higher education &#8212; it&#8217;s not going to be that hard, to be honest, I&#8217;m not too worried.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 1, 2021. It’s Robinood IPO day! That’s the headline, really. This afternoon the American consumer fintech company filed to go public in what will prove to be an early contender for the third-quarter’s most important IPO. We also have a metric ton of other startup news for you. And don’t forget that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tc-early-stage-2021-marketing-and-fundraising-kicks-off-in-1-week/">the next TechCrunch event is next week</a>! Let’s go! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-files-to-go-public-after-squeaking-to-profitability-in-2020/">Robinhood is going public:</a></strong> In our first look at the company’s IPO filing we observed a quickly growing consumer fintech company that made money in 2020. The company swung to a loss in the first quarter of 2021, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">as TechCrunch reported</a>, that loss is largely immaterial. Robinhood closed out Q1 2021 on an annual run rate of more than $2 billion. Hot dang.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/macos-montereys-public-beta-is-live/"><strong>Apple’s software rollout continues:</strong></a> After dropping public betas for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 yesterday, Apple released the public beta version of macOS 12.0 Monterey. You can download it now, if you are a brave soul who wants to do some testing. For the rest of us, yes that’s the sound of a required corporate update in our future.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/after-bootstrapping-since-2002-articulate-raises-1-5b-on-3-75b-valuation/"><strong>Articulate raises $1.5B in Series A:</strong></a> After bootstrapping for ages, corporate edtech company Articulate raised a $1.5 billion Series A round on a $3.75 billion valuation. The outsized, putatively early-staged round was the leading story of the day until Robinhood arrived and kicked it into third.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Looping back to a few topics that TechCrunch has been covering extensively in recent weeks, there’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/a-bank-for-the-creator-economy-karat-raises-26m-in-series-a-funding/">fresh news from Karat</a>, a neobank aimed at the creator economy. Everyone wants to make money off creators starting to make money, it seems. And from the global startup market, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/as-eu-venture-capital-soars-will-the-region-hold-onto-future-ipos/">TechCrunch has fresh notes on the future of European IPOs</a> for those of you into such things.</p>
<p>Now, the day’s rounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/nowports-raises-16m-to-build-the-os-for-latams-shipping-industry/"><strong>Nowports raises $16M to automate Latin American freight:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Supply chain software startups are big business, and Nowports wants in on the boom. The startup’s latest round was led by Mouro Capital, with Nowports now backed by around $24 million in capital to date.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/codat-raises-40m-from-tiger-for-its-business-focused-fintech-app-service/"><strong>Codat raises $40M to build the Plaid for companies:</strong></a><strong> </strong>APIs are popular. Fintech APIs are super popular. And fintech APIs that connect individuals’ money to other companies are Plaid. Codat wants to build Plaid, but for SMB financial data. And Tiger is now backing it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/mercado-bitcoin-raises-200m/">Mercado Bitcoin raises $200M for its bitcoin market:</a> </strong>In the wake of the Coinbase direct listing, and seemingly strong crypto trading volumes in the second quarter, it’s not a huge surprise to see fintech companies that facilitate consumer bitcoin purchases attract attention. Seeing Brazil’s Mercado raise such a huge check, then, is not a huge surprise.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/rohlik-raises-119m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-grow-its-2-hour-grocery-delivery-service-in-europe/"><strong>Good news for hungry Europeans:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you want groceries, and want them now, “Rohlik, a Czech startup that has built an online grocery ordering and delivery business selling grocery fare,” TechCrunch reports, has just raised €100 million in a round that values the company at €1 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/ghost-raises-100m-series-d-for-autonomous-driving-and-crash-prevention-tech/"><strong>Ghost raises $100M for crash prevention:</strong></a><strong> </strong>How much money can self-driving car tech collect? At least nine-figures more we’ve learned thanks to the new Ghost round. Ghost is also the name of a web content CMS. This is not that. Instead, <em>this</em> Ghost is working on what TechCrunch called “universal collision avoidance technology” for autonomous driving systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>To guard against data loss and misuse, the cybersecurity conversation must evolve</h2>
<p>Locking down data centers and networks against intruders is just one aspect of an organization&#8217;s security responsibilities; cloud services, collaboration tools and APIs extend security perimeters even farther. What&#8217;s more, the systems created to prevent the misuse and mishandling of sensitive data often depend heavily on someone&#8217;s better angels.</p>
<p>According to Sid Trivedi, a partner at Foundation Capital, and seven-time CIO Mark Settle, IT managers need to replace existing DLP frameworks with a new one that centers on DMP — data misuse protection.</p>
<p>These solutions &#8220;will provide data assets with more sophisticated self-defense mechanisms instead of relying on the surveillance of traditional security perimeters,&#8221; and many startups are already competing in this space.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>We revisited some themes we’ve seen before in our startup section. The same goes for our look at Big Tech. On the government-and-tech side of things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/indias-central-bank-says-growing-presence-of-big-tech-in-financial-services-a-concern/">India doesn’t appreciate Big Tech companies, part 47:</a></strong> Manish Singh reports that “India’s central bank has identified Big Tech’s push into financial services as a challenge for banks in the South Asian market, saying the growing presence of these firms have prompted concerns about creation of an uneven playing field.” Recall that India is also irked at Twitter and has various other beefs with different tech companies.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paris-court-fines-airbnb-9-6-million-for-illegal-listings/">Paris fines Airbnb:</a> </strong>Sticking to the government theme, Airbnb got hit with an €8 million fine today, a fee worth 0.14% of the company’s $6.6 billion in cash it held at the end of the first quarter, per its <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Airbnb_Q1-2021-Shareholder-Letter_Final.pdf">latest earnings report</a>. The Daily Crunch would like to congratulate the City of Light on its auspicious regulatory victory.</li>
<li>Lastly, from Pinterest, something that stood out while going back through the day’s news: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/pinterest-updates-policy-to-prohibit-ads-promoting-weight-loss/">A prohibition of weight-loss advertising</a>. Lots of folks struggle with eating disorders, body image and related issues. So Pinterest is doing away with one type of advertisement that might harm those folks. With decisions like this we don’t want to be overly kind to the company in question as we don’t know how much money it is leaving on the table, but the move could hint at more active social media regulation of owned platforms in the future. At least when it comes to ads.</li>
</ul>

		<a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rhys-spence">Rhys Spence</a> is head of research at Brighteye Ventures, a European edtech-focused fund, where he works with portfolio companies to help address priorities, with a focus on internationalization.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Last week was a good one for edtech in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/viennas-gostudent-raises-244m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-online-tutor-marketplace/">GoStudent became Europe’s first edtech unicorn</a> (IPO’d companies aside), raising its third round in 12 months and the biggest ever in the sector in Europe. Brighteye Ventures’ <a href="https://www.brighteyevc.com/post/edtech-funding-report-2021-half-year-review#viewer-273gu">analysis</a> showed that VC investments in European edtech had breached $1 billion in a calendar year for the first time, even without GoStudent’s mega-round, with six months left to go.</p>
<p>Edtech deal flow in 2021 looks set to match or even outpace 2020 levels, per the report: At $9.4 million, average deal size is triple 2020 levels; seven companies have raised $50 million in five different markets; and the U.K. has more than three times as many deals as the next individual market.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172791" style="width: 1288px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172791" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2172791 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Deal-size-progression-graphic.png" alt="Deal size progression in edtech over the years" width="1278" height="514" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Deal-size-progression-graphic.png 1278w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Deal-size-progression-graphic.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Deal-size-progression-graphic.png?resize=300,121 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Deal-size-progression-graphic.png?resize=768,309 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Deal-size-progression-graphic.png?resize=680,273 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Deal-size-progression-graphic.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1278px) 100vw, 1278px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172791" class="wp-caption-text">Deal-size progression in edtech over the years. <strong>Image Credits</strong>: Brighteye Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that we are not seeing enormous increases in deal count. The $1.05-billion mark in the report is spread across 111 transactions — there were 237 in 2020, so we could expect a similar total this year. More funding and stable deal count of course means that we are seeing significant increases in deal size.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It seems generalist investors are recognizing that edtech investments can reap outsized returns, similar to sectors like deep tech, health tech and fintech.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We can draw a few conclusions from this. We can construe that companies created last year and in previous years matured significantly during the pandemic due to increased demand. Moreover, this rapid natural selection process provided insights on verticals and possible winners.</p>
<p>Lastly, it seems generalist investors are recognizing that edtech investments can reap outsized returns, similar to sectors like deep tech, health tech and fintech.</p>
<p>This is contributing to larger early rounds than we have seen in previous years — investors can’t pick the winner, but they can slant the playing field instead. We therefore expect to see a surge in the number of pre-seed, seed and Series A rounds in the second half of 2021, as companies founded during the pandemic begin to raise meaningful funding.</p>
<p>Another reason that edtech is being taken seriously by generalist investors is that the true size of the market (and the extent of digitization to come) is becoming more conceivable.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Where does all that revenue come from?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This afternoon Robinhood <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm#ib5a32e8afc3b422193a2f2891a49e0c9_910">filed to go public</a>. TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-files-to-go-public-after-squeaking-to-profitability-in-2020/">first look at its results can be found here</a>. Now that we&#8217;ve done a first dig, we can take the time to dive into the company&#8217;s filing more deeply.</p>
<p>Robinhood&#8217;s IPO has long been anticipated not only because there are billions of dollars in capital riding on its impending liquidity, but also because the company became something of a poster child for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech/">savings and investing boom</a> that 2020 saw and the COVID-19 pandemic helped engender.</p>
<p>The consumer trading service&#8217;s products became so popular and enmeshed in popular culture thanks to both the &#8220;stonks&#8221; movement and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">the larger GameStop brouhaha</a>, that the company&#8217;s public offering carries much more weight than that of a more regular venture-backed entity. Robinhood has fans, haters, and many an observer in Congress.</p>
<p>Regardless of all that, today we are digging into the company&#8217;s business and financial results. So, if you want to better understand how Robinhood makes money, and how profitable or not it really is, this is for you.</p>
<p>We will start with a more in-depth look at growth and profitability, pivot to learning about the company&#8217;s revenue makeup, discuss a risk factor or two, and close on its decision to offer some of its own shares to its users. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>Inside Robinhood&#8217;s growth engine</h2>
<p>Before we get into the <em>how</em> of Robinhood&#8217;s growth, <strong>let&#8217;s discuss how big the company has become</strong>.</p>
<p>The fintech unicorn&#8217;s revenue grew from $277.5 million in 2019 to $958.8 million in 2020, which works out to growth of around 245%. Robinhood expanded even more quickly in the first quarter of 2021, scaling from year-ago revenue of $127.6 million to $522.2 million, a gain of around 309%.</p>
<p>Those are numbers that we frankly do not see often amongst companies going public; 300% growth is a pre-Series A metric, usually.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has a history of sharing feature and design ideas it&#8217;s considering at very early stages of development. Earlier this month, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/">it showed off</a> concepts around a potential &#8220;unmention&#8221; feature that would let users untag themselves from others&#8217; tweets. Today, the company is <a href="https://twitter.com/a_dsgnr">sharing</a> a few more of its design explorations that would allow users to better control who can see their tweets and who ends up in their replies. The new concepts include a way to tweet only to a group of trusted friends, new prompts that would ask people to reconsider the language they&#8217;re using when posting a reply, and a &#8220;personas&#8221; feature that would allow you to tweet based on your different contexts &#8212; like tweets about your work life, your hobbies and interests, and so on.</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s thinking through these concepts and is looking to now gather feedback to inform what it may later develop.</p>
<p>The first of the new ideas builds on work that began last year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/">the release of a feature</a> that allows an original poster to choose who&#8217;s allowed to reply to their tweet. Today, users can choose to limit replies to only people mentioned in the tweet, only people they follow, or they can leave it defaulted to &#8220;everyone.&#8221; But even though this allows users to limit who can respond, everyone can see the tweet itself. And they can like, retweet or quote tweet the post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the proposed Trusted Friends feature, users could tweet to a group of their own choosing. This could be a way to use Twitter with real-life friends, or some other small network of people you know more personally. Perhaps you could post a tweet that only your New York friends could see when you wanted to let them know you were in town. Or maybe you could post only to those who share your love of a particular TV show, sporting event or hobby.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172835" style="width: 651px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172835" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2172835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/trustedfriends-full.png?w=641" alt="" width="641" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/trustedfriends-full.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=141,150 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=283,300 283w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=768,815 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=641,680 641w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172835" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>This ability to have private conversations alongside public ones could boost people&#8217;s Twitter usage and even encourage some people to try tweeting for the first time. But it also could be disruptive to Twitter, as it would chip away at the company&#8217;s original idea of a platform that&#8217;s a sort of public message board where everyone is invited into the conversation. Users may begin to think about whether their post is worthy of being shared in public and decide to hold more of their content back from the wider Twitter audience, which could impact Twitter engagement metrics. It also pushes Twitter closer to Facebook territory where only some posts are meant for the world, while more are shared with just friends.</p>
<p>Twitter says the benefit of this private, &#8220;friends only&#8221; format is that it could save people from the workarounds they&#8217;re currently using &#8212; like juggling multiple alt accounts or toggling between public to protected tweets.</p>
<p>Another new feature under consideration is Reply Language Prompts. This feature would allow Twitter users to choose phrases they don&#8217;t want to see in their replies. When someone is writing back to the original poster, these words and phrases would be highlighted and a prompt would explain why the original poster doesn&#8217;t want to see that sort of language. For instance, users could configure prompts to appear if someone is using profanity in their reply.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172833" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172833" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2172833 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smellcheck-full.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smellcheck-full.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smellcheck-full.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smellcheck-full.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smellcheck-full.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smellcheck-full.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smellcheck-full.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172833" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>The feature wouldn&#8217;t stop the poster from tweeting their reply &#8212; it&#8217;s more a gentle nudge that asks them to be more considerate.</p>
<p>These &#8220;nudges&#8221; can have impact. For example, when Twitter launched a nudge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/">that suggested users read an article</a> before they amplify it with a retweet, it found that users opened articles before sharing them 40% more often. But in the case of someone determined to troll, it may not do that much good.</p>
<p>The third, and perhaps most complicated, feature is something Twitter is calling &#8220;Facets.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an early idea about tweeting from different personas from one account. The feature would make sense for those who often tweet about different aspects of their lives, including their work life, their side hustles, their personal life or family, their passions and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172836" style="width: 668px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172836" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2172836" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facets-full.png?w=658" alt="" width="658" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facets-full.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facets-full.png?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facets-full.png?resize=290,300 290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facets-full.png?resize=768,794 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facets-full.png?resize=658,680 658w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facets-full.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facets-full.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172836" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Unlike Trusted Friends, which would let you restrict some tweets to a more personal network, Facets would give other users the ability to choose whether they wanted to follow all your tweets, or only those about the &#8220;facet&#8221; they&#8217;re interested in. This way, you could follow someone&#8217;s tweets about tech, but ignore their stream of reactions they post when watching their favorite team play. Or you could follow your friend&#8217;s personal tweets, but ignore their work-related content. And so on.</p>
<p>This is an interesting idea, as Twitter users have always worried about alienating some of their followers by posting &#8220;off-topic&#8221; so to speak. But this also puts the problem of determining what tweets to show which users on the end user themselves. Users may be better served by the algorithmic timeline that understands which content they engage with, and which they tend to ignore. (Also: &#8220;facets‽&#8221;)</p>
<p>Twitter says none of the three features are in the process of being built just yet. These are only design mockups that showcase ideas the company has been considering. It also hasn&#8217;t yet made the decision whether any of the three will go under development &#8212; that&#8217;s what the user feedback it&#8217;s hoping to receive will help to determine.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a sweltering day here in New York City, and that means Wall Street is on fire, and so is Robinhood, apparently. The popular stock trading app officially filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-files-to-go-public-after-squeaking-to-profitability-in-2020/">its Form S-1 with the SEC a few hours ago to go public</a>, where it will trade under the ticker &#8220;HOOD.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robinhood files to go public after squeaking to profitability in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-files-to-go-public-after-squeaking-to-profitability-in-2020/embed/#?secret=HCiCcylGSI" data-secret="HCiCcylGSI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Equity crew has been yammering about Robinhood for years now, and we have been chomping at the bit to see those S-1 results for what feels like ages. Well, we finally got the numbers, we chomped that bit (or at least <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> did, since <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> went on vacation about 15 minutes before the IPO hit the wires), and so here&#8217;s a special Equity Shot to talk about all the highlights.</p>
<p>We talked about so much in an itsy-bitsy 15-minute episode: crazy revenue growth, crazy revenue concentration from two major sources, regulatory hurdles that the company has been clearing up, better financials with a bit of nuance on the company&#8217;s Q1 finances, and the company&#8217;s special plan for its IPO.</p>
<p>Wowza.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical growth and profitability.</li>
<li>Revenue mix and revenue concentration, along with constituent concerns.</li>
<li>The importance of options-related incomes for the company.</li>
<li>Dogecoin.</li>
<li>Why the company&#8217;s adjusted income may help it assuage investors who have their eyes pop out of their skulls when they see its GAAP Q1 2021 results.</li>
</ul>
<p>And a lot more. Of course, if you hate Robinhood, we will be back with our normally scheduled Friday episode of Equity tomorrow.</p>

In healthcare alone, 2020 saw <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/2020-healthcare-data-breach-report-us/">640 breaches</a>, exposing 30 million personal records, a 25% increase over 2019 that equates to roughly two breaches per day, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

<p>It’s painfully clear that existing data loss prevention (DLP) tools are struggling to deal with the data sprawl, ubiquitous cloud services, device diversity and human behaviors that constitute our virtual world.</p>
<p>Conventional DLP solutions are built on a castle-and-moat framework in which data centers and cloud platforms are the castles holding sensitive data. They’re surrounded by networks, endpoint devices and human beings that serve as moats, defining the defensive security perimeters of every organization. Conventional solutions assign sensitivity ratings to individual data assets and monitor these perimeters to detect the unauthorized movement of sensitive data.</p>

	</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these historical security boundaries are becoming increasingly ambiguous and somewhat irrelevant as bots, APIs and collaboration tools become the primary conduits for sharing and exchanging data.</p>
<p>In reality, data loss is only half the problem confronting a modern enterprise. Corporations are routinely exposed to financial, legal and ethical risks associated with the mishandling or misuse of sensitive information within the corporation itself. The risks associated with the misuse of personally identifiable information have been widely publicized.</p>
<p>However, risks of similar or greater severity can result from the mishandling of intellectual property, material nonpublic information, or any type of data that was obtained through a formal agreement that placed explicit restrictions on its use.</p>
<p>Conventional DLP frameworks are incapable of addressing these challenges. We believe they need to be replaced by a new <a href="https://medium.com/work-bench/cio-perspectives-with-mark-settle-nextgen-dlp-data-misuse-protection-e2d6335517aa">data misuse protection (DMP) framework</a> that safeguards data from unauthorized or inappropriate use <i>within </i>a corporate environment <i>in addition to </i>its outright theft or inadvertent loss. DMP solutions will provide data assets with more sophisticated self-defense mechanisms instead of relying on the surveillance of traditional security perimeters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s central bank has identified Big Tech&#8217;s push into financial services as a challenge for banks in the South Asian market, saying the growing presence of these firms have prompted concerns about creation of an uneven playing field.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?UrlPage=&amp;ID=1174">report</a> published on Thursday, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said Big Tech offers a wide range of digital services that hold the promise of supporting financial inclusion, generating lasting efficiency gains, and making banks become more competitive, but their expansion in the financial services sector has given rise to “important policy issues.”</p>
<p>“Specifically, concerns have intensified around a level playing field with banks, operational risk, too-big-to-fail issues, challenges for antitrust rules, cybersecurity and data privacy,” the Indian central bank wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Big Tech firms “straddle many different (nonfinancial) lines of business with sometimes opaque overarching governance structures&#8221; and have the potential to become “the dominant players&#8221; in financial services, wrote the central bank, which also regulates the finance market in India. “Third, Big Tech [companies] are generally able to overcome limits to scale in financial services provision by exploiting network effects.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For central banks and financial regulators, financial stability objectives may be best pursued by blending activity and entity-based prudential regulation of Big Tech [companies] (an activity-based approach is already applied in areas such as anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism; an activity-based approach is the provision of cloud services, where minimising operational and in particular, cyber risk is paramount).”</p>
<p>“Furthermore, as the digital economy expands across borders, international coordination of rules and standards becomes more pressing,” it added. Worth noting that it&#8217;s not clear how RBI defines Big Tech: Is it referring to American tech giants? Does it also see Reliance Industries and Tata Group, two Indian conglomerates that are also slowly making their way into financial services, as Big Tech?</p>
<p>The caution comes at a time when the RBI, which in the past decade opened up the mobile payments through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">retail banks-backed infrastructure called UPI</a> in the past decade, is now opening up the entire national payment network in the country.</p>
<p>A number of players including the tech giants Facebook, Google and Amazon and plastic card processing firms Visa and Mastercard have applied for licenses to operate retail payments and settlement systems in the country. (RBI is expected to give some of these firms licenses later this year.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Nowhere else in the world would the largest corporates, banks [and] telcos in India and the largest tech players in the world would come together to build national payment networks.&#8221; analysts at Bernstein said of the NUE.</p>
<p>An industry executive questioned the concerns raised by RBI, saying no existing rule is preventing the big banks in India &#8212; ICICI and HDFC &#8212; that already amass a plethora of data about their customers from investing in their digital expansion.</p>
<p>State Bank of India “is nearly a quarter of Indian banking. And Yono [State Bank of India&#8217;s digital bank platform] claims a $40 billion market valuation. Why is their reach not a concern?”</p>
<p>The executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said big technology firms are following the regulations set by the RBI. They are using rails built by banks and are required to operate in the space only through partnerships with banks. “The RBI is free to make more regulations &#8212; and it’s already doing so with wallet KYC restrictions and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/google-and-walmart-face-growth-hurdles-as-india-caps-payments-transactions/">imposing market share caps</a> for those doing payments atop UPI infrastructure.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We spoke to EY’s Franck Sebag, Osborne Clarke Spain partner David Miranda and Dealroom’s Yoram Wijngaarde to better understand the current IPO market as it relates to European public offerings.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of American cybersecurity unicorn SentinelOne began to trade yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. The former startup had raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sentinel/company_financials">nearly $700 million</a> before its IPO. And it priced its public debut above a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/sentinelones-upgraded-ipo-pricing-is-good-news-for-tiger-public-markets-and-your-local-vc/">raised price interval</a>. But even its higher-than-anticipated valuation didn’t stop shares of the company from closing <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sentinelone-stock-bolts-out-of-gate-on-first-day-trades-about-25-above-ipo-price-11625072304">around 20% higher</a>.</p>
<p>The SentinelOne IPO is a single data point, but one that fits into a quarters-long trend of high-growth technology companies attracting strong &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">perhaps exuberant</a> &#8212; valuations on American exchanges. The notion that America is a good place to go public is not news; even Chinese tech companies facing what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/for-us-and-chinese-startups-the-ipo-market-is-increasingly-a-two-tier-affair/">could be called a valuation gap</a> are still pursuing listings in the United States.</p>
<p>But not every technology startup grows up planning, or even dreaming of an American IPO. Many European companies will wind up listing on their native exchanges.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In the wake of the busy 2021 IPO cycle, The Exchange wanted to better understand why some tech companies choose to list in Europe over the United States.</p>
<p>The question is pertinent thanks to rising venture capital activity on the continent. The first quarter of 2021 saw record investment in the region, to the tune of $21.4 billion, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/european-venture-reaches-all-time-high-in-the-first-quarter-of-2021/">according to Crunchbase News</a>. Early data looking at European venture capital activity in the first half of 2021 is <a href="https://twitter.com/yoramdw/status/1409575469222088712">looking similarly bullish</a>. More VC activity likely implies more breakout startups, which in turn should lead to more startup exits, some of which will be public offerings.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A court in Paris has fined <a href="https://www.airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>, the popular marketplace for vacation rentals. According to the court, the tech company has failed to comply with local regulation when it comes to listing your apartment on the platform. Airbnb should pay $9.6 million (€8.08 million) to the city of Paris.</p>
<p>This decision has been years in the making. Like many major cities around the world, Airbnb has had some impact on the housing market in Paris. Many apartments disappeared from the housing market as they became full-time Airbnb apartments, leading to high rents.</p>
<p>In 2017, it became a bit more difficult to list your home on Airbnb if you live in Paris. For instance, you can’t rent an apartment for more than 120 nights a year. This way, landlords would think twice before switching from full-time tenants to Airbnb customers.</p>
<p>As there are multiple vacation rental platforms, the city of Paris implemented a registration system. If you want to list your apartment on Airbnb, you have to get a registration number first. Platforms like Airbnb would have to ask for that registration number and cap listings to 120 nights per year.</p>
<p>At first, the mayor’s office <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/11/paris-asks-airbnb-to-delist-a-thousand-apartments/">flagged</a> around 1,000 apartments that were not properly registered. They sent the list to Airbnb, asking the company to take down those listings.</p>
<p>In 2019, the city of Paris <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/paris-sues-airbnb-for-illegal-listings-and-seeks-14-2-million/">sued</a> Airbnb for the same reason. Thanks to some regulatory changes, the responsibility was shared between the hosts and the platform. And it leads us to today’s fine.</p>
<p>“This is the first time in France that a local government wins a case against a tech giant,” Paris Deputy Mayor Ian Brossat said in <a href="https://presse.paris.fr/pages/19789">a statement</a>. “Platforms are finally held accountable. A wonderful win for Parisians.”</p>
<p>Airbnb <a href="https://www.20minutes.fr/paris/3075139-20210701-paris-airbnb-condamne-verser-huit-millions-euros-premiere-felicite-mairie">told</a> the AFP that 95% of listings in Paris have been reserved for less than 120 nights in the past year. It means that those last 5% of listings represent much more than 5% of nights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This afternoon Robinhood, the popular investing app for consumers filed to go public. The company intends to list on the NASDAQ under the symbol &#8220;HOOD.&#8221;</p>
<p>That Robinhood released an<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm#ib5a32e8afc3b422193a2f2891a49e0c9_910"> S-1 filing today</a> is not a surprise. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/robinhood-files-confidentially-to-go-public/">privately filed to go public</a> back in March, leaving the startup-watching world waiting for the eventual filing drop. Robinhood&#8217;s public offering document includes a placeholder $100 million raise figure, though that will change the closer we get to its debut.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CK62DvyzCg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">How Robinhood&#8217;s explosive growth rate came to be</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Robinhood&#8217;s explosive growth rate came to be&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/embed/#?secret=CK62DvyzCg" data-secret="CK62DvyzCg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is pursuing a public listing after a period of rapid growth. Robinhood saw its revenues soar from $277.5 million in 2019 to $985.8 million in 2020.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s first-quarter numbers are even more impressive. During the first three months of 2021, Robinhood generated revenues of $522.2 million, up around four times from its Q1 2020 result of $127.6 million. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom/">expected Robinhood to post a strong first quarter</a> based on previous filings relating to its payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) business.</p>
<p>Notably, Robinhood was profitable in 2020, generating net income of around $7.4 million during the one-year period. However, the company&#8217;s most recent period includes an epic $1.49 billion cost relating to &#8220;change[s] in fair value of convertible notes and warrant liability,&#8221; leading the company to post an astronomical net loss of $1.44 billion in the first quarter of the year. That compares with a net loss of $107 million for 2019.</p>
<p>For the three-month period ended March 31, Robinhood posted $463.8 million in operating expenses, inclusive of &#8220;brokerage and transaction&#8221; costs. The company&#8217;s business then, apart from its fair-value changes, had a good start to the year in profitability terms.</p>

<p>That Robinhood closed the first quarter of 2021 on a more than $2 billion annual run rate is notable; the firm has quickly scaled to mammoth size on the back of rising consumer interest in investing in both stocks and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Robinhood has proved to be a lightning rod for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/robinhood-goes-to-congress/">oversight</a>, <a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2021/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial">fines</a>, mass usage and culture in the last year. And it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">raised billions</a> this year after running into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">operational issues regarding trading of certain stocks</a> that retail investors found particularly appealing.</p>
<p>Turning to investor results, DST Global, Index Ventures, New Enterprise Associates and Ribbit capital are listed as shareholders with more than 5% of the company apiece, though certain information in the S-1 filing is yet to be included, including share counts for most of those groups. DST&#8217;s 58,102,765 Class A shares, however, are listed.</p>
<p>Robinhood has three classes of shares, including Class A shares with one vote, Class B shares with 10, and Class C shares with none.</p>
<p><em>TechCrunch is parsing the S-1 and will have more in a following piece. <strong>Update: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">Here</a>!</strong></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LA-based game studio <a href="https://www.singularity6.com/">Singularity 6</a> has banked more funding as it scales itself up and readies for the launch of its debut title.</p>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $30 million in a Series B bout of funding led by FunPlus Ventures with additional participation from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), LVP, Transcend, Anthos Capital and Mitch Lasky. The studio has now disclosed some $49 million in funding, a sizable sum, but one that showcases how much investors are looking to rally around gaming platform plays in the wake of Roblox&#8217;s monster IPO.</p>
<p>In 2019, Singularity 6 raised a $16.5 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. At the time, the studio was mum on details about its upcoming debut title, but we&#8217;ve learned more about it since.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The title, Palia, is a community simulation game that seems to be more focused on Animal Crossing-like community mechanics in an MMO environment, rather than endless battles. Last month, the studio showcased a launch trailer of the title which hinted at a good deal of the gameplay. Palia looks to be a medieval Zelda-like environment where users can move between towns in an open world environment while farming and collecting resources to build structures in a shared world.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lP009fvbt8c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The company has said in marketing materials that the title is &#8220;designed to create community, friendships and a real sense of belonging.&#8221; In a statement, a16z partner Jonathan Lai called the upcoming title, &#8220;warm and dynamic.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are still quite a bit of unanswered questions about the title, which is currently taking sign-ups on its website to be alerted to pre-alpha access. We do know that plenty of VCs are betting millions on the prospect that this multiplayer title could be big.</p>

<p>Following three weeks of developer beta, the public beta version of macOS 12.0 Monterey is now live for download (i.e., has begun a rollout that often takes a little time to make its way to everyone).</p>

<p>Any beta version of an operating system comes with the usual caveats/caution against downloading it on your primary machine, but at very least, this ought to be sufficiently more stable than what first rolled out to developers in June. Listen, I’m not going to tell you how to live your life.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172739" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172739" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172739" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macos-focus.gif" alt="" width="800" height="834" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>I don’t always open these sorts of writeups with system compatibility, but it probably ought to be singled out for Monterey. After all, this is the first full new OS release since the company made the first Apple silicon Macs available last year. Naturally, it will be available for all of the systems sporting a first-party Apple processor.</p>
<p>Intel Macs are more of a grab bag, though support goes back for several years, in most cases.  A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/macos-monterey-compatibility/">nod to Macrumors</a>, who compiled the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>iMac‌ — Late 2015 and later</em></li>
<li><em>‌iMac‌ Pro — 2017 and later</em></li>
<li><em>‌MacBook Air‌ — Early 2015 and later</em></li>
<li><em>MacBook Pro — Early 2015 and later</em></li>
<li><em>Mac Pro — Late 2013 and later</em></li>
<li><em>Mac mini — Late 2014 and later</em></li>
<li><em>MacBook — Early 2016 and later</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The dates are shifted up by a year or so from the Big Sur compatibility break down, which makes some sense.</p>
<p>Okay, so what do you get if you bite the bullet and download today? The biggest changes come to Safari, FaceTime, along with the addition of the Universal Control feature that unifies peripherals across devices and Shortcuts, an iOS feature that will replace macOS mainstay, Automater.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172741" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172741" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172741" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macos-safari.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="309" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172741" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Some initial thoughts &#8212; Let’s start with Safari. The browser gets some key updates with every major macOS refresh, but this is one of the largest in recent memory. There was some concern following the keynote that the updates would only introduce confusion for many users. And certainly it’s true that people hate disruptions to their workflow — this is likely one of a handful of reasons I’ve never seriously concerned switching to Safari as a default every day browser. Change is hard, friends. Of course, change is also a necessary part of evolving. In either case, I haven’t been using Monterey intimately enough to offer something more definitive on the Safari experience.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a pretty radical difference up front:</p>

<p>It might not seem like much, but after so many generations of the task bar serving as the driving force, it&#8217;s admittedly a pretty bold change at the center of the browser. Your mileage will vary, of course, but the idea at the heart of it is tying the field to the individual tabs, rather than having it more of a constant presence. There&#8217;s more control of of the tabs, as well, in the form of Tab Groups, which allow you to essentially bookmark a bunch of sites together, so you can group them into things like Home and Work (assuming those ever become separate things again).</p>
<p>If you know anything about how Apple makes software, it shouldn&#8217;t come as any surprise that those groups get synced across devices via your Safari account. This is the kind of feature that could break either way for folks &#8212; it either means getting more organized or just creating a whole bunch of new groups of infinite tabs.</p>

<p>The additions to FaceTime are a pretty welcome pandemic no-brainer. The biggest addition is a code a lot of third-parties attempted to crack over the past year, bringing the ability to stream movies and TV shows on FaceTime calls with friends, in order to watch together. Again, it&#8217;s a very pandemic-friendly product that will likely continue to have appeal, since teleconferencing certainly isn&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>

<p>In addition to Apple products like TV+ and Music, it will work with a bunch of launch partners, including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, NBA, Twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, ESPN+, Paramount+ and PlutoTV. The company is also opening its API to developers, because, honestly, this thing really needs YouTube and Netflix.</p>

<p>Focus essentially builds on the existing Do Not Disturb feature, adding in the ability to create specific notification parameters. Apple offers some like Work and Sleep, by default, or you can create your own custom version, allowing some disturbances in and blocking others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172772" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172772" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172772" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.43.23-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="890" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.43.23-PM.jpg 1740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.43.23-PM.jpg?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.43.23-PM.jpg?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.43.23-PM.jpg?resize=768,667 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.43.23-PM.jpg?resize=680,591 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.43.23-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1335 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.43.23-PM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172772" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Apple</p></div></p>
<p>From a hardware perspective, Universal Control is probably the most interesting addition. The feature makes it possible to share wireless keyboards and mic/trackpads across compatible Macs and iPads. It&#8217;s not exactly a replacement for Sidecar, nor does it specifically build on that technology. Where Sidecar effectively turns an iPad into a second screen, Universal Control maintains the standard iPad functionality, albeit with a cursor that moves across devices. Both seem compelling for creatives and frequent travelers, but it will be interesting to see if one effectively cannibalizes the other.</p>
<p>Speaking of cross-device functionality, AirPlay to Mac is one of those features where you wonder why it took so long. Here you can share content from an iPhone or other Apple device directly on your big screen Mac. The computer can also serve as an Airplay speaker, casting music from that device onto the system.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the arrival of the Mac version of Shortcuts marks the beginning of the end for Automater. Apple will be keeping the app around for a while, as it gathers feedback from users. I do appreciate that change from the company&#8217;s standard policy of just ripping the band-aid off with new features. Automater was extremely versatile, but could be downright perplexing for the uninitiated. To get started, the company is offering a gallery (see: above) of shortcuts.</p>
<p>They range from basic OS tasks to things like &#8220;Make Gif,&#8221; which could could ultimately make some third-party Mac apps redundant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Hepsiburada.com">Hepsiburada</a> — Turkey&#8217;s giant online shopping platform considered the Amazon of its country — floats on the Nasdaq today, for a valuation likely to exceed $3.9 billion on current projections, especially with shares being marked up to $14 apiece (up from the previously predicted $12 pricing). But this isn’t the end of the journey for this breakout Turkish tech and e-commerce company, for long-time founder and chairwoman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanzade_Do%C4%9Fan_Boyner">Hanzade Doğan Boyner</a> — who started the business in 1998 no less and still has overall control of the company — considers this closer to a growth round of funding, enabling her ambitious plans to mine Turkey’s fast-developing market even further, as well as expand into Central and Eastern Europe. Doğan Boyner, a scion of the powerful Doğan family in Turkey, continues to hold three-quarters of the voting power in the company, according to the prospectus filed to the SEC.</p>
<p>Hepsiburada’s IPO comes after it more than doubled its revenue during the pandemic, as Turkey’s largely offline population was forced to switch to online shopping.</p>
<p>Hepsiburada (which translates as “everything is here”) is also making history as the first-ever Turkish NASDAQ IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a massive logistics platform spread across Turkey, the company now offers two-hour deliveries, with around 43 million products available on the platform, available from a more Chinese-like superapp that can offer everything from groceries to flights, to payment services, via is &#8220;Alipay-like&#8221; service called Hepsipay. In Turkey, many people prefer to buy things in installments, a service Hepsiburada has pre-built into its platform.</p>
<p>Turkish people have also enjoyed its frictionless returns, where goods can be returned for free, involving a super-efficient logistics network.</p>
<p>After growing at about 50% year on year for the last five years, the company says it doubled in size last year, taking advantage of the exponential growth in Turkey’s e-commerce penetration into its 82-million-strong population.</p>
<p>The IPO comes after a mere $100 million was invested in the platform over the last 20 years, and a profit-making period until 2018 when Doğan Boyner started investing more in the platform, prior to this moment.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What brought you to this moment in time in terms of the IPO?</strong></p>
<p>Doğan Boyner: Almost 20 years ago I started with e-commerce and from day one we built it with new features, new services, and today we manage a fully integrated ecosystem, from last-mile delivery to payment to groceries. Hepsiburada is the superapp that makes our customer&#8217;s lives easier. They can get their groceries or their toys for next-day delivery or flight tickets. Why are we listing now? Because the Turkish e-commerce market is at 10% penetration, and we believe that its penetration will double by 2025. It&#8217;s an inflection point. It&#8217;s a large market, and as Hepsiburada we are a pioneering platform reaching maturity toward becoming a public company. With the funds raised through the IPO, we will accelerate our growth and continue to execute our vision.</p>
<p><strong>Are you satisfied with the $3.9 billion valuation?</strong></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s valuation is not very important for me. It’s not where you start, it&#8217;s where you go. I’m not selling any shares, and this is primarily for growth funding. This is just the beginning. You know, the market is still low penetration, and we have an exciting journey ahead of us. I want the stock to perform well for my investors, but what the value is today is irrelevant for me.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re going to use some of this funding to add on new products onto the platform like booking flights or money transfers and other kinds of new products, what are some of the other kinds of expansion plans you have?</strong></p>
<p>One is to continue building our infrastructure, such as frictionless returns, which gives such peace of mind to our consumers. The second is Hepsi Express. It&#8217;s still only at 4% penetration. This will change the consumer’s grocery shopping habit because we have such a strong model where we partner with a lot of national chains, regional chains, mom-and-pop shops, so we turn those stores into our &#8220;dark stores.&#8221; Plus we sometimes do our own picking from the stores or sometimes the retailer does the picking. So the customer offering is very strong. You can get something in half an hour, or you can schedule it for next day, whenever you want. You can do the weekly shopping, or just get something for that night. Express is an area that we will scale. Payment is another focus. We are the only platform with a payments license. Soon it will be an open wallet and our fintech capabilities will increase post IPO.</p>
<p><strong>Are you following a sort of Alibaba/Alipay strategy?</strong></p>
<p>We will leverage our current customers and marketplace, and we will turn them into our wallet customers. Superapps don’t really exist in Europe or the U.S. So it’s our vision to digitalize commerce. We are in our customer&#8217;s pocket. We want to make life easier for them.</p>
<p><strong>How did you shift operations during the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>We almost became a lifeline, not just for consumers but for our merchants as well. So we rose to the occasion to not only scale operationally. We had to onboard 1,000s of drivers and employees, very, very fast, but we also had to secure the well-being of our employees. While all of us were isolating we had to ask our employees to work, which, I think we&#8217;ve done a very, very good job of, in terms of providing PPE, and providing health coverage. It was a chance to live up to our values. Our consumers experimented with us as new consumers, and they&#8217;re happy with the service so they will stay with us and our merchants appreciated us as well, because in a time when their shops were closed, they could generate revenues through us.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been a big advocate of women in your company and also in your country, you&#8217;ve created many programs for women and girls and engaged in a great deal of advocacy. Where do you feel you are on that journey?</strong></p>
<p>Half our workforce is female, 33% of our management is female — which should be 50%! Our woman entrepreneur program has been very impactful. We tell women entrepreneurs to come, we will teach you e-commerce, we will onboard your products, we will give you free shipping, we will prioritize your products or listing pages, we will give you real estate on our home page. Some 19,000 women have benefitted from this. Women have sent me their inspiring stories. They start small and hire two people, and then they create their own brands. Having said that, when I look at where we are in terms of gender equality globally, the needle doesn&#8217;t move much. You look at the number of CEOs in the FTSE 500, the number doesn&#8217;t change. So, I will keep doing whatever I can, because every &#8220;small drop&#8221; counts. And hopefully, it will. I also think there should be a new conversation, a global conversation about gender equality in general. The 19,000 women who benefited from our program became economically more empowered. They gained skills and tools and confidence to trade on a platform like Hepsiburada, which is very meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>Are you concerned that perhaps your success may attract the attention of government regulation in Turkey, in the future?</strong></p>
<p>We are considered a national champion. Turkey has different dynamics. I think it&#8217;s an inspiration that national champions can come out and be successful.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been very hugely successful, you&#8217;re a big advocate for women in your country, do you have any political aspirations?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
