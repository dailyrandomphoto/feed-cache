										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A venture capitalist once told me candidly that whenever you see the phrase &#8220;democratization&#8221; in tech marketing material, think of it as a red flag. Democracy, generally speaking, often comes with an ironic caveat: It disproportionately benefits white and male participants. Now, you know me well enough to know that I wouldn’t start off your Saturday with this dreary of an introduction normally, but I think that that reality is why a new tool, championed by tech entrepreneurs Lolita and Josh Taub, could be on to something actually innovative.</p>
<p>The Taubs have launched a GP-LP, or general partner and limited partner, <a href="https://www.notion.so/lolitataub/GP-LP-Matching-Tool-a294b1d887ed46d7892f66f826a5631f">matching tool</a> to help underrepresented fund managers get access to the capital they need to start their fund. The match-making tool connects those looking to raise funds (GPs!) with check-writers (LPs!). The move comes on the heels of their founder-investor matching tool, which to date has generated over 1,000 introductions that they say have led to 27 checks totaling nearly $4 million in total capital.</p>
<p>Yes, matching LPs to GPs is a relatively simple tech and concept. And this is a relatively simple experiment. But, it couldn’t have existed five, and definitely 10, years ago. Zoom investing has changed the way that people meet and vet, and I think the GP-LP tool is a key data point in how emerging fund managers can bring optionality to their fundraising process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>Speaking of fundraising:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/dismantling-the-myths-around-raising-your-first-check/">Dismantling the myths around raising your first check </a></li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/when-to-walk-away-from-a-vc-who-wants-to-invest-in-your-startup">When to walk away from a VC who wants to invest in your startup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The tool’s explicit focus on only helping underrepresented folks &#8212; which it defines as anyone who doesn’t fit the classic Silicon Valley mold like women, LGBTQ+ folks, non-Ivy grads (or people from non-elite employers) and non-wealthy individuals &#8212; is a layer of differentiation from many other tools out there. Products like the AngelList rolling fund are great, but public, ongoing fundraising still largely benefits those who have networks to tap into in the first place — just take <a href="https://www.angellist.com/rolling">a quick scroll</a> to see who has one so far.</p>
<p>Let me put it like this: We’ve gotten to a point in venture where there are an ample number of tools out there that help founders and investors leverage their community into checks. What’s missing, though, are the tools that help the community-less, undernetworked and underestimated access those opportunities. While there still is LP hesitancy as emerging managers raise their second and third funds, this effort is a good step in the right direction. And I’ll be tracking it to see how successfully it works.</p>
<p><em>It’s been a big week for Black and other underrepresented founders: </em></p>

<p>Disaster tech, such as startups that use data to fight wildfires or analyze brainwaves to analyze PTSD after a traumatic event, is having a moment. Are you surprised? COVID-19 and the ongoing climate crisis have energized entrepreneurs to build proactive solutions that fight literal disaster. Our own Danny Crichton spent 12,000 words mapping out the landscape so you don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The Equity team boiled down those 12,000 words on disaster into a 20-minute episode focused on top takeaways and highlights. As Danny explains in the show: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/cataclysms-are-a-growth-industry/">“Cataclysms are a growth industry.”</a></p>

<p>Since travel first shut down last March, all eyes have been on Airbnb, the travel and short-term rental company with global name recognition. Nearly a year ago, the company cited revenue declines and cut 1,900 jobs, roughly 25% of its workforce. Now, as digital nomadic lifestyles and long-term travel come back, it has a growth story worth sharing, too.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky sat down with our own Jordan Crook to talk about how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/brian-chesky-describes-a-faster-nimbler-post-pandemic-airbnb/">his company is preparing for a faster, nimbler post-pandemic reality.</a> Time will tell if Airbnb’s stance pans out, but getting into the head of one of the co-founders of a business pummeled, then resurrected, by this pandemic can give founders some tactical tips on how to frame conflict and what’s next.</p>
<blockquote><p>Brian Chesky: Little did I know that a travel company in a pandemic might even be crazier than starting a company based on strangers living together. I kind of feel like I’m now 39 going on 49. It was definitely the craziest year ever.</p>
<p>Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say it’s like driving a car. You can’t go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, and expect nothing really bad to happen. Now imagine you’re going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving, and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p><em>Hello from Friday, I presume that you are currently enjoying the long weekend. In celebration for this week’s Exchange letter we’ll try something new by being brief. </em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you are tired of hearing about cryptocurrencies, I have bad news. They are not only not going away, but it appears that the financial cannon that have helped clear the fields for their general advance are reloading with even more financial ammunition.</p>
<p>At least that’s what Eric Newcomer is reporting in a post out this week aptly titled “<a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/a16z-crypto-fund-balloons-to-2-billion">a16z Crypto Fund Balloons to $2 Billion</a>.”</p>
<p>This raises a few points. First! That there is enough LP demand to fund a crypto vehicle to the tune of $2 billion. Second! That there are enough hot crypto ideas out there worth sticking $2 billion into.</p>
<p>I can entirely believe the former, but the latter stretches my brain a little. Not that there aren’t great companies being built in the blockchain space; Coinbase’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">Q1 earnings</a> indicate that you can make money with crypto. But it seems that the firms that have proven the most successful thus far are more a hybrid of the traditional banking world and the crypto space than entirely inhabitants of the latter.</p>
<p>But as those ideas have been mined to increasing perfection, we should anticipate seeing money chase the more experimental crypto ideas. As I noted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/daily-crunch-12/">the Daily Crunch yesterday</a>, there’s a lot of money already going into those markets:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Y]ou’ve heard of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. If you have already digested the NBA TopShot hype wave, buckle in, because a lot of folks are still building in the NFT world. That includes Anima, which is bringing AR to NFTs and just raised new capital from Coinbase, and Infinite Objects, which just raised $6 million to help folks bring their NFTs IRL.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is where venture investing in crypto &#8212; and that mammoth a16z fund &#8212; gets interesting.</p>
<p>Sure, crypto exchanges can make money. But what about the further reaches of the crypto economy? Can they build material revenues that the fiat world can understand and go public? (Do they even want to go public?)</p>
<p>It’s a pleasure to watch other people wager other people’s money on ideas that may fail. Heads they lose, tails we win. Not bad!</p>
<h2>Twitter’s subscription (and media?) moment</h2>
<p>Twitter’s “Blue” subscription product is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/twitter-blue-a-3-monthly-subscription-service-could-be-coming-soon/">slowly dripping its way into the market</a>. I’m going to buy it, whatever it is.</p>
<p>But what I can’t get out of my head is that Twitter is very well positioned to build a sort of creator nirvana. After all, Twitter is already where many writers, journalists and artists hang out. Where we already have a following. Why not help us weirdos leverage all the time we’ve spent on the platform?</p>
<p>You can see how this could scale. Now that Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">bought startups Revue and Scroll</a>, it could build a newsletter platform where Blue subscriber money is divvied up amongst writers for its platform. Or Twitter could buy Medium, as a friend suggested to me the other day. Medium has a huge subscriber base, which Twitter could merge into Blue and provide a sort of extra-social-network-network for writers and other creatives. Right?</p>
<p>If I had a few billion dollars, a few thousand engineers and a dictate from shareholders to grow, I’d go hog-wild and do some crazy shit. Let’s see what Twitter comes up with, but let’s hope that they aren’t making small plans.</p>
<p><em>Closing, you can catch up on all we wrote on The Exchange during the week </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>here</em></a><em>. Have a truly lovely break, we all need one.</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For many VCs, the exit is the endgame; you cash in and move on. But as we know, the startup world is evolving, and that means the impact of investment is no longer limited to how much money is made.</p>
<p>As investors, we’re looking further into what each investment <em>means</em> to human beings, at interlinking our mission with our money. And yet, one of the events that generates the most momentum for long-term impact &#8212; the successful exit of a portfolio company &#8212; is not being harnessed.</p>
<p>When leveraged properly, an exit can be the beginning of a firm’s true impact, especially when we’re talking about giving all founders equal opportunities and empowering the best ideas. The investment sphere is slowly shaking off its “America first” approach as foreign products take the world by storm and international businesses become the norm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			When leveraged properly, an exit can be the beginning of a firm’s true impact, especially when we’re talking about giving all founders equal opportunities and empowering the best ideas.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors will be driving forces in enabling the highest-potential companies to build products that countries everywhere will benefit from &#8212; no matter where they were conceived. The way they play the game can transform the industry into one in which a founder from across the ocean has as much of a chance to change the world as one from next door.</p>
<p>We know the basics of how to do this with cash: Investing in underrepresented founders is a necessary first step. But who’s talking about the power of exits to change the playing field for diverse founders? We must consider the psychological motivation of seeing a huge buyout on other entrepreneurs, what that startup’s ex-team members go on to build, and what the achievements of one citizen does for that nation’s reputation.</p>
<p>Last year, 41 venture-backed companies saw a billion-dollar exit, totaling over $100 billion, the<a href="https://theventure.city/status-of-vc-q4-2020/"> highest numbers</a> in a decade. We have an unprecedented amount of clout to do something with those power moves and four ways to turn them into a domino effect.</p>
<h2>1. Competitor effect</h2>
<p>When a foreign entrepreneur raises money from U.S. firms and sells to a U.S. company, other immigrants see that. Regardless of how groundbreaking their product idea might be, immigrant Americans will always be more wary of putting their eggs into the entrepreneurship basket, at least as long as 93% of all VC money continues to be<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethedwards/2021/02/24/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks/?sh=6c2586a8185d"> controlled by white men</a>.</p>
<p>This, despite research suggesting that immigrants contribute<a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/how-immigrants-drive-entrepreneurship-invention-innovation/"> 40% more to innovation</a> than local inventors.</p>
<p>What these foreign entrepreneurs most need is confidence, role models and success stories proving other people who look like them have made it, especially when those founders are making waves in the same industry as them.</p>
<p>So a big, well-publicized exit will create momentum in the industry for other foreign founders to give fuel to their venture and seek to take it to the next stage. Not only that, it will instill more self-assurance when it comes to fundraising, and investors will value that.</p>
<p>I was inspired to write this column after Returnly, a fintech founded by a fellow immigrant from Spain based in San Francisco &#8212; which, for full transparency, I invested in as an angel investor, and then for Series B and C via my fund &#8212; was acquired for<a href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-to-acquire-returnly"> $300 million by Affirm</a>.</p>
<p>While there was undoubtedly a personal financial gain worth celebrating, the success of a foreign founder who persevered against the odds in such a competitive ecosystem as Silicon Valley, raised large rounds from U.S.-based investors, and was finally acquired by a U.S. company served as a moment of inspiration for other diverse founders around the world. We saw this in the amount of media attention it received in both business and mainstream press in Spain and the floods of connect requests and congratulations that followed on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>The impact of an exit is greater when it shows foreign entrepreneurs that there are globally minded organizations helping startups like theirs get equal access to funding. That means having VC firms that spotlight international entrepreneurship and foster global expert networks.</p>
<p>As investors, we can maximize the impact of our exits in the industry by highlighting the foreign origins of our founders in a big way when it comes to promoting the exit, including narrating the challenges and opportunities they encountered on their journey. We can use the victory to drive the point home to our fellow investors that diverse and international entrepreneurship is an undervalued gem. We can personally take the win to boost our brand as one that empowers foreign entrepreneurs in that niche, attracting more to seek funding with us in a positive reinforcement cycle.</p>
<h2>2. Wealth effect</h2>
<p>The windfall from a big exit puts all previous investors in a privileged position, and it’s unlikely that money will sit around for long. They’ll look to reinvest in other high-potential companies &#8212; probably ones that look a lot like the one that was just sold.</p>
<p>But in addition to those investors multiplying the positive impact in their own portfolio, they will rally other investors to behave in a similar way.</p>
<p>Each exit &#8212; good or bad &#8212; sets a precedent for that niche and that type of company. Other investors will follow suit if they sense that one of their peers is onto a cash cow. Because foreign and ethnic minority founders are still underrepresented in startup funding, it makes this field less competitive while harboring huge potential. VCs who have an eye out for unique opportunities will spot when an investor has made a hefty profit from an unconventional startup, especially if they continue to invest in others in that same field.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NTPHL1YhIP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/want-to-double-your-rate-of-return-seek-counsel-from-experienced-executives/">Want to double your rate of return? Seek counsel from experienced executives</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Want to double your rate of return? Seek counsel from experienced executives&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/want-to-double-your-rate-of-return-seek-counsel-from-experienced-executives/embed/#?secret=NTPHL1YhIP" data-secret="NTPHL1YhIP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To help this along, angels and VCs who’ve been behind a recent exit and are reinvesting in similar founders should publicize those knock-on investments, explaining how their previous success motivated them to support similar ventures. They can also be vocal within their network about their decision to raise up certain entrepreneurs because they’ve seen it works.</p>
<p>Returnly’s founder recently offered to put some of his earnings back into our fund, enabling more foreign entrepreneurs like himself to access capital. If as investors we foster meaningful relationships with our funders and truly care about empowering diverse entrepreneurs, we’ll see more of that wealth circle back into our mission.</p>
<h2>3. Team effect</h2>
<p>The PayPal Mafia is a set of former PayPal executives and employees &#8212; such as Elon Musk, a South African, and Peter Thiel, a German American &#8212; who have gone on to seriously disrupt not one but<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-mafia-members-careers-elon-musk-peter-thiel-reid-hoffman-2019-11#there-are-several-more-former-paypal-employees-who-went-on-to-have-careers-both-in-and-out-of-technology-29"> multiple industries</a> across tech. Among the companies they’ve founded are YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp and Tesla, and they’ve even been named U.S. ambassadors. That’s just one company. Imagine what other diverse and driven teams can do with the influx of cash and inspiration that comes with a big exit. There will be a ripple effect of team members eager to start out on their own who feel empowered by the success of someone who believed in them.</p>
<p>Their ventures will be more likely to “pass it on” when it comes to giving equal opportunities to people regardless of origin and will generate more jobs for people with their mission. Take Thiel, who has to date backed<a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/peter-thiel-european-investments/"> over 40 companies</a> in Europe alone.</p>
<p>As VCs, we can capitalize on this team effect by keeping our eye on any spinoff ventures that arise and supporting them when possible (with experience and contacts, if not with capital). But beyond this, you can also consider encouraging these people to join the investment sphere, maybe even within your firm. Many successful startup founders and executives go on to become investors &#8212; the PayPal Mafia has contributed to some of the most notorious funds out there today. The origin story of these former team members will make them more prone to supporting underrepresented founders they can get behind. In turn, new entrepreneurs will draw more value from their personal experiences.</p>
<h2>4. Reputation effect</h2>
<p>Although Returnly is headquartered in San Francisco, its founder is Spanish and many of its employees were based in Spain.</p>
<p>That means that the impact of Returnly’s exit will be felt on the other side of the Atlantic as well as among co-nationals in the United States. The same is true of other notable sales, like AlienVault, which was founded in Spain and had multiple offices there. AlienVault was<a href="https://elreferente.es/venture-capital/las-20-ventas-millonarias-mas-relevantes-de-startups-espanolas/"> acquired</a> by U.S. telecommunications giant AT&amp;T for $900 million. Or IPOs &#8212; earlier this month, the Spanish-origin payments company Flywire<a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/payments-specialist-flywire-files-for-ipo"> filed for an IPO</a> that could value the company at $3 billion. One startup’s success boosts the reputation of its entire team, and with it other founders and talent with their same country of origin, background, education and drive.</p>
<p>It follows that investors and other stakeholders will be more inclined to back opportunities among founders from the same home country if it says something about the mission, expertise and culture they bring to their startup.</p>
<p>At the same time, growing startups will be more interested in hiring the talent of evidently successful teams. That doesn’t just mean hiring more foreign experts in the United States, but seeking to outsource farther afield. We’re already becoming far more comfortable with remote teams, and it’s more capital-efficient for one half of the team to be working while the other half sleeps. But founders will always gravitate more to countries where local talent and innovation is already seen to be thriving. Open up that conversation with your portfolio companies.</p>
<p>VCs have the power to change an industry forever, to connect startup ecosystems across continents and to see startups expand worldwide. But this is about staying relevant as an investor as much as it’s about ensuring this next stage in the startup world is a positive one.</p>
<p>Investors who don’t recognize that the future of startups is global and diverse in nature won’t be in sync with the best opportunities &#8212; and won’t be selected by the best founders. Rather than trying to play catchup, help build that ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook this week will begin to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">publicly roll out the option to hide Likes on posts across both Facebook and Instagram</a>, following earlier<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/"> tests</a> beginning in 2019. The project, which puts the decision about Likes in the hands of the company’s global user base, had been in development for years, but was deprioritized due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the response work required on Facebook’s part. When the company tested how people felt about Like counts, it got pushback from both sides &#8212; some wanted to see this information and others felt it was leading to a negative, competitive experience.</p>
<p>The company decided to split the difference and put the decision in its users&#8217; hands. Via new settings, users can choose to disable Like counts on the posts they make and those that appear when they browse the social apps&#8217; feeds.</p>
<p>The decision, however, indicates not one of user empowerment, but rather one representative of a company that&#8217;s so large (and intent on remaining the largest), it declines to have its own point of view on controversial matters for fear of causing a mass exit. You can see this in other areas of the business as well, like how it wanted to downplay its responsibility with regard to the misinformation it recirculated by leaving it to fact-checkers to handle, or how it offloaded hard decisions about takedowns to an advisory board. While it&#8217;s one thing to not want to piss off a large number of users, turning every toggle and setting into a user choice is just another way at shrugging off responsibility while claiming that something has been done.</p>
<h3>Poparazzi hypes and growth hacks to the top</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2157861" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157861" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2157861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="284" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg 3282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=768,321 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=680,284 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=1536,642 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=2048,856 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157861" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Poparazzi</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new app with its own point of view has made it to the top. Recently launched anti-selfie app <a href="https://www.poparazzi.xyz/">Poparazzi</a> sees itself as a referendum on the Instagram age of performative and self-obsessed social media. The app turns the &#8220;tag your friends in photos&#8221; feature from Instagram into a standalone, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">excellently marketed and growth-hacked app experience</a>.</p>
<p>Your Poparazzi profile can only be added to by your friends, which makes the app feel more authentic as it captures casual, unpolished moments, not those you&#8217;ve rehearsed and filtered to perfection. But the viral app favors giving up some user privacy protections for network effects, which could potentially be harmful. In the end, it also overlooks why people use social media today: self-expression. Posting pictures to other profiles doesn&#8217;t fulfill that desire. That means the app either become an additive experience to be used alongside your existing preferred social app, or one that&#8217;s risking a bet on a future where people are actually less self-involved. We can only hope.</p>
<h3>Apple-Epic trial officially adjourns</h3>

<p>As the Apple-Epic App Store antitrust trial adjourns, the judge seemed <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-facing-potential-loss-in-app-store-antitrust-case-as-judge-turns-hostile">leaning more</a> to Epic&#8217;s point of view on specific matters, including the 30% cut Apple takes and its decision to ban companies from telling their customers where they could get a better deal on an in-app purchase. (Tim Cook taking the stand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony/">only to claim ignorance</a> of certain key aspects of the App Store business didn&#8217;t help matters, either.)</p>
<p>At its core, the case is about whether or not Apple is a monopoly and could set the tone for later lawsuits and government regulation. Epic believes Apple has a monopoly over distribution to the iPhone, but Apple argued there were plenty of other places for a company like Epic to sell its games &#8212; including those that Epic pays a cut to without complaint, like Microsoft and Sony. Epic, meanwhile, argued that its metaverse is more than just a game, it&#8217;s a social place to hang out.</p>
<p>The judge pointed out both Epic&#8217;s plain-as-day ulterior motives (hint: $$$$), but also the extent to which mobile games &#8212; games that make up the lion&#8217;s share of App Store revenue &#8212; seem to be subsidizing the platform for others. That includes apps where Apple doesn&#8217;t take a cut of IAPs.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/05/apple-epic-trial-antitrust-market-power-fortnite.html">for the judge to rule for Epic</a>, she would have to find that Apple leveraged its market power as a monopoly. And that means Apple has to actually <em>have</em> a monopoly in the first place. But does it? There are other places to buy apps (Google&#8217;s Android devices, e.g.) and games, like console platforms. Epic wants the definition of a monopoly here narrowed to the market for apps on Apple devices, and that may not work. Though the trial has adjourned, a decision will still be months out, so don&#8217;t worry about prepping your in-app credit card forms and PayPal buttons yet.</p>

<p><strong>Apple released its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-kicks-off-june-7/">agenda</a> for WWDC 2021, which will still be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/">virtual</a>. The keynote address will air June 7 at 10 AM PDT, followed by the Platform State of the Union at 2 PM PDT. </strong>The schedule also includes the Apple Design Awards on June 10 at 2 PM PDT. Plus, there will be more than 200 sessions and labs, as well as special activities and events. New this year is &#8220;Pavilions,&#8221; which will better organize event sessions, labs and activities around a given topic.</p>
<p><strong>With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-14-6-features/">iOS 14.6&#8217;s public launch</a></strong>, Apple released Apple Card Family and Apple Podcast subscriptions, Spatial Audio and lossless audio for Apple Music, added enhanced support for AirTags (you can now add emails for lost AirTags), and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/25/apple-made-shortcuts-run-faster-on-iphone-and-ipad-with-ios-14-6/">made Shortcuts actions run faster </a>on both iPhone and iPad, among other features.</p>

That means more devices will likely have new OS updates sooner than before.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=fwpxy9kw">updated age ratings setting</a> in App Store Connect</strong>. The Gambling and Contests setting is now split into two settings, allowing app developers to indicate these content types separately. They’re also indicated separately on the App Store. If your setting was previously yes or no, it will remain across both content types now if you don&#8217;t make any adjustments.</p>

The top six were all in the tools and utilities categories, indicting many developers are looking for SDKs to add functionality to create better user experiences.</p>
<p><strong>ATT opt-in update.</strong> According to<a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/ios-14-att-dashboard/"> new data form AppsFlyer,</a> there were 78M instances were users saw an ATT prompt and allowed tracking. The advertiser side opt-in rates remain consistent at 35%-40%. In addition, spend in iOS apps increased 20% since ATT was enforced. Android budgets, by comparison, remained mostly the same (+2%).</p>

This creates a travel journal of sorts where you itinerary, points of interest, map and, optionally, your own commentary are organized for you.</p>

<p>Well, you have to see what all the hype is about, right? The <a href="https://www.poparazzi.xyz/">new social app</a> for iOS and Android offers Instagram-like photo profiles with one big difference: you can&#8217;t post pictures yourself. Instead, the app only allows users to post photos to their friends&#8217; profiles, arguing against the self-absorbed nature of today&#8217;s social media. After a lot of pre-launch hype on TikTok, the app shot to the top of the App Store at launch where it sits poised to be the viral trendy app of the post-COVID summer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Scotland's capital Edinburgh boasts a beautiful, hilly landscape, a robust education system and good access to grant funding, public and private investment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scotland is slowly but surely drawing attention in the UK&#8217;s startup space. In 2020, Scottish startups collectively raised £345 million, according to Tech Nation, and with nearly 2,500 startups, it has the highest number of budding tech companies outside London. Venture capital fundraises are also consistently on the rise every year.</p>
<p>Scotland&#8217;s capital Edinburgh boasts a beautiful, hilly landscape, a robust education system and good access to grant funding, public and private investment. It&#8217;s also one of the top financial centers in the U.K., making it a great place to begin a business.</p>
<p>So to find out what the startup scene in Edinburgh looks like, we spoke to six founders, executives and investors. The city&#8217;s tech ecosystem appears to have a robust space for machine learning, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, fintech, travel tech, oil, renewables, e-commerce, gaming, health tech, deep tech, space tech and insurtech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<hr />
<p>However, the city&#8217;s tech scene is apparently lackluster when it comes to legal tech, blockchain and consumer-facing technology.</p>
<p>Breakout companies that were founded in Edinburgh include Skyscanner and FanDuel. Notable among the current crop are Desana, Continuum Industries, Parsley Box, Current Health, Boundary, Zumo, Appointedd, Criton, Mallzee, TravelNest, TVSquared, Care Sourcer, Stampede, For-Sight, Vistalworks, Reath, InfraCost, Speech Graphics and Cyan Forensics.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh business-angel community appears to be quite strong, but it seems local founders find it difficult to get London-based investors to take an interest. Scottish investors are said to be &#8220;pretty conservative and risk-adverse&#8221; with some notable exceptions.</p>

<h2>Wendy Lamin, managing director, Holoxica</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s strong in space, biomedicine, fintech/insurtech, AI.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The Scottish business-angel community is said to be the largest in Europe. It&#8217;s difficult to get London-based investors take an interest in Scotland — investors can tend to look at where companies are based. It is hard for &#8220;underrepresented founders&#8221; to get investments in Scotland and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Stay. Not always easy to get people to come and live in Scotland. Edinburgh, there are lots of prejudices, despite it being one of the best cities to live in in the whole of the U.K.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Good to see more focus on impact investing. Par Equity is one of Edinburgh&#8217;s biggest investors, whereas Archangels is one of the biggest angel investors. Poonam Malik is great for diversity and female entrepreneurs, and she is on the board of Scottish Enterprise, and is a social entrepreneur and investor. Garry Bernstein is also an investor — he leads the Scottish chapter of Tech London Advocates and Global Tech Advocates, and as such is the founder of Tech Scot Advocates.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Thriving. The government is doing its best for the tech sector. Education in tech is currently an issue, though. Hope Brexit won&#8217;t be too much of an issue.</p>
<h2>Andrew Noble, partner, Par Equity</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Strong in fintech, health tech, data science, deep tech. Excited by quantum computing, advanced materials, AI in Edinburgh. Weak in blockchain and consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Current Health, InfraCost, Speech Graphics and Cyan Forensics.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Good at seed stage up to £1 million, okay for pre-series A (£1 million to £3 million) and non-existent for Series A (£3 million-£10 million). Quality of investors is improving. Par Equity is leading the way.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Experiencing influx of new talent due to COVID-19. Edinburgh is a highly desirable city to live in. Recent new residents include Aaron Ross (Predictable Revenue) and Jules Pursuad (early employee at Airbnb and now VP at Omio).</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Par Equity (investor), Paul Atkinson, Alistair Forbes, Mark Logan, Lesley Eccles, Chris McCann, CodeBase.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
One to two new unicorns. Promising number of high-growth tech companies. A much more sophisticated investor scene in the Series A space.</p>
<h2>Danae Shell, co-founder and CEO, Valla</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Edinburgh is strong in fintech because of our proximity to so many financial services companies and banks. Also, there are some exciting games tech companies because of our history of games companies. We&#8217;re pretty weak in law tech, Valla&#8217;s area.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Vistalworks for consumer tech; Sustainably for fintech; Reath for sustainable tech.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
As a rule, Scottish investors are pretty conservative and risk-averse. The only real exception is Techstart Ventures, in my experience.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
I think more people will come to Edinburgh from London because the quality of life and cost of living are both so much better here.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Calum Forsyth and Mark Hogarth at Techstart Ventures; Janine Matheson at CodeBase; Jackie Waring from the Investing Women angel syndicate; Jim Newbury is a very well-respected developer and coach, and my co-founder Kate Ho is also well known. Also Danny Helson who runs the EIE event with the Bayes Centre.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
We&#8217;ve had a few exits in the past few years (Skyscanner, FreeAgent), which means that talent is spreading out across the ecosystem here and we&#8217;re getting some fantastic new startups kicking off. In five years, that first crop should be coming into the Series A stage so we could see a lot of super exciting businesses!</p>
<h2>Allan Nelson, co-founder and CEO, For-Sight</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Strong in fintech, travel tech, health, oil, renewables, e-commerce, gaming (both video game and gambling tech). Excited by all bar oil (great driver of revenue, but not the future).</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Boundary, Parsley Box, Appointedd, Criton, Mallzee, TravelNest, TVSquared, Care Sourcer, Stampede, For-Sight.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Big fintech scene here. Travel tech is growing too, with Skyscanner&#8217;s influence strong.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Most will stay, as it&#8217;s a very attractive city to live and work in. It&#8217;s a globally recognized and unique city. Very international flavor as evidenced by the makeup of our team.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Ex-Skyscanner people including Gareth Williams, Mark Logan, etc. Ian Ritchie, Alistair Forbes, the FanDuel&#8217;s founders and the CodeBase founders.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
A lot bigger, as tech is a key growth target of the Scottish government and is underpinned/influenced/inspired by Skyscanner and FanDuel.</p>
<h2>Lysimachos Zografos, founder, Parkure</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Strong in machine learning/AI/digital. Weak in deep tech discovery, especially in biotech/therapeutics. Excited by the rise in adoption of AI in drug discovery — all these ideas that were sci-fi 20 years ago are now adopted in £B deals.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Pheno Therapeutics.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Conservative angels and a few tech seed VCs.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Move in.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Investors: Archangels, Techstart Ventures and Epidarex.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Growing.</p>
<h2>Bertie Wilson, co-founder, “Stealth mode”</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t think there are any sectors that stand out — it&#8217;s fairly evenly split. A good strength of the city is the talent that comes from the universities. There are some really good engineers that come from Edinburgh, Heriot Watt and Edinburgh Napier. The main weakness is that the ecosystem doesn&#8217;t favor the most ambitious founders. Most investors in the region are angels and aren&#8217;t interested in finding outliers that could grow 1000x and are more interested in backing companies that are less risky but might 5x their money. If you want to find investors that will back risky (but very ambitious) plans, it&#8217;s easier to find that elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Desana, Continuum Industries, Parsley Box, Current Health, Boundary, Zumo.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
I would say it&#8217;s getting better, but there are still a lot of issues with the ecosystem. It is being helped in Scotland by the likes of Techstart investing at the earliest stages with high conviction and term sheets that are more similar to London VCs. Outside of this, though, it&#8217;s easy for founders to end up with a messy cap table due to the number of angels and lack of VCs looking for VC-type returns — the messiness of these cap tables can then make it hard to raise venture funding down the line. This is fine for a lot of companies that aren&#8217;t aiming for a venture-scale return (which admittedly is a lot), but it can hurt those that are.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
I imagine and hope others will move in. It is a great place to live with a very high quality of life, and this should be a natural attraction for people who want a good standard of living but want to remain in a city.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
SEP (investor), Techstart Ventures (investor), Gareth Williams (founder/investor), MBM Commercial (lawyers), Pentech, Bill Dobbie (investor), Jamie Coleman.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Optimistically, I hope that there will be a good number of companies that are at the Series B/Series C stage, which will invite a lot more interest from investors outside of Edinburgh (London, Berlin, Paris, New York, San Francisco, etc.) to start investing more actively in the city at the earliest stages as well as these stages.</p>

<p>Alibaba Cloud is one of the fastest-growing businesses for the Chinese e-commerce giant and the world&#8217;s fourth-largest public cloud service in the second half of 2020, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47685521">according to market research firm IDC</a>.</p>
<p>The global chip market has mostly been dominated by Intel&#8217;s x86 in personal computing and Arm for mobile devices. But RISC-V, an open-source chip architecture competitive with Arm&#8217;s technologies, is gaining popularity around the world, especially with Chinese developers. Started by academics at the University of California, Berkeley, RISC-V is open to all to use without licensing or patent fees and is generally not subject to America&#8217;s export controls.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Trump Administration&#8217;s bans <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc/">on Huawei</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/trump-adds-another-year-to-huawei-zte-ban/">rival ZTE</a> over national security concerns have effectively severed ties between the Chinese telecom titans and American tech companies, including major semiconductor suppliers.</p>
<p>Arm was forced to decide its relationships with Huawei and said it<a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3127782/british-chip-design-firm-arm-takes-aim-intel-biggest-tech-overhaul"> could continue licensing to the Chinese firm</a> as it&#8217;s of U.K. origin. But Huawei still struggles to find fabs that are both capable and allowed to actually manufacture the chips designed using the architecture.</p>
<p>The U.S. sanctions led to a burst in activity around RISC-V in China&#8217;s tech industry as developers prepare for future tech restrictions by the U.S., with Alibaba at the forefront of the movement. Alibaba Cloud, Huawei and ZTE are among the 13 premier members of <a href="https://riscv.org/members/">RISC-V International</a>, which means they get a seat on its Board of Directors and Technical Steering Community.</p>
<p>In 2019, the e-commerce company&#8217;s semiconductor division T-Head launched its first core processor Xuantie 910, which is based on RISC-V and used for cloud edge and IoT applications. Having its operating system work with multiple chip systems instead of one mainstream architecture could prepare Alibaba Cloud well for a future of chip independence in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IT ecosystem was traditionally defined by chips, but cloud computing fundamentally changed that,&#8221; Zhang Jianfeng, president of Alibaba Cloud&#8217;s Intelligence group, said at the event. &#8220;A cloud operating system can standardize the computing power of server chips, special-purpose chips and other hardware, so whether the chip is based on x86, Arm, RISC-V or a hardware accelerator, the cloud computing offerings for customers are standardized and of high-quality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some argue that Chinese companies moving towards alternatives like RISC-V means more polarization of technology and standards, which is not ideal for global collaboration unless RISC-V becomes widely adopted in the rest of the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wejo, the connected vehicle data startup backed by GM and Palantir, plans to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Virtuoso Acquisition Corp. The agreement, announced in a regulator filing Friday, will give the combined company an enterprise valuation of $800 million, which includes debt.</p>
<p>The deal raises $330 million in proceeds for Wejo, including a $230 million cash contribution from Virtuoso and a $100 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Previous strategic investors Palantir and GM anchored the transaction, according to Wejo. The company did not disclose the amounts of those investments. Current shareholders will retain 64% ownership of the company, according to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822888/000121390021029979/ea141712ex99-2_virtuosoacq.htm">its investor deck</a>.</p>
<p>Once the transaction closes, which is expected to occur in the third quarter, Wejo will be listed on the Nasdaq public exchange.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wejo works with automakers and tier 1 suppliers to collect data in real-time from sensors integrated in vehicles. The company&#8217;s cloud platform aggregates and normalizes data, and then shares those insights customers. By 2030, Wejo estimates a connected vehicle data market of $500 billion and a serviceable addressable market of $61 billion driven by projections of more than 600 million connected vehicles worldwide.</p>
<p>Wejo said the cash proceeds will fully  from the transaction will fully fund its five-year plan and help it achieve several growth goals such as onboarding automakers and other OEMs more quickly, continuing to rollout services and expanding into new markets.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Founders aren’t flocking to build just another SaaS tool or Airtable copycat — they're trying to disrupt the only thing possibly more annoying than e-mail: the work meeting.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than a year into the coronavirus pandemic, early-stage startups across the world are re-inventing how we work. But founders aren’t flocking to build just another SaaS tool or Airtable copycat — they&#8217;re trying to disrupt the only thing possibly more annoying than e-mail: the work meeting.</p>
<p>On an episode of this week&#8217;s podcast, Equity hosts Alex Wilhelm, Danny Crichton and Natasha Mascarenhas discussed a flurry of funding rounds related to the future of work.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/1f003db3-c3b6-4a9b-9bd9-7d4082236cd9?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rewatch, which makes meetings asynchronous, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/zoom-fatigue-no-more-rewatch-raises-20m-to-index-transcribe-and-store-enterprise-video-content/">raised $20 million from Andreessen Horowitz</a>, AnyClip <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/anyclip-snaps-up-47m-for-its-video-search-and-analytics-technology/">got $47 million in a round led by JVP</a> for video search and analytics technology, Interactio, a remote interpretation platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/interactio-a-remote-interpretation-platform-grabs-30m-after-seeing-12x-growth-during-covid-19/">landed $30 million from Eight Roads Ventures and Silicon Valley-based Storm Ventures</a>, and Spot Meetings got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/spot-meetings-seed/">Kleiner Perkins on board in a $5 million seed.</a></p>
<p>We connected the dots between these funding rounds to sketch out three perspectives on the future of workplace meetings. Part of our reasoning was the uptick of investment as mentioned above, and the other is that our calendars are full of them. We all agree that the traditional meeting is broken, so below you’ll find each of our arguments on where they go next and what we’d like to see.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Wilhelm: Faster information throughput, please</li>
<li>Natasha Mascarenhas: Meetings should be ongoing, not in calendar invites</li>
<li>Danny Crichton: Redesign meetings for flow</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alex Wilhelm: Faster information throughput, please</h2>
<p>I’ve worked for companies that were in love with meetings, and for companies where meetings were more infrequent. I prefer the latter by a wide margin. I’ve also worked in offices full-time, half-time and fully remote. I immensely prefer the final option.</p>
<p>Why? Work meetings are often a waste of time. Mostly you don’t need to align, most folks taking part are superfluous and as accidental team-building exercises they are incredibly expensive in terms of human-hours.</p>
<p>I am not into wasting time. The more remote I’ve been and the less time I’ve spent in less-formal meetings &#8212; the usual chit-chat that pollutes productive work time, making the days longer and less useful &#8212; the more I’ve managed to get done.</p>
<p>But I’ve been the lucky one, frankly. Most folks were still trapped in offices up until the pandemic shook up the world of work, finally giving more companies a shot at a whole-cloth rebuild of how they toil.</p>
<p>The good news is that CEOs are taking note. Chatting with Sprout Social CEO Justyn Howard this week, he explained how we have a unique, new chance to not live near where we work in 2021, but to instead bring work to where we live. He’s also an introvert, which meant that as a pair we’ve found a number of positives in some of the changes to how tech and media companies operate. Perhaps we’re a little biased.</p>
<p>A number of startups are rushing to fill the gap between the new expectations that Howard noted and our old digital and IRL realities.</p>
<p>Tandem.chat might be one such company. The former <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/tandem/">Y Combinator launch-day darling</a> has spent its post-halo period building. Its CEO sent me a <a href="https://blog.tandem.chat/the-virtual-office-is-here-to-stay/">manifesto of sorts</a> the other day, discussing how his company approaches the future of work meetings. Tandem is building for a world where communication needs to be both real-time and internal; it leaves asynchronous internal communication to Slack, real-time external communications to Zoom and asynchronous external chats to email. I agree, I think.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the Daily Crunch for May 28, the last edition before a long weekend here in the United States. But impending holiday or not, there’s plenty to catch up on, not the least of which today is Elon Watch in our top-three rundown. Let’s get into it! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>All about Elon:</strong> The only thing more certain than more venture rounds and SPAC news in the tech game these days is the inevitably of Elon Musk making news. This week was no exception, with the Tesla boss in the media today for <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot/">turning on in-car cameras when their driver assistance is switched on</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/the-financial-pickle-facing-elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-system/">his Boring company’s Las Vegas tunnel challenges</a></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The EU examines TikTok: </strong>The tech-and-government theme we’ve tracked all week continued today <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/eu-to-review-tiktoks-tos-after-child-safety-complaints/">with the European Union launching</a></strong> “what it described as ‘a formal dialogue’ with the video sharing platform over its commercial practices and policy.” The social media giant’s kid-focused policies appear to be in the EU’s crosshairs.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare can be lucrative startup ground: </strong>That’s what we learned reading Doximity’s IPO filing this morning. The venture-backed health tech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/doximitys-s-1-may-explain-why-healthcare-exits-are-heating-up/">grew like a weed during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and is capitalizing on its gains by going public while markets are hot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>Let’s wrap this week with startups that are challenging the status quo, shall we?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/penfold-closes-8-5m-to-provide-a-full-stack-pension-in-an-app-aimed-at-freelancers/"><strong>Penfold just raised $8.5 million to keep pensions alive</strong></a><strong>: </strong>In your part of the world the pension may be dead, but Penfold wants to keep the retirement plan alive in the U.K. With a mobile app. Sure, your company has probably given up on the idea that it should materially provide for workers’ post-work existence, but Penfold is betting that its freelancer-friendly pension system will find purchase in its market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/kitt-an-office-outfitter-as-a-service-raises-5m-seed-round-led-by-barclay-ventures/"><strong>Kitt put together a $5 million round to build out your next office</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Parts of the world are slowly circling back to the idea of going to the office. Kitt wants to take advantage of the trend by “a ‘fully customizable’ workspace solution to tenants via its landlord partners,” TechCrunch reports. Everyone seems to agree that post-COVID office life will look different. Here’s a startup trying to help design that future.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/anthropic-is-the-new-ai-research-outfit-from-openais-dario-amodei-and-it-has-124m-to-burn/"><strong>Anthropic pulls together $124 million to make AI more steerable</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Some of the folks behind GPT-3 have a pile of new money for their AI-focused startup. But unlike most AI-centered startups, the company appears to be working on model <em>tuning</em> over building something to, say, do one particularly focused task.</p>
<p>“Today [in AI] the general rule is: The more powerful the system, the harder it is to explain its actions,” Devin reports, adding that that’s “not exactly a good trend.” Perhaps Anthropic can build the AI tuning dials we’ve long needed. It certainly now has the money to pursue its vision.</p>
<h2>Dismantling the myths around raising your first check</h2>
<p>The growing complexity of fundraising has the opportunity to make tech either inclusive or exclusive. For new founders looking to raise money, let’s dismantle the myths about raising your first check and instead focus on how investors and other successful founders describe the nuance needed to secure money.</p>
<p>Natasha Mascarenhas spoke to Elizabeth Yin, founding partner of Hustle Fund, and Leslie Feinzaig, founder of Female Founders Collective, to get their candid thoughts about the challenges first-time founders face when fundraising.</p>
<p>According to Yin, all startups should be able to reach one of two goals: by the fifth year, achieve $100 million ARR or a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>“This is hard to do,” she said. “And most businesses will never get there — not for a lack of trying — but there’s a lot of luck whether your idea has that much demand that quickly.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Closing this week with a mote of Big Tech news, once again centered around the rising tension between technology companies and the Indian government. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/facebook-whatsapp-google-and-other-internet-giants-comply-with-indias-it-rules/">own Manish Singh reports that</a> “Google, Facebook, Telegram, LinkedIn and Tiger Global-backed Indian startups ShareChat and Koo have either fully or partially complied with the South Asian nation’s new IT rules, according to two people familiar with the matter and a government note obtained by TechCrunch.”</p>
<p>Singh goes on to note that “Twitter has yet to comply with the rules.” We saw earlier this week how Twitter is pushing back against the Indian government after it tried to use force to intimidate the American social network into going against its own policies in defense of its party’s political goals.</p>
<p>American social networks born in an environment where they had plenty of room to experiment and maneuver have a history of running afoul of foreign governments with either <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html">rising autocratic tendencies</a> or a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/chinese-app-that-let-users-access-google-facebook-has-disappeared.html">fondness for full-blown control</a>. This is no exception. The question is whether Twitter will wind up a cautionary tale in its argument with the Indian government, or a guiding light.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The notion of digital transformation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/31/digital-transformation-requires-total-organizational-commitment/">evolved from a buzzword</a> joke to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic/">critical and accelerating fact</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">The changes wrought by</a> a global shift to remote work and schooling are myriad, but in the business realm they have yielded a change in corporate behavior and consumer expectation &#8212; changes that showed up in a bushel of earnings reports this week.</p>
<p>TechCrunch may tend to have a private-company focus, but we do keep tabs on public companies in the tech world as they often provide hints, notes and other pointers on how startups may be faring. In this case, however, we’re working in reverse; startups have told us for several quarters now that their markets are picking up momentum as customers shake up their buying behavior with a distinct advantage for companies helping customers move into the digital realm. And public company results are now confirming the startups’ perspective.</p>
<p>The accelerating digital transformation is real, and we have the data to support the point.</p>
<p>What follows is a digest of notes concerning the recent earnings results from Box, Sprout Social, Yext, Snowflake and Salesforce. We’ll approach each in micro to save time, but as always there’s more digging to be done if you have time. Let’s go!</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Customer experience and digital transformation concepts are merging during the pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic/embed/#?secret=nY1rwBEZXR" data-secret="nY1rwBEZXR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Enterprise earnings go up</h2>
<p>Kicking off with <a href="http://yext.com">Yext</a>, the company beat expectations in its most recent quarter. Today its shares are up 18%. And a call with the company’s CEO Howard Lerman underscored our general thesis regarding the digital transformation’s acceleration.</p>
<p>In brief, Yext’s evolution from a company that plugged corporate information into external search engines to building and selling search tech itself has been resonating in the market. Why? Lerman explained that consumers more and more expect digital service in response to their questions &#8212; &#8220;who wants to call a 1-800 number,&#8221; he asked rhetorically &#8212; which is forcing companies to rethink the way they handle customer inquiries.</p>
<p>In turn, those companies are looking to companies like Yext that offer technology to better answer customer queries in a digital format. It’s customer-friendly, and could save companies money as call centers are expensive. A change in behavior accelerated by the pandemic is forcing companies to adapt, driving their purchase of more digital technologies like this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s proof that a transformation doesn&#8217;t have to be dramatic to have pretty strong impacts on how corporations buy and sell online.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This may seem like a great time to launch a SaaS startup, but the landscape is crowded with well-designed applications that promise &#8220;blazingly fast and delightfully simple&#8221; experiences, according to seed-stage investor John Chen of Fika Ventures.</p>
<p>Most SaaS startups will fail, but not because of a sour marketing campaign or server downtime. The majority of these companies will fall victim to what Chen calls &#8220;the myth of frictionless onboarding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the hype about ease of use, enterprise companies always ask customers to abandon familiar tools so they can learn something new.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Just like with a new fitness program, participants feel good after completing the workout, but it takes a lot of activation energy to start and hard work to get there,&#8221; Chen notes.</p>

<p>Instead of putting the onus on customers to roll up their sleeves, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/saas-needs-to-take-a-page-out-of-the-crypto-playbook/">he suggests that SaaS startups learn from cryptocurrency culture</a> and find ways to &#8220;incentivize users to do the necessary work to have the right experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>But how do you encourage users to put in the time and effort required to produce an optimal customer experience?</p>
<p>&#8220;In a world where there is a surplus of alternatives for every job to be done, the scarce resource is not content, tooling, or hacks and tricks,&#8221; says Chen. &#8220;It’s attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re off on Monday, May 31 in observance of Memorial Day; I hope you have a relaxing weekend!</p>

<p>As startups and venture capital grow in tandem, fundraising has gone from a formal affair on Sand Hill Road to a process that can happen anywhere from Twitter to Zoom.</p>
<p>While fundraising may no longer require a trip to California, it might depend on whether you got an invite to a private audio app. And while you may not need to be an insider, second-time founders — largely male and white — still have a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The growing complexity of fundraising has the opportunity to make tech either inclusive or exclusive.</p>
<p>VC is the flashy gold medal, but the rapid growth of emerging fund managers means that a first check can be piecemealed together from a variety of different sources. The options for financing are seemingly endless: syndicates, public crowdfunding, VC firms, accelerators, debt financing, rolling funds, and, for the profitable few, bootstrapping.</p>

<p>Telehealth startup Doximity filed to go public earlier today. Notably, the company has not fundraised since 2014, a year in which it attracted just under $82 million at a valuation of $355 million, per PitchBook data.</p>
<p>How has it managed to not raise money for so long? By generating lots of cash and profit over the years. Healthtech communications, it turns out, can be a lucrative endeavor.</p>

<p>The spin-out of video platform Vimeo from IAC completed this week, and the smaller company is now trading as an independent entity under the ticker &#8216;VMEO&#8217;.</p>
<p>If you missed the news that the internet conglomerate was spinning out the video service, don’t feel bad; it slipped past many radars. But with the company now trading, our access to its historical results, and our minds still enthralled by YouTube’s recent financial performance for Alphabet, it’s worth taking a moment to digest the company’s health.</p>

<p>The Flywire IPO is neat from a financial perspective and notable in that it’s a Boston exit as opposed to yet another New York or San Francisco-based flotation. It’s nice to see some other cities put points on the board.</p>
<p>But more than that, this IPO is a useful measuring stick for keeping tabs on the IPO market as a whole. This year and the last are shaping up to be key exit periods for startups and unicorns of all shapes and sizes; many a venture capital fund return rests on these public debuts.</p>

<p>Cities like Miami, Pittsburgh and Austin have been drawing talent and wealth from Silicon Valley for years, but the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend.</p>
<p>In recent months, many investors and entrepreneurs have noisily departed for Miami, citing the region’s favorable business climate and quality of life.</p>
<p>It’s always good to consider one’s options, but before booking a moving van for the Sunshine State — or any emerging tech hub, for that matter — here are some basic questions entrepreneurs should ask themselves.</p>

<p>In just a few short years, Vise has gone from launching on the Disrupt Battlefield stage to a unicorn. Co-founders Samir Vasavada and Runik Mehrotra met Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire at an after-party at the event, and Maguire ended up leading a seed and Series A round while Sequoia led the Series B.</p>
<p>Last week, Vise raised its Series C of $65 million and was officially valued at $1 billion post-money.</p>
<p>We spoke to the pair about the early fundraising process for Vise, what Vasavada has learned about delivering a good fundraising pitch, and what stood out about the pitch and the product for Maguire.</p>

<p>Another day, another unicorn public offering.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it was Acorns, a consumer fintech service that blends saving and investing into a freemium product.</p>
<p>Acorns fits inside the larger savings-and-investing boom seen over the last four or five quarters as consumers buffeted by the economic changes brought on by COVID-19 turned to stashing cash and boosting their equities investing cadence.</p>
<p>By now this is old news, but we haven’t had a clear picture of the economics of consumer fintech startups accelerated by the pandemic. Now that Acorns has decided to list via a SPAC — more on that in a moment — we do.</p>

<p>The world of hybrid work is here, and the usual 10-minute intro call, swag bag and first-day team lunch are just not enough to make your new employee feel welcome.</p>
<p>While many companies have found a way to interview and select candidates in a fully remote environment, few have spent time and resources on aligning the &#8220;pre-boarding&#8221; and onboarding process for the new hybrid world of work. Many employers still rely on old ways of welcoming new hires, despite our totally changed work environment.</p>
<p>It’s important to capitalize on candidates’ enthusiasm and eagerness from the moment the offer is signed instead of when they log in on Day One, because first impressions can make or break a candidate’s chances of staying at a company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in the U.S. the concept of using a driver’s data to decide the cost of auto insurance premiums is not a new one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in markets like Brazil, the idea is still considered relatively novel. A new startup called Justos claims it will be the first Brazilian insurer to use drivers’ data to reward those who drive safely by offering “fairer” prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now Justos has raised about $2.8 million in a seed round led by Kaszek, one of the largest and most active VC firms in Latin America. Big Bets also participated in the round, along with the CEOs of seven unicorns, including Assaf Wand, CEO and co-founder of Hippo Insurance; David Vélez, founder and CEO of Nubank; Carlos Garcia, founder and CEO of Kavak; Sergio Furio, founder and CEO of Creditas; Patrick Sigrist, founder of iFood and Fritz Lanman, CEO of ClassPass. (There&#8217;s a seventh CEO who wishes to remain anonymous). Senior executives from Robinhood, Stripe, Wise, Carta and Capital One also put money in the round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serial entrepreneurs Dhaval Chadha, Jorge Soto Moreno and Antonio</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Molins co-founded Justos, having most recently worked at various Silicon Valley-based companies including ClassPass, Netflix and Airbnb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While we have been friends for a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">while, it was a coincidence that all three of us were thinking about building something new</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in Latin America,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chadha said. “We</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent two months studying</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">possible paths, talking to people and investors in the United States, Brazil and Mexico, until</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">we came up with the idea of creating an insurance company that can modernize the sector,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">starting with auto insurance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the trio decided that the auto insurance market would be an ideal sector considering that in Brazil, an estimated more than 70% of cars are not insured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process to get insurance in the country, by any accounts, is a slow one. It takes up to 72 hours to receive initial coverage and two weeks to receive the final insurance policy. Insurers also take their time in resolving claims related to car damages and loss due to accidents, the entrepreneurs say. They also charge that pricing is often not fair or transparent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos aims to improve the whole auto insurance process in Brazil by measuring the way people drive to help price their</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance policies. Similar to Root here in the U.S., Justos </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intends to collect users&#8217; data through their mobile phones so that it can “more accurately and assertively price different types of risk.” This way, the startup claims it can offer plans  that are up to 30% cheaper than traditional plans, and grant discounts each month, according to the driving patterns of the previous month of each customer. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We measure how safely people drive using the sensors on their cell phones,” Chadha said. “This allows us to offer cheaper insurance to users who drive well, thereby reducing biases that are inherent in the pricing models used by traditional insurance companies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos also plans to use artificial intelligence and computerized vision to analyze and process claims more quickly and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">machine learning for image analysis and to create bots that help accelerate claims processing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are building a design-driven, mobile first and customer experience that aims to revolutionize insurance in Brazil, similar to what Nubank did with banking,” Chadha told TechCrunch. “We will be eliminating any hidden fees, a lot of the small text and insurance-specific jargon that is very confusing for customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos will offer its product directly to its customers as well as through distribution</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">channels like banks and brokers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By going direct to consumer, we are able to acquire users cheaper than our competitors and give back the savings to our users in the form of cheaper prices,” Chadha said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers will be able to buy insurance through Justos’ app, website or even WhatsApp. For now, the company is only adding potential customers to a waitlist but plans to begin selling policies later this year..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, the auto insurance sector in Brazil declined by 1%, according to Chadha, who believes that indicates “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">there is latent demand raring to go once things open up again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos has a social good component as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos intends to cap its profits and give any leftover revenue back to nonprofit organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also has an ambitious goal: to help make insurance become universally accessible around the world and the roads safer in general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People will face everyday risks with a greater sense of safety and adventure. Road accidents will reduce drastically as a result of incentives for safer driving, and the streets will be safer,” Chadha said. “People, rather than profits, will become the focus of the insurance industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos plans to use its new capital to set up operations, such as forming partnerships with reinsurers and an insurance company for fronting, since it is starting as an MGA (managing general agent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also working on building out its products such as apps, its back end and internal operations tools, as well as designing all its processes for underwriting, claims and finance. Justos’ data science team is also building out its own pricing model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup will be focused on Brazil, with plans to eventually expand within Latin America, then Iberia and Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek’s Andy Young said his firm was impressed by the team’s previous experience and passion for what they’re building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a huge space, ripe for innovation and this is the type of team that can take it to the next level,” Young told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as taken an approach to building an insurance platform that blends being consumer-centric and data-driven to produce something that is not only cheaper and rewards safety but as the brand implies in Portuguese, is fairer.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook made a few noteworthy changes to its misinformation policies this week, including the news that the company will now allow claims that COVID was created by humans — a theory that contradicts the previously prevailing assumption that humans picked up the virus naturally from animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made from our apps,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is adjusting its rules about pandemic misinformation in light of international investigations legitimating the theory that the virus could have escaped from a lab. While that theory clearly has enough credibility to be investigated at this point, it is often interwoven with demonstrably false misinformation about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/the-pandemic-is-already-reshaping-techs-misinformation-crisis/">fake cures</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/coronavirus-5g-covid-19-conspiracy-theory-misinformation/">5G towers causing COVID</a> and most recently the false claim that the<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-astrazeneca-bluetooth-idUSL2N2NC2G9"> AstraZeneca vaccine implants recipients with a Bluetooth chip</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this week, President Biden ordered a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/26/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-investigation-into-the-origins-of-covid-19/">multi-agency intelligence report</a> evaluating if the virus could have accidentally leaked out of a lab in Wuhan, China. Biden called this possibility one of two &#8220;likely scenarios.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230; Shortly after I became President, in March, I had my National Security Advisor task the Intelligence Community to prepare a report on their most up-to-date analysis of the origins of COVID-19, including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident,&#8221; Biden said in an official White House statement, adding that there isn&#8217;t sufficient evidence to make a final determination.</p>
<p>Claims that the virus was man-made or lab-made have circulated widely since the pandemic&#8217;s earliest days, even as the scientific community largely maintained that the virus probably made the jump from an infected animal to a human via natural means. But many questions remain about the origins of the virus and the U.S. has yet to rule out the possibility that the virus emerged from a Chinese lab — a scenario that would be a bombshell for international relations.</p>
<p>Prior to the COVID policy change, Facebook announced that it would finally implement <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/taking-action-against-people-who-repeatedly-share-misinformation/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">harsher punishments</a> against individuals who repeatedly peddle misinformation. The company will now throttle the News Feed reach of all posts from accounts that are found to habitually share known misinformation, restrictions it previously put in place for Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts and websites that repeatedly break the same rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As AI has grown from a menagerie of research projects to include a handful of titanic, industry-powering models like GPT-3, there is a need for the sector to evolve — or so thinks Dario Amodei, former VP of research at OpenAI, who struck out on his own to create a new company a few months ago. <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>, as it&#8217;s called, was founded with his sister Daniela and its goal is to create &#8220;large-scale AI systems that are steerable, interpretable, and robust.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenge the siblings Amodei are tackling is simply that these AI models, while incredibly powerful, are not well understood. GPT-3, which they worked on, is an astonishingly versatile language system that can produce extremely convincing text in practically any style, and on any topic.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hDo1z2rXH9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable/">Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable/embed/#?secret=hDo1z2rXH9" data-secret="hDo1z2rXH9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But say you had it generate rhyming couplets with Shakespeare and Pope as examples. How does it do it? What is it &#8220;thinking&#8221;? Which knob would you tweak, which dial would you turn, to make it more melancholy, less romantic, or limit its diction and lexicon in specific ways? Certainly there are parameters to change here and there, but really no one knows exactly how this extremely convincing language sausage is being made.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to not know when an AI model is generating poetry, quite another when the model is watching a department store for suspicious behavior, or fetching legal precedents for a judge about to pass down a sentence. Today the general rule is: the more powerful the system, the harder it is to explain its actions. That&#8217;s not exactly a good trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large, general systems of today can have significant benefits, but can also be unpredictable, unreliable, and opaque: our goal is to make progress on these issues,&#8221; reads the company&#8217;s self-description. &#8220;For now, we’re primarily focused on research towards these goals; down the road, we foresee many opportunities for our work to create value commercially and for public benefit.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to announce what we’ve been working on this year &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AnthropicAI</a>, an AI safety and research company. If you’d like to help us combine safety research with scaling ML models while thinking about societal impacts, check out our careers page <a href="https://t.co/TVHA0t7VLc">https://t.co/TVHA0t7VLc</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The goal seems to be to integrate safety principles into the existing priority system of AI development that generally favors efficiency and power. Like any other industry, it&#8217;s easier and more effective to incorporate something from the beginning than to bolt it on at the end. Attempting to make some of the biggest models out there able to be picked apart and understood may be more work than building them in the first place. Anthropic seems to be starting fresh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthropic’s goal is to make the fundamental research advances that will let us build more capable, general, and reliable AI systems, then deploy these systems in a way that benefits people,&#8221; said Dario Amodei, CEO of the new venture, in a short post announcing the company and its $124 million in funding.</p>
<p>That funding, by the way, is as star-studded as you might expect. It was led by Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and included James McClave, Dustin Moskovitz, Eric Schmidt and the Center for Emerging Risk Research, among others.</p>
<p>The company is a public benefit corporation, and the plan for now, as the limited information on the site suggests, is to remain heads-down on researching these fundamental questions of how to make large models more tractable and interpretable. We can expect more information later this year, perhaps, as the mission and team coalesces and initial results pan out.</p>
<p>The name, incidentally, is adjacent to anthropocentric, and concerns relevancy to human experience or existence. Perhaps it derives from the &#8220;Anthropic principle,&#8221; the notion that intelligent life is possible in the universe because&#8230; well, we&#8217;re here. If intelligence is inevitable under the right conditions, the company just has to create those conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Please see update below&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Restrictions put in place by Nevada regulators are making it difficult for The Boring Company (TBC) to meet contractual targets for its LVCC Loop, Elon Musk&#8217;s first underground transportation system.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/lvcc">Loop system</a> at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) is supposed to use more than 60 fully autonomous high-speed vehicles to transport 4,400 passengers an hour between exhibition halls. However, TechCrunch has been told that Clark County regulators have approved just 11 human-driven vehicles so far, set strict speed limits and forbidden the use of on-board collision-avoidance technology that is part of Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;full self-driving&#8221; Autopilot advanced driver assistance system. Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system technically does not rise to the level of fully autonomous, even though it is branded as such. It is considered — even internally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/tesla-refutes-elon-musks-timeline-on-full-self-driving/">according to exchanges between Tesla and California regulators</a> — an advanced driver assistance system that can automate certain functions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LVCC’s parent body, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitor’s Authority, created a contract aimed at incentivizing Musk and ensuring promises are met. The contract is for a fixed price, and TBC has to hit specific milestones to receive all of its payments. The contract provides payments at different points in the process, such as completing the bare tunnels, the entire working system, finishing a <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">test period and safety report and then demonstrating it can carry passengers. The final three milestones relate to how many passengers it can carry. If the Loop can demonstrate moving 2,200 passengers an hour, TBC will get $4.4 million, then the same payment again for hitting 3,300, and the same again for 4,400 passengers an hour. Together, these capacity payments represent 30% of the fixed-price contract.</span></p>
<p>Instead of moving more than 4,000 passengers an hour, the constrained system could limit the capacity to less than 1,000, exposing TBC to hefty penalties for missing contractual targets. TBC doesn&#8217;t generate revenue from charging passengers (the rides are free).</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Shortly after publication, Steve Hill, president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), <a href="https://twitter.com/SHillforVegas/status/1398497136623247361?s=20">tweeted that a Loop</a> test this week, with a few hundred participants, had demonstrated its planned 4,400 passenger per hour capacity. This could release the additional construction funds mentioned below. TBC still has to achieve this figure during actual conferences in the months ahead to avoid penalties. TechCrunch shared its reporting with the LVCVA, Clark Country and TBC numerous times, over a period of weeks, prior to publication. Only LVCVA provided a substantive reply, and none addressed the question of capacity, nor the outstanding questions about children or passengers with mobility issues.</p>
<p>For instance, during a large trade show like CES, the LVCC will pay TBC $30,000 for every day it operates and manages the system, according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20702362-2021-1-management-agreement-feb-4-final">management agreement</a> newly obtained by TechCrunch. However, the original contract signed by TBC in 2019 specifies a $300,000 penalty for each large convention where TBC cannot move around 4,000 people per hour.</p>
<p>This means that over the course of a three- or four-day event, TBC stands to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars, above and beyond the cost of running the system. In a typical pre-pandemic year, LVCC would host around a dozen such large shows. It&#8217;s unclear if TBC is planning on another means of making money such as revenue from advertising in its cars.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Boring Company goes brick-and-mortar with The Brick Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/16/elon-musk-boring-company-the-brick-store/embed/#?secret=Nf5h7wegCw" data-secret="Nf5h7wegCw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This capacity issue is already costing TBC money. The contract states that if TBC misses its performance target by such a margin, Musk’s company will not receive more than $13 million of its construction budget. The convention center authority confirmed to TechCrunch that, per its contract, it is withholding that construction fee until TBC can demonstrate moving thousands of people an hour.</p>
<p>Smaller shows, numbering about 20 a year, carry no capacity penalties but earn TBC a much smaller fee of just $11,500 a day, according to the agreement. TBC also receives a monthly payment of $167,000 to keep the system ticking over, regardless of how many conventions are running.</p>
<p>A capacity test of the Loop this week <a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/las-vegas-convention-center-prepares-for-return-of-business">reportedly involved just 300 people</a>; a Convention Center official did say the 4,400 people-per-hour figure was &#8220;well within our sights.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as its team of human drivers, TBC has to staff an operations center and a maintenance and charging facility, and provide uniformed customer service personnel, security staff and a full-time resident manager, according to the management agreement.</p>
<p>The fee structure is set to be renegotiated &#8212; presumably downwards &#8212; by the end of 2021, to incorporate the &#8220;expected transition to autonomous vehicle operations.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Collision warnings out</h2>
<p>Some of the restrictions on the Loop&#8217;s initial operation came from the Clark County Department of Building and Fire Prevention. These reportedly include a 40 mph overall speed limit, dropping to 10 mph within each of the Loop&#8217;s three stations, and a restriction to just 11 vehicles.</p>
<p>Deputy Fire Chief Warren Whitney of the Clark County Fire Department said that TBC had told him the company wasn&#8217;t allowed to use Tesla&#8217;s collision warning systems within the Loop. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20792266-2021-5-11-ats-certificate">transportation system certificate</a> issued by Clark County this week specified that the Loop must use &#8220;non-autonomous&#8221; &#8220;manually driven&#8221; vehicles. It was issued for the planned 62 vehicles. Neither Clark County officials nor TBC provided responses to detailed questions on the operational restrictions, nor indicated when or if they could be lifted.</p>
<p>Toyota has previously warned that its radar-based collision warning system may not function correctly within tunnels.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the Teslas are capable of safe and &#8220;fully autonomous operation&#8221; without their collision-warning radars, although Musk has suggested &#8212; and now executed on a plan &#8212; to remove radar sensors from its vehicles and only use cameras. Tesla started delivering Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in May that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america/">do not have radar sensors</a>. The lack of radar sensors has prompted the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration to say that Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built on or after April 27, 2021 will no longer receive the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot/">agency&#8217;s check mark</a> for automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane departure warning and dynamic brake support. The decision also prompted Consumer Reports to no longer list the Model 3 as a Top Pick, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said it plans to remove the Model 3&#8217;s Top Safety Pick+ designation.</p>
<p>The Fire Department also had concerns about dealing with emergencies within the tunnels, including battery fires that can potentially last many hours. &#8220;There have been cases where electric cars have caught fire without an accident,&#8221; Whitney told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our plan right now would be just to get the people out, then pull back and let the fire continue to burn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whitney noted the system has many cameras and smoke alarms, as well as a &#8220;robust&#8221; ventilation system that can move 400,000 cubic feet of air per minute in either direction down the tunnels. This should allow passengers and drivers to escape on foot around the cars. For less serious incidents, TBC has a tow vehicle (also a Tesla) to extract broken-down cars.</p>
<p>Neither TBC nor Clark County replied to TechCrunch queries about whether the Loop would be allowed to transport wheelchair users, children or infants usually requiring car seats, people with other mobility issues or pets and support animals.</p>
<p>Firefighters have already conducted multiple drills in the underground system, including simulated accidents far from a station, with two or three other vehicles in the way. &#8220;Eleven cars is definitely doable,&#8221; says Whitney. &#8220;But when you start increasing numbers of cars, it may be a problem. [TBC] is a for-profit company and is going want to maximize the efficiency, so there may be further discussions as they try to increase the capacity.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Expansion plans</h2>
<p>Not only does TBC want to use more vehicles in the existing Loop, it is already planning to expand the system. At the end of March, TBC told Clark County that it had broken ground on an extension from one LVCC station to the new Resorts World hotel, and it is has permission for a similar spur to the Encore nearby.</p>
<p>More significantly, TBC also wants to build a transit system covering much of the Strip and downtown Las Vegas with more than 40 stations connecting dozens of hotels, attractions and, ultimately, the airport. That system would be financed by TBC and supported by ticket sales.</p>
<p>The viability of those expansions could depend on how soon TBC can meet the technological and operational promises it made for its relatively simple LVCC Loop, and demonstrate whether taxis in tunnels can generate as much revenue as they do column inches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google, Facebook, Telegram, LinkedIn and Tiger Global-backed Indian startups ShareChat and Koo have either fully or partially complied with the South Asian nation’s new IT rules, according to two people familiar with the matter and a government note obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>India’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new IT rules</a>, unveiled in February this year, require firms to appoint and share contact details of representatives tasked with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">compliance, nodal point of reference and grievance redressals to address on-ground concerns. </span></p>
<p>The aforementioned firms have complied with this requirement, the government note and a person familiar with the matter said. The firms were required to comply with the new IT rules by this week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter has yet to comply with the rules. “Twitter sent a communication late last night, sharing details of a lawyer working in a law firm in India as their Nodal Contact Person and Grievance Officer,” a note prepared by New Delhi said, adding that the rules require the aforementioned officials to be direct employees.</p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between Twitter and the government of India of late. This week, police in Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">visited Twitter offices to “serve a notice” about an investigation</a> into its intel on classifying Indian politicians’ tweets as misleading. Twitter called the move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-says-concerned-with-india-intimidation-requests-3-more-months-to-comply-with-new-it-rules/">a form of intimidation</a>, cited concerns about its employees and requested the government to respect citizens&#8217; rights to free speech.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google, Facebook and Twitter threaten to leave Pakistan over censorship law&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-censorship-law/embed/#?secret=99gNi9AaUM" data-secret="99gNi9AaUM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>WhatsApp has complied with the aforementioned rules, but not with the requirement about traceability, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">sued the Indian government earlier this week</a> over the requirement about bringing a way to trace the originator of messages. WhatsApp said it would have to compromise every users&#8217; privacy to be able to comply with this rule.</p>
<p>It is unclear at this point whether Apple, which operates iMessage, and Signal have complied with the rules.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on Wednesday had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/india-says-whatsapps-lawsuit-over-new-regulations-a-clear-act-of-defiance/">asked the social media firms for an update on their compliant status</a>, TechCrunch first reported.</p>
<p>India is a key overseas market for several technology giants, including Facebook and Google, both of which identify the nation as its biggest market by users. Neighboring nation Pakistan, which had proposed similar rules as India last year, had to withdraw them after tech giants united and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-censorship-law/">threatened to leave the nation</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great news for typo-prone tweeters: Twitter Blue, a $2.99 monthly subscription, appears to be coming soon to a Timeline near you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, researcher Jane Manchun Wong </span><a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Twitter’s new subscription service is in the works. But yesterday, Twitter’s iOS App Store listing updated to list Twitter Blue as an in-app purchase, confirming earlier findings from this unofficial source. Though users can’t yet subscribe to Twitter Blue – even after downloading the app update – Wong dug up details about the service, signaling that its launch could be imminent.  </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158813" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158813" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2158813" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wong-twitter-2.jpeg?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wong-twitter-2.jpeg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wong-twitter-2.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wong-twitter-2.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wong-twitter-2.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wong-twitter-2.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158813" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jane Manchun Wong <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the undo button, which Wong </span><a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1367704041942179841"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uncovered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as early as March, this service will include a reader mode, which turns tweet threads into “easy-to-read text.” Twitter acquired </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year in an effort to improve users’ reading experience on the app, so this addition makes sense. Plus, users will be able to change the color of the Twitter app icon, as well as the color theme of their Timeline, a feature that’s already available on the web. Twitter Blue subscribers can also organize tweets into <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393287285156859911">Collections</a> – this feature looks like an updated version of Bookmarks, but with the added ability to organize tweets into folders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/twitter-teases-its-upcoming-premium-service-which-it-plans-to-release-globally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter ads make up 85%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the company’s revenue. Twitter told </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg in February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it plans to “research and experiment” with new ways to monetize the platform, especially as its user growth has </span><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/twitter-posts-strong-revenue-result-in-q3-as-user-growth-slows/588093/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slowed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But over</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the last several months, Twitter has teased some of the platform’s biggest changes since doubling the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/twitters-doubling-of-character-count-from-140-to-280-had-little-impact-on-length-of-tweets/">140-character tweet limit</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018. These features include </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Super Follows</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">Tip Jar</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Twitter Spaces</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week at J.P. Morgan’s Global Technology, Media, and Communications conference, Twitter CFO Ned Segal </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/twitter-teases-its-upcoming-premium-service-which-it-plans-to-release-globally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">indicated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the company views Twitter Blue and Super Follows as two separate types of subscriptions. On Google Play, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">the Twitter app</a> page lists an in-app product priced at $4.99 per item, which might indicate the upcoming launch of Super Follows, too. Segal also said that Twitter would offer more information about the service in the coming months, then “ultimately roll it out to people around the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, for those of us wondering – no, there’s no indication of plans for an “edit tweet” button at this time. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. Naturally, we do this by having candid conversations with founders and their investors.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll sit down with MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner Marlon Nichols and Wonderschool co-founder and CEO Chris Bennett. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-mac-venture-capital-and-wonderschool">REGISTER HERE FOR FREE!</a></p>
<p>Not only will we discuss how they came together for Wonderschool&#8217;s seed round in 2017, but how that translated into what has become a total of $24 million in funding from VCs like a16z and First Round Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll also host the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, where folks in the audience can pitch their startup to Nichols and Bennett to get their live feedback.</p>
<p>Nichols is a former Kauffman Fellow and Investment Director at Intel Capital. His portfolio includes Gimlet Media, MongoDB, Thrive Market, PlayVS, Fair, LISNR, Mayvenn, Blavity and Wonderschool. Nichols knows more than most of us will ever learn about seed-stage fundraising, and even gave a chat at TechCrunch Early Stage in April that outlines four strategies for securing seed funding.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll get even deeper on that subject with Nichols, and hear the perspective from the other side of the table with Bennett.</p>
<p>Wonderschool is a network of early childhood programs that combine the quality of top-notch early education with an in-home setting.</p>
<p>Bennett can talk extensively on edtech as a sector, and we&#8217;ll pick both his and Nichols&#8217; mind on that fast-growing space.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that this episode will feature an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, so founders in the audience should be ready to &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; and get in the mix.</p>
<p>The episode goes down on Wednesday, June 16 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT. Extra Crunch Live is accessible to anyone who wants to attend, but on-demand access to the content, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">entire library of ECL episodes</a>, is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Join now to check out what Aileen Lee, Roelof Botha, Mark Cuban and more had to say on earlier episodes of ECL. </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has a month to respond to concerns raised by European consumer protection agencies earlier this year, EU lawmakers <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_2744">said today</a>.</p>
<p>The Commission has launched what it described as &#8220;a formal dialogue&#8221; with the video sharing platform over its commercial practices and policy.</p>
<p>Areas of specific concern include hidden marketing, aggressive advertising techniques targeted at children and certain contractual terms in TikTok&#8217;s policies that could be considered misleading and confusing for consumers, per the Commission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Commenting in a statement, justice commissioner Didier Reynders added: “The current pandemic has further accelerated digitalisation. This has brought new opportunities but it has also created new risks, in particular for vulnerable consumers. In the European Union, it is prohibited to target children and minors with disguised advertising such as banners in videos. The dialogue we are launching today should support TikTok in complying with EU rules to protect consumers.”</p>
<p>The background to this is that back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">February</a> the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) sent the Commission a report calling out a number of TikTok&#8217;s policies and practices &#8212; including what it said were unfair terms and copyright practices. It also flagged the risk of children being exposed to inappropriate content on the platform, and accused TikTok of misleading data processing and privacy practices.</p>
<p>Complaints were filed around the same time by consumer organisations in 15 EU countries &#8212; urging those national authorities to investigate the social media giant’s conduct.</p>
<p>The multi-pronged EU action means TikTok has not just the Commission looking at the detail of its small print but is facing questions from a network of national consumer protection authorities &#8212; which is being co-led by the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (which handles privacy issues related to the platform).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the BEUC queried why the Commission hasn&#8217;t yet launched a formal enforcement procedure.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">“</span><span lang="EN-GB">We hope that the authorities will stick to their guns in this &#8216;dialogue&#8217; which we understand is not yet a formal launch of an enforcement procedure. It must lead to good results for consumers, tackling all the points that BEUC raised. BEUC also hopes to be consulted before an agreement is reached,&#8221; a spokesperson for the organization told us. </span></p>
<p>Also reached for comment, TikTok sent us this statement on the Commission&#8217;s action, attributed to its director of public policy, Caroline Greer: <b><br />
</b></p>
<blockquote><p>As part of our ongoing engagement with regulators and other external stakeholders over issues such as consumer protection and transparency, we are engaging in a dialogue with the Irish Consumer Protection Commission and the Swedish Consumer Agency and look forward to discussing the measures we&#8217;ve already introduced. In addition, we have taken a number of steps to protect our younger users, including making all under-16 accounts private-by-default, and disabling their access to direct messaging. Further, users under 18 cannot buy, send or receive virtual gifts, and we have strict policies prohibiting advertising directly appealing to those under the age of digital consent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company told us it uses age verification for personalized ads &#8212; saying users must have verified that they are 13+ to receive these ads; as well as being over the age of digital consent in their respective EU country; and also having consented to receive targeted ads.</p>
<p>However, TikTok&#8217;s age verification technology has been criticized as weak before now &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/tiktok-will-recheck-the-age-of-every-user-in-italy-after-dpa-order/">recent emergency child-safety-focused enforcement action</a> by the Italian national data protection agency has led to TikTok having to pledge to strengthen its age verification processes in the country.</p>
<p>The Italian enforcement action also resulted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users/">TikTok removing more than 500,000 accounts</a> suspected of belonging to users aged younger than 13 earlier this month &#8212; raising further questions about whether it can really claim that under-13s aren&#8217;t routinely exposed to targeted ads on its platform.</p>

<p>In further background remarks it sent us, TikTok claimed it has clear labelling of sponsored content. But it also noted it&#8217;s made some recent changes &#8212; such as switching the label it applies on video advertising from &#8220;sponsored&#8221; to &#8220;ad&#8221; to make it clearer.</p>
<p>It also said it&#8217;s working on a toggle that aims to make it clearer to users when they may be exposed to advertising by other users by enabling the latter users to prominently disclose that their content contains advertising.</p>
<p>TikTok said the tool is currently in beta testing in Europe but it said it expects to move to general availability this summer and will also amend its ToS to require users to use this toggle whenever their content contains advertising. (But without adequate enforcement that may just end up as another overlooked and easily abused setting.)</p>
<p>The company recently announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/tiktok-to-open-a-transparency-center-in-europe-to-take-content-and-security-questions/">transparency center in Europe</a> in a move that looks intended to counter some of the concerns being raised about its business in the region, as well as to prepare it for the increased oversight that&#8217;s coming down the pipe for all digital platforms operating in the EU &#8212; as the bloc works to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">update its digital rulebook</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The events of the past year have only served to accelerate interest in all things robotics and automation. It’s a phenomenon we’ve seen across a broad range of categories, and automotive is certainly no different.</p>
<p>Of course, carmakers are no strangers to the world of robotics. Automation has long played a key role in manufacturing, and more recently, robotics have played another central role in the form of self-driving vehicles. For this panel, however, we’re going to look past those much-discussed categories. Of late, carmakers have been investing heavily to further fuel innovation in the category.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating space &#8212; and one that covers a broad range of cross-sections, from TRI’s (Toyota) Woven City project to Ford’s recent creation of a research facility at U of M to Hyundai’s concept cars and acquisition of Boston Dynamics. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hyundaispeaker&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hyundaispeaker&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> on June 9, we will be joined by a trio of experts from these companies for what’s sure to be a lively discussion on the topic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
