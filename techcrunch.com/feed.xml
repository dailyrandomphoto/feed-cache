<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>We were smaller team this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> together with Chris to sort through yet another summer frenzy of a week.</p>
<p>This time around we actually recorded live on Twitter Spaces, which was a first for the podcast. If you missed it, it&#8217;s probably because we didn&#8217;t promote the taping since it was just an experiment. Good news, though, is that it went well, and we&#8217;re going to some more live tapings of the show with the entire crew on the mics. Make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">follow the show on the Big Tweet</a> to ensure that you can come hang with us next week. We&#8217;ll also do some Q&amp;A at the end, if we&#8217;re in good moods.</p>
<p>Until then, let&#8217;s live in the present. Here&#8217;s what we got into in today&#8217;s show:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">The blisteringly-hot EU startup market</a>: You can raise money anywhere, but you might want to do it in Europe where VCs are putting a acre-feet of capital to work this year. Hours before the taping, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/index-ventures-trio-of-new-funds-leads-to-3-billion-and-more-tiktok/">Index Ventures announced a $3 billion trio of funds</a> (and TikTok strategy?), basically solidifying our earlier reporting.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/07/20/bitcoin-exchange-led-by-worlds-richest-crypto-billionaire-raises-record-900-million/?sh=68c754844e33">huge round for crypto trading house FTX</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">OpenSea raising again</a>: Regardless of whether or not you are paying attention to the crypt market today, investors are still firing capital at startups in the space at an eye-catching pace.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">Duolingo&#8217;s first IPO price range</a>: It&#8217;s a good-news week for consumer-focused, edtech startups, since the public markets will finally get a taste of an non-enterprise sector startup. Plus, Duolingo&#8217;s upcoming finance event could lead to them finally bolstering areas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">like speech, cultural norms, and fluency.</a></li>
<li>From the world of funding rounds, we had notes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/sololearn-raises-24m-for-its-bite-sized-duolingo-like-mobile-first-coding-education-app/">on Sololearn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/numerade-lands-100m-valuation-for-short-form-stem-videos/">Numerade</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/newcampus-wants-to-train-the-first-time-managers-within-southeast-asias-tech-giants/">NewCampus</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/mural-raises-50m-series-c-after-tripling-its-arr-in-the-last-year/#:~:text=This%20morning%20Mural%2C%20a%20startup,at%20more%20than%20%242%20billion.">Mural</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/spreadsheet-com-wants-to-put-apps-in-your-spreadsheet/">Spreadsheet.com</a>, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/online-checkout-startup-bolt-valued-at-4-billion?utm_source=ti_app">and Bolt</a>. The conversation ran into some fresh corners, such as how a company raised less than its preceding round but 4x&#8217;d its valuation and if we should bite-size all learning.</li>
<li>And we chatted about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">Clubhouse leaving beta</a>. Live on Twitter spaces. What can you do?</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA['At each layer of your growth model, you don't want to just be relying on ads or just be relying on SEO or just be relying on email marketing … you really want to have your eggs in multiple baskets.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Your startup might rely on clever growth tactics to get off the ground, but you need more than spreadsheets if you want to turn viral spikes into a real business. You need a qualitative growth model to guide the strategy that you can use to tell your story to your team and investors.</p>
<p>Growth marketing expert Susan Su sat down with us at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising this month to share pointers for young companies that are trying to raise money after initial market traction. In the presentation below, she <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">maps out a growth strategy from seed through Series A and B rounds and details how your milestones, budgets, investor updates and other measures change as you advance.</span></p>

<p>Formerly a strategic growth adviser to companies at Sound Ventures, a growth marketing lead focused on startups at Stripe, and the first hire and head of growth at Reforge, Su <a href="https://susanfsu.medium.com/why-and-how-im-dedicating-my-career-to-climate-change-210457421b34">just became</a> a partner investing in climate tech for early-stage fund Toba Capital. She also writes a <a href="https://climatemoney.substack.com/p/top-climate-investors">popular newsletter</a> on climate investing and runs a six-week course for other investors on the topic.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more about growth, and how to talk about it with investors, from her presentation:</p>
<blockquote><p>So here&#8217;s a sample qualitative growth model that I built for one of our portfolio companies with some modifications for anonymity. At the bottom, we have our linear inputs that form the foundation of awareness &#8212; in other words, traffic or leads that feed into our growth machine.</p>
<p>Once those leads come in, we have our acquisition loops, working to turn that non-repeatable spiky linear traffic (aka TechCrunch traffic, if you get so lucky as to be written up in TechCrunch) into scalable, repeatable acquisition. You cannot repeat the TechCrunch effect.</p>
<p>For this sample business, I happened to spec out five different acquisition loops — I was really ambitious. Many companies will struggle to identify this many. But the key to being able to scale is to have multiple viable acquisition loops, not just one single thing that works.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Paystone provides electronic payments and customer engagement technology to businesses, particularly those that provide services.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.paystone.com">Paystone</a>, a payments and integrated software company, secured another strategic investment this year, this time $23.8 million ($30 million CAD) from Crédit Mutuel Equity, the private equity arm of Crédit Mutuel Alliance Fédérale.</p>
<p>The Canada-based company got its start in 2008 as the payment processing company Zomaron, and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191107005392/en/Zomaron-Acquires-DataCandy-Rebrands-Paystone-North-American">rebranded itself as Paystone</a> in 2019. Today it provides electronic payments and customer engagement technology to businesses, particularly those that provide services, CEO Tarique Al-Ansari told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Paystone is on a mission to help businesses grow, and we were enthralled by their commitment to that mission and their focus on service-oriented verticals,” said Léa Perge, investor at Crédit Mutuel Equity in Canada, via email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While most of the company’s peers focus on product companies, Al-Ansari saw how underserved the service side was: their needs are different, and unlike retail, aren’t looking to sell online. Rather, they need an online presence and digital marketing to engage with customers, but their focus is being findable and having content that tells people why they should do business with them.</p>
<p>Paystone provides the marketing through content, help with reviews and with loyalty and rewards programs. However, rather than reward for spending, Paystone rewards for behavior. Refer a friend, get a reward. Write a review, get a reward. Al-Ansari calls it “payments as a benefit.” Referrals and reviews are how businesses become more findable, and the more content that&#8217;s out there, the more it helps people consider the business trustworthy, he added.</p>
<p>The new funding gives Canada-based Paystone total funds raised in 2021 of $78.8 million in a mix of debt and equity. It raised $54.9 million in January, funds that were barely touched as of yet, Al-Ansari said.</p>
<p>Though he wasn’t actively seeking new funds, Al-Ansari had been speaking with Crédit Mutuel Equity, which used to be CIC Capital Canada, prior to the pandemic, and their deal was put on hold.</p>
<p>Crédit Mutuel Equity came back with similar interest, and taking into account the kind of talent Paystone wanted to go after and its acquisition strategy — the company has already acquired five companies — Al-Ansari decided to take the additional funds. He said it gives the company options to hire more and double down on building the company, as well as enough capital to look for more acquisitions.</p>
<p>This year, Paystone entered the U.S. market for the first time and will do a proper launch later this year. The company has over 30,000 merchant locations on its platform throughout North America, and Al-Ansari expects that to grow by 5,000 this year. The company has 150 employees currently, and another 50 are expected to come on board by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In addition, Al-Ansari expects growth to accelerate for the rest of the year. The company processes around $6 billion in credit card payments and is on track to bring in $55.7 million in revenue this year. It is cash flow positive, residuals from the company’s origins of being bootstrapped, he said.</p>
<p>“We want to become the go-to destination for service businesses to set up a digital presence to accept payments and provide loyalty and rewards,” Al-Ansari said. “We will do this by solidifying our market position and growing our platform with the tools that customers want.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open-source framework startup <a href="https://serverless-stack.com">Serverless Stack</a> announced Friday that it raised $1 million in seed funding from a group of investors that includes Greylock Partners, SV Angel and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2017 by Jay V and Frank Wang in San Francisco, and they were part of Y Combinator’s 2021 winter batch.</p>
<p>Serverless Stack’s technology enables engineers to more easily build full-stack serverless apps. CEO V said he and Wang were working in this space for years with the aim of exposing it to a broader group of people.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While tooling around in the space, they determined that the ability to build serverless apps was not getting better, so they joined Y Combinator to hone their idea on how to make the process easier.</p>
<p>Here’s how the technology works: The open-source framework allows developers to test and make changes to their applications by directly connecting their local machines to the cloud. The problem with what V called an “old-school process” is that developers would upload their apps to the cloud, wait for it to run and then make any changes. Instead, Serverless Stack connects directly to the cloud for the ability to debug applications locally, he added.</p>
<p>Since its launch six months ago, Serverless Stack has grown to over 2,000 stars on GitHub and was downloaded more than 60,000 times.</p>
<p>Dalton Caldwell, managing director of YC, met V and Wang at the cohort and said he was “super impressed” because the pair were working in the space for a long time.</p>
<p>“These folks are experts — there are probably just half a dozen people who know as much as they do, as there aren’t that many people working on this technology,” Caldwell told TechCrunch. “The proof is in the pudding, and if they can get people to adopt it, like they did on GitHub so far, and keep that community engagement, that is my strongest signal of staying power.”</p>
<p>V has earmarked the new funding to expand the team, including hiring engineers to support new use cases.</p>
<p>Serverless initially gravitated toward specific use cases — APIs are now allowing its community to chime in and it is using that as a guide, V said. It recently announced more of a full-stack use case for building out APIs with a database and also building out the front end frameworks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, V’s roadmap includes building out more tools with a vision of getting Serverless Stack to the point where a developer can come on with an idea and take it all the way to an IPO using his platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why we want the community to drive the roadmap,&#8221; V told TechCrunch. “We are focused on what they are building and when they are in production, how they are managing it. Eventually, we will build out a dashboard to make it easier for them to manage all of their applications.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s pretty easy for individuals to send money back and forth, and there are lots of cash apps from which to choose. On the commercial side, however, one business trying to send $100,000 the same way is not as easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paystand.com/about">Paystand</a> wants to change that. The Scotts Valley, California-based company is using cloud technology and the Ethereum blockchain as the engine for its Paystand Bank Network that enables business-to-business payments with zero fees.</p>
<p>The company raised $50 million Series C funding led by NewView Capital, with participation from SoftBank’s SB Opportunity Fund and King River Capital. This brings the company’s total funding to $85 million, Paystand co-founder and CEO Jeremy Almond told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the 2008 economic downturn, Almond’s family lost their home. He decided to go back to graduate school and did his thesis on how commercial banking could be better and how digital transformation would be the answer. Gleaning his company vision from the enterprise side, Almond said what Venmo does for consumers, Paystand does for commercial transactions between mid-market and enterprise customers.</p>
<p>“Revenue is the lifeblood of a business, and money has become software, yet everything is in the cloud except for revenue,” he added.</p>
<p>He estimates that almost half of enterprise payments still involve a paper check, while fintech bets heavily on cards that come with 2% to 3% transaction fees, which Almond said is untenable when a business is routinely sending $100,000 invoices. Paystand is charging a flat monthly rate rather than a fee per transaction.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181273" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181273" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2181273" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png" alt="" width="1024" height="891" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=768,668 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=680,592 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181273" class="wp-caption-text">Paystand&#8217;s platform. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Paystand</p></div></p>
<p>On the consumer side, companies like Square and Stripe were among the first wave of companies predominantly focused on accounts payable and then building business process software on top of an existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Paystand’s view of the world is that the accounts receivables side is harder and why there aren’t many competitors. This is why Paystand is surfing the next wave of fintech, driven by blockchain and decentralized finance, to transform the $125 trillion B2B payment industry by offering an autonomous, cashless and feeless payment network that will be an alternative to cards, Almond said.</p>
<p>Customers using Paystand over a three-year period are able to yield average benefits like 50% savings on the cost of receivables and $850,000 savings on transaction fees. The company is seeing a 200% increase in monthly network payment value and customers grew two-fold in the past year.</p>
<p>The company said it will use the new funding to continue to grow the business by investing in open infrastructure. Specifically, Almond would like to reboot digital finance, starting with B2B payments, and reimagine the entire CFO stack.</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted something like this to exist for 20 years,” Almond said. “Sometimes it is the unsexy areas that can have the biggest impacts.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Jazmin Medina, principal at NewView Capital, will join Paystand’s board. She told TechCrunch that while the venture firm is a generalist, it is rooted in fintech and fintech infrastructure.</p>
<p>She also agrees with Almond that the B2B payments space is lagging in terms of innovation and has “strong conviction” in what Almond is doing to help mid-market companies proactively manage their cash needs.</p>
<p>“There is a wide blue ocean of the payment industry, and all of these companies have to be entirely digital to stay competitive,” Medina added. “There is a glaring hole if your revenue is holding you back because you are not digital. That is why the time is now.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.taboola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taboola</a>, the company that operates a popular grid-based advertising and content recommendation network across media properties, today announced an acquisition to expand its reach further into e-commerce, its first big move since going public in June by way of a SPAC: it is paying $800 million in a combination of cash and stock to buy <a href="https://connexity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connexity</a>, a marketing technology company that operates an retail- and e-commerce-focused advertising network. Connexity has been owned by Symphony Technology Partners since 2011.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The deal &#8212; coming in the form of $260 million from cash on hand, $300 million from committed debt financing and approximately $240 million through the issuance of ordinary shares to the seller &#8212; will supersize and further diversify Taboola, which currently has a <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TBLA:NASDAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a> of about $1.9 billion (that&#8217;s according to Google Finance; Taboola says the share count is off and it&#8217;s actually $2.35 billion) and is in hot competition with another content recommendation network operator, Outbrain: the two were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/taboola-outbrain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to merge</a> operations but eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/taboola-and-outbrain-call-off-their-850m-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went their own ways</a>, and Outbrain itself <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/market/article/r1pynrdad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public this month</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taboola said it expects the combined company to have gross profit of over $500 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (ex- traffic acquisition costs, or TAC), with $185 million of adjusted EBITDA for the period, with both figures growing 20% in 2021 versus 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Connexity was originally called Shopzilla before <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/cms/digital-marketing/shopzilla-rebrands-as-connexity-026587.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranding</a>, and it has over the years amassed a number of related businesses, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/04/connexity-become-shopzilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Become.com</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/a-12-year-journey-ends-as-skimlinks-is-acquired-by-retail-marketing-platform-connexity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skimlinks</a> and <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/shopzilla-parent-connexity-acquires-pricegrabber/400812/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PriceGrabber</a>. (Even Connexity itself was an <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140219005260/en/Shopzilla-Acquires-Connexity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition made by Shopzilla</a> when it was primarily a shopping search engine.) Together, it&#8217;s helped the company build out what has become a sizable network focused around the business of e-commerce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Taboola focuses on content recommendations and advertising that runs alongside that, and Connexity is more squarely focused on the business of e-commerce, the two have something in common. They both position themselves as viable alternatives to the big players in advertising and discovery, giving publishers and retailers another way of making revenues and finding new customers without selling out data and a cut to the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of this world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While keeping the landscape competitive and providing viable alternatives to beleaguered publishers sounds like a noble enough effort, there are of course potential drawbacks. Taboola&#8217;s approach has long incurred a lot of criticism for disseminating click-bait and other garbage links, and some might have an issue with the concept of now a deeper move into e-commerce and selling merchandise along side that. Some in the media industry (and within the world of journalism in particular) has long aimed to keep commercial and other vested interests at arms length from its content, and so it will be worth watching to see how and if that effort shifts as publishers continue to look for profit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adam Singolda, the CEO and co-founder of Taboola, very much understands the challenges that publishers face, and he sees his company as building solutions to address that. He told TechCrunch that when Taboola went public, part of its sell to investors was that it would move into newer &#8220;types&#8221; of recommendations, covering new segments, that would also further scale the bigger operation, and this is a part of that strategy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We believe the future of the open web is e-commerce,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taboola today has 9,000 digital property partners, 13,000 direct advertisers and 500 million daily active users on its platform, where publishers can use the content recommendation format to recirculate their own content as well as that of other publishers and advertisers on the Taboola network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Connexity&#8217;s part, it covers various activities like affiliate links, influencer marketing, in-stream advertising, shopping search ads, and more. Its customers include 1,600 direct merchants, and 6,000 publishers ((Walmart, Wayfair, Skechers, Macy’s, eBay and Otto are some of the most high profile of these). And in total, it says its network has some 40,000 retail-oriented publishers that can select from a pool of 750 million product offers, and an audience of 100 million shoppers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And in a very fragmented e-commerce world rife with challenges in keeping online consumers&#8217; attention, it says its various activities have generated over 800 million shopping leads and in 2020 more than $2 billion in sales for its customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That is still a relatively small part of the pie, though. eMarketer estimates that the e-commerce media market is worth some $35 billion in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Added to that, Taboola&#8217;s bet is that the publishers it already works with are going to be getting deeper into this space as part of their own drive to maximize more revenues per visitor/reader and make their own business models more viable (alongside diversifying into paid content, paywalls, alternative advertising formats like sponsored content, events, and so on).</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;62% of US publishers expect ecommerce to be one of their biggest revenue channels,&#8221; Singolda said. &#8220;I strongly believe every publisher&#8217;s leadership these days have e-Commerce as a top 3 thing they want to get into in a big way.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Connexity is a fairly multichannel offering today &#8212; a byproduct of all the acquisitions it has made into adjacent technologies &#8212; and Taboola plans to keep it all, with &#8220;massive cross sell and upselling opportunities, bringing eCommerce to every publisher on the open web, driving higher yields, going global with e-Commerce, empowering editorial teams what to write about around e-Commerce,&#8221; Singolda said.</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p id="speakable-summary">Connexity on its own is a substantial business, and the shift to more e-commerce in the wake of the global Covid-19 pandemic has put a focus on the different tools it has in its armory to capture attention and convert ordinary site visitors into browsers and then into shoppers. It says that in 2019 it generated $151 million of revenue, $63 million of ex-TAC gross profit and $28 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2019, with that figure increasing to $172 million of revenue, $78 million of ex-TAC gross profit and $38 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares in Zomato, a Gurgaon-based food delivery company and first of India’s consumer tech startups to go public, closed up 65% in its debut day of trading in Mumbai, delivering a key insight into the appetite investors have for the world&#8217;s second largest internet market&#8217;s burgeoning startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Zomato’s shares traded all day above the issue price of 76 Indian rupees ($1) and surged as high as 138.9 Indian rupees ($1.87). The 12-year-old firm ended day one of trading on BSE in Mumbai at 125.8 Indian rupees ($1.69), securing a market cap of $13.2 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-valued-at-5-4-billion-in-new-250-million-investment/">$5.4 billion valuation</a> it had attained in private markets during the startup’s fundraise earlier this year.</p>
<p>The startup’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">$1.3 billion initial public offering</a> was 40 times subscribed last week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Friday&#8217;s milestone of Zomato has equally been significant for the rest of the industry as startup founders and investors closely watched the firm&#8217;s stock performance. India’s Twitter timeline on Friday was flooded with celebratory messages from industry colleagues.</p>
<p>Ashish Dave, India head of Mirae Asset, a backer of Zomato, said the listing and performance of Zomato today have delivered the missing piece of liquidity in Indian startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;This validates that we can generate large IPOs, which then makes our startups more attractive for global LPs. It also gives Indian investors a chance to participate in the India tech journey rather than from watching it from sidelines,&#8221; he told TechCrunch, adding that retail investors of this generation will finally find a way to get in on the action with the brands they recognize and have grown up with.</p>

<p>Zomato chief executive Deepinder Goyal was quick to reciprocate. In a blog post, Goyal wrote, “today is a big day for us. A new Day Zero. But we couldn’t have gotten here without the incredible efforts of India’s entire internet ecosystem. Jio’s prolific growth has set all of us up for unprecedented scale. Flipkart, Amazon, Ola, Uber, Paytm – have also over the years, collectively laid the railroads that are enabling companies like ours to build the India of the future.”</p>
<p>“They say it takes a village to raise a child, and we are no exception. Hundreds of people have selflessly played a part in making Zomato what it is today.”</p>
<p>Indian tech startups have raised a record amount of capital this year as some high-profile investors have doubled down in the South Asian market. Swiggy, Zomato&#8217;s chief rival in India, said earlier this week it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-raises-1-25-billion-led-by-softbank-and-prosus/">raised $1.25 billion</a> from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 and Prosus among others at a valuation of $5.5 billion.</p>
<p>A handful of other firms are also preparing to publicly list within a few months. Financial services startups Paytm and MobiKwik <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">filed for their initial public offerings</a> earlier this month. Online insurance aggregator Policybazaar is expected to file its paperwork within a few weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t know whether we will succeed or fail – we will surely, like always, give it our best. But I hope that the fact that we are here, inspires millions of Indians to dream bigger than we ever have, and build something way more incredible than what we can dream of,&#8221; wrote Goyal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.kitchenful.com">Kitchenful</a>, a new German startup backed by Y Combinator that wants to make it easier to cook at home by taking care of menu ideas and grocery shopping. The service is currently available in early access in Germany with a focus on Berlin and Munich.</p>
<p>When you sign up to Kitchenful, you first have to set your preferences and goals. You can choose vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free and gluten-free options, but you can also focus on slow carbs recipes, a diet focused on healthy fats, etc.</p>
<p>After that, you get a meal plan for the coming week. You can review and customize each meal. For instance, if you plan to have guests, you can add a couple of persons to your Tuesday dinner. You can also remove vegetables if you usually buy your vegetables at a farmers market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once you’re ready to order, a virtual grocery basket is automatically generated for the user. You can review, add something that isn’t on the list, such as household items, and confirm.</p>
<p>Kitchenful then transfers your list of items to a major supermarket near you. The startup doesn’t fulfill orders directly — they rely on partners for that part of the process. That’s why Kitchenful describes itself as a grocery concierge service.</p>
<p>“Our main revenue stream is a concierge fee which we collect directly from our users for creating personalized weekly menus, handling the basket creation process, providing personalized cooking instructions for the recipes as well as leftover ideas. Additionally, we receive a commission from our supermarket partners per generated order,” Kitchenful co-founder and CEO Christian Schiller told me.</p>
<p>This isn’t Schiller’s first experience in food delivery. He previously spent four years as Vice President of Product at <a href="https://www.hellofresh.com">HelloFresh</a>, a popular meal-kit company.</p>
<p>Kitchenful is just getting started. It has raised $1 million from Y Combinator, N26 co-founder and CEO Valentin Stalf, Souq co-founder Samih Toukan, HighSnobiety’s David Fischer, DurstExpress MD Maik Ludewig, and Mendeley co-founder Victor Henning.</p>
<p>The company has already established partnerships with REWE in Germany, Walmart and Kroger in the U.S. By partnering with supermarkets, Kitchenful can offer a great variety of products at supermarket prices.</p>
<p>It’s a different take on meal kits with a different approach to logistics, so it’s going to be interesting to see if Kitchenful becomes a popular alternative to both grocery delivery and meal-kit services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM is rolling out three major upgrades including automatic lanes changes and towing support to its hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise and making it available in six vehicles, including the 2022 all-new GMC Hummer EV pickup truck.</p>
<p>While GM has steadily improved Super Cruise since its introduction in 2017, for years it has been limited to its luxury Cadillac brand. The improvements and additional vehicles mark the automaker&#8217;s willingness — and perhaps readiness — to sell owners of its Chevrolet- and GMC-branded pickup trucks on the technology.</p>
<p>When GM launched Super Cruise, it was only available in one Cadillac model — the full-size CT6 sedan — and restricted to divided highways. That began to change in 2019 when GM announced plans to expand where Super Cruise would be available. Now the system can be activated on more than 200,000 miles of roads in the United States.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And GM is planning to expand even further. By 2023, GM aims to bring Super Cruise to 22 vehicles, including the upcoming EVs Cadillac Lyriq and GMC Hummer SUV.</p>
<p>The company said Friday it is adding automatic lane changes that function without a driver prompt to Super Cruise. This feature in the enhanced Super Cruise will be available in the 2022 Cadillac Escalade, Cadillac CT4, Cadillac CT5, Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Hummer EV Pickup and GMC Sierra. GM has also developed and will launch a new feature that will allow drivers to engage the hands-free assistance system while trailering their boat or camper. This trailering feature will be available only in 2022 model year vehicles that have towing capability. Finally, GM has upgraded its in-car navigation to show drivers the highways where Super Cruise can be used.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM CEO Mary Barra wants to sell personal autonomous vehicles using Cruise&#8217;s self-driving tech by 2030&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/gm-ceo-mary-barra-wants-to-sell-personal-autonomous-vehicles-using-cruises-self-driving-tech-by-2030/embed/#?secret=mp5lCoBTnN" data-secret="mp5lCoBTnN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Super Cruise uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention. Unlike Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>The automatic lane change feature in Super Cruise will still require the driver to keep their eyes on the road. When the system is engaged, the driver <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/gm-adds-automated-lane-changes-to-its-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system/">no longer needs to engage</a> the turn signal to indicate a desire to change lanes. Instead, the system, if engaged, will make the lane change on its own after alerting the driver. The system will move the vehicle to other lane to pass a slower vehicle.</p>
<p>The driver-prompted automatic lane change will be the default when the vehicle is towing a boat, camper or trailer.</p>
<p>All of these upgrades are possible thanks to GM&#8217;s newish digital vehicle platform called VIP, or vehicle intelligent platform, which provides more electrical bandwidth and data processing power, enabled engineers to add to Super Cruise&#8217;s capabilities. Vehicles equipped with this VIP electrical architecture can add features Super Cruise via over-the-air software updates. That means certain 2021 models, specifically the Cadillac Escalade, will get these new upgrades.</p>
<p>There are a couple of vehicles, namely the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV, that have a different version of Super Cruise because it is not equipped the VIP. As a result, the Bolt EUV won&#8217;t get these upgrades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey confirmed to investors that bitcoin will be a &#8220;big part&#8221; of the company&#8217;s future, as he sees opportunities to integrate the cryptocurrency into existing Twitter products and services, including commerce, subscriptions and other new additions like the Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">Tip Jar</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">Super Follows</a>.</p>
<p>Dorsey has been a staunch bitcoin advocate for years, but how it would be put into action on Twitter&#8217;s platform had not yet been spelled out in detail. However, Dorsey has often publicly touted the cryptocurrency, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/jack-dorsey-says-this-is-what-inspires-him-the-most-about-bitcoin.html">saying</a> it reminds him of the &#8220;early days of the internet&#8221; and that there wasn&#8217;t &#8220;anything more important&#8221; in his lifetime for him to work on.</p>
<p>More recently, Dorsey launched a $23.6 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/jack-dorsey-and-jay-z-invest-23-6-million-to-fund-bitcoin-development/">bitcoin fund with Jay Z</a> and announced <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1415765941904941061">plans</a> to lead his other company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/square-is-building-a-decentralized-finance-business-for-bitcoin.html">Square into the decentralized financial services</a> market by way of bitcoin. Square also this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">acquired</a> a majority stake in Jay-Z&#8217;s TIDAL music service with an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tidal-stake-square/squares-297-million-deal-for-jay-zs-music-service-tidal-may-bring-blockchain-to-masses-idUSKBN2AW1N8">eye toward how blockchain</a> technologies and cryptocurrencies could change the music business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Dorsey also dubbed bitcoin one of three key trends for Twitter&#8217;s future, along with AI and decentralization &#8212; the latter which Twitter is pursuing through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">its &#8220;Bluesky&#8221; initiative</a>.</p>

<p>He touted bitcoin to investors on Twitter&#8217;s second quarter earnings call, saying it could help the company move faster in terms of its product expansions, while explaining that it was the &#8220;best candidate&#8221; to become the &#8220;native currency&#8221; of the internet. (Incidentally, Square&#8217;s $50 million in bitcoin purchased in 2020 was worth <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/squares-50m-bitcoin-buy-is-now-worth-253m">$253 million</a> by February 2021, and it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-23/square-reports-quarterly-revenue-that-falls-short-of-estimates?sref=gni836kR">purchased $170 million more</a> earlier this year.)</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh man, Jack Dorsey says he thinks Bitcoin is key to Twitter&#39;s future. Says it will &quot;ensure people and companies can freely trade goods and services anywhere on the planet&quot;</p>
<p>&mdash; Alex Weprin (@alexweprin) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexweprin/status/1418331237157150722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;If the internet has a native currency, a global currency, we are able to able to move so much faster with products such as Super Follows, Commerce, Subscriptions, Tip Jar, and we can reach every single person on the planet because of that instead of going down a market-by-market-by-market approach,&#8221; Dorsey explained. &#8220;I think this is a big part of our future. I think there is a lot of innovation above just currency to be had, especially as we think about decentralizing social media more and providing more economic incentive. So I think it&#8217;s hugely important to Twitter and to Twitter shareholders that we continue to look at the space and invest aggressively in it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>A Twitter rep confirmed this is the first time that Dorsey has spoken publicly about how Twitter could integrate bitcoin into its product lineup.</p>
<p>Dorsey also pointed out Twitter would not be alone in pursuing a crypto strategy, noting that Facebook was backing the digital currency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diem_(digital_currency)">Diem.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an obvious need for this, and appreciation for it. And I think that an open standard that&#8217;s native to the internet is the right way to go, which is why my focus and our focus eventually will be on bitcoin,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Overall, Twitter delivered strong earnings in a pandemic rebound, which saw the company posting its fastest revenue growth since 2014, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/twitter-twtr-earnings-q2-2021.html">according to CNBC</a>, which drove Twitter shares 9% higher in extended trading. The company pulled in Q2 revenue of $1.19 billion versus the $1.07 billion Wall Street expected, a majority ($1.05 billion) from its advertising business. It also saw earnings per share of 20 cents versus the 7 cents expected.</p>
<p>However, monetizable daily active users (mDAUs) &#8212; Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/twitter-is-slowly-perfecting-the-art-of-inventing-nonsensical-performance-metrics/">own invented metric</a> meant to fluff up often flat monthly user growth &#8212; were only at 206 million, an 11% year-over-year increase, while analysts were counting on 206.2 million. The company blamed the decline on a slower news cycle and end of shelter-in-place in many U.S. communities, which may have impacted Twitter usage during the quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arrival, the commercial electric vehicle company that is shaking up the traditional auto production line with AI-run microfactories, has been chosen to build electric buses for the City of Anaheim, California.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grants/fiscal-year-2019-low-or-no-emission-low-no-bus-program-projects">Federal Transportation Administration awarded Anaheim a $2 million grant</a> in 2019, and on Thursday the city&#8217;s transportation network announced the plan to partner with Arrival to achieve its goal of running California&#8217;s first all-electric bus fleet by 2025.</p>
<p>The U.K.-based company said Anaheim, which operates transit services to and from Disneyland and other local attractions, would be the first customer for its lightweight-battery bus. Arrival will start with five 40-foot buses, but did not respond to requests for more information about when the buses would launch and when to expect more additions to the fleet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The buses for Anaheim will be built in Arrival&#8217;s first U.S. microfactory in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Arrival&#8217;s other microfactory is in Charlotte, North Carolina, but the startup aims to have 31 microfactories all over the country by the end of 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Arrival&#8217;s partnership with Anaheim Transportation Network also includes workforce development programs, according to a statement from the EV company. Local community colleges with electrical and mechanical engineering programs will be able to give eligible students internships to gain experience working with zero-emission transportation.</p>
<p>“The Arrival Bus will change the face of public transportation when it hits the roads,” said Mike Ableson, CEO of Arrival Automotive. “Our first order from a U.S. transit operator is just the beginning.”</p>
<p>Arrival, which recently went public via a SPAC merger, already has a number of notable  partnerships. Last year, it signed an agreement with UPS to roll out an initial order of 10,000 electric delivery vehicles through 2024. In May the company partnered with Uber to create a purpose-built EV for ride-hailing, and just last week, the company announced an <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leaseplan-arrival-sign-partnership-bring-060000630.html">initial order of 3,000 EVs from LeasePlan</a>, a Dutch &#8220;car-as-a-service&#8221; company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Tumblr community often refers to itself as the Wild West of the internet, and they&#8217;re not wrong. A <a href="https://threecheersmaka.tumblr.com/post/649025845330067456/tumblr-is-my-favourite-social-media-site-because">text post</a> with over 70,000 notes puts it best: &#8220;Tumblr is my favorite social media site because this place is literally uninhabitable for celebrities. No verification system, no algorithm that boosts their posts, it’s a completely lawless wasteland for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But like any social media company, Tumblr needs to keep itself afloat in order for its users to continue sharing esoteric fan art, incomprehensible shitposts, and overly personal diary entries hidden beneath a &#8220;Read More&#8221; button. Yesterday, Tumblr announced the limited beta test of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">Post+ subscription feature</a>, which &#8212; if all goes as planned &#8212; will eventually let Tumblr users post paywalled content to subscribers that pay them $3.99, $5.99 or $9.99 per month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180371" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180371" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2180371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png 8001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tumblr</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tumblr is far from the first social media platform to seek revenue this way &#8212; Twitter is rolling out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">Super Follows</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">Tip Jar</a> feature, and this week, YouTube announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/youtubes-newest-monetization-tool-lets-viewers-tip-creators-for-their-uploads/">a tipping feature</a> too. Even Instagram is working on its own version of Twitter&#8217;s Super Follows that would let users create &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/instagram-is-developing-its-own-version-of-twitters-super-follow-with-exclusive-stories/">exclusive stories</a>.&#8221; But on a website with a community that prides itself as being a &#8220;completely lawless wasteland&#8221; for anyone with a platform (save for <a href="https://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/">Wil Wheaton</a> and <a href="https://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/">Neil Gaiman</a>, who are simply just vibing), the move toward paywalled content was not welcomed with open arms.</p>

<p>Monetization is a double-edged sword. It&#8217;s not considered uncool for a Tumblr artist to link to a third-party Patreon or Ko-fi site on their blog, where their most enthusiastic followers can access paywalled content or send them tips. So Post+ seems like an obvious way for Tumblr to generate revenue &#8212; instead of directing followers to other websites, they could build a way for fans to support creators on their own platform while taking a 5% cut. This isn&#8217;t unreasonable, considering that Twitter will take 3% revenue from its new monetization tools, while video-centric platforms like YouTube and Twitch take 30% and 50%, respectively. But Tumblr isn&#8217;t Twitter, or YouTube, or Twitch. Unlike other platforms, Tumblr doesn&#8217;t allow you to see other people&#8217;s follower counts, and no accounts are verified. It&#8217;s not as easy to tell whether the person behind a popular post has 100 followers or 100,000 followers, and the users prefer it that way. But Post+ changes that, giving bloggers an icon next to their username that resembles a Twitter blue check.</p>

<p>Tumblr rolled out Post+ this week to a select group of hand-picked creators, including <a href="https://kaijuno.tumblr.com/">Kaijuno</a>, a writer and astrophysicist. The platform announced Post+ on <a href="https://postplus.tumblr.com/">a new blog</a> specific to this product, rather than its established <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com">staff blog</a>, which users know to check for big announcements. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So, as the most public user who was granted access, the 24-year-old blogger was the target of violent backlash from angry Tumblrites who didn&#8217;t want to see their favorite social media site turn into a hypercapitalist hellscape. When Kaijuno received death threats for beta testing Post+, Tumblr&#8217;s staff intervened and condemned harassment against Post+ users.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We want to hear about what you like, what you love, and what concerns you. Even if it’s not very nice. Tell us. We can take it,&#8221; Tumblr wrote on its <a href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/657366672276176896/tumblr-earlier-today-we-announced-to-the-press">staff blog</a>. &#8220;What we won’t ever accept is the targeted harassment and threats these creators have endured since this afternoon. [&#8230;] all they’re doing is testing out a feature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before making their post, a representative from Tumblr&#8217;s staff reached out to Kaijuno directly to check in on them regarding the backlash, but there&#8217;s only so much that Tumblr can do after a user has already been threatened for using their product.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt like the sacrificial lamb, because they didn&#8217;t announce Post+ beforehand and only gave it to a few people, which landed me in the crosshairs of a very pissed-off user base when I&#8217;m just trying to pay off medical bills by giving people the option to pay for content,&#8221; Kaijuno told TechCrunch. &#8220;I knew there&#8217;d be some backlash because users hate any sort of change to Tumblr, but I thought that the brunt of the backlash would be at the staff, and that the beta testers would be spared from most of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do Tumblr users perceive monetization as such a threat? It&#8217;s not a question of whether or not it&#8217;s valuable to support creators, but rather, whether Tumblr is capable of hosting such a service. Multiple long-time, avid Tumblr users that spoke to TechCrunch referenced an incident in late 2020 when people&#8217;s blogs were being hacked by spam bots that posted incessant advertisements for a Ray-Ban Summer Sale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tumblr is not the most well-coded website. It&#8217;s easy to break features,&#8221; Kaijuno added. &#8220;I think anything involving trusting Tumblr with your financial information would have gotten backlash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tumblr users also worried about the implications Post+ could have on privacy &#8212; in the limited beta, Post+ users only have the ability to block people who are subscribed to their blog if they contact Tumblr support. In cases of harassment by a subscriber, this could leave a blogger vulnerable in a potentially dangerous situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahead of our launch to all U.S.-based creators this fall, Post+ will allow creators to block subscribers directly,&#8221; a Tumblr spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>A former Tumblr employee told TechCrunch that the feature that became Post+ started out as a tip jar. But higher-ups at Tumblr &#8212; who do not work directly with the community &#8212; redirected the project to create a paywalled subscription product.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a Tip Jar would be a massive improvement,&#8221; said the creator behind the Tumblr blog <a href="https://normal-horoscopes.tumblr.com/">normal-horoscopes</a>. Through the core audience they developed on Tumblr, they make a living via Patreon, but they don&#8217;t find Post+ compelling for their business. &#8220;External services [like Patreon] have more options, more benefits, better price points, and as a creator I get to choose how I present them to my audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a paywalled subscription service is different in the collective eyes of Tumblr. For a site that thrives on fandom, creators that make fan art and fanfiction worry that placing this derivative work behind a paywall &#8212; which Post+ <a href="https://postplus.tumblr.com/post/657323537298833408/hi-there-as-you-might-have-noticed-were#notes">encourages</a> them to do &#8212; will land them in legal trouble. Even Archive of Our Own, a major fanfiction site, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18072622/fanfic-ao3-free-speech-censorship-fandom">prohibits its users</a> from linking to sites like Patreon or Ko-Fi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Built-in monetization attracts businesses, corporate accounts, people who are generally there to make money first and provide content second,&#8221; said normal-horoscopes. &#8220;It changes the culture of a platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Across Tumblr, upset users are rallying for their followers to take Post+&#8217;s <a href="https://tumblr.survey.fm/post-feedback-form">feedback survey</a> to express their frustrations. The staff welcomes this.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6yxx10MXSi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/youtubes-newest-monetization-tool-lets-viewers-tip-creators-for-their-uploads/">YouTube&#8217;s newest monetization tool lets viewers tip creators for their uploads</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YouTube&#8217;s newest monetization tool lets viewers tip creators for their uploads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/youtubes-newest-monetization-tool-lets-viewers-tip-creators-for-their-uploads/embed/#?secret=6yxx10MXSi" data-secret="6yxx10MXSi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;As with any new product launch, we expect our users to have a healthy discussion about how the feature will change the dynamics of how people use Tumblr,&#8221; a Tumblr spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Not all of this feedback will be positive, and that’s OK. Constructive criticism fuels how we create products and ultimately makes Tumblr a better place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tumblr&#8217;s vocal community has been empowered over the years to question whether it&#8217;s possible for a platform to establish new revenue streams in a way that feels organic. The protectiveness that Tumblr&#8217;s user base feels for the site &#8212; despite their lack of faith in staff &#8212; sets it apart from social media juggernauts like Facebook, which can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/instagram-redesign-puts-reels-and-shop-tabs-on-the-home-screen/">put e-commerce front and center</a> without much scrutiny. But even three years after the catastrophic porn ban, it seems hard for Tumblr to grow without alienating the people that make the social network unique.</p>
<p>Platforms like Reddit and Discord have remained afloat by selling digital goods, like coins to reward top posters, or special emojis. Each company&#8217;s financial needs are different, but Tumblr&#8217;s choice to monetize with Post+<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> highlights the company&#8217;s lack of insight into its own community&#8217;s wishes.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 22, 2021. Today we have a lot of news for you, but with a notable twist. Normally we have lots of startup news and a few notes from Big Tech companies. Today we have a lot from both, so strap in.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/us-secretary-of-transportation-pete-buttigieg-is-coming-to-disrupt-draft/">U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg is coming to Disrupt</a>. Because TechCrunch covers the worlds of micromobility, mobility proper and the future of transit, we have a few questions for the man. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/filing-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-is-raising-750m-more-at-a-13-5b-valuation/">Gopuff is raising again:</a></strong> TechCrunch broke the news today that Gopuff, the SoftBank-backed delivery company, is raising more capital. Our sources say $1 billion at around a $15 billion valuation. Axios confirmed the news. The potential funding will follow in the wake of lots of capital raised for instant-delivery grocery around the world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/canadas-startup-market-booms-alongside-hot-global-vc-investment/">Canada’s venture capital market is hotter than the sun:</a> </strong>TechCrunch’s exploration of the global, U.S, Indian, European and Latin American startup markets continued today with a look at North North America. It turns out that Canadian startups are enjoying one hell of a year when it comes to landing big venture rounds.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/a-dns-outage-just-took-down-a-good-chunk-of-the-internet/">The internet went down. Here’s why:</a></strong> Akamai’s DNS system hit a pothole today, taking down a pretty big chunk of the internet. Lots of stuff broke, including the Couchbase website right as your humble servant was prepping to chat with its CEO about its recent IPO (more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting/">here</a>). Things are back to normal now, but don’t forget that the internet is not a series of tubes. It’s a series of leaky tubes held together with duct tape.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about startups. Today we have everything from passwordless tech to new venture funds and a robotics roundup. But if you need even more, here’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/greylocks-mike-duboe-explains-how-to-define-growth-and-build-your-team/">Greylock’s Mike Duboe explaining how to define growth and build your team</a>.</p>

The U.K.-based company’s service wants to train CCTV cameras on digital humans, saving customers from knotty privacy issues. This is one of those times when venture capital dollars appear to be flowing to an actually kinda wild idea?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/sendlane-raises-20m-to-convert-shoppers-into-loyal-customers/">Sendlane wants you to spend more:</a> </strong>Sendlane, now flush with $20 million in new capital, wants to help its customers use data on <em>their </em>customers to help keep shoppers loyal and spend more.

In fact, some data sources indicate that VC is actually getting less diverse this year. All Raise wants to push back on that by helping more founders other than folks who <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1418229129946845188">look like me</a> raise capital. Good.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/magic-27m-series-a-for-its-plug-and-play-passwordless-tech/">Magic raises $27M to get rid of passwords:</a> </strong>Magic, a startup that will spend its life trying to live up to its name, just raised a huge amount of money to pursue its vision of a less password-focused future. Its tech allows developers to “implement a variety of passwordless authentication methods with just a few lines of code,” TechCrunch reports.</li>

Hot Startup Summer is being made possible by Hot Zero Interest Rate Policy Decade, which in turn is helping fuel Hot Bored Cash Season, leading to every venture capital firm raising enough money to cause their GPs to lose sleep. Fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>And for your robotics fans out there, TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/robotics-roundup-21/">a new digest from the industry here</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Last-mile delivery in Latin America is ready to take off</h2>
<p>Thanks to sprawling fulfillment centers, seamless logistics networks and ubiquitous internet access, consumers in many regions now order groceries and a new set of cookware during breakfast and can reasonably expect everything to arrive in time for dinner.</p>
<p>In Latin America, a lack of technology infrastructure makes delivery operations less complex — products are delivered from a retailer&#8217;s loading dock to a customer&#8217;s front door — but these supply chains are often managed with spreadsheets, paper and pen.</p>
<p>Algorithms that manage delivery routes or automatically dispatch drivers &#8220;are almost unheard of in the Latin America retail logistics sector,&#8221; says Bob Ma, an investor at WIND Ventures.</p>
<p>But thanks to growing consumer demand and expanding investment in last-mile delivery startups, Ma says the region is at a turning point.</p>
<p>Since Latin America&#8217;s middle class has grown 50% in the last decade and e-commerce constitutes just 6% of all retail, several unicorns have emerged in recent years, with more waiting in the wings.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Let’s start with transportation news and then talk about the rest of Big Tech.</p>
<p>Daily Crunch asked TechCrunch transportation guru and generally sterling person Kirsten Korosec just why there was so much news today from her beat. “I have no idea why, just make it stop,” she joked, before adding that she “can say that with so many automakers making commitments to move to all electric lines, we can expect more announcements about how they plan to ensure they have battery capacity and other raw materials.”</p>
<p>Here’s the news:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/rivian-is-planning-a-second-u-s-factory/">Rivian sets sights on second factory:</a></strong> Fresh off production delays, EV company Rivian is planning for the future in the form of another factory. The company admitted to being in the process of looking for a second plant. Our read? This electric car thing is not slowing down.</li>
<li>Speaking of which, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/"><strong>Tesla will source nickel directly from commodity production giant BHP</strong></a>. It’s going to be the Hunger Games out there for the raw materials needed for electric cars if the market evolves as it is expected to. Tesla wants to make sure it doesn’t lack supplies.</li>
<li>How much demand are we talking about? Well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/"><strong>Mercedes is going to build eight &#8212; <em>eight!</em> &#8212; battery plants</strong></a>. Now that we’ve read the news, the idea makes sense, but it still made us sit up and consider its implications. The days of the internal combustion engine are coming to an end.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/uber-freight-acquires-transpace-for-2-25b/"><strong>Uber buys Transplace for $2.25B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Rounding out our mobility rundown, Uber is making moves with its checkbook, this time buying Transplace, a digital logistics company, for a few billion. The effort will fit into Uber’s larger freight aspirations. The company has said that it intends to reach adjusted profitability this year.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/waymo-to-open-offices-in-pittsburgh-an-av-tech-hub/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"><strong>Waymo announced it is opening an office in Pittsburgh</strong></a>, where it will certainly put even more pressure on an already competitive talent recruiting process.</li>
</ul>
<p>And from the rest of the world of giant tech companies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/spotify-partners-with-giphy-to-connect-users-with-artists-music-via-gifs/"><strong>Spotify and Giphy team up:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Er, have you wanted GIFs in your music player? Well, good news if so: Spotify has “a new partnership with online GIF database GIPHY to enable discovery of new music through GIFs.” Cool?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/microsofts-cyber-startup-spending-spree-continues-with-cloudknox-acquisition/"><strong>Microsoft buys CloudKnox:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Microsoft’s push to provide cash returns to every cybersecurity-focused venture capitalist continued today, with the Redmond-based software giant buying CloudKnox. It’s the fourth deal <em>this year</em> for a smaller cybersecurity-focused startup from Microsoft.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/visa-acquires-currencycloud-which-makes-apis-for-remittances-and-currency-transfers-in-a-963m-deal/"><strong>Visa buys Currencycloud:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Visa, likely still stinging slightly from its inability to buy fintech API provider Plaid, is busy buying other companies. This time it’s Currencycloud, which builds <em>other</em> fintech APIs. Jokes aside, the deal will bring the smaller company’s remittance and currency-transfer tech into Visa for just under $1 billion.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Even, a healthcare membership company, aims to make going to a primary care doctor as easy and accessible in India as it is in other countries.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global pandemic highlighted inefficiencies and inconsistencies in healthcare systems around the world. <a href="https://even.in/">Even</a> co-founders Mayank Banerjee, Matilde Giglio and Alessandro Ialongo say nowhere is this more evident than in India, especially after the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/07/20/1018438334/indias-pandemic-death-toll-estimated-at-about-4-million-10-times-the-official-co">COVID death toll reached 4 million</a> this week.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based company received a fresh cash infusion of $5 million in seed funding in a round led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Founders Fund, Lachy Groom and a group of individuals including Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora, CRED CEO Kunal Shah, Zerodha founder Nithin Kamath and DST Global partner Tom Stafford.</p>
<p>Even, a healthcare membership company, aims to cover what most insurance companies in the country don’t, including making going to a primary care doctor as easy and accessible as it is in other countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Banerjee grew up in India and said the country is similar to the United States in that it has government-run and private hospitals. Where the two differ is that private health insurance is a relatively new concept for India, he told TechCrunch. He estimates that less than 5% of people have it, and even though people are paying for the insurance, it mainly covers accidents and emergencies.</p>
<p>This means that routine primary care consultations, testings and scans outside of that are not covered. And, the policies are so confusing that many people don’t realize they are not covered until it is too late. That has led to people asking doctors to admit them into the hospital so their bills will be covered, Ialongo added.</p>
<p>Banerjee and Giglio were running another startup together when they began to see how complicated health insurance policies were. About 50 million Indians fall below the poverty line each year, and many become unable to pay their healthcare bills, Banerjee said.</p>
<p>They began researching the insurance industry and talking with hospital executives about claims. They found that one of the biggest issues was incentive misalignment — hospitals overcharged and overtreated patients. Instead, Even is taking a similar approach to Kaiser Permanente in that the company will act as a service provider, and therefore, can drive down the cost of care.</p>
<p>Even became operational in February and launched in June. It is gearing up to launch in the fourth quarter of this year with more than 5,000 people on the waitlist so far. Its health membership product will cost around $200 per year for a person aged 18 to 35 and covers everything: unlimited consultations with primary care doctors, diagnostics and scans. The membership will also follow as the person ages, Ialongo said.</p>
<p>The founders intend to use the new funding to build out their operational team, product and integration with hospitals. They are already working with 100 hospitals and secured a partnership with Narayana Hospital to deliver more than 2,000 COVID vaccinations so far, and more in a second round.</p>
<p>“It is going to take a while to scale,” Banerjee said. “For us, in theory, as we get better pricing, we will end up being cheaper than others. We have goals to cover the people the government cannot and find ways to reduce the statistics.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA['I think you want insight from people who understand how human beings listen and learn and grow.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, Cowboy Ventures&#8217; Ted Wang joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising, where he spoke about executive coaching and why he encourages founders in his portfolio to have a CEO coach. Wang, who has an executive coach himself, sees coaching as a key way to drive sustained personal growth, a factor that he believes separates the middling CEOs from the best ones.</p>
<h2>Why CEOs need coaching</h2>
<p>Just like professional athletes at the top of their game still need coaching, executives can need external validation and comment on where they are and aren&#8217;t delivering, Wang says. These insights can be tough for executives to catch on their own and might require a level of honesty that can be challenging for a CEO to expect from anyone involved with their company.</p>
<blockquote><p>Roger Federer &#8212; the famous tennis player who has won 20 Grand Slam events &#8212; he has a coach, but he doesn&#8217;t just have a coach, he has a coach for tennis. I&#8217;m pretty sure Roger knows the rules of the game and all the different strokes he needs to hit, so why would he have a coach? The answer is really that it&#8217;s about having a second set of eyes; when you&#8217;re in the moment … it&#8217;s hard to be able to see yourself and assess yourself. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:52)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Coaches can help entrepreneurs reflect and reframe the things being communicated with them.</p>
<blockquote><p>A good example &#8212; you might be at a board meeting and one of your board members is being critical of your VP of marketing, and one way to think of that is &#8220;Oh, OK, here are some things we need to solve for this person,&#8221; but another point of view that a coach might open your eyes to, is actually maybe this person thinks you&#8217;re not hiring the right people. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 8:59)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>While advisers can help startups navigate tactical situations, therapists may be more focused on helping clients navigate emotional states and improve themselves. Coaching exists in a very nebulous gray area between startup advisers and licensed therapists, Wang says, but coaching is more focused on improving yourself as a business leader rather than solving a particularly vexing startup issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vochi.ai/">VOCHI</a>, a Belarus-based startup behind a clever computer vision-based video editing app used by online creators, has raised an additional $2.4 million in a &#8220;late-seed&#8221; round that follows the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/vochi/">initial $1.5 million round</a> led by Ukraine-based Genesis Investments last year. The new funds follow a period of significant growth for the mobile tool, which is now used by more than 500,000 people per month and has achieved a $4 million-plus annual run rate in a year&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>Investors in the most recent round include TA Ventures, Angelsdeck, A.Partners, Startup Wise Guys, Kolos VC and angels from companies like Belarus-based Verv and Estonian unicorn Bolt. Along with the fundraise, VOCHI is elevating the company&#8217;s first employee, Anna Buglakova, who began as head of marketing, to the position of co-founder and chief product officer.</p>
<p>According to VOCHI co-founder and CEO Ilya Lesun, the company&#8217;s idea was to provide an easy way for people to create professional edits that could help them produce unique and trendy content for social media that could help them stand out and become more popular. To do so, VOCHI leverages a proprietary computer vision-based video segmentation algorithm that applies various effects to specific moving objects in a video or to images in static photos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;To get this result, there are two trained [convolutional neural networks] to perform semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation and Instance Segmentation,&#8221; explains Lesun, of VOCHI&#8217;s technology. &#8220;Our team also developed a custom rendering engine for video effects that enables instant application in 4K on mobile devices. And it works perfectly without quality loss,&#8221; he adds. It works pretty fast, too &#8212; effects are applied in just seconds.</p>

<p>The company used the initial seed funding to invest in marketing and product development, growing its catalog to over 80 unique effects and more than 30 filters.</p>

<p>Today, the app offers a number of tools that let you give a video a particular aesthetic (like a dreamy vibe, artistic feel, or 8-bit look, for example). It also can highlight the moving content with glowing lines, add blurs or motion, apply different filters, insert 3D objects into the video, add glitter or sparkles and much more.</p>
<p>In addition to editing their content directly, users can swipe through a vertical home feed in the app where they can view the video edits others have applied to their own content for inspiration. When they see something they like, they can then tap a button to use the same effect on their own video. The finished results can then be shared out to other platforms, like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.</p>
<p>Though based in Belarus, most of VOCHI&#8217;s users are young adults from the U.S. Others hail from Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and parts of Europe, Lesun says.</p>
<p>Unlike some of its video editor rivals, VOCHI offers a robust free experience where around 60% of the effects and filters are available without having to pay, along with other basic editing tools and content. More advanced features, like effect settings, unique presents and various special effects, require a subscription. This subscription, however, isn&#8217;t cheap &#8212; it&#8217;s either $7.99 per week or $39.99 for 12 weeks. This seemingly aims the subscription more at professional content creators rather than a casual user just looking to have fun with their videos from time to time. (A one-time purchase of $150 is also available, if you prefer.)</p>
<p>To date, around 20,000 of VOCHI&#8217;s 500,000 monthly active users have committed to a paid subscription, and that number is growing at a rate of 20% month-over-month, the company says.</p>

<p>The numbers VOCHI has delivered, however, aren&#8217;t as important as what the startup has been through to get there.</p>
<p>The company has been growing its business at a time when a dictatorial regime has been cracking down on opposition, leading to arrests and violence in the country. Last year, employees from U.S.-headquartered enterprise startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/pandadoc-employees-arrested-in-belarus-after-founders-protest-against-lukashenko-regime/">PandaDoc were arrested</a> in Minsk by the Belarus police, in an act of state-led retaliation for their protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. In April, Imaguru, the country’s main startup hub, event and co-working space in Minsk &#8212; and birthplace of a number of startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/09/facebook-acquires-video-filter-app-msqrd-to-square-up-to-snapchat/">MSQRD, which was acquired by Facebook</a> &#8212; was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/belarusian-regimes-thugs-shut-down-imaguru-the-countrys-key-startup-hub/">also shut down by the Lukashenko regime</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, VOCHI was being featured as App of the Day in the App Store across 126 countries worldwide, and growing revenues to around $300,000 per month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personal videos take an increasingly important place in our lives and for many has become a method of self-expression. VOCHI helps to follow the path of inspiration, education and provides tools for creativity through video,&#8221; said Andrei Avsievich, general partner at Bulba Ventures, where VOCHI was incubated. &#8220;I am happy that users and investors love VOCHI, which is reflected both in the revenue and the oversubscribed round.&#8221;</p>
<p>The additional funds will put VOCHI on the path to a Series A as it continues to work to attract more creators, improve user engagement and add more tools to the app, says Lesun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two Democratic senators introduced a bill Thursday that would strip away the liability shield that social media platforms hold dear when those companies boost anti-vaccine conspiracies and other kinds of health misinformation.</p>
<p>The Health Misinformation Act, introduced by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), would create a new carveout in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to hold platforms liable for algorithmically promoted health misinformation and conspiracies. Platforms rely on Section 230 to protect them from legal liability for the vast amount of user-created content they host.</p>
<p>&#8220;For far too long, online platforms have not done enough to protect the health of Americans,&#8221; Klobuchar said. &#8220;These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bill would specifically alter Section 230&#8217;s language to revoke liability protections in the case of &#8220;health misinformation that is created or developed through the interactive computer service&#8221; if that misinformation is amplified through an algorithm. The proposed exception would only kick in during a declared national public health crisis, like the advent of COVID-19, and wouldn&#8217;t apply in normal times. The bill would task the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with defining health misinformation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Features that are built into technology platforms have contributed to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, with social media platforms incentivizing individuals to share content to get likes, comments, and other positive signals of engagement, which rewards engagement rather than accuracy,&#8221; the bill reads.</p>
<p>The bill also makes mention of the <a href="https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen">&#8220;disinformation dozen&#8221;</a> — just 12 people, including anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and a grab bag of other conspiracy theorists, who account for a massive swath of the anti-vax misinformation ecosystem. Many of the individuals on the list still openly spread their messaging through social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms.</p>
<p>Section 230&#8217;s defenders generally view the idea of new carveouts to the law as dangerous. Because Section 230 is such a foundational piece of the modern internet, enabling everything from Yelp and Reddit to the comment section below this post, they argue that the potential for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/safe-tech-act-section-230-warner/">unforeseen second-order effects</a> means the law should be left intact.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cJZpuGBTfI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/safe-tech-act-section-230-warner/">The SAFE TECH Act offers Section 230 reform, but the law&#8217;s defenders warn of major side effects</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But some members of Congress — both Democrats and Republicans — see Section 230 as a valuable lever in their quest to regulate major social media companies. While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/biden-jonathan-kanter-doj/">White House is pursuing its own path</a> to craft consequences for overgrown tech companies through the Justice Department and the FTC, Biden&#8217;s office said earlier this week that the president is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/politics/white-house-section-230-facebook/index.html">&#8220;reviewing&#8221; Section 230</a> as well. But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">as Trump also discovered</a>, weakening Section 230 is a task that only Congress is positioned to accomplish — and even that is still a long shot.</p>
<p>After a recent war of words with President Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/technology/facebook-vaccine-misinformation.html">over its handling of Covid-19 misinformation</a>, Facebook struck a cooperative if vague note on the new Democratic bill. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We believe clarification on the difficult and urgent questions about health related misinformation would be helpful and look forward to working with Congress and the industry as we consider options for reform,&#8221; Facebook VP of Public Policy Kevin Martin said.</span></p>

<p>While the new Democratic bill is narrowly targeted as far as proposed changes to Section 230 go, it&#8217;s unlikely to attract bipartisan support. Republicans are also interest in stripping away some of Big Tech&#8217;s liability protections, but generally hold the view that platforms remove too much content rather than too little. Republicans are also more likely to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-has-blocked-sen-johnson-for-spreading-covid-misinformation-2021-6">sow misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines</a> themselves, framing vaccination as a partisan issue. Whether the bill goes anywhere, it&#8217;s clear that an alarming portion of Americans have no intention of getting vaccinated — even with a much more contagious variant on the rise and colder months on the horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;As COVID-19 cases rise among the unvaccinated, so has the amount of misinformation surrounding vaccines on social media,&#8221; Luján said of the proposed changes to Section 230. &#8220;Lives are at stake.&#8221;</p>

			E-commerce in LatAm has taken off at a compound annual industry growth rate of 16% over the past five years.					</blockquote>

<h2>The holdout: Latin America</h2>
<p>Venture capitalists have been investing heavily in last-mile delivery over the past five years on a global scale, but Latin America (LatAm) has lagged behind. Over $11 billion has been invested globally in last-mile logistics over the past decade, but Latin America only saw about $1 billion over the same period (Source: PitchBook and WIND Ventures research).</p>
<p>Within this, only about $300 million was in Spanish-speaking Latin America — a surprisingly small amount for a region that has 110 million more consumers than in the U.S.</p>
<p>Brazil-based <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/softbank-backed-loggi-valued-near-2-billion-in-funding-round">Loggi</a> accounts for about 60% of last-mile VC investment in Latin America, but it only operates in Brazil. That leaves major Spanish countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Argentina without a leading independent last-mile logistics company.</p>
<p>In these countries, about 60% of the last-mile delivery market is dominated by small, informal companies or independent drivers using their own trucks. This results in inefficiencies due to a lack of technologies such as route optimization as well as a lack of operating scale. These issues are quickly becoming more pronounced as e-commerce in LatAm has taken off at a compound annual industry growth rate of 16% over the past five years.</p>
<p>Retailers are missing an opportunity to give customers what they want. Customers today expect free, reliable same- or next-day delivery — on-time, all the time, and without damage or theft. All of these are challenging in LatAm. Theft, in particular, is a significant problem, because unprofessional drivers often steal products out for delivery and then sell them for a profit. Cost is a problem, too, because free same- and next-day deliveries are simply not available in many places.</p>
<h2>Operational and technological roadblocks abound</h2>
<p>Why does Latin America lag when it comes to the last mile? First, traditional LatAm e-commerce delivery involves multiple time-consuming steps: Products are picked up from the retailer, delivered to a cross-dock, distributed to a warehouse, delivered to a second cross-dock, and then finally delivered to the customer.</p>
<p>By comparison, modern delivery operations are much simpler. Products are picked up from the retailer, delivered to a cross-dock, and then delivered directly to the customer. There’s no need for warehousing and an extra pre-warehouse cross-dock.</p>
<p>And those are just the operational challenges. Lack of technology also plays a significant role. Most delivery coordination and routing in LatAm are still done via a spreadsheet or pen and paper.</p>
<p>Dispatchers have to manually pick up a phone to call drivers and dispatch them. In the U.S., computerized optimization algorithms dramatically cut both delivery cost and time by automatically finding the most efficient route (e.g., packing the most deliveries possible on a truck along the route) and automatically dispatching the driver that can most efficiently complete the route based on current location, capacity and experience with the route. These algorithms are almost unheard of in the Latin America retail logistics sector.</p>
