										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The relationship between economic news and the value of technology stocks has been a fun puzzle in recent months.</p>
<p>You might think that strong jobs reports, for example, would lead to general economic optimism and, therefore, upward movements for technology stocks. And you might also expect that poor economic data would lead to general economic pessimism, and therefore downward movement for technology stocks. You know, because tech is a big part of the present-day economy.</p>
<p>Ha, no. Well, partially yes, but also no.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254981" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Heading into <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/december-2021-jobs-report-labor-department-unemployment-usa-192453058.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today&#8217;s jobs report</a>, there was a specter hanging over the markets. Namely, the U.S. Federal Reserve, which will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/the-fed-is-scaring-markets-with-the-triple-threat-of-policy-tightening.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin to tighten monetary policy this year</a>, perhaps through the end of its bond-buying program, cutting its balance sheet and raising rates. The result of the Fed tightening rates is that bonds and other lower-risk assets would become more attractive. At the same time, rising rates are expected to make expensive tech stocks less attractive given risk-adjusted return evolution.</p>
<p>Given that dynamic, you might expect that a strong jobs report today would mean that tech stocks would go down, and a jobs report miss would mean that tech stocks would go up. That almost happened. Today&#8217;s December jobs data missed (199,000 net new jobs reported, about half of expectations) and tech stocks <em>initially</em> sold off. But then when markets opened, they ripped higher, with the Nasdaq up 0.34% &#8212; while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down a fraction &#8212; and software stocks are up around 0.8%.</p>
<p>Why the drop and then bounce in tech stock value?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/conorsen/status/1479454159313195016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concern that</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1479455915833241606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we&#8217;ve effectively reached full employment</a>. Which could mean that the lackluster December jobs number was not driven entirely by a lack of employer demand, but also in part due to a lack of worker supply. (The fact that <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronsojourner/status/1479447236299919369">we remain in a global pandemic plays into this dynamic</a>, of course</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We find ourselves, then, in the weird situation when a poor jobs report could indicate that the economy is stronger (closer to full employment) than anticipated, implying that wages and prices will continue to rise, inducing the Fed to raise rates. Which, as noted above, would mean that higher-risk assets would sell off and less risky assets would become more attractive. And yet tech stocks are a touch higher because, well, it appears that the markets are deciding that the poor-ish report will net out positive for tech shares, which have sold off sharply in recent weeks. Or that the lackluster jobs report will prove less Fed-provoking than a strong jobs report, in essence.</p>
<p>So, tech stocks are higher today and everyone who works in the industry gets a little wealth bump.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pendulumfn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pendulum</a> helps companies, governments and other organizations track harmful narratives on social media platforms and elsewhere on the web. The company today announced that it has raised a $5.9 million seed round led by Madrona Venture Group, with participation from Cercano Management and others. The service was incubated inside Madrona Venture Labs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pendulum’s platform applies AI and NLP technologies to uncover threats and opportunities contained in narratives in the earliest days of their formation and track them as they spread online,&#8221; explains Madrona managing director Hope Cochran. &#8220;By dissecting and categorizing the narratives in text, video and audio content on social media platforms, companies are better prepared and able to engage with communities as they choose. With support for YouTube, BitChute, Rumble and Podcasts currently available, the platform will grow to encompass all social platforms of importance over the coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team behind Pendulum seems uniquely suited to build a product like that. Co-founder Sam Clark, for example, previously worked as a data mining engineer at Decide.com and then at eBay after it acquired that company. He also co-created <a href="https://transparency.tube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transparency Tube</a>, a project that categorizes and analyzes political YouTube channels. Transparency Tube shares quite a bit of DNA with Pendulum, and Clark then teamed up with Madrona to build a commercial product around this general idea of tracking mis- and disinformation online. That&#8217;s also where he teamed up with his co-founder Mark Listes, who brings a lot of government experience to the team. Listes was previously the director of policy for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the chief of staff for the National Security Innovation Network, where he helped manage the U.S. Department of Defense&#8217;s venture engagement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254819" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2254835" style="width: 822px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254835" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg" alt="" width="812" height="406" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg 812w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254835" class="wp-caption-text">Pendulum co-founders Sam Clark (l) and Mark Listes (r). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pendulum</p></div></p>
<p>While Listes expected to have a pretty calm time at the Election Assistance Commission, he obviously picked the wrong time for that when he joined in 2016. &#8220;By November and December of &#8217;16, the elections space looked a lot different,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;We were dealing with foreign interference and intelligence briefs and everything under the sun. Long story short, over the next two and a half years, I and my colleagues got right in the middle of leading the effort for fighting foreign interference out of our election system. We experienced it both personally and organizationally, and then helped fight to get out of our overall system. Harmful narratives and the impact that narratives, whether they&#8217;re mis- or disinformation or malaligned narratives can have on society at large.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet while Pendulum can be used by government agencies to track online narratives, it&#8217;s a commercial service first. &#8220;We&#8217;re commercial first,&#8221; Listes said. &#8220;There&#8217;s of course an easy, intuitive government play here, but we&#8217;re actually focusing exclusively on the commercial sector first and we&#8217;re building out some really powerful partnerships there.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254834" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254834" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254834" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254834" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pendulum</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Listes stressed that for a platform like Pendulum to work, it has to cover as many platforms as possible. It&#8217;s not enough to simply track Twitter, which doesn&#8217;t offer a representative sample of the population anyway, or YouTube. Because of this, Pendulum also tracks BitChute and Rumble, for example.</p>
<p>But Listes also noted that Pendulum isn&#8217;t in the business of adjudicating truth. &#8220;We actually have this really strong powerful narrative tracking engine that is not reliant on whether or not something&#8217;s true or false,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;We&#8217;re staying away from truth adjudication &#8212; and that opens us up to a wider range of use cases.&#8221; That means the company can work with corporations, for example, which may want to track narratives around a company&#8217;s executives and assets, for communications but also security reasons.</p>
<p>Because it doesn&#8217;t want to decide whether something is true or not, Pendulum opens itself up for use by nefarious actors as well. Listes argues that the company doesn&#8217;t track any personal identifiable information, though, and that the team is quite cognizant of this possibility. &#8220;We&#8217;re building values to make sure that we&#8217;re not ever in any way creating an unfair playing field or empowering malicious actors and things like that through the use of our tool,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finalsite, an internet software house that provides school districts with website design, hosting, and content management solutions, has been hit by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, school districts whose websites are hosted by Finalsite discovered that they were no longer accessible or displayed errors. While at the time Finalsite blamed the issues on “performance difficulties” across different services, the Glastonbury, Conn.-based company has since confirmed the outage was caused by ransomware.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Tuesday, January 4, our team identified the presence of ransomware on certain systems in our environment,” <a href="https://status.finalsite.com">the company said in a statement</a>. “We immediately took steps to secure our systems and to contain the activity. We quickly launched an investigation into the event with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists, and began proactively taking certain systems offline.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254983" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Finalsite spokesperson Morgan Delack told TechCrunch that 5,000 of its total 8,000 global customers — including school districts in Kansas City, Illinois, and Missouri — are affected by the incident. In addition to website outages, one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rxnze3/thousands_of_school_websites_have_been_down_for_3/">claimed</a> the incident also prevented some schools from sending email notifications about school closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks.</p>
<p>In its latest status update, FinalSite says the &#8220;vast majority of front-facing websites are online,&#8221; though notes that “some sites may still lack proper styling, admin log-in functionality, calendar events, or constituent directories.&#8221; One Finalsite customer, the Holy Ghost Preparatory School in Pennsylvania, <a href="https://twitter.com/HGPAlumni/status/1479454006300880897">said</a> on Friday that while its website is back online, registration forms and our email system remain unavailable.</p>
<p>The Finalsite spokesperson said the company took its customers&#8217; sites offline upon noticing a problem and rebuilt its system in a clean environment from the ground up. “That is why it is taking time to get everyone back online,” she said. “The malware issue is not what caused sites to go down — we took them down to protect our client’s data.&#8221;</p>
<p>It remains unclear how attackers gained access to Finalist’s systems, and it’s not yet known what type of ransomware was used in the attack. The company tells TechCrunch that it continues to work with a forensic specialist to complete a thorough investigation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Reinhardt spent the last decade as CEO at <a href="http://segment.com">Segment</a> helping to build the customer data platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">selling it to Twilio</a> for $3.2 billion along the way. Today, Reinhardt announced he was leaving Twilio to be full-time CEO at <a href="https://www.charmindustrial.com/">Charm Industrial</a>, a carbon mitigation startup he co-founded in 2018.</p>
<p>Reinhardt expressed mixed emotions about leaving, calling it bitter sweet, but believes that working on the global climate crisis is something that demands his attention now. Steve Davito, Twilio Segment’s go-to-market leader, will take over for him, according to the company.</p>
<p>Reinhardt says that the Charm&#8217;s business began to accelerate last year after his co-founder, chief scientist Shaun Meehan, had a couple of key breakthroughs, and he felt it was time to devote his energies completely to the venture.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254791" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;My co-founder Shaun realized that we could convert biomass into a liquid and that that solved a whole bunch of economic logistics issues around how to make biomass accessible,&#8221; Reinhardt told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then the second thing was another breakthrough that Shaun had, which was that we could pump that liquid biomass underground and effectively put oil back where it came from. And that idea of pumping liquid plants, basically back underground, to put oil back underground [was key],&#8221; Reinhardt explained.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen biodiesel fuel produced from vegetable oil or cooking grease to run <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/green-cars/biodiesel-car-benefits-buyers-guide-and-fuel-conversion-info">specially equipped vehicles</a> for years. Jon Shieber, former TechCrunch reporter, who now works as a venture partner and chief editor at Footprint Coalition, a firm that invests in climate startups, says this is taking the opposite approach.&#8221;It’s biodiesel production, but instead of burning the fuel, they sequester it permanently,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company reports it&#8217;s off to a decent start, removing over 5400 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in 2021 using this method, its first full year in operation. It believes that makes it the most successful and largest carbon mitigation project in history, but even with that kind of success, the startup recognizes that it is just the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet… 5,000 tons is a drop in the bucket. We are in a race against time to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year (according to IPCC models.) We’ll need multiple methods of carbon removal, all scaling at breakneck speed, to meet our climate goals,&#8221; Reinhardt wrote in the <a href="https://charmindustrial.com/blog/largest-permanent-carbon-removal-delivery-of-all-time">company blog</a> in October.</p>
<p>Shieber says that Charm Industrial is in fact part of a group of startups trying to attack this problem. &#8220;All [of these companies are] very promising parts of an emerging chain of carbon capture, sequestration and utilization. Solutions have to do more than just replace fossil fuels. We have to clean up the mess we’ve made in the air,&#8221; Shieber told me.</p>

<p>The company generates revenue by having customers pay them in a form of carbon offsets to cancel out their carbon usage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/salesforce-reaches-net-zero-energy-usage-announces-updates-to-sustainability-cloud/">across the supply chain</a>. Stripe was the startup&#8217;s first customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stripe really led the way here with a carbon dioxide removal RFP. And so they became our first customer. They&#8217;ve purchased a couple hundred tons of permanent removal. And they&#8217;ve also gone and purchased from a number of other really interesting new technologies that also do permanent carbon removal,&#8221; Reinhardt told me.</p>
<p>Other companies who have bought into this approach with Charm Industrial include Shopify, Zendesk, Block (formerly Square) and Microsoft.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/265342-51/company/profile#insights">Pitchbook reports</a> Charm raised over $25 million to date, a number he disputed, only confirming that the company has raised an A round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">US medical device maker, Abbott, is moving into making general purpose consumer biosensing wearables.</p>
<p>The company has been making continuous glucose monitor (CGM) hardware for diabetes management for years (since 2014) &#8212; but in a healthtech keynote at CES yesterday, Abbott&#8217;s chairman and CEO, Robert B Ford, announced it&#8217;s developing a new line of consumer biowearables &#8212; called Lingo &#8212; intended for more general fitness and wellness purposes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Technology gives us the power to digitize, decentralize and democratize healthcare, create a shared language between you and your doctor &#8212; and put more control of your health in your hands,&#8221; he said during the keynote. &#8220;We’re creating a future that will bring you and your loved ones care that&#8217;s more personal and precise. It’s happening right now. And its potential is no less than incredible.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ford said the Lingo sensing technology is being designed to track &#8220;key signals&#8221; in the body &#8212; such as glucose, ketones and lactate &#8212; adding that it could also be used to track alcohol levels in the future.</p>
<p>Last year the company launched a biosensor designed for athletes, called the Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biowearableiii &#8212; which was made available in Europe, and has been used by the likes of marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge to support their training needs.</p>
<p><span class="il">Abbott said its goal with Lingo</span> is to expand glucose monitoring to people looking to manage their weight, sleep better, improve energy and think clearer.</p>
<p>To support this expanded utility it said it&#8217;s developing the biosensor to measure other biomarkers than glucose.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A ketone biowearable is being developed to track ketones continuously, see how fast you are getting into ketosis, and understand exactly what keeps you there by providing insights on dieting and weight loss,&#8221; the company noted in a press release. &#8220;A lactate biowearable is in development to track continuous lactate build up during exercise, which can be used as an indicator of athletic performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent years a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/signos-series-a/">startups in the US</a>, Europe and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ultrahuman-raises-17-5m-touting-a-wearable-blood-glucose-tracker/">Asia</a> have been seeking to productize CGM hardware &#8212; including existing sensors made by Abbott &#8212; for a variety of non-medical purposes, launching real-time blood glucose tracking services targeted at fitness enthusiasts, peopler wanting to lose weight or generally health conscious consumers.</p>
<p>Abbott jumping into the space itself so quickly suggests it sees significant potential for biosensing consumer wearables to go mainstream.</p>
<p>For a deep dive on what it&#8217;s like living with a CGM biosensor attached to your arm &#8212; and the constantly updating window into biological process that it provides &#8212; check out TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/four-weeks-as-an-ultrahuman-cyborg/">review of Ultrahuman&#8217;s Cyborg service</a>, an Indian-based startup that&#8217;s repurposing current-gen sensing hardware made by Abbott.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The vast majority of e-commerce customers prefer to preview the product before making the purchase. That’s the reason why the likes of Amazon have historically struggled to move fashion and home decor items online. A San Francisco and Bengaluru-based startup is attempting to solve this problem and has just raised a new funding round to scale its operations.</p>
<p>AI and computer vision startup <a href="http://Avataar.me">Avataar</a> said on Friday it has raised $45 million in its Series B funding. The round was led by Tiger Global, and existing investor Sequoia Capital India participated in it. The six-year-old startup has raised about $55.5 million, including some financed by the founder and chief executive in the early years, across all funding rounds.</p>
<p>Avataar helps direct-to-consumer brands and e-commerce marketplaces with shaping their consumer journeys with 3D rendition of products. The firms can integrate Avataar’s plug-and-play technology into their system, which then allows customers to visualize the products in its real-life size and <em>feel</em> in their living room using the phone’s camera.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254923" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup currently works with a number of firms including the top two e-commerce marketplaces across furniture, large appliances and other categories, said Sravanth Aluru, founder and chief executive of Avataar, in an interview with TechCrunch. He declined to share the names of the clients, citing confidentiality agreements. (Some firms such as Samsung and Pepperfry have publicly <a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/get-a-life-like-virtual-shopping-experience-from-your-home-with-augmented-reality-demo-for-samsungs-flagship-refrigerator-tv">acknowledged</a> collaboration with Avataar.)</p>
<p>In a demo, Aluru dragged and dropped several products – couches and desks – to his living room from a partner e-commerce marketplace’s app and changed the color and the SKUs without having to reposition the virtual items in the house. The items can also be interactive. A virtual rendition of a refrigerator allows users to open and close the door, for instance.</p>
<p>Brands don’t need to make any major changes to be able to adapt Avataar’s offerings. As long as the product images are in at least 1080p resolution, Aluru said, Avataar can stitch a virtual and 3D version from it. For consumers, too, if they are using an iPhone or an Android smartphone launched in recent years, there’s a good chance that their phone has the computational and graphical power to support viewing and interactive with virtual objects, he said.</p>
<p>“Given the camera is the homescreen, you see significantly higher engagement time and brands are witnessing more than 3.5x sales conversion,” he said. The startup relays the engagement information to the partner brands who then further personalize their offerings to better serve the customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aluru said an increasingly growing number of companies are beginning to adapt the technology as they recognize the benefits it can deliver. This <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/3d-rendering-in-tmall-cutting-edge-tech-to-accelerate-image-preview-30x_596811">trend</a> is projected to only grow from here.</p>
<p>Without revealing the brand names, he said some smartphone firms have used Avataar’s technology to carry virtual launches. “We are today integrated across most platforms. If you’re seeing 3D on a big large volume service, it’s likely powered by us,” he said.</p>

<p>By 2025, nearly 75% of the global population and almost all people who use social and communication apps will be frequent AR users, said Snap in a recent report, for which it collaborated with Deloitte. The report said there are already over 100 million customers who shop using AR.</p>
<p>Aluru said the startup is gearing up to be at the forefront as metaverse makes inroads and engages with several key players in the space.</p>
<p>&#8220;The metaverse is already here, just not evenly distributed. Avataar.me is leading the way in bringing scale creation capabilities to the largest brands to enable commerce &#8211; an application with tremendous promise in AR/VR environments,” said Shailesh Lakhani, MD at Sequoia India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Sravanth, Gaurav, and Mayank have been a delight to work with and Sequoia Capital India is excited to re-iterate its commitment in their Series B round.&#8221;</p>
<p>The digital and digitally influenced marketplace is projected to grow to $18 trillion by 2025, offering a monetization opportunity of over $50 billion over the next decade for the underlying platforms driving the 2D to 3D commerce shift, according to industry estimates.</p>
<p>“For the first time in history, we are now able to detect, understand, augment and manipulate consumers’ physical reality using a live camera feed. While our patented AI/CV capabilities are applicable to the overall metaverse evolution, we have started with an upfront focus on redefining consumers’ shopping experiences,” said Aluru.</p>
<p>“The platform will transform the consumer shopping experience at home on their mobile devices, through AR glasses/wearables, or even in a physical store exploring an infinite aisle of a digitally enabled catalogue.”</p>
<p>Evan Feinberg, Partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement: “Consumers continue to look for a better eCommerce experience, and the innovative technology created by Avataar provides a powerful plug and play solution for its customers to meet this demand. As the digital world shifts from 2D to 3D, Avataar and its talented management team are well positioned in this fast-growing market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bfree.africa/">Bfree</a>, a Nigerian credit management fintech has embarked on global expansion after raising $1.7 million in a pre-Series A round, to tap the opportunities in emerging markets, where digital lending apps have recently sprung up in droves.</p>
<p>Funds that participated in the latest round included 4Di Capital, Octerra Capital, VestedWorld, Voltron Capital, Logos Ventures, and several other angel investors, bringing the total capital raised by the Lagos-based startup to $2.5 million, having realized $800,000 in a seed round last May.</p>
<p>Bfree is now on a massive recruitment drive for the 16 new markets it is setting up operations in, including Ghana, India, Uganda, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Poland, Pakistan and Indonesia. This is as it grows beyond Nigeria, where it started operations in August 2020 before entering Kenya in July last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254904" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are going into markets with large populations, credit deepening and an underdeveloped regulatory environment, where a behavioral collection approach is likely to work,” Bfree co-founder and CEO, Julian Flosbach told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bfree was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chukwudi-enyi/?originalSubdomain=ng">Chukwudi Enyi</a> (COO), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moses-azubuike-nmor/">Moses Nmor</a> (CPO) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-flosbach-461a8756/">Flosbach</a> (CEO), who were looking to develop better, ethical and tech-inspired debt-collection tools and processes following their first-hand experience working for digital lenders in Nigeria.</p>
<p>“We saw that there was like a little bit of a breach in the value proposition of lenders &#8212; they are good at giving out loans, but the aftersales services of the credit market didn&#8217;t work as collections processes were inefficient and not user friendly,” said Flosbach.</p>
<p>Flosbach told TechCrunch that Bfree employs the use of ethical debt collection standards and works closely with defaulters for tailor-made settlement options, with the end-goal of increasing the repayment rate and customer satisfaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ethical debt collection standards ensure the privacy of customer information during the process, explore flexible repayment options and do not lead to unnecessary penalties like lateness fees and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/kenya-cracks-down-on-digital-lenders-over-data-privacy-issues/">debt-shaming</a> (as is the practice with many digital lenders at the moment).</p>

<p>The startup is currently working with 30 credit institutions, including digital lenders, micro-finance institutions and banks. Using customer data provided by the lenders, the startup builds the user profiles of defaulters, and runs their data through an algorithm to predict their behavior and recommend the best collection method.</p>
<p>Depending on a customer’s risk profile, Bfree either directs them to a self-service platform, where borrowers set new payment plans using their phone number, follow-up on debt balance through automated communication (chatbots, callbots or IVR technology) or direct calls. The startup also regularly conducts financial literacy campaigns.</p>
<p>The emerging markets have in recent years experienced a surge in digital lenders providing credit to a population that has remained underserved by formal lenders. The credit offered is often instant and collateral-free, which is unlike loans from formal banking institutions (like banks) where borrowers are at the very least required to hold an account, have regular account activity and maintain minimum operating balances. Besides, traditional lenders require collateral of some kind to cushion them from losses whenever borrowers fail to repay.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/kenyas-president-signs-new-law-to-police-digital-lenders-apps-have-six-months-to-apply-for-licenses/">Digital lenders avail the much-needed credit to people locked out</a> by formal banking institutions, but they experience a high default rate (in mid 2020, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-06/biden-must-hold-ethiopia-s-abiy-accountable?sref=gni836kR">Kenya’s default of digital loans stood at 23%</a>), which has forced them to outsource the services of collection agencies, which, among other techniques, use debt-shaming tactics like calling the friends and relatives of borrowers.</p>
<p>Bfree has so far followed up with 1.1 million defaulters to date, and are currently handling around 800,000 customers, majority of them in Nigeria. Flosbach anticipates that the startup will be handling 1.4 million profiles by the end of next month.</p>
<p>In preparation for its next stage of growth, Bfree has secured the services of leading industry professionals, including CTO Konrad Pawlus formerly of SALESmanago and Yohan Theatre who previously worked at  investment management firm PIMCO. Theatre takes over as the head of data decision-making and financial engineering. The duo will be part of the team that will steer the startup’s new business as it works to disrupt traditional finance by leveraging blockchain technology for secondary debt markets.</p>
<p>“Lenders in the US or in Europe have the opportunity to sell significant chunks of their debt portfolios to third parties. This means they only carry a portion of the risk of the loans they issue. In emerging markets, this is typically not the case. Lenders have to carry the entire credit risk on their own. A key driver for this difference lies in higher transaction costs and contractual uncertainties,” said Theatre.</p>
<p>“The arrival of DeFi (decentralized finance) is a game-changer: transaction costs can be slashed while contractual certainty is increased by smart contracts. These are some of the risk-sharing instruments that we are now actively providing to lenders and borrowers,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On December 8, Roblox&#8217;s Chinese version LuoBuLeSi, published and operated by Tencent, abruptly closed down its server <a href="https://roblox.qq.com/web202106/news-detail.shtml?newsid=14476655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five months</a> after it launched on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Many users, taken by surprise, took to Chinese social media to complain about the short notice. What users had been playing was in fact an &#8220;archive-deleting test version,&#8221; LuoBuLeSi said in a <a href="https://roblox.qq.com/web202106/news-detail.shtml?newsid=15359110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notice</a>. But one user <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Mi4y1Z7Sr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snapped</a>: &#8220;Have you seen a testing game that lets users add funds to their accounts?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Last year, we launched Roblox China also known as LuoBuLeSi with a vision to build an immersive virtual universe of 3D experiences in China that we have been testing and iterating on along the way,&#8221; a Roblox spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254320" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We always knew that building a compelling platform in China is an iterative process, and we are thankful for the support of LuoBuLeSi users and our global developer community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tencent has not responded to TechCrunch&#8217;s request for comment.</p>
<p>In May 2019, Roblox and Tencent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/eyeing-an-entry-into-china-roblox-enters-strategic-partnership-with-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a joint venture</a> in which the former holds a 51% controlling stake and Tencent with 49%, a rare arrangement in which a foreign entity commands the majority share in a Chinese joint venture. In July 2020, LuoBuLeSi rolled out an<a href="https://www.taptap.com/topic/13306000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Android test version</a>, which explicitly said it would clear user archives when the period ended.</p>

<h2>Data infrastructure</h2>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Roblox&#8217;s unique offering might have taken it more time to secure regulatory greenlight. LuoBuLeSi has billed its </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://edu.roblox.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education-oriented angle</a><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> at the outset. Yet last year, China launched a sweeping crackdown on the private education sector. China&#8217;s heightened restriction on children&#8217;s gaming time was also expected to limit LuoBuLeSi&#8217;s exposure to young players.</span></h2>
<p>One may also wonder how China&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/what-chinas-new-data-privacy-law-means-for-us-tech-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> new data regulations</a> have impacted foreign internet service operators in the country. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/as-yahoo-leaves-china-an-accelerating-stream-of-exits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/the-long-haul-of-microsofts-china-localization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, in response to China&#8217;s tightening cross-border data transfer rules, won&#8217;t be the last foreign companies to pull their services from the massive market.</p>
<p>Roblox&#8217;s statement offers a slight clue:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is critical that we now make the necessary investments, including investments in our data architecture, in order to realize our long-term vision for LuoBuLeSi. We have determined that a number of important transitory actions are necessary as we build the next version of LuoBuLeSi.&#8221;</p>
<p>To publish in China, overseas games normally seek a local partner to help with marketing, distribution, and perhaps most important, regulatory compliance and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/china-restarts-game-approval-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application for gaming licenses</a>.</p>
<p>An ally like Tencent would ensure LuoBuLeSi&#8217;s user-generated plays don&#8217;t go out of line with Chinese authorities. LuoBuLeSi is isolated from Roblox&#8217;s global platform and doesn&#8217;t have the same reservoir of games or pool of players. As a result, many Chinese users have hopped over to the global version via VPNs, a common phenomenon where the Chinese edition of a globally popular title is subject to censorship.</p>
<p>LuoBuLeSi is nonetheless still the gateway for many developers, both domestic and overseas, to have a crack at China&#8217;s casual-games market. That no date has been set for the &#8220;official&#8221; launch no doubt makes many creators impatient. The platform had generated 1.7 million installs in the China App Store prior to its removal on December 8, according to app analytics firm Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we launched LuoBuLeSi last year, we were taking the long view in China wanting to build a platform that would deliver a compelling metaverse experience,&#8221; said the Roblox spokesperson. &#8220;That goal has not changed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Age-tech startups at this year’s CES demonstrated the potential breadth of the sector. If tech can help an older person live more comfortably, it can also help out a lot of other people. After all, the usefulness of things like mobility aids, health monitoring platforms and long-term financial planning aren’t limited to the elderly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/aarp-innovation-labs-takes-a-holistic-approach-to-age-tech-at-ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered the startups at AARP Innovation Labs’ virtual presentation</a>, which ran the gamut from a financial literacy platform to a D2C startup creating products to address menopause.</p>
<p>Some of TechCrunch’s other coverage from this week included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/labrador-set-to-deliver-a-robotic-helping-hand-to-homes-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labrador Systems’ Retriever</a>, a robotic cart with a retractable tray system, shelves and optional fridge. Capable of carrying up to 25 pounds, Retriever assists people with limited mobility, and can deliver payloads like laundry, meals and other items around a house. It can be voice controlled via Alexa (the startup is backed by the Amazon Alexa Fund).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254881" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/this-lightbulb-can-monitor-your-vital-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sengled</a> came out with a smart lightbulb capable of taking health readings, including heart rate, temperature and sleep tracking through radar sensing. While smart monitors aren’t a new idea, Sengled’s lightbulb is particularly unobtrusive. As our hardware editor Brian Heater noted, “it could have some potentially useful applications for eldercare, including fall detection.”</p>
<p>More tech giants are getting into the home health monitoring game, including LG, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865640/lg-tv-telehealth-platform-independa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that all of their 2021 and 2022 smart TVs will come with remote health platform Independa’s app installed. This means people will be able to use their LG TVs to have telemedicine appointments and get access to a pharmacy benefit plan.</p>
<p>Medical device startup Eargo launched its latest hearing aid, the <a href="https://shop.eargo.com/eargo-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eargo 6</a>. New features include Sound Adjust, a proprietary algorithm that automatically adjusts its settings so users don’t have to switch them manually and clarifies speech in noisy environments. It also includes Mask-Mode, an environmental offset that can be selected through Eargo’s app so users can hear people wearing masks more clearly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sensorscall unveiled update to its CareAlert remote monitoring app, which integrates with Apple Watch, Fitbit and other health tracking devices. Its new wellness dashboard allows family members and other caregivers to see trends in daily routines, sleep patterns, hygiene and kitchen usage. CareAlert was created by seniors who are aging-in-place (or continuing to live at home, often apart from other family).</p>

<p>BOCCO emo is one of the latest robot created for nursing homes. Developed by Yukai Engineering, the maker of plush robotic pillow Qoobo, Bocco emo is small enough to sit on a table and connects to medical IoT devices, monitoring patients’ vitals and alerting nurses about patients’ conditions. If a patient needs help, BOCCO emo will ‘talk’ to them until a nurse comes. It can also be used to update families about patients’ conditions. BOCCO emo has already undergone a trial program in Japan and is currently being used at hospitals in the country. The little robot uses “emo language,” which Yukai Engineering says means it is capable of understanding user’s speeches and emotions and responding accordingly with “sound effects, facial expressions and gestures.”</p>
<p>Startups that help enable independent living through the use of IoT sensors included<a href="https://www.eng.nodeus.solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nodeus Solutions</a>’ KoKoon, a network of small IoT sensors connected to mobile app for caregivers and family members. It’s algorithms learns a person’s habits, and informs caregivers if there are any changes in behavior.</p>
<p>Other startups that use a combination of IoT sensors, AI-based tech and mobile apps is <a href="https://caregiver-smart-solutions.myshopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caregiver Smart Solutions</a>, <a href="https://utech.care/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unaide</a> and <a href="https://www.smartmacadam.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Macadam</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the lead up to CES, I wrote a piece reflecting on top tech of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/the-best-tech-of-ces-2012/">CES 2012</a>. It was an interesting exercise for a number of reasons &#8212; not the least of which was recalling the buzzwords from 10 years ago.</p>
<p>That year, LTE and ultrabooks topped the list. One had a great run. The other one, not so much. That is to say that the strength of buzz at CES in any given year isn’t predictive of longevity. By the middle of 2012, the stories around the death of the ultrabook had already begun in earnest.</p>
<p>This year, the halls of CES may have been fairly devoid of human life, but from the looks of things, one couldn’t walk a few feet without tripping over the metaverse. Just over two months after Facebook rebranded to Meta, a little metsploitation is to be expected at a show like CES, where companies are every bit as invested in a good hook as good product. In a show like this, it’s understandable &#8212; if you’re not a company like, say, Samsung or Hyundai, it’s difficult standing out. Of course, both of those giant brands never met a that they didn’t want to verse.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I’ll spare you the specifics on the smaller companies. <a href="https://twitter.com/NimaZeighami/status/1478816178470473730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This thread</a> is a pretty well versed in the aforementioned meta. Frankly, I don’t want to blow up any startups for hoping they glean a little bit of that shine (though, if I’m being honest, “Goart Metaverse” is a phrase that is going to wedge itself into my psyche until my body releases the DMT into my brain in my final moments on Earth).</p>
<p>What I will say, for sure, is that if you didn’t know what a metaverse was prior to the start of CES, the show didn’t do a particularly good job clarifying &#8212; beyond the fact that it probably definitely includes some goofy looking Memojis and probably some VR equipment. And, actually, now that I’m typing that, I recognize that it’s probably as good a description of metaverse as any.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254837" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254837" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254837" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/03_CES-2022_metaverse_169_youtube_220103_Final.2022-01-06-17_58_32.gif" alt="" width="600" height="337" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254837" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hyundai</p></div></p>
<p>Receiving a press release from Hyundai titled, “Hyundai Motor Shares Vision of New Metamobility Concept, ‘Expanding Human Reach’ through Robotics and the Metaverse at CES 2022” may have been what pushed me over the edge. Or maybe it was the accompanying video of Boston Dynamics’ Spot hanging out on Mars with a bunch of weird metaverse puppets. It was surreal to see a borderline sci-fi video that involved sending an actual robot to actual Mars that still revolved around the metaverse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/hyundai-plans-to-incorporate-robots-into-the-metaverse-to-help-users-reach-out-and-touch-someone/">Hyundai’s concept</a> is nothing if not interesting, using advanced robots like the ones from Boston Dynamics to serve as real-world avatars for our metaversial interactions, but it also speaks to how much even ostensibly automotive companies are banking on this concept for the future. Samsung, meanwhile, offered a kind of stopgap metaverse (betaverse?) while we sit down and wait for the real one to shake out. Here it was a “virtual showcase” of the company’s wares, which, at very least, got around the very real irony of traveling to Las Vegas to get pitched the metaverse in-person.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/ces-2022-samsung-x-zepeto-interacting-with-innovative-home-appliances-in-the-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company notes:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Picture this: you’ve just been given the lifestyle TV you’ve always had on your wish list, home appliances that enhance your quality of life and the latest stylish smartphone. Now, what if we told you that you could use those innovative products to decorate your home?</p>
<p>It’s an interesting scenario to think about, and it will become a reality once the metaverse is up and running. Samsung Electronics has been innovating with the metaverse in various ways, and has created an option for those interested in CES 2022 to experience the event online.</p></blockquote>
<p>It must be a confusing time to be among the most bullish on the metaverse. Everyone from beauty brands to wearables. It’s at once hopeful to see such excitement around the concept, but also frustrating to witness what may be an emerging metaverse of shit. That is to say, will the metaverse lose all meaning before there’s a metaverse to metaverse in? Your metaverse is as good as mine (metaverse).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 6, 2021! Today we have not only killer notes on this year’s strange CES confab, but breaking media news and even an editorial from United States Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. And, of course, a host of updates from startup land. Let’s have some fun! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/reflections-on-another-strange-pandemic-era-ces/"><strong>Reflections on another pandemic CES:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Our own Brian Heater has the must-read from this year’s kinda-IRL CES event. TechCrunch decided to not attend in-person due to spiking COVID-19 cases, but that doesn’t mean that we’re not paying attention. If you want to know even more on what it looks like to cover the event from afar, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/look-upon-my-ces-2022-work-from-home-setup-and-despair/">Devin Coldeway has the nitty-gritty</a> you are looking for.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/the-new-york-times-plans-to-buy-the-athletic-for-550m/"><strong>The NYTimes is buying The Athletic:</strong></a> After The Athletic went about the nation hiring all the newspaper sports reporters it could, the company is reversing its model and is instead selling <em>itself</em> to The New York Times. For a reported price of $550 million. That’s a lot of dosh, but not <em>that</em> much in today’s startup terms. Media remains a pretty hard game.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/mark-cuban-backed-fintech-daves-public-offering-puts-spacs-to-the-test/"><strong>Mark Cuban-backed fintech goes public:</strong></a> Remember SPACs? Dave does, because the fintech startup finally rode its chosen blank-check company to the public markets. TechCrunch spoke to the company’s CEO about the transaction, its timing and what’s ahead for the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rounding out the top stories of the day is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/steering-innovation-toward-the-public-good/">this entry from United States Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg</a>. He talks about innovation and the role of government in the creation of what’s next, from a transit perspective.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we jump into our usual mix of startup updates, something fun. TechCrunch’s own Natasha Lomas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/four-weeks-as-an-ultrahuman-cyborg/">spent four weeks testing a “metabolic fitness” service from Ultrahuman</a>. “Becoming a cyborg is no longer as sci-fi as that sounds” in the world of quantified health realm, she says, but the post is a great look into how we may care for our bodies in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/how-will-the-crypto-selloff-impact-the-nft-market/"><strong>How will the crypto selloff impact NFTs?</strong></a> In the last day, before a partial recovery, cryptos sold off sharply. TechCrunch wants to know what impact falling cryptocurrency prices will have on NFTs and other assets that are priced in crypto terms.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/goldfinch-raises-25m-from-a16z-to-power-its-defi-lending-protocol-for-borrowers-in-developing-countries/"><strong>Crypto lending sans crypto collateral:</strong></a> Lucas Matney reports that “most [crypto] lending platforms rely on an end user’s existing crypto collateralization,” while DeFi startup Goldfinch is taking a different approach. It just raised $25 million for its efforts, led by a16z.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/zuddl-raises-13m-for-its-simple-but-powerful-virtual-events-platform/"><strong>Zuddl raises $13M for virtual events:</strong></a> Notably I have not heard that Hopin has raised another trillion dollars in several months, which now feels like a surprise given how busy that company was in the last few years. Regardless, the virtual events space is still attracting capital, Zuddl shows. While it’s nice to see competition in the online confab market, I have to protest gently against Zuddl’s name, which reads like a mix of zoodle (which are gross) and muddle (which is what the company’s name reminds me of).</li>
<li><strong>The mental health startup market is hot:</strong> TechCrunch has notes on the blog today about Little Otter (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/little-otter-raises-22m-to-scale-its-personalized-pediatric-mental-health-platform/">$22 million, focused on child mental health</a>) and Mined (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/emotional-wellness-app-mined-raises-3-5m-led-by-listen-ventures/">$3.5 million, focused on emotional well-being</a>). Two rounds in the same space in a single day reads like a data point to me.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/illegal-movie-streaming-service-popcorn-time-shuts-down/"><strong>RIP Popcorn Time:</strong></a> The golden era of online piracy is behind us, but that doesn’t mean that some services that flagrantly broke copyright law didn’t keep the flame of the past alive. For a while. Now Popcorn Time is no more, which I am sure some of you will mourn.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/reliance-retail-backs-dunzo-in-240-million-funding/"><strong>Dunzo raises $240M from Reliance Retail:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Focused on hyperlocal delivery in seven Indian cities, Dunzo has landed a huge new round led by Reliance Retail, which put in $200 million of the total for a 25.8% stake in the company. Hyperlocal, rapid delivery is a big push around the world. We’re curious about the economics involved, but it’s clear that there’s appetite to invest in the thesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was even more. Rupifi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/rupifi-raises-25-million-for-its-b2b-payments-platform-in-india/">raised $25 million to build its B2B payments business in India</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/yc-backed-namibian-startup-jabu-gets-3-2m-for-its-b2b-e-commerce-and-retail-play/">JABU raised $3.2 million for its B2B e-commerce business</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/payroll-startup-payfit-is-frances-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-289-million/">Payfit became France’s latest unicorn after raising $259 million</a>. It’s busy out there — so busy that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/are-early-stage-funding-rounds-out-of-control/">some folks even in the venture world are curious</a> about the sheer pace of today’s private-market investing.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/5-growth-marketing-predictions-for-2022/">Our latest guest column with predictions for the coming year</a> doesn&#8217;t just prognosticate: Growth expert Jonathan Martinez shares several tactics early-stage companies can use to capitalize on these trends.</p>
<p>Among other topics, Martinez shared methods for incrementally testing ads, his ideas about video ads and influencer marketing, and a few thoughts about Facebook and iOS 14 privacy changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we’ll start seeing heavy investments by Facebook and other social media platforms to keep users on their platforms, where they will still have access to first-party data,&#8221; writes Martinez.</p>

The mobile companion app for the Oculus VR hardware was downloaded “roughly 2 million times globally since Christmas Day,” per third-party data. That’s a lot of headsets.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/spotify-introduces-a-new-ad-format-for-podcasts-that-puts-clickable-cards-inside-shows/">Spotify does an innovation:</a></strong> Spotify has introduced a new podcast advertising format. Cue the parades. What I want is for Spotify to make new ways for me to support musical artists that I love. Spotify, in contrast, is busy working on the podcasting side of its business. I suppose part of my gig is podcasting, but, Spotify. C’mon. Focus back on music!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you have diabetes, or ever suspected that you might, you will have done the poke-your-finger-and-drop-blood-on-a-stick thing until your finger goes numb. Finger-prick blood glucose monitoring is the de facto standard, but AI company <a href="http://scanbo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scanbo</a> wants to put an end to all that, replacing the droplet with some off-the-shelf diagnostic tools and a big helping of data analysis.</p>
<p>The company has developed a prototype device that combines <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a three-lead </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983#:~:text=An%20electrocardiogram%20(ECG%20or%20EKG,attached%20computer%20monitor%20or%20printer." target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECG measurement</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photoplethysmogram</a> (PPG). The 60-second measurement is fed to a set of algorithms that can give you some very promising measurements. For starters, the device is doing non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, but the company&#8217;s founder claims that it can also do blood pressure measurements. </span></p>
<p>I spoke to the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, Ashissh Raichura, as part of TechCrunch&#8217;s virtual CES coverage, where he told me a bit more about the technology. He also gave me a demonstration, first testing his own blood with a conventional, off-the-shelf fingerprick blood glucose monitor, and then with the company&#8217;s own prototype. The measurements were 6.2 and 6.3 mmol/L, respectively, which puts the two devices within a couple of percent accuracy of each other.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254719" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We use the three electrodes for ECG data, and an additional measurement for PPG. We measure for 60 seconds, and then take the raw data and analyze that using the machine learning convolutional neural network, and the deep neural network. We combine all of that data, take the three machine learning algorithms, see what comes as a result, and then analyze the glucose,&#8221; Raichura told me, as he was preparing to demo the device for me. &#8220;We want to commercialize our product, and will be looking looking for US FDA in Health Canada approval.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254806" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254806" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254806" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="643" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg 3992w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=1536,964 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=2048,1286 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254806" class="wp-caption-text">Scanbo&#8217;s prototype in action. <strong>(Image: Scanbo)</strong></p></div></p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that it is possible to do non-invasive blood glucose measuring &#8212; most of the so-called non-invasive methods do use an <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/eversense-continuous-glucose-monitoring-system-p160048s006">implant</a> or a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-continuous-glucose-monitoring-system-adults-not-requiring-blood-sample" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filament sensor wire</a> to get readings, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472987/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the method that Scanbo uses has been studied and covered in medical journals</a>. It doesn&#8217;t look like the FDA has approved any products that take this approach yet, so the company is certainly facing a lengthy medical approval process in order to bring its products to market.</p>
<p>The company also claims it is able to do blood pressure measurements, the kind that you might do at home or in the doctor&#8217;s office with a blood pressure cuff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we take your EKG data, we convert that into what is called a short wave transmission length,&#8221; Raichura summarizes in how the company is able to pull off blood pressure metrics. &#8220;Based on that, we calculate your non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure too. That is another piece of algorithm that we have patent pending.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all of this tech in its back pocket, the company has an interesting choice to make; is it going to start manufacturing its own hardware devices, or is there an opportunity to license the algorithms and technology to other manufacturers that already have devices with PPG and ECG capabilities on the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have two patents pending, purely on the hardware, how we designed it, how we amalgamated electrodes and all the sensors in a way where we can take all the parameters in one time,&#8221; explains Raichura, hinting at how the company is trying to measure all the things at once. &#8220;If you look at the traditionally available all the devices, you measure one thing at a time, not everything at once. You do blood pressure one time, your EKG at another time. One after another, all in sequential processes. In our case, we are asking you to put four fingers on the device, so we can capture all the data, and use algorithms to report different aspects of your health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scanbo sees its technology as an at-home alternative to some of the currently existing clinical techniques and technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a company, we are a combination of AI and med-tech,&#8221; Raichura says, and mentions that the market is starting to take notice. &#8220;With this product, we are just getting started now. Medtronic, Samsung, LG, and others are already talking to us and see can we collaborate with them, and we are exploring a couple of strategic partnerships that could help us in taking us to different markets globally. We see the needs from 400 million people in the world with type two diabetes, and most of the populations can&#8217;t afford glucometers &#8212; never mind continuous glucose meters. We are very, very cost-effective, and we can bring the cost down to as low as $20 a month. There is no biowaste, you don&#8217;t need any disposables, you don&#8217;t need strips or anything, just purely the machine learning algorithm and a device with a chargeable battery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is about to take its prototype and clinical results as leverage to go raise a seed round and kick off the process toward regulatory approval and, eventually, make a product available to the public.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Marketing makes or breaks a company. When I am asked what is the No. 1 thing that I would do to help a company scale massively, it is focusing on marketing. Period.</p>
<p>I learned long ago that the best product doesn’t always win. It’s often a “good enough” product paired with killer marketing powered by unique customer insights. As a VC, I have seen this play out time and time again. Many companies get stuck in “feature and functionality” marketing, meaning they miss the opportunity to create durable brands. That happens when you elevate messaging to higher-level needs that solve a pain point for the end consumer and delight them on an emotional level.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about helping companies uncover new channels or reinvent old channels in a way that moves the needle. Finding a new way to make established channels such as TV, direct mail and radio generate awareness around a brand can be a huge competitive moat and propel a company to exponential growth.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that it’s easy. The job of a marketer gets more complicated with every channel that emerges. Among the latest challenging trend lines:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It’s noisier than ever</strong>. In the year ahead, marketers expect a 40% YoY increase in the number of data sources they use, according to Salesforce’s seventh edition of the annual<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/form/state-of-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> State of Marketing</a> report, for which they spoke to over 8,200 global marketers.</li>
<li><strong>Purses are tightening</strong>. According to Gartner, marketing budgets as a percentage of company revenue fell to 6.4% in 2021 from 11%. The firm reports that “this is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/annual-cmo-spend-survey-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner’s Annual CMO Spend Survey.</a>”</li>
<li><strong>The ponds are overfished</strong>. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-ad-spending-expected-to-rebound-faster-than-previously-forecast-11623666600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A decade ago, only 17% of global ad spend went to the top five ad sellers</a> (Google; Viacom and CBS; News Corp. and Fox; Comcast and Disney). Today, ad networks are much more crowded, with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-ad-spending-expected-to-rebound-faster-than-previously-forecast-11623666600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46% of global ad spending</a> taking place on the top five networks (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba and ByteDance).</li>
</ol>
<p>With this downward pressure on the efficiency of marketing dollars, it’s important to listen to customers, stay curious and remain open to wild ideas that have the potential to break through. Over the past year, I’ve had dozens of conversations with leading marketers to ask them what’s actually working for them, and what crazy idea they tried that seemed ridiculous at the time.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Here are some highlights of what I heard, and what I now share with all of the CEOs and marketing leads at our portfolio companies:</p>
<h2>With developers, marketers need to be problem-solvers, not sellers</h2>
<p>&#8220;Developers are very quick to sniff out any sort of marketing-speak or BS. They&#8217;re looking to get the answer to a problem they have and then move on. How can you get them to the right documentation as quickly as possible? How can you keep them up to speed on the products that are live today, not the ones that will be live two years from now?</p>
<p>Your job is to help them get their hands on the code as quickly as possible. Get them direct access to other developers in the community who think the same way and can help solve some of their problems in real-time.&#8221; — Sara Varni, former CMO at Twilio.</p>
<h2>Avoid free trials at all costs</h2>
<p>&#8220;Early on at Curology, we had a hypothesis that by not charging anything at all for a product trial, it was too easy for people to get it without having any kind of mental commitment. We began experimenting with having people pay the shipping cost, $4.95. [That price] was still a very low barrier for people, but we learned that it dramatically changed the perception of value and the mental commitment in the eyes of our customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everybody wants a little of that TikTok magic.</p>
<p>To that end, Twitter is rolling out a new test feature that invites people to post video reactions to tweets instead of quote-tweeting the old-fashioned way. It&#8217;s a very un-Twitterlike choice, but the company has been actively experimenting with new products for a while now, including the now-retired disappearing tweets known as Fleets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">may they rest in peace</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We want to give you more creative ways to join the conversation and express yourself on Twitter. Starting today, we’re rolling out a test on iOS that gives you the option to Quote Tweet with a reaction video (or photo) with your very own Tweet Take. </p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The test is limited to iOS for now and lets users opt to &#8220;Quote tweet with reaction&#8221; right from the retweet menu. Twitter is calling these reaction vids &#8220;Tweet Takes&#8221; and they play with the tweet embedded, which is fun if entirely derivative of TikTok&#8217;s own video replies. TechCrunch reached out to Twitter to hear more about how wide the test is and how likely Tweet Takes are to make it into the final product.</p>
<p>Twitter says it&#8217;s only running the test with a small subset of iOS users for now and will monitor feedback from the group to see how the feature goes. The company says it wants to give users &#8220;more creative ways to express themselves&#8221; which tracks with its generally experimental vibe lately.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/instagram-now-lets-users-reply-to-comments-with-reels/">Instagram added its own version of TikTok&#8217;s video replies</a> to encourage people to reply to comments on posts through Reels. Given how video replies make TikTok feel more interactive and alive, it makes sense that Instagram would integrate the option into its existing TikTok clone. It might make less sense on Twitter, but we much prefer the see-what-sticks product approach to the company&#8217;s prior strategy of making no changes in the app for years on end and hoping for the best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Months after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/mirror-ceo-exits-company-following-2020-acquisition-by-lululemon/">surprise departure</a> of Mirror founder Brynn Putnam, Lululemon <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220106005777/en/lululemon-names-Michael-Aragon-as-CEO-of-MIRROR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today announced</a> that it has named former Twitch Chief Content Officer Mike Aragon to run the connected fitness brand. Effective January 17, Aragon will be stepping into the CEO role for both Mirror and Lululemon’s Digital Fitness line.</p>
<p>“Mike Aragon has an impressive track record of building successful brands by connecting people and building communities through digital content and experiences,” Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald said in a release tied to the news. “He is the ideal leader to chart the path forward for MIRROR as we engage with the more than 10 million lululemon guests who live the sweat life.”</p>
<p>Putnum stepped down as CEO in September effective immediately, according to a memo that noted Lululemon was on the search for “the right candidate to drive the brand’s next phase of growth.” The news followed the fitness brand’s $500 million 2020 acquisition of the connected fitness startup, as the pandemic was fueling interest in the category.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254756" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Aragon joins the company after nearly five years serving as the CCO of Amazon-owned livestreaming service Twitch. Prior to that, he served as the GM of Crunchyroll parent, Ellation and a VP at PlayStation Network/Sony.</p>
<p>“Mirror has a strong market position with a growing subscriber base, and I look forward to building upon this solid foundation and defining the next chapter of growth with the talented MIRROR team,” he said in the same release.</p>
<p>Interest in home fitness has continued as the pandemic has raged on, though re-openings of gyms have impacted the bottom line of competitors like Peloton. Mirror has also seen increased competition from fellow full-screen workout platforms like Tempo and Tonal. Earlier this week,<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nike-sues-lululemon-patent-infringement-mirror-home-gym-rcna11157" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nike filed a lawsuit</a> against Lululemon over the infringement of six patents related to Mirror and connected apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Mozilla Foundation is pausing the ability to accept donations in cryptocurrencies following a backlash from scores of people, including a founder of the Mozilla Project.</p>
<p>The foundation, which oversees the development of the Firefox browser, on Thursday acknowledged conversations around the environmental impact that cryptocurrencies potentially pose and said it is reviewing whether its current policy on crypto donations &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1479143342495744009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fits with our climate goals</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Decentralized web technology continues to be an important area for us to explore, but a lot has changed since we started accepting crypto donations,&#8221; the foundation said in a tweet thread, pledging to be forthcoming about the updates of its review.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254730" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The foundation started to face backlash after it invited people to donate to the American nonprofit firm via using a variety of crypto tokens, including bitcoin.</p>
<p>In response to its tweet, Jamie Zawinski (a founder of Mozilla) <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jwz/status/1478022085737803776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> dismay at the foundation&#8217;s move. &#8220;Everyone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision to partner with planet-incinerating Ponzi grifters,&#8221; he said, adding an expletive.</p>
<p>Peter Linss, the founder of Gecko, the engine that powered the browser, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/plinss/status/1478135256683143168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> the conversation in telling Mozilla that it was &#8220;meant to be better than this.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time a major firm has faced backlash &#8212; or distanced itself from Bitcoin &#8212; because of environmental concerns. In May last year, Tesla suspended accepting bitcoin as payment for its vehicles, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">months after introducing the option</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Musk said the firm was &#8220;concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.&#8221; Weeks later, he said the company will &#8220;most likely&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-most-likely-accept-bitcoin-again-when-it-becomes-more-eco-friendly/">accept bitcoin again</a> once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables.</p>
<p>Questions around the environmental footprint of Bitcoin have been linked to how various tokens are created. Bitcoin and Ethereum use a mechanism called proof-of-work to power their networks and mint new blocks of each currency. This calculation, by design, has become more complex over the years as the networks grew and gave birth to an industry of firms that run thousands of GPUs around the clock to participate in solving the puzzle.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining consumes about 148 terawatt-hours of energy annually, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates. Many cryptocurrency proponents have, however, either <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1474143477344583694" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disputed such findings or have made a case for why it is worth it</a>.</p>
<p>In recent months, a broader divide has started to emerge in the industry. The critics have challenged some of the fundamental value proposition of web3. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who supports Bitcoin, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/your-mom-owns-web-2-0/">dismissed the assertion </a>that VCs aren&#8217;t reaping most profits from web3 projects.</p>
<p>Amid the ongoing discourse, many firms have scaled back their web3 ambitions. Discord <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/discord-nfts-crypto-jason-citron/">pushed pause on exploring crypto and NFTs</a> in November following outcry from many who opposed the idea. Gaming firm GSC Game World cancelled its plan to include NFTs in its upcoming title &#8220;STALKER 2: Heart of Chernobyl&#8221; after several gamers offered strong feedback.</p>

<p>The new oversubscribed fund brings Khosla’s total set of funds to just under $2 billion. Managing partner Samir Kaul told TechCrunch that the fund gives the firm an opportunity to retain its pro rata and double down on earlier investments, including Impossible Foods, Faire, Checkr, OpenTrons and Vectra AI, which he says have already benefited from the new fund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254731" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We like to invest in the entire lifecycle and this allows us to do that,” he added. “Both our investors and CEOs have asked us for a way to put in more money and also lead later rounds.”</p>
<p>The new fund comes a few months after Khosla closed its Fund VII, raising $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Its Opportunity Fund is the latest in a trend of early-stage venture capital firms wanting to get in on later rounds of their breakout portfolio companies as they continue maturing. We’ve seen firms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/the-latam-funding-boom-continues-as-kaszek-raises-1b-across-a-duo-of-funds/">Kaszek</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/version-one-launches-70m-fund-iv-and-30m-opportunities-fund-ii/">Version One</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/heartcore-capital-bets-on-europe-with-a-200m-fund-for-consumer-tech-startups/">Heartcore Capital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/venture-firm-chapter-one-focused-on-all-things-web3-draws-backing-from-big-name-vc-firms/">Chapter One</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/things-are-heating-up-for-costanoa-ventures-closes-two-over-subscribed-funds/">Costanoa Ventures</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/sapphire-ventures-secures-largest-capital-raise-to-date-across-two-new-funds/">Sapphire Ventures</a>, announce similar funds over the past year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder confirmed it&#8217;s exploring a new feature called Swipe Party which offers a way to make sorting through possible matches a more social experience. According to details spotted in the Tinder mobile app&#8217;s code, Swipe Party requires access to the phone&#8217;s camera and microphone so your friends can &#8220;see and hear you while vetting prospects.&#8221;</p>
<p>This &#8220;Tinder with Friends&#8221;-style experience builds on what&#8217;s already a popular offline activity. Today, friends often swipe through the app together making joint decisions on which profiles the Tinder account holder should try to match with. In the case of Swipe Party, however, it seems as if Tinder is looking to make this a virtual experience where a user could invite a &#8220;guest&#8221; to join their swiping session in order to give their feedback remotely.</p>
<p>This follows on the broader trend of co-browsing apps, as with Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/shareplay-powers-new-ways-to-stay-connected-and-share-experiences-in-facetime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SharePlay</a>, or co-watching videos with friends as enabled by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/hulu-officially-launches-its-co-viewing-feature-watch-party/">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime/">Prime Video</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/disney-rolls-out-support-for-apples-shareplay-co-viewing-experience-over-facetime/">Disney+&#8217;s</a> co-viewing features, for example. The trend was already growing in popularity but was then further amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic and its social distancing requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254642" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Swipe Party feature was first spotted in the Tinder Android app&#8217;s code by the Dutch website <a href="https://www.gratisdatingtips.nl/tinder-swipe-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GratisDatingTips</a>, then reblogged as a rumor by outlets like <a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/tinder/159597-tinder-swipe-party-mode-rumoured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pocket-lint</a> and <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/tinder-dating-app-may-get-Swipe-Party-feature_id137605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhoneArena</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch subsequently confirmed there are also references to Swipe Party in the Tinder app for iOS, according to an analysis by tech analyst Steve Moser (see images below).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254669" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254669" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2254669" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/code-tinder.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="129" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/code-tinder.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/code-tinder.png?resize=150,28 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/code-tinder.png?resize=300,57 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/code-tinder.png?resize=768,145 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/code-tinder.png?resize=680,129 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/code-tinder.png?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254669" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>  Tinder Android app code by <a href="https://www.gratisdatingtips.nl/tinder-swipe-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GratisDatingTips </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="https://www.gratisdatingtips.nl/tinder-swipe-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> (opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254667" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254667" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2254667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tinder-swipe-party.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="147" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tinder-swipe-party.jpeg 787w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tinder-swipe-party.jpeg?resize=150,32 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tinder-swipe-party.jpeg?resize=300,65 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tinder-swipe-party.jpeg?resize=768,166 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tinder-swipe-party.jpeg?resize=680,147 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tinder-swipe-party.jpeg?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254667" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder iOS app code by Steve Moser</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to the code snippets, Swipe Party would see Tinder users inviting friends to join a swiping session. These friends would create guest accounts on Tinder by offering their phone number, validating it with a code, then entering their name and date of birth before joining the &#8220;party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, tech companies regularly build, test and experiment with new features &#8212; many of which are never released to the wider public, and that may be the case here. But what makes the existence of Swipe Party more interesting is how it ties into Tinder parent company Match&#8217;s larger plans to bring more audio and video experiences to its line of dating apps.</p>
<p>The company last August <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/match-group-to-add-live-audio-and-video-to-its-dating-app-portfolio-starting-in-2021/">said it planned to introduce audio and video chat</a> features, including group live video, to its dating app portfolio over the next 12 to 24 months. That means we would see some of these additions begin to show up later this year. Match said these new features would be powered by innovations from Hyperconnect, the Korean social networking company and app maker that became Match&#8217;s biggest acquisition to date at<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/"> $1.73 billion.</a> It&#8217;s not clear that Swipe Party is related to that specific roadmap, which also includes plans for some kind of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/match-group-details-plans-for-a-dating-metaverse-tinders-virtual-goods-based-economy/">dating &#8220;metaverse&#8221; </a>with a virtual goods-based economy.</p>
<p>But the feature does fit in with Tinder&#8217;s recent efforts to become a more interactive and social app instead of just a place to swipe profiles.</p>
<p>Last year, Tinder took its first major steps on that front with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/">a new section in its app called &#8220;Explore,</a>&#8221; where it now highlights the app&#8217;s interactive elements. This includes the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tinders-new-murder-mystery-themed-swipe-night-returns-november-7/">interactive video series Swipe Night,</a> interest-based matching, lightweight chat and more.</p>
<p>Tinder confirmed Swipe Party&#8217;s development, but declined to share further details about the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are always exploring features to help our members connect in new, fun ways,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch, when asked about Swipe Party and its functionality.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Match Group&#8217;s portfolio, the company has also experimented with having friends play matchmaker. Its dating app Ship lets friends engage in group chats about dating prospects, but this was text-based chat not video or audio.</p>
<p>This would also not be the first time Tinder experimented with some sort of social video in its app, either.</p>
<p>The company had previously tested, then discarded, a feature called &#8220;Tinder Mixer,&#8221; which offered users a way to play games and video chat with others nearby. Tinder in more recent years also embraced video in other ways, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/tinder-begins-testing-its-first-video-feature-tinder-loops/">video profiles</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/face-to-face-tinders-opt-in-video-chat-feature-is-now-rolling-out-globally/">one-to-one video calls.</a> But to date, Tinder&#8217;s growth has been limited by its nature as a dating app &#8212; that means (generally speaking) only some subset of single people will install the app and create profiles. Swipe Party could allow those who aren&#8217;t Tinder users to try the app, as well. And they wouldn&#8217;t have to be single to do so.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What happens to both NFT activity and NFT prices when their backing asset, if we can call ether that, rapidly loses value?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Major cryptocurrencies are currently enduring price declines from already depressed levels. It&#8217;s a selloff, though likely not one large enough to shake the confidence of the crypto faithful. Still, the impact of falling crypto prices on assets priced in crypto should prove interesting.</p>
<p>The NFT market, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchains-vie-for-nft-market-but-ethereum-still-dominates-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely built on the Ethereum blockchain</a>, has seen a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/making-sense-of-opensea-at-a-13b-valuation/">rapid ascent in value and trading volumes</a> as the value of ether, the native token of its chain, appreciated massively. What will happen to NFTs in a market in which ether is falling? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>How much of a selloff?</h2>
<p>In the last week, bitcoin has fallen by 8.6%, ether by 7.8% and Solana&#8217;s token by just around 12%, <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per CoinMarketCap data</a>. Those are sharp declines, even for the more volatile crypto market. From recent highs, the declines are even steeper. From all-time highs set during Q4 2021, bitcoin is off by around 35%, ether 28% and Solana&#8217;s token about 40%.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-ether-prices-fall-along-with-tech-stocks-11641471483?reflink=e2twmkts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal has a pretty succinct explanation</a> today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin and ether slumped as part of the broader tech selloff, cementing their status among investors as risky assets quickly dumped in moments of market stress.</p>
<p>The falls were triggered by Federal Reserve minutes that showed officials are eyeing a faster timetable for raising interest rates this year. As rates rise, holding volatile investments that produce little income becomes less attractive compared with government bonds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply: As rates rise, less risky assets are more attractive in yield terms; this makes riskier assets less attractive and therefore worth less. Declines <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/software-stocks-get-punched-in-the-face-again/">in the value of high-growth software stocks</a> <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">are likely driven by similar dynamics in the crypto market. Bitcoin is not an uncorrelated asset, it seems clear at this point.</span></p>
<p>But what does all of that mean for NFTs? A few things.</p>
<h2>Prices, trading and correlations</h2>
<p>The boom in NFT value and trading activity does not have a single driving factor. Instead, myriad inputs have been at play, from celebrity involvement to improving technology, better public awareness and more.</p>
<p>Also involved, I would argue, has been the sharp appreciation of ether in the last year or so. In mid-2020, Ethereum&#8217;s token could be purchased for less than $250 each. The value of ether tripled by the end of the year and reached the $4,700 mark last year. That enormous appreciation led to the creation of a simply massive amount of paper &#8212; token? &#8212; wealth. In short, folks holding ether enjoyed huge returns, very quickly.</p>
<p>More than anything else, the wealth created from the appreciation of ether led to the NFT boom, from my perspective. After all, I don&#8217;t think that folks have been transferring millions of dollars <em>into</em> ether to buy digital signatures on the blockchain that relate to particular images; instead, I think we&#8217;re seeing ether-rich folks gamble with what must feel like house money on non-traditional assets. Not that that is a bad thing; it&#8217;s neutral, I reckon. But it does raise the question of what happens to both NFT activity and NFT prices when their backing asset, if we can call ether that, rapidly loses value.</p>
