										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gardin.co.uk/">Gardin</a>, a ‘deep tech’ hardware and software startup developing optical phenotyping technology and analytics to optimise food production, has raised $1.2 million in pre-seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is LDV Capital, with participation from Seedcamp, and MMC Ventures. A number of angel investors are also investing, including Pratima Aiyagari, Gilad Engel, and Abdulaziz Alrashed.</p>
<p>Founded in late 2019, Gardin’s mission, in the U.K. company’s own words, is to help everyone access high quality, nutritious food that is “good for you and for our planet”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Specifically, the startup is developing tech for farms based on its own “optical phenotyping” hardware and accompanying analytics software. The idea is to enable food producers to measure and monitor the nutritional value of food, from “seed to plate in a real world environment,” rather than a lab.</p>
<p>“With deployment of Gardin’s OS, insight from our analytics will be delivered to help food producers optimise production, grow nutritious food, lower carbon footprint and reduce waste,” says founder and CEO Sumanta Talukdar. “At Gardin, we want to empower food producers to feed the world consciously, sustainably and nutritionally, as it should be”.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7W9VyKIaee"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/infarm-raises-170m-in-equity-and-debt/">Infarm raises $170M in equity and debt to continue building its &#8216;vertical farming&#8217; network</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Infarm raises $170M in equity and debt to continue building its &#8216;vertical farming&#8217; network&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/infarm-raises-170m-in-equity-and-debt/embed/#?secret=7W9VyKIaee" data-secret="7W9VyKIaee" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Talukdar says he started the company after learning that the traditional food industry currently “does not, or cannot, quantifiably measure food nutrition and quality”. This has seen Gardin partner with some of the leading crop and plant physiologists, phenotyping experts and plant scientists to identify the key biochemical mechanisms in various crops related to plant physiology.</p>
<p>“By designing hardware to specifically measure the signatures of these mechanisms, Gardin is able to quantify plant physiology and key compounds density with high fidelity (i.e. signal/noise ratio) at a cost similar to consumer electronics goods,” he explained. To achieve this, Gardin is employing a multispectral data fusion approach, using a suite of remote sensing and computer vision techniques to capture very specific data which is then “fused” to drive the analytics.</p>
<p>To that end, Gardin has been designed to assist both traditional and CEA (controlled environment agriculture), with the ambitious aim to become the new “food production gold standard”.</p>
<p>“Our full stack product is designed to run and optimise the entire growing environment running silently in the background like an OS i.e we are solving their problems, helping food producers grow higher quality food and reducing their operating costs and carbon footprint,” adds Talukdar.</p>
<p>“We have also designed our platform so we can integrate with their existing architectures. To us, asking a producer in what is already an asset heavy industry to change or add to their system to make us fit, was folly”.</p>
<p>In terms of traction, Talukdar says Gardin has already secured pilot trials that are ready to go live early this year with “key go-to-market clients. They include supermarket chains, food producers and vertical farms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.mooncard.co">Mooncard</a> is partnering with Flying Blue to offer Air France miles to its customers. This is the first time you can earn miles with a payment card in France that isn’t an American Express card.</p>
<p>Mooncard provides corporate payment cards to streamline your expenses. Most companies in France don’t use corporate cards. But fintech startups have created corporate cards that can help you streamline expenses.</p>
<p>In addition to Visa cards, Mooncard lets you easily take a photo of your receipts, add details and submit expenses to your accounting team. You can set up different limits and validation processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today’s news is interesting as American Express has been in a monopolistic position for decades with its partnership with Flying Blue. In France, companies had to choose American Express if they wanted miles as perks.</p>
<p>When it comes to pricing, it looks pretty similar to what American Express offers:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png" alt="" width="1024" height="597" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2100832" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png 2472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=1536,895 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=2048,1193 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There’s one big difference —&nbsp;Mooncard relies on the Visa network. As many restaurants and shops don’t support American Express, it could be enough to lure customers away from American Express. Employees can use their miles for personal trips.</p>
<p>There are 3,000 companies using Mooncard as well as many public institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joanne Chen just became the second general partner in the history of the now 26-year-old, Silicon Valley venture firm, Foundation Capital.</p>
<p>Were she still alive, Foundation&#8217;s founder, Kathryn Gould, would undoubtedly cheer the development.</p>
<p>Known for her big personality, Gould first met Chen when Chen was an MBA student at the University of Chicago. Gould was recovering from a bout with cancer at the time, and after being introduced to Chen through one of <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/steven-neil-kaplan">Chen&#8217;s professors</a>, she initially advised Chen not to go into venture. As Gould herself discovered early on, doors open more easily to men in the venture world, which is why she&#8217;d <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2015/02/23/kingmaker-background-kathryn-gould/">started her own firm in the first place</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yet, like Gould, being dissuaded only motivated Chen more. While she began her career as an engineer at Cisco, she was long interested in finance, jumping into a banking analyst role with Jeffries, then working as an associate with the capital advisory firm Probitas before cofounding a mobile gaming company she would later wind down.</p>
<p>Indeed, grad school in Chicago &#8212; and meeting Gould &#8212; only reinforced for Chen how much she wanted to become a VC, and following stints at Formation 8 and Hyde Park Angels, she landed at Foundation in 2014. (Sadly, Gould passed away in 2015.)</p>
<p>Chen has certainly brought a fresh perspective to a firm that features 10 investors altogether, the rest men.</p>
<p>Aside from being the only woman in the group, Chen has a strong point of view, for example, on the entrepreneurial potential of students from U.C. Berkeley, where she studied as an undergraduate. While the university is not nearly so organized as Stanford when it comes to minting founders, in her view it has just as much talent and, as a result, it&#8217;s a network into which she invests a lot of time and energy as an investor.</p>
<p>Chen, who was born in China and great up in Montreal, also spends a lot of time thinking about AI, both as an investor and also simply a person in the world. Her father, who received his PhD from the University of Montreal, went on to work at Bell Labs as a researcher, and her mother is a computer programmer and &#8220;DevOps person&#8221; who Chen routinely talks with about software tools. But their background isn&#8217;t so simple.</p>
<p>Like many immigrants, her parents fled China during the Cultural Revolution. Because her grandfather helped architect a major telecom company in China, he was persecuted by the Communist Party, stripped of all his responsibilities and titles and, as an &#8220;intellectual,&#8221; says Chen, thrown in jail. Meanwhile, his son (her father) wasn&#8217;t allowed to start college until he was 21, and it was only because he was a good student that was he invited abroad to obtain his master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p>Today, her family&#8217;s experience combined with China&#8217;s use of artificial intelligence &#8212; including to track its Muslim minority &#8212; is top of mind for Chen in ways it may not be for someone with a lesser grasp of the lengths to which authoritarian regimes will go, and how quickly they can act.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why most of Chen&#8217;s work centers on understanding how AI, from how machines evolve from organizing activity to replacing humans (which will definitely happen, says Chen); to how to recognize and counter malicious applications of AI with AI (such as through recruiting software that screens out names and gender to eliminate human bias); and how to otherwise make sure that AI is used to improve human life, she suggests.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen isn&#8217;t exactly alone in her interest in AI. Nearly every startup today incorporates &#8212; or says it does &#8212; AI into its offerings, from lending companies to startups that help remote teams work more effectively. And investors, including at Foundation, have funded many of them.</p>
<p>Asked how she deals with competition for many of these deals, Chen says she moves as fast when there&#8217;s a decision to be made. She engages with VPs of engineering and technical founders who share ideas through Slack communities and elsewhere. She also notes that Foundation provides capital to roughly 30 operators who write angel checks and help steer the firm&#8217;s attention to interesting deals.</p>
<p>Mostly, suggests Chen, she focuses on whatever is not landing in her inbox &#8212; a lesson learned in part from Gould years ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to believe. As Gould <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2015/02/23/kingmaker-background-kathryn-gould/">once told this editor</a> of the advice she gives to other VCs: &#8220;It not the calls you take. It’s the calls you make. Everyone is calling you with dumb startup ideas, and you can stay hugely busy sorting through that crap. My advice instead is to figure out who are the 10 to 20 smartest people you know and call them. One of them is always starting a company.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a> is expanding its focus by creating a second startup studio called <a href="https://www.efounders.com/logicfounders">Logic Founders</a>. This time, Logic Founders is going to focus on fintech startups exclusively. Camille Tyan (pictured above) is going to lead the new studio.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, eFounders has launched dozens of software-as-a-service companies trying to improve the way we work. Portfolio companies include <a href="https://frontapp.com">Front</a>, <a href="https://aircall.io">Aircall</a> and <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a>.</p>
<p>Camille Tyan previously co-founded PayPlug, a payments company that was acquired by Natixis (Groupe BPCE). He plans to follow the eFounders model centered around a new vertical. Logic Founders will come up with ideas for new startups. It’ll recruit two co-founders and start working on the product for the first 12 to 18 months of the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ideally, the startup finds product-market fit and raises a seed round after this initial phase. The startup studio keeps a stake in the startup but it moves on so that it can focus on new projects.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following eFounders closely, the startup studio has already worked on several fintech companies, such as Spendesk, <a href="https://upflow.io">Upflow</a>, <a href="https://multis.co">Multis</a> and <a href="https://www.swan.io">Swan</a>. New fintech projects will likely fall under the Logic Founders umbrella.</p>
<p>The studio says it will launch API-first financial products. It is riding the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/embedded-finance-might-represent-fintechs-future/">embedded finance</a> trend — many believe financial products will be distributed by platforms that aren’t primarily focused on finance but could benefit from fintech features. You can expect companies working on payments orchestration, asset securitization, lending APIs, crypto and B2B identity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese internet giant ByteDance has told employees in India that it is reducing the size of its team in the country after New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/india-retains-ban-on-tiktok-uc-browser-and-57-other-chinese-apps/">retained ban on TikTok</a> and other Chinese apps last week, said a source familiar with the matter and an internal memo obtained by TechCrunch. After the publication of this story, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed the layoff.</p>
<p>The company, which employs more than 2,000 people in India, shared the news with employees in the country at 10am local time and said only critical jobs will be retained in the country, said the source. ByteDance said it was left with no choice after the Indian government, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned its marquee app late June</a> last year, had offered no clear direction on when TikTok could make return in the nation, the source said on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is deeply regretful that after supporting our 2000+ employees in India for more than half a year, we have no choice but to scale back the size of our workforce. We look forward to receiving the opportunity to relaunch TikTok and support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers in India,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to the ban, India was the biggest international market for TikTok, which had amassed over 200 million monthly active users in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. India blocked over 200 apps with links to China last year amid geopolitical tension between the two nations. New Delhi has said that these apps engaged in activities that posed threats to “national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, New Delhi told ByteDance and dozens of other Chinese firms that it maintains the concerns it had originally charged against them and would retain the ban.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Vanessa Pappas and VP of Global Business Blake Chandlee shared more context about the move in a memo to India employees today. &#8220;We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived, and that we would be able to resolve this quickly. Seven months later, we find that has not been the case. Many of you have patiently waited to hear how this would play out, which has been very stressful. Thank you for your continued belief and trust in us,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you can imagine, a decision of this magnitude is not easy. For the last several months, our management team has worked tirelessly to avoid having to separate anyone from the company. We&#8217;ve cut expenses, while still paying benefits. However, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational. We are fully aware of the impact that this decision has for all of our employees in India, and we empathize with our team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s move caps some of the strangest and confusing months for ByteDance employees in India. Following the ban, the employees were told to focus on developing a range of other apps from the Chinese giant such as the productivity suite Lark that had not been blocked in India.</p>

<p>But they were asked to not talk about these apps in the public to avoid putting risk of other ByteDance properties also getting the limelight. The source said ByteDance also stopped all marketing efforts in India to promote its other services in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we don&#8217;t know when we will make a comeback in India, we are confident in our resilience, and desire to do so in times to come,&#8221; Pappas and Chandlee wrote in the memo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Twitter seems to buy its way into competing with Clubhouse and Substack, one wonders whether the beleaguered social media company is finally ready to move past its truly awful track record of seizing opportunities.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s pace of product ambition has certainly seemed to speed in the past several months, conveniently following shareholder action <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/activist-investors-want-to-crank-up-the-twitter-revenue-machine/">to oust CEO Jack Dorsey last year. </a>They&#8217;ve finally rolled out their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">Stories product Fleets</a>, they&#8217;ve embraced audio both in the traditional feed and with their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">beta Spaces feature,</a> and they&#8217;ve taken some much-publicized steps to reign in disinformation and content moderation woes (though there&#8217;s still plenty to be done there).</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, Twitter has also made some particularly interesting acquisitions. Today, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">announced that they were buying Revue</a>, a newsletter management startup. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">they bought Breaker</a>, a podcasting service. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-acquires-screen-sharing-social-app-squad/">they bought Squad</a>, a social screen-sharing app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter acquires newsletter platform Revue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/embed/#?secret=zQziU969zS" data-secret="zQziU969zS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an aggressive turn that follows Twitter&#8217;s announcement that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/">will be shutting down Periscope</a>, a live video app that was purchased and long-neglected by Twitter despite the fact that the company&#8217;s current product chief was its founder.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s wild 2020 success in fully realizing the broader vision for Vine, which Twitter shut down in 2017, seems to be a particularly embarrassing stain on the company&#8217;s history; it&#8217;s also the most crystallized example of Twitter shooting itself in the foot as a result of not embracing risk. And while Twitter was ahead of that curve and simply didn&#8217;t make it happen, Substack and Clubhouse are two prime examples of competitors which Twitter could have prevented from reaching their current stature if it had just been more aggressive in recognizing adjacent social market opportunities and sprung into action.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s particularly hard to reckon in the shadow of Facebook&#8217;s ever-swelling isolation. Once the eager enemy of any social upstart, Facebook finds itself desperately complicated by global politics and antitrust woes in a way that may never strike it down, but have seemed to slow its maneuverability. A startup like Clubhouse may once seemed like a prime acquisition target, but it&#8217;s too complicated of a purchase for Facebook to even attempt in 2021, leaving Twitter a potential competitor that could scale to full size on its own.</p>
<p>Twitter is a much smaller company than Facebook is, though it&#8217;s still plenty big. As the company aims to move beyond the 2020 US election that ate up so much of its attention and expand its ambitions, one of its most pertinent challenges will be reinvigorating a product culture to recognize opportunities and take on rising competitors &#8212; though another challenge might be getting its competition to take it seriously in the first place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sila Nanotechnologies, a Silicon Valley battery materials company, has spent years developing technology designed to pack more energy into a cell at a lower cost — an end game that has helped it lock in partnerships with Amperex Technology Limited as well as automakers BMW and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/sila-nanos-battery-tech-is-now-worth-over-1-billion-with-daimler-partnership-and-150-million-investment/">Daimler</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Sila Nano, flush with a fresh injection of capital that has pushed its valuation to $3.3 billion, is ready to bring its technology to the masses.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded nearly a decade ago, said Tuesday it has raised $590 million in a Series F funding round led by Coatue with significant participation by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. Existing investors 8VC, Bessemer Venture Partners, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Sutter Hill Ventures also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sila Nano plans to use the funds to hire another 100 people this year and begin to buildout a factory in North America capable of producing 100 gigawatt-hours of silicon-based anode material, which is used in batteries for the smartphone and automotive industries. While the company hasn&#8217;t revealed the location of the factory, it does have a timeline. Sila Nano said it plans to start production at the factory in 2024. Materials produced at the plant will be in electric vehicles by 2025, the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took eight years and 35,000 iterations to create a new battery chemistry, but that was just step one,&#8221; Sila Nano CEO and co-founder Gene Berdichevsky said in a statement. &#8220;For any new technology to make an impact in the real-world, it has to scale, which will cost billions of dollars. We know from our experience building our production lines in Alameda that investing in our next plant today will keep us on track to be powering cars and hundreds of millions of consumer devices by 2025.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>The tech</strong></h2>
<p>A lithium-ion battery contains two electrodes. There’s an anode (negative) on one side and a cathode (positive) on the other. Typically, an electrolyte sits in the middle and acts as the courier, moving ions between the electrodes when charging and discharging. Graphite is commonly used as the anode in commercial lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>Sila Nano has developed a silicon-based anode that replaces graphite in lithium-ion batteries. The critical detail is that the material was designed to take the place of graphite in without needing to change the battery manufacturing process or equipment.</p>
<p>Sila Nano has been focused on silicon anode because the material can store a lot more lithium ions. Using a material that lets you pack in more lithium ions would theoretically allow you to increase the energy density — or the amount of energy that can be stored in a battery per its volume — of the cell. The upshot would be a cheaper battery <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">that contains more energy in the same space.</span></p>
<h2>The opportunity</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a compelling product for automakers attempting to bring more electric vehicles to market. Nearly every global automaker has announced plans or is already producing a new batch of all-electric and plug-in electric vehicles, including Ford, GM, Daimler, BMW, Hyundai and Kia. Tesla continues to ramp up production of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles as a string of newcomers like Rivian prepare to bring their own EVs to market.</p>
<p>In short: the demand of batteries is climbing; and automakers are looking for the next-generation tech that will give them a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Battery production sat at about 20 GWh per year in 2010. Sila Nano expects it to jump to 2,000 GWh per year by 2030 and 30,000 GWh per year by 2050.</p>
<p>Sila Nano started building the first production lines for its battery materials in 2018. That first line is capable of producing the material to supply the equivalent of 50 megawatts of lithium-ion batteries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Apple reports its earnings on Wednesday, you can expect mentions of India on the call.</p>
<p>Apple shipped more than 1.5 million iPhone units in India in the quarter that ended in December, up 100% year-on-year, making this its best quarter in the world’s largest smartphone market to date, according to research firms Counterpoint and CyberMedia.</p>
<p>Thanks to the improved sales of older generation iPhone 11, iPhone XR, iPhone 12 and the newer iPhone SE, Apple doubled its market share in India to 4% in the quarter, the research firms said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overall, Apple shipped more than 3.2 million iPhone units in India in 2020, up 60% year-on-year, Counterpoint said.</p>
<p>The shipment growth comes months after Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/apple-launches-its-online-store-in-india/">launched its online store in the country</a> and offered customers a wide-range of financing and upgrade options, AppleCare+, and lucrative perks such as a free set of AirPods with the purchase of iPhone 11. The company plans to open its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/apple-to-begin-online-sales-in-india-this-year-open-first-retail-store-in-2021/"> first physical retail store in the country later this year</a>.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, Apple has struggled to sell its handsets in India because of the expensive price tags they carry. Most smartphones that ship in India are priced between $100 to $200. Samsung, and a group of Chinese smartphone vendors including Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/smartphone-shipments-rebound-to-hit-an-all-time-high-in-india/">flooded the market in the past decade</a> with their affordable smartphones.</p>
<p>None the less, in recent years Apple has visibly grown more interested in the country that is also one of the world’s fastest growing smartphones markets. The company’s contract manufacturers today locally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/apple-begins-assembling-iphone-11-in-india/">assemble a range of iPhone models and some accessories</a> — an effort the company kickstarted more than two years ago. (A recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/19/apple-puts-contract-partner-wistron-on-probation-after-violence-at-india-plant/">violent event at an Indian facility of Wistron</a>, one of Apple&#8217;s contract manufacturers, however, underscored some of the challenges Apple will grapple with as it looks to scale its local production efforts in the country.)</p>
<p>That move has allowed Apple to lower prices of some older generation iPhone models in India, where for years the company has passed import duty charges to customers. The starting price of the iPhone 12 Pro Max is $1,781 in India, compared to $1,099 in the U.S. (Apple has yet to start locally assemble the iPhone 12 units.) The AirPods Pro, which sells at $249 in the U.S., was made available in India at $341 at the time of launch. AirPods Max, similarly, is priced at $815 in India, compared to $549 in the U.S. (It doesn&#8217;t help that an average person in India makes $2,000 a year.)</p>
<p>Unlike most foreign firms that offer their products and services for free in India or at some of the world’s cheapest prices, Apple has focused entirely on a small fraction of the population that can afford to pay big bucks, Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at Convergence Catalyst, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Apple has not made some changes to its price strategy for India. The monthly cost of Apple Music is $1.35 in India, compared to $9.99 in the U.S. Its Apple One bundle, which includes Apple Music, TV+, Arcade and iCloud, costs $2.65 a month in India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.classdojo.com/">ClassDojo</a>’s first eight years as an edtech consumer startup could look like failure: zero revenue; no paid users; and a team that hasn’t aggressively grown in years. But the company, which helps parents and teachers communicate about students, has raised tens of millions in venture capital from elite Silicon Valley investors including Y Combinator, GSV, SignalFire and General Catalyst over its life.</p>
<p>If you ask co-founder<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samchaudhary"> Sam Chaudhary</a> to explain how the startup survived so long without bringing in money, he responds simply: &#8220;When you have something that you think will be for the long term you can put [in] a lot of energy. So, we always kind of maintained the belief that like bringing people together and helping them be connected, especially last year when they needed to be apart, physically apart, was going to be really important.&#8221;</p>
<p>In layman’s terms: ClassDojo has been playing the long-game in edtech since 2011, quietly aggregating free users-turned-fans across the world’s public schools, which are notoriously hard to sell due to tight budgets. Every engineer on the team serves a population that is the size of the city of San Francisco. The company has been intentionally frugal throughout the process. Its core service, which is an interface that allows parents and teachers to communicate updates and stay involved in the classroom, is free for anyone to download.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our view from the start was actually that the idea of districts isn&#8217;t the customer of education, [that’s] kind of backwards,” he said. “It’s like Airbnb saying we’re going to transform travel by selling to hotels.” The route has helped ClassDojo gain traction with 51 million users across 180 countries.</p>
<p>Two years ago, ClassDojo tested this customer love. It launched its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/classdojo-an-app-to-help-teachers-and-parents-communicate-better-raises-35m/"> first monetization attempt in 2019</a>: Beyond School, a service that complements in-school learning with at-home tutorials. Within four months of launching the paid service, ClassDojo hit profitability. In 2020, the added dimension of COVID-19 helped ClassDojo triple its revenue and grow to have hundreds of thousands of paying subscribers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2100933" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DojoGrowth.gif" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lesson in how a venture-backed startup can successfully live for years without any plans to monetize, grow a super-fan user base, and eventually turn those users into paying customers if the fit is right.</p>
<p>The acceleration of ClassDojo’s business got noticed by Josh Buckley, the new CEO of Product Hunt and a solo capitalist.</p>
<p>“For years, they’ve quietly been building the most adored brand in the industry; kids, teachers and families they serve love it. Their business model follows that vision; they’re focused on serving the consumers, not the ‘system’” Buckley said.</p>
<p>Buckley led a new $30 million financing round for ClassDojo, he tells TechCrunch. The round also includes Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra, Coda CEO and former Youtube head of product and engineering Shishir Mehrotra, former product lead of growth for Airbnb Lenny Rachitsky, and others.</p>
<p>The financing comes nearly two years after ClassDojo<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/classdojo-an-app-to-help-teachers-and-parents-communicate-better-raises-35m/"> raised a $35 million Series C</a> round led by GSV. When new capital is less than the preceding round it usually signals a downround, but Chaudhary says that ClassDojo had a “significant markup on valuation” with the extension round. The trend of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/making-sense-of-3-edtech-extension-rounds/">opportunistic extension rounds</a> has grown for edtech startups recently as the pandemic underscores the need for remote learning innovation.</p>
<h2><strong>ClassDojo’s next act</strong></h2>
<p>With new financing and massive scale, ClassDojo is now trying to evolve from a communication app into a platform that can help students get better learning experiences beyond the one they get from schools.</p>
<p>Chaudhary says that they plan to double ClassDojo’s 55-person team, invest in product, and enter new markets.</p>
<p>“For me, I’d always thought ClassDojo could enable a better future, specifically one where kids&#8217; outcomes aren’t entirely determined by what their ZIP code can offer them,” Chaudhary said. “That’s the kind of future we’ve been building toward.” He likened ClassDojo’s goal as similar to Netflix: provide a broad scope of material for a broad scope of people, not just on-demand political dramas.</p>
<p>ClassDojo is already creating content around topics not discussed in school such as how to fail and how to become an empathetic person, as part of its<a href="https://ideas.classdojo.com/"> Big Idea series.</a> The Beyond School offering helps students set goals and track activities, as well as find activities such as dinner table discussion starters or bedtime meditations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100905" style="width: 1635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100905" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100905 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg" alt="" width="1625" height="1112" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg 1625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=768,526 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=1536,1051 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1625px) 100vw, 1625px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100905" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ClassDojo</p></div></p>
<p>ClassDojo charges $7.99 a month, or $59.99 annually, for its premium content. The platform is finding small ways to add personalization and spice to its content, such as customized avatars, but further innovation will be key in making its next phase work.</p>
<p>While ClassDojo certainly has a strong user engine to monetize off of, the content game is difficult to win at. Content, to an extent,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/booming-edtech-ma-activity-brings-consolidation-to-a-fragmented-sector/"> is commoditized.</a> If you can find a free tutorial on YouTube or Khan Academy, why buy a subscription to an edtech platform that offers the same solution? The commodification of education is good for end-users and is often why startups have a freemium model as a customer acquisition strategy. To convert free users into paying subscribers, edtech startups need to offer differentiated and targeted content.</p>

<p>The United States continues to be a dominant market for ClassDojo, which also has users in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and more. While some in edtech express concern that United States consistently lags in consumer spending in education, Chaudhary thinks it’s an unfair assessment.</p>
<p>“To believe that, you have to believe that families don&#8217;t care all that much about their kids. And I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true,” he said. “All the ways that American people express their care for children, there’s such a range, from extracurricular to sports camp to moving to the right zip code.”</p>
<p>And with that mindset, ClassDojo thinks that it can become the brand that families turn to when they think about a child’s education.</p>
<p>“I think there’s just like a missing brand in the world right now,” Chaudhary said. “There’s a blank, a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.”</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">June 4, 2019 should have been one of the happiest days of my life.</p>
<p>At 11:30 a.m., a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190604005577/en/Imperva-to-Acquire-Distil-Networks-the-Industry-Recognized-Leader-in-Bot-Management">press release</a> hit the wire announcing that the cybersecurity company I had spent more than eight years building was being acquired by a larger cybersecurity player.</p>
<p>What’s not to love about a successful exit? I’d be set financially, the investors who had given us $70 million would make money, and the technology we created would get new legs in an organization with broader reach and resources.</p>
<p>Still, I had regrets. For one thing, I initially hadn’t wanted to sell. (More on that later.) For another, I was nagged by the feeling that our company had fallen short of its true potential, and that the reason was me &#8212; specifically, several rookie mistakes I made as a first-time entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I don’t stew about those errors any longer. In fact, I believe my miscues at my first startup will help define my career from here on out. That’s why, as I grow my next company, I’m thinking about not only the things I want to do but those I’d never do again.</p>
<p>Here are five of them.</p>
<h2>Trying to do too much myself</h2>
<p>In management theory terms, I was a “pacesetter.” I’d be the first to jump into any project or task, I’d execute it as quickly as possible and I expected everyone else to keep up. I thought that was how a startup leader acted — super helpful and scrappy.</p>
<p>But it came at a big price: disempowerment of the team. I was hoarding not only control — nobody felt like they personally owned anything &#8212; but also the institutional knowledge that needs to be spread around as a company grows. I became a human GPS: People could follow my directions, but they struggled to find the way themselves. Independent thinking suffered.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I became a human GPS: People could follow my directions, but they struggled to find the way themselves. Independent thinking suffered.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>After a few years, I had a frustrating sense that I had all the answers and no one else did. Well, no wonder.</p>
<p>I’m now leaving the pacesetting to NASCAR and marathons.</p>
<h2>Thinking people can read my mind</h2>
<p>I believed all I had to do was say something once and everyone would get it. I became irritated when that didn’t happen. “We talked about this three months ago,” I’d bark. Intimidated team members would say to themselves, “Yeah, but we really only got 50% of it.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.smoredate.com">S&#8217;More</a>, a dating app that&#8217;s focused on helping users find more meaningful relationships, announced today that it has raised $2.1 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>S&#8217;More (short for &#8220;something more&#8221;) ensures that users can&#8217;t focus on physical appearance, because photos are  initally blurred — they gradually un-blur as you interact with someone. The startup has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/dating-app-smore-adds-blurred-video-chat-and-launches-in-la/">introduced new features like video chat</a> (also blurred initially), and it launched a redesigned app of the beginning of this month — CEO Adam Cohen-Aslatei said it&#8217;s a &#8220;completely rebuilt product&#8221; with new features like real-time conversation prompts and the ability to pay to promote your profile.</p>
<p>Cohen-Aslatei also said that S&#8217;More&#8217;s focus on &#8220;anti-superficial relationships&#8221; is attracting a real audience, with 160,000 downloads in its first year and &#8220;thousands&#8221; of paying users, including a 50% increase in subscriptions after launching the new app in January.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Looking at how dating will evolve after the pandemic, Cohen-Aslatei suggested, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going back to the way things were.&#8221; He pointed to a<a href="https://www.smoredate.com/q4-smore-survey-2020"> recent survey of S&#8217;More users</a> in which 80% of respondents said they hadn&#8217;t gone on a single live, in-person date in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to meet for casual encounter on Tinder, or do you have to want to have a conversation get to know a real person on S&#8217;More?&#8221; he said. Assuming that many people will choose the latter, the next question is: &#8220;How do you make discovery fun? There&#8217;s got to be multimedia, video, audio, games, all of those features are part of our product roadmap &#8230; S&#8217;More will feel like Hinge meets Nextdoor.&#8221; (Apparently, there&#8217;s &#8220;a huge cohort&#8221; of users on Nextdoor who are single and looking for relationships.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100976" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100976" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100976" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SMoreApp-Full-Screen-1-1.jpg?w=680" alt="S'More" width="680" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SMoreApp-Full-Screen-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SMoreApp-Full-Screen-1-1.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SMoreApp-Full-Screen-1-1.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SMoreApp-Full-Screen-1-1.jpg?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SMoreApp-Full-Screen-1-1.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SMoreApp-Full-Screen-1-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100976" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> S&#8217;More</p></div></p>
<p>The new funding comes from a long list of investors: Benson Oak Ventures, Mark Pincus&#8217; Workplay Ventures, Gaingels VC, Loud Capital/Pride Fund<br />
SideCar Angels, AppLovin Chairman Rafael Vivas, Joshua Black of Apollo Management, Plus Grade CEO Ken Harris, Harvard geneticist George Church, former Meet Group CEO John Abbott, former IMAX CEO Brad Weschler, Aaron and Sharon Stern, Justen Stepka/Enterprise Fund, Boston Harbor Angels, Grit Daily CEO Jordan French, Kind.Fund founder Marty Isaac, Craig Mullett and Dating Group.</p>
<p>Cohen-Asletai told me the funding has already allowed him to hire what he&#8217;s calling a &#8220;founding team,&#8221; including chief architect Long Nguyen, head of operations Sneha Ramanchandran, head of product and design Regina Guinto and senior developer David Lichy.</p>
<p>S&#8217;More is also announcing that it has signed a production deal with producers Elvia Van Es Oliva and Jack Tarantino, who have worked on shows like &#8220;90 Day Fiancé.&#8221; Cohen-Asletai said the startup will work with them to create &#8220;anti-superficial&#8221; dating content for digital platforms and TV networks.</p>
<p>This deal builds on the success of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smoredate/?hl=en">S&#8217;More Live,</a> the startup&#8217;s celebrity dating show on Instagram Live, which has aired 60 episodes so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re using that show to build our brand, to gain awareness and then &#8230; we&#8217;re actually able to leverage all of the viewers and retarget them with content from S&#8217;More, which has made our cost to acquire a user [very affordable],&#8221; Cohen-Asletai said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has released iOS 14.4 with security fixes for three vulnerabilities, said to be under active attack by hackers.</p>
<p>The technology giant said in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146">its security update pages for iOS and iPadOS 14.4</a> that the three bugs affecting iPhones and iPads &#8220;may have been actively exploited.&#8221; Details of the vulnerabilities are scarce, and an Apple spokesperson declined to comment beyond what&#8217;s in the advisory.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known who is actively exploiting the vulnerabilities, or who might have fallen victim. Apple did not say if the attack was targeted against a small subset of users or if it was a wider attack. Apple granted anonymity to the individual who submitted the bug, the advisory said.</p>
<p>Two of the bugs were found in WebKit, the browser engine that powers the Safari browser, and the Kernel, the core of the operating system. Some successful exploits use sets of vulnerabilities chained together, rather than a single flaw. It&#8217;s not uncommon for attackers to first target vulnerabilities in a device&#8217;s browsers as a way to get access to the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>Apple said additional details would be available soon, but did not say when.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rare admission by Apple, which prides itself on its security image, that its customers might be under active attack by hackers.</p>
<p>In 2019, Google security researchers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/google-iphone-secretly-hacked/">found a number of malicious websites</a> laced with code that quietly hacked into victims&#8217; iPhones. TechCrunch revealed that the attack was part of an operation, likely by the Chinese government, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/31/china-google-iphone-uyghur/">spy on Uyghur Muslims</a>. In response, Apple disputed some of Google&#8217;s findings in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/apple-doesnt-want-google-stoking-fear-about-serious-ios-security-exploits/">an equally rare public statement</a>, for which Apple faced more criticism for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/apple-doesnt-want-google-stoking-fear-about-serious-ios-security-exploits/">underplaying the severity</a> of the attack.</p>
<p>Last month, internet watchdog Citizen Lab found dozens of journalists had their iPhones hacked with a previously unknown vulnerability <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/citizen-lab-iphone-nso-group/">to install spyware</a> developed by Israel-based NSO Group.</p>
<p>In the absence of details, iPhone and iPad users should update to iOS 14.4 as soon as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tapbots, the company behind Tweetbot, has released a major update for the iPhone and iPad. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834">Tweetbot 6</a> is now available in the App store. While there aren’t a lot of visual changes, there are a couple of important things happening under the hood.</p>
<p>First, Tweetbot 6 is using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/">Twitter’s API v2</a>. An API is an interface that lets two applications or services interact with each other. In today’s case, Tweetbot uses Twitter’s API to interact with the service.</p>
<p>And third-party developers can only do what Twitter lets them do. For many years, Twitter’s API has been somewhat limited, especially if you’ve been trying to build a full-fledged Twitter client. But API v2 surfaces some missing features.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, Tweetbot 6 can now display polls. Before that, polls simply didn’t appear in the timeline. Similarly, Tweetbot 6 displays preview cards, which let you preview linked content without having to click on them. Some features are still missing, such as stories.</p>
<p>There are some minor changes with Tweetbot 6, such as new interface themes, a new feature that lets you select Chrome or Firefox as browser options for links and some tweaks in the app design.</p>
<p>The business model is changing as well. Instead of paying to download the app, you can now download a free app with many restrictions — for instance, you can’t tweet. When you’re ready, you can subscribe to unlock all features for $0.99 per month or $5.99 per year.</p>
<p>This change should ensure the future of the app. Tapbots says Tweetbot 6 is currently in early access. The company plans to add more features down the road.</p>
<p>And if you’re using Tweetbot 5 right now, the app is still working fine. You can re-download the app from the ‘Purchased’ section in the App Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sony is making a play for the top end of the professional digital camera world, where videographers and sports photographers demand immaculate image quality at high resolutions in short order. The new Alpha 1 beats pretty much everything on the market on paper, but it&#8217;ll set you back a cool $6,500.</p>
<p>This is, of course, well above the price range for ordinary consumers and even spendy enthusiasts and &#8220;prosumers.&#8221; It&#8217;s a professional tool, and in this range Canon has historically been the go-to with its 1D series, and more recently its R5, a full-frame mirrorless that leapfrogged the competition <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/buying-guide-best-cameras-over-2500">to great acclaim last year</a>. But Sony clearly means to leapfrog the R5 in turn.</p>
<p>The Canon R5 ticked all the right boxes: full frame sensor, 45 megapixels at 20 frames per second, an excellent EVF, in-body image stabilization, and 8K video. Sony ticks them all too&#8230; but harder.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2100898" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100898" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100898" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg" alt="Rear view of the Sony Alpha 1 camera showing its screen and viewfinder." width="1024" height="643" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=1536,964 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=2048,1285 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2100898" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>The Alpha 1 will send down its 50 megapixel stills at 30 frames per second and with no viewfinder blackout (plus the backside-illuminated sensor will be more sensitive); its EVF has nearly twice the pixels and can refresh twice as fast, 240 fps; its 8K video is born at a higher resolution (the Sony uses the full 8.6K and downrezzes); it&#8217;ll shoot for half an hour without overheating (an R5 quirk); and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Sony seems to have deliberately outdone Canon&#8217;s flagship in every way possible, though with no consideration for cost: the R5 goes for about $3800, while the A1 is $6500.</p>
<p>Yet photographers are no strangers to spending that kind of cash on a tool of the trade (a lens can run you as much or more). Anyone who shoots sports or nature knows that 30 fps instead of 20 fps may mean the difference between getting a cover shot and nothing at all. Visual effects artists who work closely with footage peep pixels all day will be able to tell an R5 8K from an A1 8K. Will it matter? Maybe, maybe not. Would you take the risk or pay extra to eliminate it?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100900" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100900" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg" alt="Top view of the Sony Alpha 1 camera showing its controls." width="1024" height="631" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=680,419 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=1536,946 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=2048,1262 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2100900" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>If it&#8217;s merely a question of money to get <em>the best</em> instead of <em>almost the best</em>, there are a lot of people out there who will write that check without a second thought. Of course, the R5 was released half a year ago and its successor (the &#8220;Mark II&#8221;) may change that calculus again.</p>
<p>To be clear, the R5 and A1 are both far more camera than most people will ever need. They&#8217;re the bleeding edge of the industry — an industry that has been shrinking steadily for years. Battling fiercely now over professionals may have long-lasting effects as bit players get edged out, unable to compete. It&#8217;s an investment in the markets that they think will last despite the constant creeping encroachment of smartphones.</p>
<p>More importantly for the rest of us, competition like this in the camera industry is good because it produces advances that trickle down to the models we can actually afford. Not that anyone really needs 8K, but that improved sensor readout and EVF sure would be nice to have.</p>

Among several improvements, we&#8217;re thrilled to ramp up the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/what-vcs-want-in-a-pitch-deck/">Pitch Deck Teardown</a>.</p>
<p>In short, folks can <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit their pitch decks</a> to get feedback from investors and founders alike.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The importance of the pitch deck can&#8217;t be underestimated. It is often the first point of contact between a company and venture investors, but how investors consume a pitch deck (and what they <em>really</em> think) is also a bit of a black box.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Are they speed-flipping through the slides or taking their time? Do they prefer more information on the team or context on the industry? More numbers or more words? How many slides is the right number of slides?</p>
<p>There are too many questions to count, and often very few answers. But we’re popping the lid off of that black box with the Pitch Deck Teardown. We’ve done Pitch Deck Teardowns at events like Disrupt and Early Stage 2020, and this year we’re cranking it up a notch.</p>
<p>Anyone can submit their pitch deck and hear what our guests, tech leaders across the industry, think of them. (Important note: Extra Crunch members will be prioritized on the list of decks we choose to show during the episode.)</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">shared what you can expect from Extra Crunch Live in 2021</a>. Here’s a refresher:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Series A</b> – Learn how others have fundraised! We’ll have a segment dedicated to hearing from founder/investor duos who walk us through the Series A pitch deck that led to investment.</li>
<li><b>Pitch Deck Teardowns</b> – Folks will have the opportunity to submit their pitch deck and get feedback from our guests, which will include VCs and founders (<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">You can submit their pitch decks right here!</a>).</li>
<li><b>Live Pitch-offs</b> – Audience members can raise their hand to practice their elevator pitch in front of the audience and get real-time feedback from VCs.</li>
<li><b>Networking!!</b> – The Extra Crunch membership is a community. ECL will be an opportunity to meet your fellow audience members, even in a virtual environment. Who knows? Maybe you’ll meet your next co-founder or investor!</li>
<li><b>Consistency</b> – ECL will always be at <b>12pm PT/3pm ET on Wednesdays</b>. When it comes to your calendar, set it and forget it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll announce all the speakers joining us in February tomorrow! Stay tuned!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mealco.co">Mealco</a>, a startup promising to help chefs launch new restaurants designed around delivery, is announcing that it has raised $7 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not news to anyone reading this that opening a restaurant can be an expensive, risky proposition — and of course, many restaurants have gone out of business during the pandemic.</p>
<p>But founder and CEO Daniel Simon (who was previously a developer and product lead at Applicaster, and has also worked with Tel Aviv restaurant group R2M) said that even in the best of times, it can take $1 or $2 million to get started, and &#8220;if you want to hit the ground running, 98% of your focus is not on the food or the customers.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Mealco, on the other hand, there&#8217;s no need to sign a lease or any other upfront costs for the chefs, and they get to focus on actually creating the dishes and the menu. Mealco locally sources the ingredients, which are then cooked using the startup&#8217;s kitchen infrastructure and offered for delivery via the standard delivery apps — Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates and Seamless.</p>
<p>Simon said that with Mealco, the process of getting a new restaurant up and running only takes six to eight weeks: &#8220;We tell [the chefs] they don’t need to chop any more onions or tomatoes. There&#8217;s Mealco software that can tell employees at the Mealco kitchen how to prepare [each dish].&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100860" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100860" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100860" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?w=680" alt="Cayenne" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3588.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100860" class="wp-caption-text">Cayenne. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mealco</p></div></p>
<p>Mealco also provides support around branding, marketing and social media, and gives chefs access to a dashboard with real-time data about menu performance and customer feedback, which can allow them to quickly make adjustments as needed. The chef, he said, can &#8220;manage the restaurant from their mobile phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has already launched two restaurants delivering in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens — Mexican restaurant <a href="https://tributo.com">Tributo</a> and Nashville hot chicken restaurant <a href="https://eatcayenne.com">Cayenne</a> (the latter with chef Hillary Sterling). And it says there are 50 chefs on the waitlist.</p>
<p>Asked whether any of Mealco&#8217;s partners mind being separated from the food preparation and the dining experience, Simon said it depends on the chef.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to open a single location and be in the kitchen every morning,&#8221; then he said Mealco isn&#8217;t for you. &#8220;That not wrong or right, it&#8217;s a preference … But most chefs are creators, they&#8217;re artists. They express themselves through food.&#8221; And in his view, Mealco allows them to focus on that creativity.</p>
<p>Rucker Park Capital led the round with participation from FJLabs, Reshape, 2048.vc, Oceans Ventures, WLP and angel investors including former Seamless CEO Jonathan Zabusky. Simon said the plan is to launch throughout New York City and surrounding areas this year, before moving on to new cities next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had the opportunity to see the evolution of the food ecosystem firsthand in the past few years,&#8221; said Wes Tang-Wymer, general partner at Rucker Park Capital, in a statement. &#8220;The time is ripe to embrace all these advances to launch new brands in a new format. In Mealco, we found the most compelling model to push the frontier of restaurant innovation further by empowering chefs to take &#8216;idea-to-table&#8217; faster and cheaper than ever before.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/introducing-the-new-academic-research-product-track/148632">rolling out</a> a new product track on its API platform, as part of its ongoing efforts to <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/introducing_new_twitter_api.html">rebuild the Twitter API</a> from the ground up. The track, which aims to serve the needs of the academic research community&#8217;s efforts, offers broader access to the Twitter archive and fewer restrictions on tweet retrievals, so researchers can access the entire history of the public conversation on Twitter&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>In addition to gaining access to all the Twitter API v2 endpoints released to date and elevated access, researchers will gain access to more precise filtering capabilities.</p>
<p>Specifically, they&#8217;ll be able to access the full-archive search endpoint, which offers access to everything being said on Twitter. They can narrow searches for these historical tweets using start time and end time parameters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2100706" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100706" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100706" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg 2694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=768,449 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=1536,899 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1198 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-10.42.30-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100706" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Researchers will also gain a significantly higher monthly cap on the number of tweets they can pull using the Twitter API v2. While on the Basic level of API access, this cap is set to 500,000. The Basic level of access on the Academic Research track is an initial monthly cap of up to 10 million tweets. This applies to the Recent Search, Filtered Stream, Full-archive search, and user tweet and mentions timelines endpoints, Twitter says.</p>
<p>The Academic Research track will gain access to certain operators that aren&#8217;t otherwise available, too, with the goal of helping them pull more precise user data. Today, these include: <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$ (aka cashtag), bio, bio_name, bio_location, place, place_country, point_radius, bounding_box, -is:nullcast, has:cashtags and has:geo. </span></p>
<p>Researchers can also add 1,000 concurrent rules when using the filter stream endpoint, instead of the limit of 25 available in the Standard track. Queries in the recent search endpoint can be 1,024 characters long, compared with 512 characters in the Standard track.</p>
<p>Because of the elevated levels of access, those who want to gain access to the Academic Research product track have to first <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/use-case">submit an application</a>.</p>
<p>All applicants have to either be a master’s student, doctoral candidate, post-doc, faculty or research-focused employee at an academic institution or university. They will also <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research/application-info">need to have</a> a clearly defined research objective and must be able to detail their specific plans for how they intend to use, analyze and share Twitter data from their research.</p>
<p>Plus, the data used from the Academic Research product track can&#8217;t be used for any <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/commercial-terms">commercial</a> purposes, Twitter notes.</p>

<p>Academic researchers have been taking advantage of the Twitter API since its first introduction in 2006 and have used the data to study a variety of topics, Twitter says, like <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">​<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/disclosing-removed-networks-to-our-archive-of-state-linked-information.html">state-backed efforts to disrupt the public conversation</a>​, ​<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/success-stories/uc-davis-max-planck-institute">floods and climate change</a>, ​<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/success-stories/penn">attitudes and perceptions about COVID-19​</a> and​ ​<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/success-stories/hatelab">efforts to promote healthy conversation online</a>​.</span></p>
<p>However, the earlier version of the Twitter API didn&#8217;t make it easy for researchers to gain access to Twitter data &#8212; something the company wanted to correct with API v2.</p>
<p>Twitter to date has catered to the research community in other ways, with additions like a website dedicated to academic research, updates to its developer policy to make it easier to reproduce and validate others&#8217; research, and even special endpoints, like <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/covid19_public_conversation_data.html">the COVID-19 stream endpoint</a> released in April 2020. But it hasn&#8217;t fully thought through, until the API v2, how it could build tools that would actually aid researchers in doing their work, instead of the researchers having to figure out ways to work around Twitter&#8217;s limitations.</p>
<p>The Academic Research product track was tested in private beta starting in Oct. 2020, and now this is being opened more broadly, where it will be made freely available.</p>
<p>Twitter says it&#8217;s planning to add higher levels of access across all its product tracks in the future, including this one, in time. The later levels will help researchers who need even more data than what&#8217;s being offered with today&#8217;s launch. Twitter also noted it&#8217;s looking into adding flexible access as well, which would help account for times when developers were consuming more or less data throughout the year.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many stats to back up the underrepresentation of women </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">starting a company, raising money and general involvement in technology where the global tech workforce comprises 28.8% women</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a male-dominated space, programs geared toward supporting female entrepreneurs have emerged to close the gap on all fronts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for those centered around female founders, most are quick to offer mentorship and training but tend to ignore the importance of raising money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.firstcheck.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstCheck Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a female-focused angel fund that launched yesterday, is hoping to address this challenge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the fund, &#8220;fixing capital access for female tech entrepreneurs in Africa needs an intentional, female-led approach</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstCheck Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span> <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/elohogm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eloho Omame</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/odunayoeweniyi"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odunayo Eweniyi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omame is the MD of </span><a href="https://endeavornigeria.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nigeria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a program for high-impact entrepreneurs, and Eweniyi is the co-founder and COO of </span><a href="https://www.piggyvest.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piggyvest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian fintech startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omame&#8217;s experience working with founders and managing a VC firm (Amari Ventures) and Odunayo&#8217;s as a founder will prove vital to what FirstCheck Africa hopes to achieve: Making it easy for African women to raise capital and invest in tech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund will provide between $15,000 to $25,000 in six women this year in exchange for modest equity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstCheck Africa plans to see each woman or female-led team through the ideation stage to a significant pre-seed round within 12 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know we can generate solid long-term returns by investing in women, so we&#8217;ll write female founders&#8217; first checks and be their earliest believers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We&#8217;re not afraid to invest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ridiculously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early in great women,&#8221; an excerpt in the <a href="https://firstcheckhq.medium.com/announcing-firstcheck-africa-dbc72b1f7180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund also specifies that it is open to investing in mixed co-founder teams, with at least one woman. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the caveat is &#8220;only where it’s clear that the woman is a true partner and decision-maker, with a significant, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equitable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> split of the founder equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, FirstCheck has received over 600 applications from African female-led startups, Omame told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she iterates that while only six will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be selected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, FirstCheck is in no hurry to announce the deals when asked how soon the firm expects to write its first check</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’ve been transparent with our investment goal as we’re backing up to six women-led, technology-driven businesses this year,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Outside that, there’s little interest from Odun or me to rush to announce deals. The work we’re doing is important and necessary, but it will take time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you think about it, backing six startups in its first year is an impressive goal. For context, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction, an already established early-stage VC firm</a>, invested in seven startups last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> achieve that, FirstCheck will need to garner support from local and international investors that are intentional about closing the gender funding gap on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Without providing specifics around how much the fund is looking to raise, Omame says this is already happening</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, FirstCheck will be building a female-led investor community for women interested in backing startups by writing smaller checks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notion behind this is to create opportunities for women around the continent to invest at more comfortable levels. And f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or African female entrepreneurs who need pre-seed and seed funding, the launch of FirstCheck is a plus to their selection pool</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm now joins Rising Tide Africa and SA-based Dazzle Angels among others as one of the few angel funds targeted to African female-led startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Facebook and Apple begin to fire up more projects in the AR/VR world, Google has spent the last year shutting down most of their existing projects in that space.</p>
<p>Today, the folks at Google announced they had ended active development of Tilt Brush, a VR painting app that was one of virtual reality&#8217;s early hit pieces of software. The app allowed users to use virtual reality controllers as brushes to construct digital sculptures and environments.</p>
<p>While the company will not be pushing any new updates to the app, they did announce that they will be open sourcing the code on github for developers to build their own experiences and customizations. Google also notes that the app will continue to be available in the app stores on VR headsets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;[W]e want to continue supporting the artists using Tilt Brush by putting it in your hands,&#8221;a blog post from Google reads. &#8220;This means open sourcing Tilt Brush, allowing everyone to learn how we built the project, and encouraging them to take it in directions that are near and dear to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google acquired the small studio behind Tilt Brush called Skillman &amp; Hackett back in 2015.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tilt Brush co-creator Patrick Hackett announced he was leaving Google and would be joining the studio I-Illusions, the game studio behind VR title Space Pirate Trainer. According to LinkedIn, co-founder Drew Skillman stopped working on the VR project back in 2018 and now is part of the Stadia team at Google.</p>
<p>Last month, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-shutting-down-poly-3d-content-platform/">shut down Poly</a>, its 3D object library which allowed users to share digital art including design made in the Tilt Brush software.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson declined to comment further.</p>

<p>To some, this may look like the end of Tilt Brush.  To me, this is immortality.<br />Cheers to the team who helped get us here!</p>
