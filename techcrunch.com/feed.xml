										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we think of exiting via acquisition, it&#8217;s easy to think that if it&#8217;s a reasonable deal that it&#8217;s going to be an easy decision to say yes, but for three founders we spoke to at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/">TC Sessions: SaaS</a> recently, It was anything but. Founders have to balance many different decision points and deciding whether to sign on the dotted line is going to come with some anxiety and doubt before reaching a conclusion.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It wasn&#8217;t an easy decision. Even though, at $3.7 billion, everyone thought it should probably be a no-brainer; it wasn&#8217;t.							<cite>Jyoti Bansal</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The panel, which looked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/learn-what-happens-after-you-sell-your-startup-at-tc-sessions-saas-on-wednesday/">what happens after you get acquired</a>, included: Jyoti Bansal, current founder and CEO at Harness, who sold his previous startup AppDynamics<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/"> to Cisco for $3.7 billion</a> in 2017, the week he was going to IPO; Monica Sarbu, who is currently founder and CEO at Xata, who sold her startup<a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-acquires-packetbeat"> Packetbeat to Elastic</a> in 2015 just two years after launching the company, and finally Nick Mehta, who is currently co-founder and CEO at Gainsight, who sold his email archiving startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/16/symantec-buys-cloud-based-email-archiving-company-liveoffice-for-115m/">LiveOffice to Symantec</a> in 2011 for $115 million.</p>
<p>As you can see there was life with new startups after the sale for each of these founders, all of whom founded new companies after they left, but first they had to go through the sale process and decide to sell or not. Each founder took a slightly different path.</p>
<h2>The sales process</h2>
<p>Bansal was ready to take his company public in 2017 and was content to do just that when Cisco came knocking while the company was doing its roadshow. He rejected two initial offers, but when the company sweetened the pot enough, he simply couldn&#8217;t say no.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When hundreds of thousands of people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) fled their homes after the <a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eruption</a> of the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2021/5/60acb0434/unhcr-rushing-help-displaced-volcano-eruption-dr-congo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount Nyiragongo volcano</a> on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/23/999586355/congos-mount-nyiragongo-volcano-erupts-sending-lava-for-miles-but-sparing-a-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 22</a>, a blogger and a fledgling restaurant worker teamed up in the city of Goma and used bitcoin to help displaced families.</p>
<p><a href="https://chainglob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chainglob</a> crypto news founder Gloire Wanzavalere went to the makeshift refugee camp that sprang up nearly overnight, offering to give away bitcoin to displaced families.</p>
<p>He recruited by word-of-mouth, asking people if they knew someone who lost their home. But he quickly found that most of the families had already traded their phones for food. They also left most of their belongings behind, so didn’t have the paperwork needed to open new bank accounts or acquire new devices.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“These people lost everything. I understood it was rational for them to sell what they had left in order to buy food,” Wanzavalere said. “So we bought phones for eight people&#8230;12 people benefited from our initiative, four among them already had their own smartphones.”</p>
<p>Wanzavalere was inspired by online news of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-beach-tourists-residents-hail-el-salvadors-adoption-cryptocurrency-2021-09-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin Beach project</a> in El Salvador, which he said proved poor people can still use bitcoin despite the technical challenges and volatility.</p>
<p>“Coming to their aid with bitcoin was a more powerful act than any marketing campaign could be. That’s when we told ourselves, OK, we’re going to do this in Congo,” the crypto-focused blogger said.</p>
<p>They started with a small, circular workflow. Wanzavalere’s mother owns a small shop in town that sells basic hygiene supplies and nonperishable goods. She agreed to accept bitcoin using her mobile phone, relying on apps like <a href="https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wallet of Satoshi</a> and <a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phoenix Wallet</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Because she is very excited about the idea of helping people with bitcoin, she is considering the option of bringing a few essential goods closer to the refugees, so they can buy what they need without going too far into town. But it’s a complex question in part because of security concerns,” Wanzavalere said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Juvin Kombi, who works at <a href="https://twitter.com/jikofoodr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jikofood Restaurant</a>, was busy this past summer setting up his company’s first <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/gentle-introduction-to-lightning-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightning Network</a> node. This allowed the restaurant to accept bitcoin payments without high transaction fees or long confirmation times. By September they were up and running, using the restaurant’s PC and sometimes their own personal smartphones when needed. Their preferred mobile wallet apps are <a href="https://muun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muun Wallet</a> and <a href="http://bluewallet.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Wallet</a>.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2231750,2231749,2231748,2231747,2231746"]</p>
<p>“The learning process was very long, but the minimum research we have done has helped us understand bitcoin without any support,” Kombi said. “We realized that it was easy to set up. A simple wallet and an internet connection are sufficient. In addition, we are studying the possibility of setting up <a href="https://btcpayserver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTCPay Server</a> in the near future.”</p>
<p>So far just a few of the restaurant’s clients use bitcoin, Kombi added, including the displaced people Wanzavalere hired. However, they hope that as more people in the community learn about bitcoin that this payment option will set the small restaurant apart from local competition. The restaurant often hosts educational workshops for customers who want to learn more about using bitcoin.</p>
<p>Wanzavalere said he can relate to Kombi’s statement that bitcoin education takes a long time. Wanzavalere first discovered bitcoin after falling prey to an online scam in 2017. That inspired him to do more research into digital assets, and eventually start his own local crypto news blog. Hiring locally and paying in bitcoin makes sense as an altruistic marketing strategy.</p>
<p>“The Congolese population is suffering greatly; it never had any stable currency except the U.S. dollar,” Wanzavalere said. “I am not a journalist. However, I started to write about bitcoin issues in Africa because there was a lack of information on the subject in French.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, he fundraised for this grassroots program by inviting international bitcoin fans to participate in a “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/20/im-freaking-out-how-it-feels-to-hold-the-bitcoin-lightning-torch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightning Torch</a>.” First, he tweeted that anyone could join the torch, a chain of Lightning Network transactions created by strangers sharing an invoice and sending small amounts of bitcoin to pay it forward to the next invoice holder, like passing a baton in a relay race. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/05/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-becomes-latest-to-take-bitcoins-lightning-torch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the participants</a>.</p>
<p>“In total, 18 people contributed. Then the entirety of the funds were sent to me to be distributed to the beneficiaries,” Wanzavalere said. “In less than three hours, all the beneficiaries mastered it, learning how to receive and send money using a bitcoin wallet, which shows that in practice the Lightning Network isn’t that complicated to use.”</p>
<p>Next, Wanzavalere added, he plans to teach beneficiaries how to run a node, like Jikofood Restaurant does, in case they want to help expand the local bitcoin economy to include more small businesses that fully control their own funds. He may also hire some of the beneficiaries to work for his crypto blog.</p>
<p>“We plan to raise more money to help an even larger part of the suffering population,” Wanzavalere concluded. “The money collected by the torch event was meant to be distributed without anything in return. However, this is a long-term idea. Paying the refugees in bitcoin for freelance work could be a source of more community engagement.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s challenge to a 2017 EU antitrust finding against its shopping comparison service (Google Shopping) has been largely dismissed by the General Court of the European Union.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an important win for the Commission&#8217;s antitrust division, which &#8212; in recent years &#8212; has brought a string of enforcements against big tech, including multiple decisions against Google. But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/apple-and-ireland-win-appeal-against-the-european-commissions-15-billion-tax-ruling/">this summer lost a major case against Apple back taxes</a>.</p>
<p>Today the General Court of the EU has upheld the €2.42BN penalty imposed on Google and its parent company Alphabet over four years ago for competition abuses related to Google Shopping, a product comparison search service.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231979" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Google will seek to pursue further appeals vis-a-vis Google Shopping. A spokesperson declined to comment when asked.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">Back in 2017</a> the Commission found that Google had abused its dominance in search by giving prominent placement to its eponymous shopping comparison service &#8212; while simultaneously demoting rivals in organic search results.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hzKtQuz4AC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">Google fined $2.7BN for EU antitrust violations over shopping searches</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google fined $2.7BN for EU antitrust violations over shopping searches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/embed/#?secret=hzKtQuz4AC" data-secret="hzKtQuz4AC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google and its parent entity Alphabet appealed the decision but the General Court has dismissed most of their claims &#8212; agreeing that the sanctioned actions were anti-competitive and that Google had favored its own comparison shopping service over competing services rather than serving a better result.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a press release on the judgement, the Court also calls out another problematic tactic, writing: &#8220;While Google did subsequently enable competing comparison shopping services to enhance the quality of the display of their results by appearing in its ‘boxes’ in return for payment, the General Court notes that that service depended on the comparison shopping services changing their business model and ceasing to be Google’s direct competitors, becoming its customers instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>In additional findings, the Court agreed there were harmful effects for Google&#8217;s competitors of its anti-competitive behavior. And it rejected an argument by Google &#8212; which had sought to claim that competition for comparison shopping services remains strong on account of the presence of merchant platforms on that market &#8212; agreeing with the Commission’s assessment that those platforms are not on the same market.</p>
<p>In one bright spot for Google, the Court found that the Commission did not establish that the tech giant&#8217;s conduct had had (even potential) anticompetitive effects on the market for general search services. So it annulled the finding of an infringement in respect of that market alone.</p>
<p>But, again, it upheld the Commission&#8217;s analysis of the market for specialised search services for comparison shopping (and Google&#8217;s anti-competitive activity within it).</p>
<p>The Court also rejected Google&#8217;s claim that its conduct was objectively justified because it &#8216;improved the quality of its search service&#8217;.</p>
<p>And it dismissed another claim by Google of technical constraints preventing it from providing equal treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google has not demonstrated efficiency gains linked to that practice that would counteract its negative effects on competition,&#8221; it added in the press release.</p>
<p>In upholding the level of financial penalty imposed by the Commission, the Court noted that the portion of the decision it annulled had no impact on the amount of the fine (&#8220;since the Commission did not take the value of sales on that market into consideration in order to determine the basic amount of the fine&#8221;); and emphasized what is described as the &#8220;particularly serious nature of the infringement&#8221; &#8212; also taking into account the fact the conduct was intentional, rather than negligent.</p>
<p>The Commission said the judgement &#8220;delivers the clear message that Google&#8217;s conduct was unlawful and it provides the necessary legal clarity for the market&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comparison shopping delivers an important service to consumers, at a time when ecommerce has become more and more important for retailers and consumers. As digital services have become omnipresent in our society nowadays, consumers should be able to rely on them in order to make informed and unbiased choices,&#8221; the Commission said in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_5902">statement</a>.</p>
<p>It added that it will continue to use &#8220;all tools at its disposal to address the role of big digital platforms on which businesses and users depend to, respectively, access end users and access digital services&#8221; &#8212; pointing to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Markets Act regulatory proposal</a>, that&#8217;s currently being debated by the European Parliament and Council, and which it said aims to ensure &#8220;fairness and contestability&#8221;.</p>
<p>Responding to the ruling in its own statement, a Google spokesperson sought to downplay any significance, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Shopping ads have always helped people find the products they are looking for quickly and easily, and helped merchants to reach potential customers. This judgement relates to a very specific set of facts and while we will review it closely, we <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/ads/changes-to-google-shopping-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blog.google/products/ads/changes-to-google-shopping-in-europe/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636632364807000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEt1sjW0d1OsX_oFaAxhD6MW4CUjw">made changes</a> back in 2017 to comply with the European Commission&#8217;s decision. Our approach has worked <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/supporting-retail-through-comparison-shopping-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/supporting-retail-through-comparison-shopping-services/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636632364807000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg2_OWQEXOse_RW--AzBHApAX4wA">successfully</a> for more than three years, generating billions of clicks for more than 700 comparison shopping services.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However one rival to Google in the local search space &#8212; Yelp &#8212; seized on the judgement, saying it establishes a framework for &#8220;the swift assessment of the illegality of this type of conduct in other verticals&#8221;, and calling on the Commission to take action against Google over local search.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Yelp</span> welcomes today’s ruling of the European General Court, which has found Google guilty of abusing its dominance in general search to extinguish competitors in vertical search services without any efficiency justification,&#8221; said Luther Lowe, SVP, public policy, in a statement. &#8220;While the decision focuses on comparison shopping, it establishes a framework for the swift assessment of the illegality of this type of conduct in other verticals, namely local search. The local search market has not yet tipped, and European consumers conduct local searches on Google billions of times per week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than accept a Pyrrhic victory, the European Commission must now take this favorable precedent and prosecute Google for its parallel abuses in the local search market and allow services like <span class="il">Yelp</span> to compete on the merits,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;It may be hard to remember now, but Google and its Big Tech ilk were not always this unpopular. In 2015, Vice-President Vestager exhibited incredible courage by showing the world that Google&#8217;s abuses were not acceptable. She should be commended for this courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;But history&#8217;s verdict on this period will be based on whether this odyssey ultimately produced a tangible impact for European consumers, which is why it is vital that these tools be utilized in markets where competition remains salvageable.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Google has a pipeline of appeals against others EU antitrust findings (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">Android</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/">AdSense</a>), as well as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">open EU investigation of its adtech</a> &#8212; not to mention a raft of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/google-justice-department-antitrust-trial-date/">antitrust cases</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/google-state-lawsuit-android-attorneys-general/">on home soil</a>.</p>
<p>So its lawyers will be kept very busy regardless of the ramifications of today&#8217;s loss.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[General Partner Claire Chang’s plan is to deploy capital into 30 new investments and keep some back for follow-on investments.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IgniteXL Ventures, a fund founded by general partner Claire Chang, closed on its first fund of $10 million aimed at backing diverse early-stage founders in the beauty and wellness industry.</p>
<p>Chang is an angel investor who moved to the U.S. from Seoul when she was a child and started a global accelerator in 2015. Since then, she has formed a connection to the K-beauty industry and worked with more than 200 early-stage startups.</p>
<p>It was while working with the accelerator that she noticed a gap in funding between angel and seed, observing the frustration female founders felt with the lack of female VCs and with male investors who were not experienced in investing in the beauty and wellness industry. Chang formed igniteXL in 2018 and started fundraising over a year ago.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231412" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2231417" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231417" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231417" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg" alt="Claire Chang, ignitexl Ventures" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231417" class="wp-caption-text">Claire Chang, general partner at igniteXL Ventures. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> igniteXL Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>“This is a $5 trillion market opportunity that is hugely overlooked,” she told TechCrunch. “Beauty and wellness is seen as a women&#8217;s segment, but what is happening with the cultural transformation being applied to every industry, this segment is ripe for that.”</p>
<p>The fund’s first close was in February 2020, but she had to stop when the global pandemic hit, and start deploying the capital into the portfolio.</p>
<p>She picked up fundraising again earlier this year and now has 21 companies in the portfolio, including livestream platform BuyWith, sexual wellness brand Dame and skincare brand Good Light. Chang’s plan is to deploy capital into 30 new investments and keep some back for follow-on investments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When I set out to raise funds, I had no idea what to do — it was my personality to figure it out along the way,” she said. “I figured out LPs have set a criteria, and I didn’t fit into that: I don’t come from an investment banking background and don’t look like a typical VC. If anything, I am coming from a far different spectrum and it was a challenge, but it forced me to differentiate and bring something different.”</p>
<p>Chang aims to target funding dollars into more diverse founders, where investments historically go to men over 95% of the time and into just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback/">2% of female-founded companies</a>, though she says that number is increasing a bit.</p>
<p>She says she is bringing a unique lens, viewpoint and network to finding companies, especially those that are like she described herself — not a typical VC-backed company.</p>
<p>“Women care for themselves and also buy for all of their family members, so we see many more VC-backed founders coming into this space and more deal flow,”  Chang added. “The fact is that an opportunity lies in this overlooked market. Statistics show that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-05/diverse-startups-raise-more-cash-and-return-more-to-investors#:~:text=Companies%20with%20diverse%20founders%20ultimately,the%20Kauffman%20Fellows%20Research%20Center." target="_blank" rel="noopener">diverse teams outperform by 30%</a>, and for me to raise my second fund, this first fund has to be successful, and more diverse teams are going to help me do that.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, igniteXL’s fund attracted a global profile of prominent VCs and strategic LPs, including Han Kim of Altos Ventures Management, Perry Ha of Draper Athena, Allen Miner of SunBridge Group and the world’s leading cosmetics ODM, Cosmax.</p>
<p>Kim, whose fund invested in Roblox, Coupang, Delivery Hero and Krafton, said via email that “the VC world needs more people like Claire. She empathizes with entrepreneurs and takes on their problems as if they were her own. She really cares.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a world where we count every step and measure every heartbeat, hopping on the scale once per week to keep half an eye on what your body is doing just won&#8217;t do. Even if you stand around on the glass oracle of mass a few times per day, the truth is that your body weight is a trailing indicator &#8212; it shows what has already happened, rather than what&#8217;s about to. One leading indicator is your blood sugar level &#8212; and weight-loss startup <a href="https://www.signos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signos</a> is betting that you&#8217;re curious enough about the difference between our respective metabolisms to sign up for real-time glucose monitoring and alerts to keep you in shape. It turns out that GV believes that, too, to the tune of leading the company&#8217;s $13 million Series A round.</p>
<p>The basic science is this: If I eat a bowl of oatmeal, my blood sugar is going to spike. If I go for a walk or a run when it does, the glucose level in my blood will go down, which nips weight gain in the bud. My body might react differently to different kinds of foods on different days, at different times, and depending on a whole raft of unpredictable features about my body, what I eat, and how I&#8217;m doing that day. Crucially, it&#8217;s no good to use my body as an example; yours is going to be different. Signos believes that by continuously measuring, you can get the data you need to make healthier &#8212; or at least better informed &#8212; choices about what you&#8217;re putting in your body, and how often you shift your carcass around to shake off some of that weight again.</p>
<p>The company today revealed that it has raised a total of $17 million in funding, including a $4 million seed funding led by Courtside Ventures, 1984 Ventures and Tau Ventures back in January. In the current round, Signos raised a $13 million Series A led by GV.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228167" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder told me he has a pretty close personal connection with the challenge of weight loss, and outlines how he got started.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a fairly overweight/obese kid growing up, and I was like that up into my early teen years. I got into sports, lost weight, and actually became decently athletic. I eventually went to college to play hockey and ended up having a couple offers to play in the NHL,&#8221; said Sharam Fouladgar-Mercer, CEO of Signos. After his brush with top-tier sports, his body changed again, and he gained a lot of weight. &#8220;A<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> few years ago, I was pretty overweight again. I started looking for some guidance. The standard advice is 2,500 calories per day for an adult male, but we all have friends that eat 4,000 or 5,000 calories and they never put on a pound. And then there&#8217;s those who eat 1,500 calories and they never lose weight. A</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> member of my family was diagnosed as diabetic and I saw his continuous glucose monitor (CGM). He was explaining how it worked, and I found myself wishing we could take the CGM and figure out how the metabolism actually interjects itself with weight loss.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Long story short, Fouladgar-Mercer founded a company and started building.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide visibility into every body&#8217;s unique metabolic needs. Before, we were stuck with calorie reduction or counting macros or removing carbs altogether; now, we can work with people to turn diets that don’t work into plans that do,” said Fouladgar-Mercer, &#8220;We help them discover this in a matter of days or weeks and refine it over time for best weight management and overall health. Elite athletes or conscientious dieters often take an extraordinary amount of trial and error to come to the same conclusion we are able to deliver in a fraction of the time.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Signos platform will help develop personalized answers to basic questions like what to eat, when to eat and what exercises help encourage weight loss. At the heart of the system is <a href="https://www.dexcom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dexcom</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.dexcom.com/g6/features-and-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G6 continuous glucose monitoring</a> devices, which are typically used for diabetes patients. Dexcom became an investor in Signos&#8217; most recent investment round as well, as a strategic investor.</p>
<p>On top of the hardware component, which measures the glucose levels in the user&#8217;s blood every few minutes, Signos created an AI-enhanced app to offer real-time data and recommendations designed to drive sustained weight loss. At the beginning of their Signos experience, users log what they eat, enabling the Signos platform to learn their body&#8217;s reaction to specific foods. Once calibrated, Signos uses that data to provide personalized nutrition suggestions, including which foods are best for each user, when to eat and when to exercise to bring glucose levels back within their optimal weight loss range.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wear the device for 10 days, full-time. You shower, go for a run, you sleep and the device keeps measuring. At the end of the period, it beeps to let you know that it&#8217;s time to peel it off and replace it with a new one,&#8221; explains Fouladgar-Mercer, and admits that, due to the nature of the device, it isn&#8217;t exactly the greenest tech we&#8217;ve seen in a while &#8212; it isn&#8217;t recyclable or reusable. &#8220;It&#8217;s a medical device, so it needs to be disposed of.&#8221;</p>
<p>To wear a continuous blood measuring device, you can&#8217;t just pop to your local pharmacy to let the tiny electronic vampires loose on your innards; a doctor needs to prescribe one of the devices for you.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the United States, you need a doctor&#8217;s prescription to get a CGM, and then you need a pharmacy to fulfill that order, as well. We put all those operations behind the scenes; you come to the site, and we walk you through the whole process,&#8221; says Fouladgar-Mercer. &#8220;And then when that&#8217;s done, it goes to the pharmacy licensed in the appropriate state and they send you the box that has everything in it. In addition, you&#8217;ll need our software, which is available to download.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magic in the system is in the near-real-time monitoring and alert system; it doesn&#8217;t help to know that your blood sugar spiked at 1:35 PM when you check your phone before bed at night. The right time to take action, the company claims, is as the glucose level is on the upswing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having this immediate continuous feedback loop over a longer period of time yields better results for our members to achieve the sort of health outcomes that they&#8217;re trying to achieve,&#8221; claims Fouladgar-Mercer.</p>
<p>The company says it has more than 100,000 potential customers waiting for the product to become available, and it says that the new funding round means that the product will be available across the U.S. at some point in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli startup <a href="https://trieye.tech/">TriEye</a> has raised $74 million to commercialize a type of sensing technology that can be used to help autonomous and driver-assistance systems to see better in adverse conditions.</p>
<p>The technology uses short-wave infrared (SWIR), which refers to a wavelength range that is outside the visible spectrum. While SWIR sensing is not new, it has mostly been restricted to the aerospace and defense industries due to its high cost. TriEye says it has made engineering breakthroughs that have driven down the cost enough to compete with regular cameras that can be found in a mobile phone or vehicle today, and to outperform other types of sensors on the market.</p>
<p>With these innovations, built on over a decade of research pioneered by CTO Uriel Levy during his tenure at Hebrew University, TriEye is ready to bring SWIR tech to the mass market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231346" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to CEO Avi Bakal, SWIR brings an additional layer of information to existing vision systems by letting people see “beyond the visible.”</p>
<p>“Sensing is everywhere,” Bakal said. “In any industry, it&#8217;s a vital part of the gathering and analysis process. As of today, the vision system market lacks necessary and vital data that can impact performance and decision-making all over.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231353" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231353" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231353" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TriEye-founders-from-left-to-right-Prof.-Uriel-Levy-CTO-Avi-Bakal-CEO-Omer-Kapach-VP-RD.-Credit-Maxim-Dinshtein.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TriEye-founders-from-left-to-right-Prof.-Uriel-Levy-CTO-Avi-Bakal-CEO-Omer-Kapach-VP-RD.-Credit-Maxim-Dinshtein.jpeg 5029w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TriEye-founders-from-left-to-right-Prof.-Uriel-Levy-CTO-Avi-Bakal-CEO-Omer-Kapach-VP-RD.-Credit-Maxim-Dinshtein.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TriEye-founders-from-left-to-right-Prof.-Uriel-Levy-CTO-Avi-Bakal-CEO-Omer-Kapach-VP-RD.-Credit-Maxim-Dinshtein.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TriEye-founders-from-left-to-right-Prof.-Uriel-Levy-CTO-Avi-Bakal-CEO-Omer-Kapach-VP-RD.-Credit-Maxim-Dinshtein.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TriEye-founders-from-left-to-right-Prof.-Uriel-Levy-CTO-Avi-Bakal-CEO-Omer-Kapach-VP-RD.-Credit-Maxim-Dinshtein.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TriEye-founders-from-left-to-right-Prof.-Uriel-Levy-CTO-Avi-Bakal-CEO-Omer-Kapach-VP-RD.-Credit-Maxim-Dinshtein.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TriEye-founders-from-left-to-right-Prof.-Uriel-Levy-CTO-Avi-Bakal-CEO-Omer-Kapach-VP-RD.-Credit-Maxim-Dinshtein.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TriEye-founders-from-left-to-right-Prof.-Uriel-Levy-CTO-Avi-Bakal-CEO-Omer-Kapach-VP-RD.-Credit-Maxim-Dinshtein.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231353" class="wp-caption-text">TriEye founders Uriel Levy, Avi Bakal, Omer Kapach.</p></div></p>
<p>Using SWIR and a proprietary illumination source also developed by TriEye, the company has built a sensor it calls sedar (spectrum enhanced detection and ranging). According to the company, sedar provides all imaging and depth information required for advanced driver assistance and autonomous systems &#8212; that means it could replace the conventional sensing stack that’s being used in advanced driver assistance and autonomous systems today, which is generally a combination of cameras, radar, and light detection and ranging radar (lidar).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the biggest advantages to TriEye’s tech is the cost savings relative to cameras and lidar, which Bakal said is key to “truly enable mass market adoption.”</p>
<p>“This is the goal,” he said. “We want to be all over, in the most simple car to the premium vehicle.”</p>
<p>TriEye’s SWIR sensor use a type of semiconductor called a CMOS, Bakal explained. The company is already working with major CMOS foundries to produce the sensor, in order to eventually scale up to millions of units per year. Bakal also said that TriEye is working with major OEMs on commercializing the sedar with specific model vehicles, but he did not provide further details.</p>
<p>The company doesn’t just have its eyes on the automotive industry, though that is its primary target market. TriEye also sees a role for SWIR sensing in industrial applications – such as food sorting or materials identification – as well as biometrics and surveillance.</p>
<p>TriEye’s big bet on SWIR has caught the attention of some major investors, including the investment arms of Intel and Porsche. Both companies also participated in TriEye’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/porsche-invests-in-low-visibility-sensor-startup-trieye/">Series A in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>This latest round of funding was led by M&amp;G Investments and Varana Capital, with the participation of Samsung Ventures, Tawazun SDF, Deep Insight, Allied Group, and Discount Capital as well as existing investors Intel Capital, Porsche Ventures, Marius Nacht and Grove Ventures. The round brings TriEye’s total funding to $96 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seems there’s a fair bit of M&amp;A news on the smart home front these days. Following Ecobee’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/generator-maker-generac-set-to-buy-smart-thermostat-startup-ecobee/">acquisition by generator company Generac</a>, Level Home today announced that it’s acquiring Dwelo, news that arrives as the former also announces a Series C north of $100 million, led by Cox Communications and featuring Walmart. The round brings Dwelo’s funding up to $171 million to date. The acquisition is the company&#8217;s first.</p>
<p>Walmart was one of two key investors (along with Lennar) in the $71 million raise Level Home announced when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/smart-home-startup-level-home-emerges-from-stealth-with-71m-and-a-new-take-on-the-smart-lock/">it came out of stealth in 2019</a>. The company’s primary product at the time was Level Lock, a smart lock designed to look like a dumb lock with simple installation that works with HomeKit. The “first invisible smart lock” could then be unlocked with an iPhone or Apple Watch.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/smart-apartment-platform-dwelo-grabs-4-9m-in-funding/">wrote up Dwelo</a> two years earlier when the renter-focused smart home solution raised $4.9 million. Its offering is focused at apartment dwellers &#8212; or rather managers/owners of those apartments. Effectively, it lets them control a wide range of devices across different apartments in their building.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“By welcoming Dwelo to Level, we now can offer a seamless experience of thoughtfully designed hardware with a powerful SaaS platform, giving residents incredible command, convenience and new abilities to personalize their home,” Level CEO John Martin said in a release. “We founded Level with the vision of reimagining the smart home, and with Dwelo, we are introducing the next generation experience for property owners and residents.”</p>
<p>The brand merger looks likely to play out as a kind of vertical integration, likely bundling Level Locks as part of Dwelo&#8217;s landlord-focused product offering. Apartment buildings are a local step for a growing smart lock company in a crowded space. These sorts of devices have more traditionally been focused on home owners, who have to deal with less red tape upon installation.</p>
<p>In addition to offering up the amenities of the latest connected home products, building owners no doubt have their own reasons for wanting remote control over door locks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Restaurant operators typically focus on good food and customer service, but when customers stopped coming in during the pandemic, many had to learn how to reach them in new ways.</p>
<p>Childhood friends David Grandes and Andres Andrade, both originally from Ecuador, started Mimic in 2018 in Brazil as a dark kitchen-as-a-service, specializing in producing food at scale with online channel sales.</p>
<p>As food operators themselves, they saw firsthand last year the toll it was taking on restaurants that needed to quickly reinvent themselves during the pandemic, but weren’t sure how to start integrating digitalization into their businesses.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That’s when Grandes and Andrade decided to pivot their company to <a href="https://www.zak.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zak</a>, an all-in-one management tool that offers digital and financial capabilities to the food service market at zero fixed-cost. Its technology provides a 360-degree view of the restaurant and includes point-of-sale, back office tools and payment processing, both offline and online. The tools also integrate with aggregators like iFood, Uber Eats and Rappi.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231401" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231401" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231401" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg" alt="David Grandes and Andres Andrade, ZAK’s co-founders and co-CEOs, ZAK" width="1024" height="709" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg 1741w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=1536,1064 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231401" class="wp-caption-text">David Grandes and Andres Andrade, Zak’s co-founders and co-CEOs. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zak</p></div></p>
<p>The company now works with more than 300 restaurants across São Paulo and received a cash infusion of $15 million in Series A funding, led by Tiger Global Management, to take its technology mainstream across Brazil into Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Campinas, Brasília and Salvador.</p>
<p>Joining Tiger in the round is Valor Capital Group, Monashees, Base 10 and Canary, representing the total funding Zak has raised to date.</p>
<p>“We feel ready to go into the mass market,” Grandes, co-founder and co-CEO, told TechCrunch. “The funding enables us to round out our product and our teams. For now the focus is on Brazil, but we see a huge opportunity to move into Latin America and will start with Mexico, which is 50% of the restaurant market. We are also moving to be an embedded finance company.”</p>
<p>In addition, Zak plans to double its current team of 162 employees by the end of 2022 and to add new services like customer relationship management and marketing automation so that restaurants can increase their omni-channel presence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pivoting has made the company’s total addressable market “100 times bigger,” and given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">Nubank’s recent IPO</a>, provides Zak with a “front-row seat into the financial flows of restaurants,” co-CEO Andrade said.</p>
<p>It also puts the company in position to launch its financial services piece to have an upper hand on digital wallets, invoicing and offering capital to restaurants that often get turned down for loans. Ultimately, the company wants to be the “Toast of LatAm,” Grandes said.</p>
<p>The company seems well on its way: Zak grew its revenue base four times in the past year and is running some $100 million payments through the platform each month, Marina Lima, the company’s chief revenue officer, said. She sees a similar trajectory in the next 12 months and expects over $350 million in payments to go through Zak by the end of that time period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grandes says there are 1 million restaurants in Brazil, which presents a big opportunity to go downstream.</p>
<p>“It is about dominating Brazil and rounding out the team, product and platform,” he added. “We are already quite differentiated and ahead for us is consolidating across Brazil and then going into Mexico.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kodiak Robotics, one of the last privately held autonomous truck outfits in Silicon Valley, has raised $125 million in new capital, funding that will be used to double its workforce as it pursues a path to commercialization.</p>
<p>The oversubscribed Series B stands out for its lengthy list of backers and notably that the lead investor is not listed and not being disclosed. TechCrunch has been told that a freight and logistics company set up a special interest financial vehicle as the strategic lead investor spot in the round.</p>
<p>Other investors include newcomers SIP Global Partners, Muirwoods Ventures, Harpoon Ventures, StepStone Group, Gopher Asset Management, Walleye Capital, Aliya Capital Partners, and others. Existing investors Battery Ventures, CRV and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated. Bridgestone Americas and BMW i Ventures, which had announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-robotics-snags-investment-partnership-from-bridgestone/">strategic investments in Kodiak</a> earlier this year, converted its funds to this round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231571" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kodiak has raised a total of $165 million since its founding in 2018. The company did not disclose the valuation. </span></p>
<p>Like so many startups, the funding will be used to hire more people. Kodiak is aiming to grow from the 90 people it employs today to about 170 by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Don Burnette said the hiring is across every department in the company. The new funding will be used to expand operations, pay for the expansion of its fleet. Kodiak plans to add a a minimum of 15 new trucks for a total of at least 25 autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to scale and with scale comes growth across the entire company — more drivers, more operations folks, more engineers,&#8221; Burnette said in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;R&amp;D is definitely the primary utilization of the funds. Scaling the fleet is also a really big one, obviously, as you watch the space you see that there&#8217;s an ever growing interest in commercial traction and customers and partners and miles driven and the size of the autonomous freight network. So we&#8217;re going to be expanding all of those efforts and that all costs money.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series B comes at a critical time for Kodiak. The company is a fraction of the size of other autonomous vehicle companies pursuing trucking, notably Aurora and Waymo. Burnette has argued that Kodiak is more capitally efficient than its much larger and better funded rivals.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean Kodiak is forever done with seeking funding. As Kodiak scales, the company will pursue more funding and will continue to evaluate options in the public markets and the private markets. Burnette said he is not considering any mergers and is not looking to be acquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll really be interesting to see how things unfold,&#8221; Burnette said of funding within the AV industry. &#8220;I think from an investor-appetite perspective, I mean, the fact that this round was so heavily oversubscribed goes to show that there is significant investor interest out there still. Within the private markets, now that many of our competitors have gone public, Kodiak&#8217;s really positioned as one of the last remaining private AV trucking companies with any significant progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Kodiak revealed details about its fourth-generation autonomous truck system and announced it was expanding its own fleet by 15 PACCAR Class 8 trucks. (They have 10 trucks in the field today.) The fourth-generation truck has a modular sensor suite that includes a center pod on the front roofline of the truck as well as pods integrated into both of the side mirrors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vimeo</a>, the B2B video platform that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/what-vimeos-growth-profits-and-value-tell-us-about-the-online-video-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spun out from IAC earlier this year</a>, has made a pair of acquisitions aimed at building out the suite of features and tools it offers to businesses to create and run their own video strategies. The company has picked up short-form AI-based video creation platform <a href="https://www.wibbitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wibbitz</a>; and <a href="https://www.wirewax.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirewax</a>, which has built technology for marketers and other non-technical creatives to make objects in videos &#8220;shoppable&#8221; or linkable to other outside content.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed, but for some context, New York-based Wibbitz <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/05/wibbitz-raises-2-3m-series-a-for-technology-that-turns-text-into-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally made its name</a> as an Israeli startup that had built AI-based technology that automatically turned text into videos, a service that helped it raise around $30 million from investors that included a number of strategic backers (that is, customers) like the Associated Press, Bertelsmann, France&#8217;s TF1, and the Weather Channel, as well as traditional VCs like Horizons Ventures and Kima Ventures. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/video-taggging-startup-wirewax-makes-cougar-town-episode-shoppable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">London-based Wirewax</a>, meanwhile, also had a strategic backer in the form of the BBC, and other investors included Passion Capital and the Plug and Play incubator. It had raised around $7 million. Both have large customers on their books.</p>
<p>Vimeo plans to keep both platforms operational and continue serving existing customers, which include the likes of Walmart, Disney, Google, and Nike for Wirewax and HubSpot, Bloomberg, Condé Nast, and Harvard University for Wibbitz. It is also planning to integrate its features into its wider video creation dashboard to over time sell a wider set of tools both to those customers and those already with Vimeo.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231959" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The idea behind the deals is to bring in more tools specifically targeting Vimeo&#8217;s larger enterprise customers, CEO Anjali Sud said in an interview, to provide more creative tools that are less technical to help them feed the video beast: video consumption has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1215173/impact-of-covid-19-on-type-of-video-consumption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skyrocketed</a> in the last couple of years, fueled in no small part by Covid-19 and people spending more time at home and on their screens rather than in public places.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s accelerated a lot of organizations&#8217; video strategies, whether that involves providing tools for internal teams to get work done, or creating marketing campaigns, or building new products themselves.</p>
<p class="p17">&#8220;Companies are going from reactive to proactive, and employees are demanding it,&#8221; Sud said of the video push and how its customers are looking for more functionality in their video software. The knock-on effect for Vimeo, she added, has been to become a consolidator of many of the smaller video companies that have emerged over the years to address different aspects of the creation process, to make a bigger product that is easier to address that demand, with &#8220;several acquisitions helpful in expanding our product suite to create an all-in-one professional video solution. Our belief is that every startup has an interesting video feature to provide. We want to get every company using video every day, to get 1 billion knowledge workers using video. To do that you have to materially lower the barriers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p17">It&#8217;s been a years-long strategy for the company, with other acquisitions including the purchase of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/vimeo-acquires-livestream-launches-its-own-live-video-product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Livestream</a>, which it says now powers town halls and other live events (a platform that was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vimeo-launches-vimeo-events-a-new-platform-designed-to-turn-every-marketer-into-a-virtual-events-pro-301413693.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded</a> earlier this month by way of a new virtual events product); and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/vimeo-has-acquired-short-form-video-creation-platform-magisto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magisto</a>, another short-form video creator tool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wirewax will be bringing more interactive video functionality to Vimeo, specifically with a drag-and-drop interface. One of the most obvious applications will be in the realm of e-commerce where users will be able to use the tech to build &#8220;shoppable&#8221; videos with links within the videos themselves to buying featured items; but other applications can be technical (eg to product demonstrations) or education (for further information about something in a video), or internal training for employees (for example links through to quizzes).</p>
<p>Wibbitz, meanwhile, is more focused on video creation, and specifically tools for marketing, internal communications and media teams to manage large amounts of video while keeping the content consistent with company branding and style. It also still offers a product for using AI to transform text to video automatically, although this is no longer the core service. Sud said that AI IP will be integrated into its existing products that also provide the same functionality (which it acquired via Magisto).</p>
<p class="p6">&#8220;Wirewax was built for the video-first future, evolving video to be a lean-in, fully engaging experience,” said Steve Callanan, CEO, Wirewax, in a statement. “Marrying Wirewax with Vimeo’s video leadership and global scale will put the power of next-generation interactive video into the hands of millions of users. It’s an exciting step to be joining Vimeo and contributing to helping organizations unleash their creativity and produce engaging experiences that drive better business outcomes, from shoppable videos to boost sales, to entirely new ways to improve training, education, and customer service.”</p>
<p class="p6">“Wibbitz and Vimeo have a shared goal of making video creation so simple that any employee can easily and quickly make beautiful, professional-quality videos at scale,” added Zohar Dayan, CEO, Wibbitz. “We have spent over 10 years honing our product to serve marketing, HR, and communications teams at some of the largest companies in the world, and are thrilled to join Vimeo’s world-class platform to accelerate the video transformation taking place across the enterprise.”</p>
<p>The pair of acquisitions nevertheless come on the heels of a mixed year for Vimeo. The company spun out as a public company from IAC in May, debuting at $57/share. However, it saw its stock dip on its first day of trading ending up with a market cap of $8.4 billion on its closing day. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VMEO?p=VMEO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today</a>, its share price and valuation are more than halved, with a market cap of $4 billion. Some of the skepticism in the market appears to hinge on the fact that it&#8217;s spinning out into what has become a highly competitive space, with many a company with deep pockets also looking to address the same gap in the market for providing video services to businesses that want to do more in video.</p>
<p>Despite this, the fact remains that we have seen record-breaking levels for all kinds of video providers, from on-demand premium content companies like Netflix through to those focused as well on user-generated content like TikTok and YouTube, and those with more business focus, such as Zoom for conferencing.</p>
<p>That rising tide has also lifted 10-year-old Vimeo&#8217;s boat. The company posted quarterly revenues of $100 million in Q3 (it debuted in May with quarter revenues of $89.4 million). Sud tells us that the company now has &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; of free users and 1.6 million paying users (that latter figure is flat compared to May, when Vimeo disclosed 200 million free users).</p>
<p>Since its pivot to B2B four years ago, Vimeo&#8217;s customer base has settled on a pretty wide mix, ranging from SMBs through to startups and some 6,000 large enterprises including Starbucks, Amazon and Spotify. Enterprise revenues grew 60% in the last quarter compared to a year ago, figures that the company is holding in place as it looks to the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think in the long term of decades, not years,&#8221; Sud said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Canary’s first two funds each invested in approximately 50 companies and the firm's expectation is to do around the same number of first checks with the third fund.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.canary.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canary</a>, the Brazilian venture capital firm backing some of Latin America’s successful startups like Buser, Salve, Hashdex, Facily and Trybe, closed on its third fund that was oversubscribed with $100 million in commitments.</p>
<p>Since its formation in 2017, the firm invested in more than 100 companies in Latin America through its first two funds, on which it raised $45 million and $75 million, respectively. Those startups have in turn raised over $2.3 billion in new investments.</p>
<p>Marcos Toledo, Canary’s co-founder and managing partner, started the firm with Florian Hagenbuch, Mate Pencz, Patrick de Picciotto and Julio Vasconcellos. It is agnostic in terms of sector and aims to be a local partner for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/">U.S. firms seeking investments in the area</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Toledo expects to invest in about 50 companies, and first checks from the fund were signed starting in the summer.</p>
<p>We emailed with Toledo recently to learn more about the fund.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How long do you usually wait between new raises?</strong></p>
<p>MT: We normally raise a new vintage after two or two-and-a-half years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Why was now a good time to launch a new fund?</strong></p>
<p>Launching a new fund right now is a reinforcement of the potential of the region for innovation and our vision of the future: still lots of problems to be solved, paired with a growing pool of talented people starting or joining new companies.</p>
<p>When Canary was founded, in 2017, it was founded under the hypothesis that there are plenty of talented people that, with the right support and incentives, could create businesses with huge impact, capable of changing Latin America. We thought the tech market in the region was in its early stages and had many opportunities.</p>
<p>A few years later, we are not only happy to see that our belief was right, but also that this trend is accelerating, with more and more people making a shift in their careers, becoming founders or joining a startup team, instead of going to work in traditional jobs (for instance, our second vintage had 50% more second time founders than the first one, and this number seems to be higher for the new vintage).</p>
<p>In addition to that, we are very excited about our positioning in the market, having access to more than 90% of all funding rounds that have happened in Brazil since 2017. Moreover, the VC market is still in its early days in Latin America and there are plenty of structural problems and industries waiting to be disrupted in the region, something that excites us about the transformation to come in the next few years. There is a true opportunity to consolidate ourselves as one of the main VC firms in the region.</p>

<p><strong>What was it like raising a fund in this environment?</strong></p>
<p>More than just raising capital, in Canary we seek to have, as investors, long-term oriented partners that can add real value to our invested companies. In this third fund, we are excited to say that not only we were heavily oversubscribed, but also fortunate to renew the partnerships with some leading Brazilian and global families, several partners of renowned global funds, as well as a large proportion of the best tech founders in the region.</p>
<p>We also had the chance to expand our investor base across geographies, such as Asia, LatAm and the U.S., and to different pools of capital, such as U.S. endowments and foundations. Cases of success in the region are helping more and more investors to understand the market and see the potential of really big companies to be created around here. Moreover, the push for digital transformation and disruption in Latin America is each and every day making our hypothesis stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Where will the new fund be targeted?</strong></p>
<p>As in Canary’s two first funds, this third fund is focused on writing the first institutional check for the best founders in Latin America. We always saw the opportunity for the whole region, but decided to start with Brazil. Now, we are increasingly investing in companies all over the continent, from countries like Mexico, Colombia and Argentina.</p>
<p>Considering sectors, we maintain our agnostic approach: we believe that excellent founders will always find a way to look at the best opportunities and build amazing companies. As we often say, we are not experts in sectors, but we are specialists in finding talented people with ambition to transform the lives of millions of Latin Americans. More than that, we are also focused on helping these founders in areas that can unlock disproportionate value, like fundraising, building their founding teams, commercial connections, public relations and data insights. Our focus is basically on people, first checks and LatAm.</p>
<p>Canary’s first two funds each invested in approximately 50 companies and our expectation is to do around the same number of first checks. We also have a share of the capital reserved to participate in subsequent rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a particular sector where you are seeing a lot of startups coming into or raising funds</strong>?</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to get a first look in the market, and since 2017, we have had access to 93% of the deals that were invested by top-tier VC funds in Brazil. Of course, fintech has been a major sector for LatAm startups in recent years and we see that there are a lot of opportunities still available to be explored by bold and ambitious founders.</p>
<p>In Brazil, specifically, we are also seeing a very interesting moment regarding insurtechs, with local regulators not only approving, but also pushing for more innovation in the market. Healthtech is also rising up in the region — the COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call about how the health industry is structured and how it can be transformed for better.</p>
<p>Also, as an effect of the pandemic, we are seeing plenty of startups transforming e-commerce and working to make its infrastructure better, from payments to logistics, not without mentioning social commerce companies.</p>
<p>Another enthusiastic opportunity we are seeing are B2B marketplaces that can transform whole industries from the inside. It is a major global trend that is increasingly growing in the region.</p>
<p><strong>What is the investment landscape like in Brazil/Latin America right now? How has it changed in the past 12 months? What do you predict for the next 12 months?</strong></p>
<p>The investment landscape in LatAm is very accelerated right now, a surprise if you consider our perspective about 18 months ago, when COVID hit the region. 2020 and 2021 are record years for VC investments in Latin America, with new but not surprising factors. We are seeing more and more global VC firms writing their first checks in the region (and we are proud to be local partners in the early stage for firms like Dragoneer, a16z, SoftBank, QED and Ribbit).</p>
<p>We are also seeing a first wave of companies doing their IPOs and completing the investment cycle: exits and distributions of stock options do not only bring more money to the table, but also work as success cases and can influence the future of the market and bring more talented people to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>There will also be a lot of experienced executives and operators thinking about their next steps, and this is a positive cycle that can be repeated with different companies going to the public market. Moreover, we are also seeing other countries in LatAm maturing their ecosystems at a faster pace, with plenty of talented people starting new businesses and looking to solve significant problems for the whole continent.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[General Atlantic saw a record 21 IPOs and direct listings of portfolio companies in 2021 thus far.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.generalatlantic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Atlantic</a> announced Wednesday that its sixth growth equity fund, GA 2021, closed with $7.8 billion in commitments, up from the $5 billion the firm was originally seeking earlier this year.</p>
<p>Backers in the new fund included new and existing capital partners, including family offices, endowments, foundations and institutional investors.</p>
<p>GA, which was started in 1980, now has $23.8 billion in committed capital and had over $78 billion in assets under management as of June 30. The firm will continue to invest across five sectors: consumer, financial services, healthcare, life sciences and technology. It has invested $49 billion in more than 430 global growth companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231677" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The firm created a unique capital structure that enables the firm to scale its capital base on an ongoing basis that includes closed-end-funds, five-year managed accounts, evergreen accounts and a GP commitment, representing the largest single investor in GA’s core investing program, according to the firm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far this year, GA has made 65 investments, up from 42 in 2020, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/general-atlantic/recent_investments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Crunchbase data</a>. It made seven investments in October; one of the latest was in insurance policy provider Acko, based in India, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/amazon-backed-insurtech-acko-joins-unicorn-club-with-255-million-funding/">raised $225 million</a> in October. Overall, the firm had 130 exits of portfolio companies.</p>
<p>GA also saw 21 IPOs and direct listings of portfolio companies in 2021 thus far, which includes companies like payment software company EngageSmart, which <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/general-atlantic-backed-payments-company-engagesmart-files-for-ipo-2021-08-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced its IPO in August</a>, and employee screening company HireRight, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/general-atlantic-backed-hireright-files-us-ipo-2021-10-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in October</a>. That is compared to a prior record of six in both 2020 and 2019, according to a General Atlantic spokesperson.</p>
<p>“Our global growth equity strategy positions us to capitalize on the profound acceleration of digital innovation and global entrepreneurship as we seek to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our capital partners,” Bill Ford, chairman and CEO of General Atlantic, said in a written statement. “Our ability to partner with management teams, help build rapidly growing, technology-enabled companies on a global scale, and generate strong and consistent investment performance distinguishes General Atlantic from both entrepreneurs and investors.”</p>

<p>For many sales and marketing teams, finding leads is a time-consuming and tedious process. <a href="https://www.lusha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lusha</a>, a sales intelligence platform for B2B sales, is helping with a crowdsourced database that helps companies narrow down their lists of potential customers to the most likely candidates. Founded in 2016, the company was bootstrapped until it raised its Series A just nine months ago. Today, it announced it has hit unicorn status, with a $205 million Series B that puts the Tel Aviv-based startup’s valuation at $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The round was led by growth equity firm PSG, with participation from ION Crossover Partners and brings Lusha’s total raised to $245 million, including <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/10/lusha-raises-40-million-to-surface-sales-lead-contact-info-in-your-browser/">its $40 million Series A announced in Februar</a>y. Co-founder and chief executive officer Yoni Tserruya said that since raising its first round of outside funding, Lusha’s growth rate has tripled and it wants to put more resources into its go-to-market strategy. The Series B will be used on Lusha’s data infrastructure, new features, privacy compliance and expanding its market share in the United States.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231935" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lusha says its user community, which contributes data like company information and business contact details, now includes more than 800,000 sales professionals and 273,000 sales organizations, including large tech firms like Facebook, Google, Dropbox and Uber. Most of Lusha’s clients are B2B SaaS companies, but it’s also used by venture capital firms, investors and recruiting agencies.</p>
<p>The company’s tools include a browser extension that displays information about a company’s industry, size, revenue and sales contacts. A “prospecting tool” lets users filter leads into specific customer segments. Lusha also offers API and integrations so its database can be integrated into a company’s existing sales and marketing software systems. The company is GDPR-aligned and CCPA-compliant. When people are added to its database, Lusha notifies them so they can edit or remove their contact information.</p>
<p>Lusha was launched five years ago by Assaf Eisenstein and Tserruya because they realized social networks weren’t an effective way to generate quality sales leads.</p>
<p>“When we started in 2016, we realized that you can reach out to anyone because you have social networks like LinkedIn, Facebook and so on. So if you want to reach out to someone, you can do it, but the way it works with social networks is not efficient. There’s a lot of noise,” Tserruya told TechCrunch. “People were starting to ignore a lot of those reach-out requests, but the need for salespeople and marketing teams remained the same.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lusha was created to cut through the noise and help sales and marketing teams identify the people who are most likely to want to hear from them.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Lusha was like “Waze for salespeople,” as the company’s website puts it. Once it started crowdsourcing data from salespeople, that generated a network effect. In the early stages, a lot of the data wasn’t particularly accurate. But &#8220;as the company evolved, we realized what would make us the best in the industry and the differentiator would be the accuracy of the data and how deep the data is that we provide to customers,” said Tserruya. As a result, Lusha focused on growing its community of users, who contribute and validate data.</p>
<p>Current tailwinds for Lusha’s services include remote work as the pandemic continues. “Sales team can’t reach out to potential buyers face to face like before,” said Tserruya. “Companies that used conferences to generate leads now need to do it remotely, often while working from home.”</p>
<p>Lusha operates on a freemium model. Free users get limited access to data, while those who pay for subscription packages unlock more features. Lusha’s database lets sales teams search for the contact information of decision makers at companies, but Tserruya stresses it only includes business info, not personal data, for its more than 100 million contacts. Then users give feedback about database entries, improving Lusha’s algorithms and datasets.</p>
<p>The company’s database, search feature and recommendation algorithms are meant to be an improvement over the “spray and pray” approach, where sales and marketing teams call or email as many leads as possible.</p>

<p>“The main challenge for salespeople is that they are actually selling a third or two-thirds of their time on admin or aggregating data, trying to understand who this customer is, how to reach out to them, who the right person to contact is and so on,” Tserruya said. “The lack of data and intelligence wastes time for sales team, so more companies are taking a ‘super-targeted’ sales process, where they know exactly who they need to reach out to and why.” For example, users can filter companies by whether they use Salesforce, where they are located and how many people they employ.</p>
<p>He added this is similar to the marketing shift that happened about a decade ago, when companies switched their focus from billboards and TV commercials to targeted ads on Facebook and Google. For example, if a company is selling CRM software, that means they need to specifically target early-stage companies, because once one chooses a system, it will probably stick with it for years.</p>

<p>“So what kind of triggers or signals can help you reach out to sell the CRM? For example, if the company just hired a VP of sales, or their first salespeople. If they just started to sell something, this is probably the right time to reach out to them,” Tserruya said. “The timing and understanding of a company’s lifecycle is really a game-changer for a lot of B2B SaaS companies today and that’s how we try to help.”</p>
<p>Lusha’s competitors include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZoomInfo</a>, one of the biggest data providers to sales and marketing teams. “I think our main differentiation is that they’re very enterprise-oriented,” said Tserruya. “Another differentiation is the quality of our data, because it constantly gets feedback from users, and also our ease of use, because businesses can start using it without talking to one of Lusha’s sales reps, and expand their membership plans as they grow.”</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, ION Crossover Partners general partner Gili Iohan said, “We have been following Lusha’s progress over the last two years and found the team’s vision and execution highly impressive. As sales teams continue to leverage to drive their go-to-market strategies, Lusha is becoming an integral product for teams to optimize their outreach to improve overall win rates.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has won an appeal against a class action-style privacy litigation at the UK Supreme Court &#8212; avoiding what could have been up to £3BN in damages had it lost the case.</p>
<p>The long-running <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/uk-high-court-blocks-compensation-suit-against-googles-safari-workaround/">litigation</a> was brought by veteran consumer rights campaigner, Richard Lloyd, who, since 2017, has been pursing a collective lawsuit, alleging Google applied a Safari workaround to override iPhone users’ privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser between 2011 and 2012 &#8212; and seeking compensation for the breach for the estimated 4 million+ UK iPhone users affected.</p>
<p>Lloyd&#8217;s litigation had sought damages for privacy harms. More broadly, the suit sought to establish that a representative action could be brought in the UK seeking compensation for data protection violations &#8212; despite the lack of generic class action regime in UK law.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231942" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/uk-high-court-blocks-compensation-suit-against-googles-safari-workaround/">2018</a> the High Court blocked the suit from proceeding &#8212; but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/uk-privacy-class-action-complaint-against-google-gets-unblocked/">following year</a> the Court of Appeal overturned the judgment, allowing the lawsuit to be heard.</p>
<p>However today&#8217;s unanimous Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0213-judgment.pdf">judgment</a> essentially reverts to the High Court&#8217;s view: Blocking the representative action.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Supreme Court justices took the view that damage/loss must be suffered to claim compensation and that the need to prove damage/loss on an individual basis cannot be skipped &#8212; meaning </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">compensation cannot simply be applied uniformly for &#8220;loss of control&#8221; of personal data for each member of the claimed representative class, as the Lloyd litigators had sought. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Without proof of these matters, a claim for damages cannot succeed,&#8221; the Supreme Court writes, summarizing its judgement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ruling is major blow to UK campaigners&#8217; hopes of being able to bring class action-style suits against the tracking industry.</p>
<p>Had Google lost the judgement it would have opened the gate to more representative actions being brought for privacy violations. But with the adtech giant winning the appeal it is likely to put a major chill on UK class action-style suits targeting data-mining tech giants &#8212; which had, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/">in recent years</a>, been attracting commercial litigation funders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oracle and Salesforce hit with GDPR class action lawsuits over cookie tracking consent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/embed/#?secret=FjsF0zCcd6" data-secret="FjsF0zCcd6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Responding to the judgement today, one law firm, <a href="https://www.blmlaw.com/news/lloyd-v-google-court-finds-in-favour-of-google">BLM</a>, wrote that the outcome of the case &#8220;will be cause for celebration for Google and any organisation that handles significant amounts of data or bases its business model on the use of personal data (as well as their shareholders and/or insurers)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another law firm, Linklaters LLP, described the judgement as &#8220;a big blow to claimant law firms and funders who had hoped to create a new opt out regime for damages in the data breach sphere&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would expect a lot of similar claims issued in its wake now to fall away,&#8221; added Linklaters&#8217; Harriet Ellis, dispute resolution partner in a statement. “Claimant firms will be studying the decision carefully to see if there any viable opt-out class actions that can still be brought. But it looks really tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Mishcon de Reya, the law firm representing Lloyd, for comment.</p>
<p>In its own response to the Supreme Court judgement, Google avoided any discussion of the case detail &#8212; writing only:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This claim was related to events that took place a decade ago and that we addressed at the time. People want to know that they are safe and secure online, which is why for years we&#8217;ve focused on building products and infrastructure that respect and protect people&#8217;s privacy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But a spokesperson for the tech giant also pointed to a statement put out by the <a href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/techuk-responds-to-the-judgement-of-the-supreme-court-in-the-appeal-of-richard-lloyd-v-google-llc.html">techUK</a> trade association &#8212; which <span lang="EN-US">had intervened in the case in support of Google; and which writes today that &#8220;had the appeal been rejected, this would have opened the door</span> for speculative and vexatious claims to be made against data controllers, with far-reaching consequences for both public and private organisations&#8221;.</p>
<p>The UK trade association goes on to claim that it &#8220;does not oppose representative legal action, however, we believe it is right that any action must first seek to establish whether damage has been caused to the individual as a result of a data breach before seeking compensation&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, as the Supreme Court justices note &#8212; in discussion of the costs of &#8216;opt in&#8217; (rather than &#8216;opt out&#8217;) litigation regimes &#8212; the bar to accessing justice can simply be pushed out of reach in cases where individual claims are only worth a few hundred pounds apiece (in the Lloyd litigation the suggestion was a sum of £750 per person) because the associated case administration costs of processing individual claimants &#8220;may easily exceed the potential value of the claim&#8221;.</p>
<p>So &#8212; to be clear &#8212; techUK is opposing representative legal actions being brought over almost any data violation.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s data protection watchdog, meanwhile, has shown a complete lack of willingness to enforce the law against the data-mining adtech industry &#8212; despite the ICO warning,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/"> since 2019</a>, of rampantly unlawful tracking.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">UK government is also now consulting on weakening</a> the domestic data protection regime.</p>
<p>So the question of how exactly the average UK citizen can obtain the privacy rights UK law claims wraps their information on paper looks, well, pretty murky right now&#8230;</p>

<p>Rights groups have responded to the Supreme Court judgement by calling for the government to legislate for collective redress.</p>
<p>In a statement the <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/lloyd-vs-google-government-must-provide-mechanism-for-collective-redress/">Open Rights Group</a>&#8216;s executive director, Jim Killock, said: “There must be a way for people to seek redress against massive data breaches, without having to risk their homes, and without relying on the Information Commissioner alone.</p>
<p>“The ICO cannot act in every case, and is sometimes unwilling to do so. We have waited over two years for action against the Adtech industry, which the ICO says is operating unlawfully. There is no sign of action.</p>
<p>“Yet it would be completely unreasonable for someone to risk their home over court fees in cases like this. Without a collective mechanism, that is where we are left: in many cases data protection is very hard to enforce against tech giants.</p>
<p>“The Government should keep its word, and consider implementing collective action under GDPR, which i[t] specifically rejected in February on the grounds that Lloyd vs Google showed that existing rules could provide a path for redress.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global tech talent platform Andela <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/softbank-sinks-200m-into-andela-propels-company-into-unicorn-territory/">attained a $1.5 billion valuation</a> this September and is currently the only non-fintech unicorn from Africa. Foreign capital propelled Andela to this status, however, Africa-focused venture capital firms such as CRE Ventures and TLcom Capital have been critical to the company&#8217;s early success.</p>
<p>Three years after investing in Andela, the latter raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">$71 million fund to invest</a> in other African startups and has done so impressively, leading most of the rounds in which it takes part. Yet, Andela remains its poster child and the firm takes pride in having made the investment years back.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With the talent company&#8217;s unicorn news opening more conversations about the maturity of the African tech ecosystem, founder and managing partner <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/maurizio-caio-1580a97">Maurizio Caio</a>, one of the continent&#8217;s well-respected VC partners, believes that while African tech is minting new unicorns every other month, it is ready to consistently produce high-value exits and IPOs over the next 18 months.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231672" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot chest-beating and happiness in the African ecosystem, not necessarily about the wrong things, but a subset of the right things. We&#8217;re celebrating the amount of money that is invested and the fact that some financing rounds are associated with very high valuations, including unicorn valuations,&#8221; Caio said to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I think that for the long-term health of the ecosystem, we need a little bit to transition the conversation towards making money and on the return; on the fact that what counts is when these companies will eventually be sold or go public. That&#8217;s the valuation that counts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">W</span>hilst recent high-profile investments have been partly driven by the massive liquidity sitting in global capital markets looking for deployment, Caio says the primary driver is the strong business fundamentals achieved by African entrepreneurs transforming large and underserved markets.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He cites a list of markers in a playbook dubbed the &#8220;Exit Readiness Framework&#8221; to back up his thesis. In this interview with TechCrunch, Caio talks about this framework, how African tech is at the </span>start of a completely new era fuelled by structural drivers, building sustainable tech companies, venture capital, unicorns and exits. <i><br />
</i></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the Exit Readiness Framework?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MC:</strong> The general idea which is also the readiness framework says, for us to have a stronger African venture capital industry that sees the long-term goal, we need to attract more capital to Africa. And to do that, we need to make sure that we create value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other fundamental thing that we believe is that return comes from only one source: business fundamentals, which means you have to have great companies operating in great markets. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">should ask ourselves if we are building companies that will be able to attract buyers or attention of capital markets in the form of IPO, or SPAC or whatever because these are companies that have the substantial promise of generating a lot of cash as they win and execute in large and attractive markets.</span></p>
<p><strong>You talk about unicorns being companies executing in large and attractive markets. How does one know these sorts of markets?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, first of all, there is this idea that an attractive market is a large market. But other things make a market an attractive one for venture investment. One is that technology can make a difference, and the other is an industry that structurally has high margins and not a lot of CapEx. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also a feature like the fact that there is consolidation happening by larger companies. From an exit perspective, you know that larger companies are looking for smaller companies to buy. Also, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hen there&#8217;s evidence that other emerging markets have gone through the cycle that Africa is going through now and have attracted a lot of capital. </span></p>
<p><strong>Are there particular industries that come to mind when referring to attractive markets in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is sectors with large consumer markets that are not adequately served today because it doesn&#8217;t make sense economically. So you think about education, some of the fintech segments, health &#8212; these are markets where you don&#8217;t have a lot of companies playing there because they wouldn&#8217;t be able to make money because a lot of demand in Africa is low income. But technology can help you build much lower structures and make it profitable to serve those markets. So that is the first big category &#8212; the big consumer markets where technology can make it profitable to serve. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TLcom Capital closes $71M Africa fund with plans to back 12 startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/embed/#?secret=73ja9BAVRd" data-secret="73ja9BAVRd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s another one, which in our opinion, is even bigger. We call it fixing the broken verticals and these are more B2B with sectors that are entirely fragmented and inefficient. You think of retail, logistics, talent, automotive. They are gigantic markets where you don&#8217;t have to do anything to create demand, there&#8217;s a massive amount of demand, but the experience is horrible for businesses and consumers. So you need to have entrepreneurs with technology who can reinvent and redesign these industries. </span></p>
<p><strong>But I think we&#8217;re seeing more companies trying to solve what people would say are sexy problems than tackling these large underserved markets. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there is nothing that is predefined. Spaces that have not created great companies can become an attractive investment when an entrepreneur interprets and makes them bigger. So, again, I don&#8217;t think that there are sectors that, by definition, which are not attractive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see trivial problems getting funded, I don&#8217;t think we should blame the entrepreneur. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea here is not that we need better entrepreneurs to have a larger ecosystem in Africa; we need better investors. So it&#8217;s on us, not the entrepreneurs. We see fundamentally about 200 to 300 entrepreneurs per quarter, we look at business plans, and we talk to a subset of them, and we invest in an even smaller subset.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders have the right to launch a startup in a sexy place rather than a difficult market &#8212; sometimes some sexy problems have large markets &#8212; but it&#8217;s the responsibility of the investors to channel capital towards the areas that have the best outcome and expectations.</span></p>
<p><strong>As an investor, do you think Africa has reached an inflection point?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes. It was not realistic to think that this inflection point would have happened earlier. You know, it takes an average of 10 years or more to build a great company to a good or great exit. We all can have different views about when African venture capital started, yet it&#8217;s completely expected that the pipeline is now producing companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commanding higher valuation and unicorn exits. There&#8217;s a pipeline of other companies to come, so we are at the beginning of a very natural cycle that will produce more.</span></p>
<p><strong>For all the talk of a growing ecosystem, why have we seen one major IPO and a few significant exits?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The framework that we adopt to assess readiness states that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if a company serving a great market has material revenues and a clear path to profitability, it is ready to be acquired. To qualify for an IPO, though, the bar is much higher; you need high growth, one-year visibility, management governance. If you want to go on an international stock exchange, like Nasdaq, you need to have at least $90 million of revenues and at least $500 million valuation. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/embed/#?secret=pAleWLpTcp" data-secret="pAleWLpTcp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible to look at companies and see whether they are on the way to qualify for this. And that&#8217;s why when we look into the pipeline, we not only see that this framework confirms why Paystack, DPO, Sendwave were acquired or why Jumia and Fawry went public. But you can see going forward, companies that are completely ready for IPO now: Andela, SWVL, Interswitch, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave. And some companies may very soon be ready: Twiga, MFS Africa, Yoco, Kobo360, TeamApt. These are all companies that are getting there and I will not be surprised to see up to 10 IPOs over the next two to three years.</span></p>
<p><strong>Interesting. But don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;s a lot, considering how more mature developing markets like India and Latin America have struggled despite many unicorns?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, we&#8217;re back to the framework, and it&#8217;s not magic. It&#8217;s about how the company is performing. So you ask yourself, is this company operating in a large and attractive market? Yes. Do they have at least $90 million in revenues? Yes. Can they command a valuation of at least $500 million? Yes. They have a great management team and a serious board and visibility in one year. Are they growing fast and can that growth be sustained? Yes. At that point, you are ready. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, it&#8217;s more of a matter of needing the capital strategically because let us not forget that IPO for some of the investors is an exit event, but for the startup and CEO, it is a financing event. So the decision to go public is driven by market conditions and you don&#8217;t want to go when the market is skeptical. You want to go when you can articulate the story to the capital market that makes it attractive for that market to give you capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think that many factors drive the exact timing, but when we talk about the readiness from the standpoint of what the company needs to look like, it&#8217;s possible to assess several companies that can reach those milestones.</span></p>
<p><strong>Still talking about exits, we&#8217;ve only seen a couple of acquisitions made by these unicorns, or soonicorns. Do you think this should change?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really. On average, when public companies announce an acquisition, the stock price goes down because acquisitions are challenging to execute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s perfect if the acquisitions are targeted at making a stronger company achieve a lower cost position and deliver more value to customers. But there are always ways of doing it organically, by developing new products and technology and entering new markets. Acquisitions work as a way of executing your strategy more quickly.</span></p>
<p><strong>How about acquisitions from international companies just like Stripe and Paystack? Is it a play we might often see in the future?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will undoubtedly be more acquisitions on behalf of non-African companies buying African companies, which will become driven by sector and strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will the big tech companies buy African tech companies to develop their presence in Africa? Yes. They will have their organic and inorganic strategy as Africa becomes a more profound place for these companies to be in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also particular players such as international banks, financial services companies, insurance companies or agritech interested in looking at companies they can acquire to serve the African markets. So yes, there will be more of that. </span></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take about foreign money and founders dominating Africa&#8217;s startups and investments?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look at the 10 unicorns or soon to be unicorns, most of them are led by African founders: Yoco, Flutterwave, MFS Africa, Interswitch, SWVL, Kobo360. At the beginning of most tech ecosystems in Africa, it wasn&#8217;t so, but now I think the medium-term picture is that we have African entrepreneurs. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other point is that once again, funds need to be intentional. And they can be an important factor in allocating capital to African investors. When we at TLcom Capital started to think about Africa, Ido and myself, we realised that we were not Africans and got Omobola and Andreata to be part of our team. And as we have hired more people, we&#8217;ve added more Africans. So the way to have more capital in Africa is to have more African venture capitalists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other point is that, quite frankly, if there are great African companies that create employment in Africa that serves an African market that puts Africa on the map, if one of the founders is non-African, that&#8217;s fine in the big scheme of things. Let&#8217;s make sure that we convince capital markets that Africa is a great place to do business. Also, let us attract venture capitalists that don&#8217;t just write a check, get back on the plane and fly away. or hedge funds or private equity people, but African or Africa-focused venture capitalists on the ground that work with the entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><strong>Will it help if big funds like Sequoia, Tiger or SoftBank set up teams in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a critical step and will be very important, but we&#8217;re not there now. These teams are starting to have people devoted to Africa, but yes, they will be better investors when they move people to Africa, which is needed because when </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you think about the big teams writing large checks and sitting in Africa to support companies, it is a very short list. And it should be longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think that there are two axes for that to happen. One is that these Africa-focused teams become bigger or international investors move teams to Africa. For us, the African-based VC teams&#8217; primary role is to discover the companies and help them seed and Series A and get them ready for larger checks. That way, we can involve international funds that are learning about the attractiveness of Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong style="font-weight: 400;">As venture capital records new highs in Africa and across the world, do you see that slowing down on the continent in the next couple of years?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be an amount of investment adjustment. What might happen is a lot of companies dying or fundamentally becoming irrelevant, and that&#8217;s what happens in every venture capital ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that we will see happening is an adjustment in valuations because the high valuations that we&#8217;re seeing now are a small subset of cases driven by the companies&#8217; business fundamentals and a lot of money looking for a place to go. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we might see more reasonable and adjusted valuations from companies when they return to raise capital from less irrational investors, particularly in sectors with a bit of a bubble like fintech.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inspiration wants to help commercial fleets go electric, and it has already started by financing electric mobility company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/revel-launches-an-all-electric-rideshare-service-with-a-fleet-of-50-teslas/">Revel&#8217;s ride-hail fleet of blue Teslas</a>. The startup, which finances electric vehicles and has plans to build, own and operating the corresponding charging infrastructure, came out of stealth on Wednesday with an initial $200 million in capital commitment.</p>
<p>The funding comes from ArcLight Capital Partners, a venture fund that invests in energy infrastructure. Josh Green, founder and CEO of Inspiration, described the funding as a platform company investment, one that allows Inspiration to use that money to invest in infrastructure assets, like vehicles and charging solutions, as well as for general corporate purposes. In other words, it&#8217;s balance sheet capital, and Inspiration is only getting started.</p>
<p>The company, which has been operating on the down low since the end of Q1 this year, is in discussions with several other investors to raise more money needed to continue financing vehicles and other infrastructure-related assets, like energy systems like solar that power charging infrastructures, energy storage systems and real estate, according to Green.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231837" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a finance company, so we will always be raising money from the right sources to lower the cost of capital and be able to offer EVs to wider segments of the population,&#8221; Green told TechCrunch. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Our near term goals are to expand into all light and medium-duty segments and use cases and build the leading EV solutions company in North America. As we do that, we want to be thought of as the go-to partner for fleet companies that want a custom, turnkey EV solution from an aligned partner wholly focused on the same end goal: Delivering maximum economic value from EV fleets while achieving meaningful GHG reductions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Inspiration aims to cater for three types of customers. The first is what the startup refers to as emerging EV fleet operators, venture-backed companies that were born based on an EV fleet. Brooklyn-based Revel, the company that started with dockless e-mopeds and has since expanded to a questionable ride-hail fleet of Teslas and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/revel-unveils-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-superhub-with-25-chargers-in-brooklyn/">an EV charging superhub</a>, falls under this category. Earlier this year, Inspiration helped Revel get 49 EVs for its limited service before New York&#8217;s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) got wind of it and made it clear that a for-hire vehicle, even an electric one, would need a TLC license plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We act as their heavy asset capital partner so that they can use their venture dollars to scale their technology platform customer acquisition and partner with us for the vehicles, charging infrastructure, energy infrastructure, real estate – all the other hard asset components that are quite expensive but necessary for successfully deploying and scaling an EV fleet,&#8221; said Green.</p>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">The second customer segment is traditional fleet operators, like a NYC yellow cab company, that needs help transitioning their otherwise ICE-based fleet to electric.</div>
<p class="yj6qo ajU">&#8220;Basically our goal with those guys is to make deploying an EV fleet as easy and simple as buying another Toyota Camry and throwing the key to the driver,&#8221; said Green. &#8220;For those customers we help them understand which vehicles are the right ones to meet their needs, depending on their daily driving cycle and range and how long the vehicles are stationary. Then we design and implement the charging infrastructure as a system serving those vehicles to ensure business continuity.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Corporate fleets are the final category of customer, and these are typical Fortune 500 companies that give company cars to sales and operations employees. Usually, these types of companies are looking for easy ways to reach corporate emissions goals.</p>
<p>Inspiration aims to provide a bespoke service to customers in all categories. It can provide a full-stack solution, says Green, from financing the vehicles to supplying and running charging infrastructure to working with energy companies to ensure electricity is being used efficiently. Or customers can pick and choose a la carte what services they need.</p>
<p>Green thinks charging infrastructure is an integral part of the business, particularly because installing it at a fleet level can be quite expensive and robust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because fleet charging requires much more power in one location, understanding energy pricing and utility rate structures and how they charge, the right time to both serve the fleet&#8217;s needs but also not get killed on your demand charges, is really important,&#8221; said Green. &#8220;In addition, the calculation on the charging side varies dramatically by location. In New York City, for example, the incentives and rate structures are very different than if you were doing it in New Orleans. So the economic benefit of the EV fleet has to take into account a lot of factors, which change by location, and we do that analysis for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="yj6qo ajU">Green, who had been working in climate and clean energy since 2003, founded the startup after a 14 month honeymoon around the world, a trip that began with ClimateTech burnout and ended with a renewed motivation to contribute to the fight against climate change. After retracing steps he had taken in Patagonia some 20 years ago only to see firsthand how climate change had morphed the once-familiar landscapes, Green came back recommitted to the movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started thinking about where I could really put my shoulder against the wheel again, and EVs kept coming up as this area that has huge potential,&#8221; said Green. &#8220;Transportation is the largest source of U.S. emissions. EVs are now an area where the technology is ready, there are no technology barriers. The state of battery technology means that all these vehicles now have a base range that&#8217;s able to satisfy pretty much every application on the commercial side. So it&#8217;s become really a finance and deployment issue to solve, and those are things that I have a decent idea of how to attack.&#8221;</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It will scale its internal studio to increase content cadence and develop a software development kit (SDK) to open up the Sandbox platform for third-party development, CEO and co-founder Steve Zhao told TechCrunch. He also said that the company plans to build a wireless technology to remove the VR hardware backpack that weighs down the players.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR uses hardware like head-mounted VR headsets, backpack computers, motion capture sensors and haptic vests for players. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“With more stores on the way, we’ll be ramping up our internal studios as well as developing our SDK (software development kit) to open up publishing soon,” Zhao said.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR develops its own games and technology, unlike other competitors that operate with licensed games, Zhao noted. </span>The company offers five VR games: Curse of Davy Jones, Amber Sky 2088, Star Trek Discovery: Away Mission, Deadwood Mansion and Unbound Fighting League (UFL).</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The pandemic broke out right before closing the company&#8217;s planned Series B funding in early 2020, Zhao said. About 80% of its employees had to leave the company, which was forced to file bankruptcy during the COVID crisis, he added. Sandbox VR has emerged from COVID stronger than ever. Its revenue is now up 20x compared to the beginning of this year (after reopening the global offices in April of this year). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The grit and determination exemplified by Steve and his team at the height of the pandemic was more than admirable &#8212; it’s led</span> them to become what we believe to be the strongest, most technologically advanced location-based VR offering available today,” said Andrew Chen, a16z general partner and Sandbox VR board member.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has 35 employees globally as of October, Zhao said. Sandbox VR currently operates 12 retail locations in the U.S., Canada and Asia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The global location-based virtual reality market is projected to reach $26.3 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 32.9% from 2021 to 2028, <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/location-based-virtual-reality-market/#:~:text=Location%2DBased%20Virtual%20Reality%20Market%20size%20was%20valued%20at%20USD,market%20for%20the%20forecast%20period." target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on a report by Verified Market Research</a>. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR started with an idea of how it can create the most immersive experience possible, like things people see in science fiction. The VR is just a component, he said, adding that the company doesn&#8217;t want to limit its business in the VR sector. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With a mission to expand human interaction by using technology, Sandbox VR has an ambition to enter the metaverse industry down the road, which could take about 3-5 years more to get there, according to Zhao. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As we continue to innovate in the VR industry, we’ll move towards the virtualization of our physical spaces. One day, it’ll be like stepping into a portal where players can embody their persistent virtual avatars,” Zhao said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In February, <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://disha.ng/">Disha</a>, a Nigeria-based platform that allows digital creators to curate, sell digital content, create portfolios and receive payments from their audience globally, announced that it was closing shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the news, Disha had bootstrapped to more than 20,000 users; at some point, it claimed to have a monthly growth rate of about 100%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Three days after announcing its shutdown, however, Disha did an about-face and said it was thinking of new options for the company and would share an update once it made a new decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, a Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/sharononyinye_/status/1455475527251369989?s=21">noticed</a> Disha FAQs on Flutterwave’s support documents, suggesting that the unicorn company might have acquired the creator platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Disha’s FAQs have been <a href="https://support.flutterwave.com/en/collections/3195568-disha-faq">removed</a>, Flutterwave confirmed to TechCrunch today that it has indeed bought the two-year-old platform. The terms of the deal are undisclosed; however, some sources say the purchase price is in six figures.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Flutterwave has been rumoured to acquire some startups in the past, this is its first public announcement of any acquisition since launching in 2016 to tackle Africa’s payments problems. And what’s more surprising is that the buy is outside payments or fintech.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disha </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Evans Akanno, Rufus Oyemade and Blessing Abeng in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is one of the well-known platforms built from Africa, including <a href="https://selar.co/">Selar</a> and <a href="https://irawotalents.com/">Irawo</a>, targeting creators and influencers globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Disha provided them with tools to create a one-page site to curate and share links, content, portfolios and a checkout system to receive payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Disha had users globally, its revenues were low, making </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> above $1,000 in monthly recurring revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With little revenues and limited resources, Disha showed signs of struggle; even ex-CEO attested to this in a now-deleted LinkedIn post where he expressed burnout while running Disha and Cregital, a design agency he founded and was CEO, a role he stepped down from in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We [the founders] decided to shut down the company because we ran out of resources to continue driving the very valid vision we had,” ex-CTO Oyemade told TechCrunch in an email. “With Flutterwave, we now have a way to drive both value for creators and revenue to sustain the business. We are happy to have gotten the call from Flutterwave, which actually kept hopes alive.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oyemade will continue to lead the technology behind the product with a new role as software and architectural lead</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akanno and Abeng, the ex-CMO, left the company to pursue other projects.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;African payments company Flutterwave raises $170M, now valued at over $1B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/embed/#?secret=u9g3CpoCni" data-secret="u9g3CpoCni" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave says Disha will continue to be an independent product with a distinct brand and operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From now on, it wants to focus on features and integrations that help creators </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> schedule meetings and exhibitions, build sustainable income through subscriptions and leverage emerging technologies in the creator space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did Flutterwave make this acquisition? Certainly, it will bolster Disha’s payments checkout process and grow the platform’s base by allowing users to make transactions in over 150 currencies and 34 countries worldwide. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Flutterwave wants to take part in the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-famga-creator-economy/">$100 billion global creator economy</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has created an opportunity for millions of freelancers and creators to use no-code tools to monetize their craft and community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recently, we have diversified into building tools that will help freelancers, businesses and now creators grow,” Flutterwave CEO Olugbengba “GB” Agboola said in an email. “We saw Disha as an opportunity to capture a new market of indie creators that need innovative tools to showcase their craft and get paid. This acquisition cements our place as a growth partner for freelancers and businesses. For us, Flutterwave Store is to small businesses what Disha is to creators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is an increasing appetite to create, own, sell or share digital experiences such as NFTs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With most of Disha’s customers based in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe, it is well-positioned to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions around owning and selling these digital experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave knows that, and via this acquisition, the fintech is betting that Disha is its ticket to eat at that growing NFT table, where more than $10 billion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nft-sales-surge-107-bln-q3-crypto-asset-frenzy-hits-new-highs-2021-10-04/">spent</a></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Q3 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Disha is a global tool and the global creator economy is enormous, and with NFTs growing in popularity, there’s no limit to how huge the creator economy can grow,” GB said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market for complementary and alternative medicine &#8212; a wide-ranging area that includes practice-based work like yoga as well as a huge range of supplements and everything in between &#8212; has been on a massive upswing , with the global industry valued at <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/complementary-alternative-medicine-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$82.3 billion in 2020</a> and growing at a fast clip in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Now, a company called <a href="https://fullscript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fullscript</a>, which has built a wholesale backend and storefront builder to power the supplements businesses of alternative health practitioners providing these services, is getting a big infusion of cash to meet the opportunity. The Ottawa, Canada-based company has raised $240 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its business across North America, and developing more tools to serve its customers: practitioners building complementary and integrative treatment plans (bringing together both traditional and modern approaches) for their patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe integrated medicine will be medicine in the future,&#8221; Fullscript co-founder and CEO Kyle Braatz said in an interview. &#8220;Sixty percent practitioners are already focusing on wellness and prevention. It&#8217;s more than just pharmaceuticals, and patients are doing more than just popping a pill.&#8221; The company today offers a stock of some 20,000 products from some 300 brands.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231940" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The investment is coming from HGGC and Snapdragon Capital Partners &#8212; respectively a mid-market firm more known for private equity investments and a firm that invests in primarily health and wellness businesses. Fullscript&#8217;s valuation is not being disclosed, but for some context, the company has been around since 2012 and had only raised about $25 million previously, growing largely by being bootstrapped. And one reason that it will have come to investors&#8217; attention now is its financial track record on its own steam: it&#8217;s going to make $300 million in revenue this coming fiscal year, growing from a mere $40 million five years ago.</p>
<p>Fullscript is based in the same city as Shopify, and Braatz likened a little of what his company does in its own B2B2C model to what Shopify has achieved in the world of e-commerce.</p>
<p>Just as the latter has provided an easy way for companies selling online to build and operate their own web-based storefronts (a business that has been huge, and seen Shopify extending into a lot of adjacent areas as a result), Fullscript is addressing the needs of practitioners online.</p>
<p>Among Fullscript&#8217;s services, it helps them source supplements; set up and fulfill prescriptions for those treatments from Fullscript&#8217;s dispensary, either to pick up in their offices or have delivered to their homes; manage their patients&#8217; bigger treatment plans through an integrated approach that brings data from these treatments into a patient&#8217;s wider electronic health records; and provide supplementary reading and other educational materials about the supplements that are being dispensed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Just as Shopify empowers merchants, we empower practitioners,&#8221; Braatz said. And just as Shopify has brought a number of different tools online for its merchant customers to build out their businesses on the Shopify platform, so too is Fullscript developing more technology to grow its proposition. That will include more analytics for its customers, more tools for patients to monitor their own progress and purchases, and so on.</p>
<p>Fullscript&#8217;s rise comes amid a much bigger push for online health services, and specifically those geared at selling medicines and supplements. That means more potential competition from Amazons of this world (Amazon being already a <a href="https://gritdaily.com/why-amazon-is-king-of-the-supplements-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major destination for vitamins and other supplements</a>), and more attention being paid to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others like Ro</a> trying to make headway in this space. But also a greater acceptance and understanding that the online component of this business is here to stay.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all smooth sailing. Complementary therapies have been a mixed bag when it comes to general acceptance and usage of them.</p>
<p>On one side, consumers, and a widening pool of traditional and modern practitioners are increasingly looking at these alongside the pharmaceutical approach. But on the other, there are a few reason why that hasn&#8217;t been more mainstream. For starters, insurance companies do not always provide coverage for these treatments as they do for the more standard medical treatments. One of the reasons for this is that, for better or worse, pharmaceutical approaches are trialled, tested, approved by regulators and generally entered into a realm of acceptance that makes it more likely that an insurance company (or practitioner) will opt for those treatments. The same has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not been the case for supplementary medicines</a>, not least because some of the effects might be harder to quantify. And partly because of that, or even from direct experience, there are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51312441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of reputable skeptics</a> when it comes to those effects.</p>
<p>Insurance is not part of the backend for the moment for Fullscript, and all of the payments for products are made by patients directly themselves.</p>
<p>In the defense of integrative approaches, however, there are plenty of reasons why consumers and the medical industry might also criticize the pharmaceutical approach, too (not least because it&#8217;s not 100% foolproof, the costs, the side effects and so on). Indeed, Braatz noted that attitudes towards integrative approaches are gradually starting to change, not least because of the many reasons that conventional approaches do not work perfectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the whole integrative market is just starting to leverage insurance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Practitioners starting to be compensated because compensation is evolving from volume to value-based. And we see hospital systems starting to build and acquire integrative clinics to keep patients out of hospital systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evolution, in effect, is as much a part of the investment strategy here as the current business is.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are long term believers in the Fullscript story, and we thought that its platform, the tech they developed, and the reviews of that we&#8217;ve seen of it from the industry, would be an exciting investment. There is a ton of potential,&#8221; said Bill Conrad of HGGC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investor interest in African fintech continues to grab headlines with large fundraises. Today, Africa’s largest digital payments network <a href="https://mfsafrica.com/">MFS Africa</a> joins the fray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised $100 million in Series C financing — split between $70 million equity and $30 million debt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private equity fund <a href="https://www.africinvest.com/news-and-media/news/africinvest-s-permanent-vehicle-five-achieves-its-fourth-close-bringing-afdb-as-investor/">AfricInvest FIVE</a> co-led the Series C round with existing investors Goodwell Investments and LUN Partners Group.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors CommerzVentures, Allan Gray Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest also joined the round</span>, while ShoreCap III returned as an existing investor with other funds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement is the icing on the cake for the company, which has made several significant acquisitions and investments in the last couple of years rarely matched by any fintech on the continent.</span></p>
<p>In a call with TechCrunch, founder and CEO <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dare-okoudjou">Dare Okoudjou</a> was quick to highlight MFS Africa’s mission on the continent: to make it easy for Africans to send and receive money just as they do with calls.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For someone who spent more than a decade in the telecoms as an engineer and executive, Okoudjou has been around long enough to know how difficult it was to make a phone call in Africa. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though calls are still expensive in Africa when compared to the rest of the world, the process of making them has become pretty simple thanks to mobile phone penetration and advancement in telecommunications. With MFS Africa, Okoudjou envisions the same for payments on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way we take for granted the fact that we can communicate with anybody around the world via a mobile phone, my dream is that it should be the same with a mobile wallet,” CEO Okoudjou told TechCrunch during an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you sign to any mobile wallet somewhere in the world, starting with Africa, it should be enough to transact with anybody else in the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the grand mission of the company.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started the company in 2009, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions from Kenya to Zambia, Uganda, Zimbabwe and the Ivory Coast, and vice versa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s the company continued to grow, it became </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the product had use cases for small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, at the time, more than half of its users in East Africa reported using the platform for business reasons, according to Okoudjou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, by merging fragmented and disparate payment schemes across the continent into one seamless network the same telecom networks operate, MFS Africa became the go-to platform for individuals and businesses to transact across borders and currencies.</span></p>
<h2>MFS has made a series of acquisitions and investments this past year</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based company connects more than 320 million mobile money wallets across 35+ African countries and 700 corridors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also covers a broad range of financial services around bank accounts, prepaid cards and virtual debit cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a presence in Africa’s largest market, Nigeria, remained elusive for the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hat changed last month when <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/10/20/mfs-africa-acquires-baxi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it acquired Baxi</a>, an agent banking platform developed by Capricorn Digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria is quite different from the typical MFS market, where mobile money agents run the show</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the West African country, agent banking networks are more prominent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because they offer a similar range of services in digitizing cash like mobile money agents in East Africa, it made sense for MFS to acquire Capricorn and have access to its more than 90,000 agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does the acquisition give MFS Africa an entry into the Nigerian market, but it also opens the company to a sophisticated agent network unseen in other African markets, said Okoudjou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile money agents are primarily helpful in providing customers with cash deposits and withdrawals whereas agent network platforms like Capricorn, via its Baxi boxes, provide underbanked and unbanked Nigerians with access to transfers, withdrawals, airtime purchases, utility bill payments, pay-TV and data subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Agent networks are the most digitalized segment of SMEs already on the continent because very often they have other businesses selling other things. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are plugged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the economy and the fabric of society,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So if you’re thinking about bringing digital payment and digital at large to SMEs in Africa, this is a pretty good place to start</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again that what’s happening in Nigeria may end up being the blueprint for the rest of the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Baxi acquisition is completed, pending approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Okoudjou says a customer can walk to a Baxi agent and make cross-border payments to Benin, Cameroon or China, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitating payments from Africa to China falls outside the purview of MFS Africa’s holistic pan-African payments approach. However, it’s an opportunity too good to ignore: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China-Africa bilateral trade is one of the fastest-growing corridors globally, with a value <a href="http://www.sais-cari.org/data-china-africa-trade">topping $192 billion</a> in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okoudjou says the company began considering the corridor when it kickstarted the acquisition of Beyonic, a Ugandan digital payments provider for small and medium-sized businesses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Johannesburg-based company had surveyed these businesses to understand their needs better and found out the most pressing issue they faced, asides from accessing loans, was sending and receiving payments to and from China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa is currently working on setting interoperability between payment networks in the Asian country and Africa, starting from Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">before spreading to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The timeline for rollout might be next year, according to some sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, MFS Africa </span><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1873964/mobile-money-giant-mfs-africa-acquires-beyonic-for-enterprise-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1873964/mobile-money-giant-mfs-africa-acquires-beyonic-for-enterprise-solutions/"> acquired Beyonic</a>; with Baxi, the company has made two consecutive acquisitions in the space of a year and some months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And coupled with minority stakes in smaller fintechs such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/ivorian-fintech-julaya-raises-2m-to-digitize-business-payments-in-francophone-africa/">Julaya</a>, Maviance and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/">Numida</a>; health insurance product Inclusivity and agritech platform Akorion, MFS Africa has done a decent job using investment and acquisitions — methods Okoudjou terms “inorganic growth” — to exert its influence across the continent.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MFS Africa leads $2.3M seed round in Ugandan fintech startup Numida&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/embed/#?secret=2nKojlgC7M" data-secret="2nKojlgC7M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, MFS Africa raised its Series B and closed at $23 million after some extensions. With this Series C round, its total equity raise is over $95 million while debt stands at $30 million (the company is raising debt for the first time). Emerging markets lender <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/emerging-markets-lender-lendable-seeks-100m-to-fund-fintech-companies/">Lendable</a> and Norsad provided the debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debt presents an opportunity for many founders and startups to have cheaper funding because they do not have to give out equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In MFS Africa’s case, it raised debt financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to finance the floats needed for real-time settlements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If someone is sending money from Kenya to Uganda in less than a minute, someone needs to be out of pocket. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We manage that across all these countries across all these partners, and you need a little bit of oil to grease the system,” said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized we don’t need to raise equity since there is a debt market for that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s one of the reasons we looked at debt and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again, as the ecosystem matures, more companies will also do a combination of debt and equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa intends to use the new investment in several ways. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it wants to double down on its expansion efforts and add more regional offices across the continent and in the U.S. and China</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It recently opened new offices in Abidjan, Kampala, Kinshasa, Nairobi and Lagos while moving its headquarters from Mauritius to London.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 12-year-old company has also earmarked some funding to strengthen its Governance, Risks and Compliance (GRC) functions and treasury and liquidity pool. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to hire more talent within and outside the continent and continue investing in other African tech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/juliustichelaar">Julius Tichelaar</a>, a partner at AfricInvest FIVE, said his firm led the round because MFS Africa’s broad range of financial and payments services resonates with AfricInvest FIVE’s financial inclusion strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cross border payments remain an important challenge in many African markets today and MFS Africa is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniquely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positioned to confront this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to join MFS Africa’s world-class management team on its mission and to support its growth journey,” he concluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
