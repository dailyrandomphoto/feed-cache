										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new wave of apps have democratized the concept of investing, bringing the concept of trading stocks and currencies to a wider pool of users who can use these platforms to make incremental, or much larger, bets in the hopes of growing their money at a time when interest rates are low. In the latest development, <a href="https://getbux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bux</a> &#8212; a startup form Amsterdam that lets people invest in shares and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) without paying commissions (its <a href="https://getbux.com/zero-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing</a> is based on flat €1 fees for certain services, no fees for others) &#8212; has picked up some investment of its own, a $80 million round that it.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the company is announcing a new CEO. Founder Nick Bortot is stepping away and Yorick Naeff, an early employee of the company who had been the COO, is taking over. Bortot will remain a shareholder and involved with the company, which will be using to expand its geographical footprint and expand its tech platform and services to users, said Naeff in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we started, Bux has been trying to make investments affordable and intuitive, and that will still be the case,&#8221; he said. The average age of a Bux customer is 30, so while affordable and intuitive are definitely priorities to capture younger users, it also means that if Bux can earn their loyalty and show positive returns, they have the potential to keep them for a long time to come.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming from an interesting group of investors. Jointly led by Prosus Ventures and Tencent (in which Prosus, the tech division of Naspers, is a major investor), it also included ABN Amro Ventures, Citius, Optiver, and Endeit Capital &#8212; all new investors &#8212; as well as previous backers HV Capital and Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures.</p>
<p>Naeff said in an interview that Bux isn&#8217;t disclosing its valuation with this round. But for some context, he confirmed that the startup has around 500,000 customers across the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, France and Belgium, using not just its main Bux Zero app, but also Bux Crypto and Bux X (a contracts for difference (CFDs) app).</p>
<p>Crypto remains a niche but extremely active part of the wider investment market and Naeff described Bux Crypo &#8212; formed out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/bux-acquires-blockport/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bux acquiring Blockport last year</a> &#8212; as &#8220;very profitable.&#8221; The company had only raised about $35 million before this round, and it&#8217;s been around since 2014, so while he wouldn&#8217;t comment on wider profitability, you can draw some conclusions from that.</p>
<p>For some further valuation context, another big player in trading in Europe, eToro,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in March</a> announced it was going public by way of a SPAC valuing it at $10 billion. (Note: eToro is significantly bigger, adding 5 million users last year alone.)</p>
<p>Others in the wider competitive landscape include Robinhood out of the US, which had plans but appeared to have stalled in its entry into Europe; Trade Republic out of Germany, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/trade-republic-a-german-robinhood-raises-67m-led-by-accel-and-founders-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $67 million a year ago</a> from the likes of Accel and Founders Fund; and Revolut, which has been running a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/revolut-launches-stock-trading-in-limited-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading app for some time</a>.</p>
<p>The opportunity that Bux is targeting is a very simple one: technology, and specifically innovations in banking and apps, have opened the door to making it significantly easier for the average consumer to engage in a new set of financial services.</p>
<p>At the same time, some of the more traditional ways of &#8220;growing&#8221; one&#8217;s capital, by way of buying and selling property or opening savings accounts, are not as strong these days as they were in the past, with the housing market being too expensive to enter for younger people, and interest rates very low, leading those consumers to considering other options open to them. Social media is also playing a major role here, opening up conversations around investing that have been traditionally run between professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>“We’re looking for industries that solve big societal needs and fintech continues to be one of them,&#8221; said Sandeep Bakshi, who heads up investments for Prosus in Europe, in an interview. &#8220;Interest rates being what they are, there are no opportunities for individuals to save and that represents a massive opportunity, and we’re happy to partner and be a part of the journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although there is a wave of so-called neo-brokers in the market today, Bux&#8217;s unique selling point, Naeff said, is the company&#8217;s tech stack.</p>
<p>In comparison to others providing trading apps, he said Bux is the first and only one of them to have built a full-stack system of its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not on top of existing broker, which makes it a nimble and modular,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is especially critical because fintech is a game of scale, but every market is completely different when you consider tax, payment systems and the ID documents that one needs in order to fill KYC requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that is before you consider that doing business in Europe means doing business in a number of different languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our system is here to scale across Europe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The fact that we are live in five countries, and the only neo-broker doing that, shows that this modular system is working.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the scaling opportunity is one of the reasons why China&#8217;s tech giant Tencent, owner of WeChat and a vast gaming empire, has come on board.</p>
<p>“We are excited about backing BUX as they are the leading neo-broker in Europe and have been able to build a platform that is sustainable and scalable. BUX is the only neo-broker in Europe that offers zero commission investing without being dependent on kickbacks or payments for order flow. This ensures that its interests are fully aligned with its customers. We will support BUX in its journey of pursuing consistent growth for the years to come”, said Alex Leung, Assistant GM at Tencent, Strategic Development, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johannesburg-based investment company <a href="https://www.foundersfactory.africa/">Founders Factory Africa</a> (FFA) today announced a partnership with <a href="https://smallfoundation.ie/">Small Foundation</a> that will see it select 18 agritech startups for an acceleration and incubation program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Foundation is a Dublin-based philanthropic organization that focuses on the rural and agriculture sector in sub-Saharan Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this partnership, Small Foundation is making an undisclosed investment in FFA to build and scale agritech startups on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The partnership stands to make a significant impact across the continent by supporting agritech startups who can innovate and improve the delivery of a range of services to smallholder farmers and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the agricultural sector,&#8221; an excerpt in a statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the South African-based venture development and investment company founded by <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/roorogers">Roo Rogers</a> and <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alinatruhina">Alina Truhina</a>, early-stage founders will need to apply to join the Founders Factory Africa Venture Scale or Venture Build portfolios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These startups will have access to funding between $100,000 to $250,000 and hands-on technical support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a change from when the company launched in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FFA is an extension of the Founders Factory organisation that has invested in more than 130 companies globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, FFA launched its <a href="https://digestafrica.com/founders-factory-africa">first vertical in fintech</a> when it partnered with the continent&#8217;s largest bank, Standard Bank, to invest in fintech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of the startups include Bwala, LipaLater, MVXchange and OkHi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following year, it took on a second investor in South African healthcare company Netcare Group and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/founders-factory-africa-and-netcare-to-fund-35-health-tech-startups/">via the partnership</a>, invested in health-tech startups like RxAll, Redbird and Wellahealth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zrtlRWwmta"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/founders-factory-africa-and-netcare-to-fund-35-health-tech-startups/">Founders Factory Africa and Netcare to fund 35 health-tech startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Founders Factory Africa and Netcare to fund 35 health-tech startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/founders-factory-africa-and-netcare-to-fund-35-health-tech-startups/embed/#?secret=zrtlRWwmta" data-secret="zrtlRWwmta" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year when we reported this partnership, startups in FFA&#8217;s Venture Scale accelerator program received a £30,000 cash investment and £220,000 in support services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those in the Venture Build program received £60,000 cash and £100,000 toward support.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this third partnership, Truhina says FFA will be investing a total of $300,000 in cash and hands-on support for companies in its Venture Scale program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, startups in Venture Build will be receiving up to $250,000 in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Venture Scale program involves providing support for existing startups operating in seed to pre-Series A stages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other hand,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Venture Build program is for founders wanting to launch a startup in Africa, who may or may not have a concept or an idea</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, there are 23 companies across FFA&#8217;s Scale and Build portfolios. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These startups, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised more than $7 million during and after the program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Truhina says FFA plans to increase this number to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 90 startups in total by 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will build, scale and invest in 88 startups with current FFA investors (Standard Bank, Netcare and Small Foundation) until 2024</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We plan to continue to take on new investors and continue to work on the continent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indefinitely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While FFA is dedicating a fund for agritech startups, it has invested in other startups with agritech solutions for instance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nigeria&#8217;s Foodlocker. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company forecasts foodstuff demand through machine learning and helps buyers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">procure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goods from smallholder farmers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But despite this proposition, FFA classifies the startup as a fintech investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Foodlocker was a company we selected and invested in under our Fintech portfolio, as the startup has a financial component</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With Small Foundation, we are setting up a new dedicated agritech sector,&#8221; said Truhina. Small Foundation joins </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Bank and Netcare in the peculiarity of assistance offered to FFA portfolio startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From sector expertise and footprint across the continent to access to clients, POCs and pilots, these investors are trying to fill in the gap in sectors ripe for exponential growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But though fintech has caught on well with both local and international investors, the same cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for health tech and agritech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">Briter Bridges</a>, fintech accounted for 31% of the total $1.3 billion raised by African startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Health-tech startups accounted for 9%, while agritech startups represented </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 7%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Foundation wants to improve this number in its own little way, and concurrently has a plan to &#8220;end extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conor Brosnan, the CEO and chair of the foundation, holds that tackling the sector&#8217;s biggest issues with the FFA will bring the company toward achieving this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">objective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a pivotal time to invest in the growing area of agritech in Africa, which has transformative potential for local livelihoods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see FFA’s highly skilled teamwork with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immensely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talented African entrepreneurs to deliver scaled solutions to some of the biggest challenges faced by the sector,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In three years, Founders Factory Africa has managed to enlist the services and finances of three influential partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, it has 55 more startups to invest in before 2024, so we should expect an increased investment activity and more partnerships to fund startups in other sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also has fresh capital in the works for its portfolio companies as it advances, though. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the process of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raising a $35 million &#8220;Africa Seed Fund&#8221; which will exist alongside FFA and execute follow-on capital in some portfolio companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earth imaging is an increasingly crowded space, but Satellite Vu is taking a different approach by focusing on infrared and heat emissions, which are crucial for industry and climate change monitoring. Fresh from TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield, the company has raised a £3.6M ($5M) seed round and is on its way to launching its first satellite in 2022.</p>
<p>The nuts and bolts of Satellite Vu&#8217;s tech and master plan are described in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/satellite-vu-aims-to-scope-out-the-whole-globe-with-thermal-vision/">our original profile of the company</a>, but the gist is this: while companies like Planet have made near-real-time views of the Earth&#8217;s surface into a thriving business, other niches are relatively unexplored — like thermal imaging.</p>
<p>The heat coming off a building, geological feature, or even a crowd of people is an enormously interesting data point. It can tell you whether an office building or warehouse is in use or empty, and whether it&#8217;s heated or cooled, and how efficient that process is. It can find warmer or cooler areas that suggest underground water, power lines, or other heat-affecting objects. It could even make a fair guess at how many people attended a concert, or perhaps an inauguration. And of course it works at night.</p>

<p>Pollution and other emissions are also easily spotted and tracked, making infrared observation of the planet an important part of any plan to monitor industry in the context of climate change. That&#8217;s what attracted Satellite Vu&#8217;s first big piece of cash, a grant from the U.K. government for £1.4M, part of a £500M infrastructure fund.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Anthony Baker said that they began construction of their first satellite with that money, &#8220;so we knew we got our sums right,&#8221; he said, then began the process of closing additional capital.</p>
<p>Seraphim Capital, a space-focused VC firm whose most relevant venture is probably synthetic aperture satellite startup Iceye, matched the grant funds, and with subsequent grant the total money raised is in excess of the $5M target (the extra is set aside in a convertible note).</p>

<p>&#8220;What attracted us to Satellite Vu is several things. We published some research about this last year: there are more than 180 companies with plans to launch smallsat constellations,&#8221; said Seraphim managing partner James Bruegger. But very few, they noted, were looking at the infrared or thermal space. &#8220;That intrigued us, because we always thought infrared had a lot of potential. And we already knew Anthony and Satellite Vu from having put them through our space accelerator in 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;re going to need every penny. Though the satellites themselves are looking to be remarkably cheap, as satellites go — $14-15M all told — and only seven will be needed to provide global coverage, that still adds up to over $100M over the next couple years.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2046029" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2046029" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2046029" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg" alt="Simulated image of a Satellite Vu imaging satellite." width="1024" height="662" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=1536,993 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=2048,1324 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2046029" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Satellite Vu</p></div></p>
<p>Seraphim isn&#8217;t daunted, however: &#8220;As a specialist space investor, we understand the value of patience,&#8221; said Bruegger. Satellite Vu, he added, is a &#8220;poster child&#8221; for their approach, which is to shuttle early stage companies through their accelerator and then support them to an exit.</p>
<p>It helps that Baker has lined up about as much potential income from interested customers as they&#8217;ll need to finance the whole thing, soup to nuts. &#8220;Commercial traction has improved since we last spoke,&#8221; said Baker, which was just before he presented at TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt 2020 Startup Battlefield:</p>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="5f5fc40cd7e1932b282f5d0f" post-id="2046133"></div> </p>
<p>The company now has 26 letters of intent and other leads that amount to, in his estimation, about a hundred million dollars worth of business — if he can provide the services they&#8217;re asking for, of course. To that end the company has been flying its future orbital cameras on ordinary planes and modifying the output to resemble what they expect from the satellite network.</p>
<p>Companies interested in the latter can buy into the former for now, and the transition to the &#8220;real&#8221; product should be relatively painless. It also helps create a pipeline on Satellite Vu&#8217;s side, so there&#8217;s no need for a test satellite and service.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141994" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141994" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141994" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg" alt="An aerial image side by side with a thermal image of the same area." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141994" class="wp-caption-text">Another example of the simulated satellite imagery &#8211; same camera as will be in orbit, but degraded to resemble shots from that far up.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We call it pseudo-satellite data — it&#8217;s almost a minimum viable product.We work with the companies about the formats and stuff they need,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;The next stage is, we&#8217;re planning on taking a whole city, like Glasgow, and mapping the whole city in thermal. We think there will be many parties interested in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>With investment, tentative income, and potential customers lining up, Satellite Vu seems poised to make a splash, though its operations and launches are small compared with those of Planet, Starlink, and very soon Amazon&#8217;s Kuiper. After the first launch, tentatively scheduled for 2022, Baker said the company would only need two more to put the remaining six satellites in orbit, three at a time on a rideshare launch vehicle.</p>
<p>Before that, though, we can expect further fundraising, perhaps as soon as a few months from now — after all, however thrifty the company is, tens of millions in cash will still be needed to get off the ground.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand access to electric mopeds &#8212; the small, motorised scooters that you sit on, not kick &#8212; has been a small but persistent part of the multi-modal transportation mix on offer to people in cities these days. Today, a startup out of The Netherlands is announcing some funding with ambitions to make e-mopeds more mainstream, and to expand into a wider set of vehicle options.</p>
<p><a href="https://nl.go-sharing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Sharing</a>, which has a fleet of around 5,000 e-mopeds across in 30 cities in three countries &#8212; The Netherlands, Belgium and Austria &#8212; has picked up €50 million (around $60 million). The startup, based near Utrecht, plans to use the funding to expand its footprint for e-mopeds; add electric cars and e-bikes to its app; and continue building out the technology underpinning it all.</p>
<p>Go Sharing believes tech will be the answer to creating a profitable operation, using AI algorithms to optimize locations for e-mopeds, encouraging people to drop off in those locations with incentives like discounts, and keeping that network charged.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Germany, the UK and Turkey are next on Go Sharing&#8217;s list of countries, the company said.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Opportunity Partners &#8212; a firm based out of Amsterdam that also backs online supermarket <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/amsterdams-crisp-an-online-only-supermarket-raises-e30m-series-b-led-by-target-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crisp</a>, with the startup&#8217;s founders &#8212; CEO Raymon Pouwels, Doeke Boersma, and Donny van den Oever &#8212; also participating. A previous round of about $12 million came from Rabo Corporate Investments, the VC arm of the banking giant.</p>
<p>In a world where we now have many choices for getting around cities &#8212; taxis, public transport, push and electric bikes, scooters, walking, carpools, car rentals or our own cars &#8212; e-mopeds occupy an interesting niche in the mix.</p>
<p>They can be faster than bikes and scooters &#8212; 25 km per hour is a typical speed limit in cities, 40 km per hour in less dense areas &#8212; more agile than cars, completely quiet compared to their very noisy fuel-based cousins, and of course much more eco-friendly. For those managing fleets, they less likely to break down and need replacing than some of the other alternatives like e-bikes and e-scooters.</p>
<p>But they also represent a higher barrier to entry for picking up customers: riders need a license to operate them as you would other moving vehicles, and in some (but not all) places they need to wear helmets; and the operators of fleets need to sort out how required insurance will work and need special permits as a vehicle provider in most places, and they can also face the same issue as other vehicles like bikes and kick scooters of being a <a href="https://eindhovennews.com/news/2020/08/green-go-sharing-scooters-causing-parking-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public nuisance when parked</a>.</p>
<p>That mix of challenges &#8212; and the fact that fleets can be expensive to operate and might even if all the boxes are ticked still not attract enough users &#8212; has meant that the e-moped market has been a patchy one, with some startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/coup-shuts-down-its-electric-moped-scooter-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutting down</a>, some cancelling cities after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/revel-pulls-electric-mopeds-after-failing-to-make-a-dent-in-austins-car-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low demand</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/electric-moped-startup-revel-returns-to-new-york-with-helmet-selfie-other-in-app-safety-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retreating over and then returning</a> with better safety measures.</p>
<p>Yet with on-demand transport companies increasingly looking to provide &#8220;any&#8221; mode in their multi-modal plays to capture more consumers at more times, they remain a class of vehicle that the bigger players and newer entrants will continue to entertain. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/lime-adds-shared-electric-mopeds-to-the-mix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lime earlier this year</a> said it was adding e-mopeds to its fleet in certain cities. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/uber-integrates-electric-moped-service-cityscoot-in-paris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uber teamed up with Cityscoot</a> in Paris to integrate the e-moped&#8217;s fleet into its app. Cityscoot itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/cityscoot-raises-another-25-6-million-for-its-electric-moped-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised some funding last year</a> and is active in several cities across Europe.</p>
<p>And while it can be work to get permits and other regulatory aspects in place to operate services, Pouwels said that Go Sharing was finding that many municipalities actually liked the idea of bringing in more e-mopeds as an eco-friendly alternative to more vehicles &#8212; the idea being to provide a transport option to people who are not interested in kick-scooters or bikes and might have driven their own cars, meaning they already have licenses.</p>
<p>The eco-friendly option is also motivating how the company is planning out other parts of its strategy:</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have heard from regulators is that they want to motivate people to walk or move in other ways, for example with bicycles,&#8221; Pouwels said in an interview. &#8220;What we’ve seen with kick scooters is that they &#8216;deactivate&#8217; people. This is why we see bikes [not adding e-scooters] as the healthy way of moving forward.&#8221; The plan with adding electric cars, he said, is to address the needs of people to travel longer distances than shorter inner-city journeys.</p>
<p>Handling supply for its services is coming by way of <a href="https://www.greenmo.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GreenMo</a>, a sister operation run by Boersma that has been procuring and running a rental service of e-mopeds that are used by drivers for delivery services, with some 10,000 bikes already used this way. GreenMo recently acquired Dutch startup e-bike and a took a majority stake in Belgian company zZoomer, to expand its fleet.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["With the COVID-19 pandemic, it's easier to land remote jobs and stay in Zagreb, which will positively impact the Croatian startup ecosystem."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups may not spring to mind when speaking about the beautiful country of Croatia. Indeed, the country is most popular as a tourist destination, and given that tourism accounted for <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/e1fa2868-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/e1fa2868-en">about 20% of its GDP in 2018</a>, to an extent, its pre-pandemic focus was mostly on growing its share of the international tourism market.</p>
<p>But Croatia&#8217;s entrepreneurs haven&#8217;t been quiet: Startups like <a href="http://Infobip.com">Infobip</a> and <a href="http://Rimac.com">Rimac</a> are significant local hero businesses now, and the region can boast of high-quality talent in the tech, automotive, manufacturing, and agtech spaces. With only two venture capital firms operating in the capital of Zagreb, the startup scene is still young, but the country&#8217;s relatively recent EU membership has given it access to a growing set of direct investment instruments.</p>
<p>The current tax framework on capital gains tax (zero if you hold the shares for more than two years) and a new &#8216;digital nomad&#8217; visa are helping to attract investors and talent to the city, which is also close to some of the best beaches in the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Access to fresh, outside capital is always a catalyst for growth, so to get an inside look at Zagreb&#8217;s fast-growing startup ecosystem, we spoke with nine local founders, investors and C-level executives.</p>
<p>According to the respondents, Zagreb&#8217;s strongest tech areas include HR solutions, automotive, fintech, mobile gaming, IoT, insurtech, and AI. The city&#8217;s angel investor scene isn&#8217;t very strong yet, but that could be attributed to the ecosystem&#8217;s youth.</p>

<hr />
<p>The city has an excellent work-life balance, and most of the talent wants to stay there. &#8220;Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it&#8217;s easier to land remote jobs and stay in Zagreb, which will positively impact our ecosystem,&#8221; one of the investors said.</p>
<p>However, with competition heating up, startups looking for larger, serious investment will probably have to look beyond the country&#8217;s borders while trying to retain their engineering talent. Luckily, an increasing number of international investors are looking at Zagreb for their deal flow pipeline.</p>
<p>Some top Croatian startups include: Agrivi, Amodo, Ascalia, Bellabeat, Cognism, Degordian, Dok-Ing, Infobip, Mindsmiths, OptimoRoute, Oradian, Photomath, Repsly, ReversingLabs, ScoreAlarm, Sportening and AdScanner.</p>

<h2>Lucija Ilicic, CEO, PlatePay</h2>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Photomath, Sportening, and Mindsmiths.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Mostly revenue-oriented.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
People would choose to live and move here during the pandemic. Some of them did, especially having in mind that Croatia now has the digital nomad visa.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Investors: Fil Rouge Capital, Feelsgood, Zicer, Bird Incubator; Founders: Ivan Klarić, Damir Sabol, Mislav Malenica, Mate Riimac</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
The Croatian startup ecosystem really grew during last year and has huge potential. I see it as a perfect place for digital nomads, home of a few new unicorns and a European center for AI solutions development.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
Sportening, Mindsmiths, and of course, PlatePay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Julien Coustaury, partner, Fil Rouge Capital</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
Strong in fintech, automotive, insurtech, and AI. We are excited that the whole ecosystem is growing strong with flagships such as Rimac, Optimoroute, Oradian, Infobeep, Agrivi, Tvbeat, Orqa, and Bellabeat, and our relevant funding partners with us and a new PE fund that have just been creating. There is money, talent and we have unicorns in Croatia. Very few weaknesses in Croatia at the moment, especially with the current tax framework on capital gains (zero if you hold the shares for more than two years) and the digital nomad visa. A giant leap for the region!</p>

Oradian, Lebesgue, Optimoroute, Gideon Brothers, Worcon, TVbeat, Orqa, Ascalia, Epoets Society, Hoss, Jade, Miret, My Valet, Sendbee, She’s Well, Spotsie, Taia, TDA, and Twire.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The ecosystem still a bit small to talk about the vertical focus. [We have] two active funds: SC ventures and Fil Rouge Capital. FRC runs an accelerator program along the YC model. The angel scene is a bit disappointing at the moment with not a lot of investments. Funderbeam [is] pretty active here. The quality and quantity is amazing at the moment in Croatia, probably a factor of the ecosystem being rather young.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
The current fiscal climate makes it very attractive for people to relocate/stay in Zagreb, no doubt. One million people here; proximity to one of the best seas in the world — all the ingredients are here to make it the beacon of the up and coming startup world!</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
FRC is definitely the main player in Zagreb; SC ventures, Funderbeam, Novak Law for lawyers, Algebra University, ZICER, Hub 385, Step RI.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
No doubt a key hub in Europe on par with Vienna.</p>

<h2>Josip Orsolic, CEO, Lilcodelab</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
IT, automotive, manufacturing, farming (different SaaS and IoT solutions).</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Rimac Automobili, Microblink, Five, Nanobit, Agrivi.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s a small circle of people and not a lot of diversity, although it is getting better. Many new young successful investors emerged in the last few years.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
They will stay, maybe go to the suburbs, but just looking at the rental prices for flats/apartments I don&#8217;t see any shift in people moving outside of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Mate Rimac, Damir Sabol, Alan Sumina, Tomislav Car, Luka Abrus.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
I believe the tech scene is going to grow more and more. Many companies from other countries are opening up engineering hubs in Zagreb. There is a lot of talent, people are drawn to tech jobs; it is heavily covered by the media. Each success is celebrated and covered by the media, so there is a feeling that tech companies are being pushed, even though there are other successful companies from other industries.</p>

<h2>Vedran Tolic, founder &amp; CBO, Q agency</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
Strongest: Online betting, HR solutions, fintech, mobile gaming, IoT.<br />
Weakest: Gaming for serious platforms; AI solutions are still in their infancy.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
PhotoMath, Agrivi, SofaScore, TalentLyft, Jenz, and Bellabeat.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The scene is getting stronger, but for any serious investment, startups have to look beyond our borders.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
Zagreb has an excellent work-life balance, and most of the talent want to stay here. Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it&#8217;s easier to land remote jobs and stay in Zagreb, which will positively impact our ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Founders: We have many charismatic founders who are raising awareness around startups and entrepreneurship in general. They are reaching large audiences and getting attention from government, the education system and the public.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Shifting from mostly agency work for foreign companies to a more product-oriented scene — especially in AI and ML. Products will revolve around customer and employee engagement, automation and prediction of processes which are today done by a large workforce.</p>

<h2>Bozidar Pavlovic, managing director, airt</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
AI, SaaS, electric cars manufacturing, and software development in general.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Rimac Automobili, Nanobit, Infinum, Five, Agrivi, Aircash, Identyum, Airt, Mindsmiths, Electrocoin, Agency 04, Oradian, Microblink, Photomath, Agency Q, Revuto, Optimoroute, Amodo, Lemax, Ampnet, RobotiqAI, and Velebit AI.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The scene is growing recently — Zagreb is capital of Croatia, thus attracting capital and people. A recent near-unicorn (Rimac, with heavy investment from Hyundai and Porsche) helped raise visibility for this vibrant ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
Even before the pandemic, Zagreb was very attractive for tech experts worldwide due to its appealing price of accommodation, security, comfort of living and relatively high salaries. I am expecting to see the masses return after vaccination.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Davor Runje, Nikola Pavesic, Drazen Orescanin, Frane Sesnic, Tin Tezak, Ante Magzan, and Luka Sucic.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
I see it blooming, mostly due to upcoming adoption of EUR as a local currency.</p>

<h2>Matej Zelic, COO, Spotsie</h2>
<p><strong>What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
Oil and energy, Industry 4.0. Most excited to be a part of digital transformation in the old-fashioned industries.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Rimac, Agrivi, Oradian, Miret, SofaScore.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The startup ecosystem in Croatia is still in early stages of development. The investment scene (except a few business angels) started a  few years ago backed by EU with just two VCs (FRC and SVC) without a strategic plan and focus.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
People will stay here.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Fil Rouge Capital, South Central Ventures. Mate Rimac, Damir Sabol, Frane Sesnic</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Because of micro-location, the digital nomad program, and IT talent pool, Zagreb is on the way to becoming the No. 1 tech location in CEE and Europe.</p>

<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Very poor startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
Most of the last year was in partial lockdown.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)</strong><br />
Sasa Cvetojecic, Hrvoje Prpic, Fil Rouge Capital, Bird Incubator.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vedran Blagus, investment manager, South Central Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
Industry is very agnostic. Most of them work in B2B or the enterprise space. They lack B2C knowledge, growth/expansion plan and investor relations.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
AdScanner, Agrivi, ReversingLabs, TalentLyft, Sportening, Codemap, Gideon Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Two VCs operating &#8211; Fil Rouge Capital (Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A &#8211; industry agnostic; B2C and B2B) and South Central Ventures (Seed, Series A, B2B). In the past six to twelve months, C-level executives from corporates started investing in startups in early stages (up to EUR 200k), but keep their investments below the radar.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
I believe that it will stay the same as it is. Development/operations in Zagreb, expansion to other European cities by opening offices there.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Founders &#8211; Matija Zulj, Marin Curkovic, Mate Rimac, Marin Saric, Alan Sumina, Matija Kopic.<br />
Investors &#8211; Luka Sucic, Stevica Kuharski, Vedran Blagus.<br />
Lawyers &#8211; Marijana Sarolic Robic.<br />
Media &#8211; Ivan Brezak Brkan, Bernard Ivezic.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Founders who exited companies they&#8217;ve been building for the past 10 years will found new companies and/or invest in early stage startups. More international investors looking at Zagreb for pipeline/investments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Daniel Stefanic, investor</h2>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Infobip, Rimac seem to be hottest ones in Croatia.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
There&#8217;s some incredibly smart people involved in STEM in Croatia &#8211; world class. They just need better pathways to commercialisation and access to capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Being an expectant mom can be frightening, as can mothering an infant or toddler. The answers don&#8217;t come automatically, and while there&#8217;s no shortage of books and websites (and advice from grandparents) about how to parent at every stage, finding satisfying information often proves a lot harder than imagined.</p>
<p>There are online social groups that deliver some of the social and emotional support that new parents need, no matter where they live. There are <a href="https://www.parents.com/parenting/moms/mom-groups-worth-joining-on-facebook/">many dozens</a> of mom communities on Facebook, for example. However, it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s room for improvement on this theme &#8212; big groups can feel isolating, bad information abounds &#8212;that <a href="https://www.oathcare.com/">Oath Care</a>, a young, four-person San Francisco-based startup, just raised $2 million in seed funding from XYZ Ventures, General Catalyst, and Eros Resmini, former CMO of Discord and managing partner of the Mini Fund.</p>
<p>What is it building? Founder Camilla Hermann describes it as a subscription-based mobile app that&#8217;s focused on improving the lives of new mothers by combining parents who have lots in common with healthcare specialists and moderators who can guide them in group chats, as well as one-on-one video calls.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More specifically, she says, for $20 per month, Oath matches pregnant and postpartum moms in circles of up to 10 based on factors like stage of pregnancy, age of child, location, and career so they can ask questions of each other, with the help of a trained moderator (who is sometimes a mother with older children).</p>
<p>Oath also pushes curriculum that Oath&#8217;s team is developing in-house to members based on each group&#8217;s specific needs. Not last, every group is given collective access to medical specialists who can answer general questions as part of the members&#8217; subscription and who are also available for consultations when individualized help is needed.</p>
<p>Hermann says the pricing of these 15-minute-long consultations is still being developed, but that the medical experts with whom it&#8217;s already working see the app as a form of lead generation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting concept, one that could be taken in a host of directions, acknowledges Hermann who says she was inspired to cofound the company based on earlier work developing a contact tracing technology created to track outbreaks like Ebola in real time.</p>
<p>As she said yesterday during a Zoom call with TechCrunch and her cofounder, Michelle Stephens, a pediatric clinician and research scientist: &#8220;We&#8217;ve fundamentally misunderstand something really important about health in the West; we think that [changes] happen to one person at a time or one part of the body at a time, but it always happens in interconnected systems both inside and outside the body, which fundamentally means that it is always happening in community.&#8221;</p>
<p>For her part, Stephens &#8212; who was introduced to Hermann at a dinner years ago &#8212; says her motivation in cofounding Oath was born out of research into childhood stress, and that by &#8220;better equipping parents to be those positive consistent caregivers in their child&#8217;s life,&#8221; Oath aims to help enable stronger, more intimate child-parent bonds.</p>
<p>It might sound grand for a mobile app, but it also sounds like a smart starting point. Though the idea is to match mothers in similar situations at the outset to help bolster theirs and their children&#8217;s health, it&#8217;s easy to imagine the platform evolving in a way that brings together parents in numerous groups based on interests, from preschool applications to autism to same-sex parenting. It&#8217;s easy to see the platform helping to sell products that parents need. It&#8217;s easy to imagine the company amassing a lot of valuable information.</p>
<p>Indeed, says Hermann, the longer-term vision for Oath is to create rich datasets that it hopes can be used to improve health outcomes, including by identifying health issues earlier. Relatedly, it also hopes to build relationships with health systems and payers in order to increase access to its products.</p>
<p>For now, Oath is mostly just trying to keep up with demand. Hermann says the &#8220;small and scrappy&#8221; company found its first 50 users through Facebook ads, and that this base quickly tripled organically before Oath was forced to create a growing waitlist for what has been a closed beta until now. (Oath is &#8220;anticipating a full launch in late summer,&#8221; says Stephens.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say the company isn&#8217;t thinking at all about next steps.</p>
<p>While right now it is &#8220;laser focused on building out the most exceptional experience for this specific cohort of users in this specific period of time of their lives,&#8221; says Hermann, once it builds out many more communities of small trusted groups with &#8220;high engagement and high trust,&#8221; there is &#8220;a lot you can layer on top of that. It&#8217;s virtually limitless.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A French startup that set out to bring a new approach to driver education and road safety, and then used that foothold to expand into the related area of car insurance, is today announcing a big round of funding to continue building its service across Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ornikar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ornikar</a>, which prepares people for driving tests by providing online drivers education courses, lets those users organize in-person lessons with driving instructors, provides a booking system for taking their written and practical examinations, and finally provides them with competitive rates for getting car insurance as new drivers, has raised €100 million ($120 million).</p>
<p>The company intends to use the funding to expand its business. Drivers education services are live today in France and Spain, while insurance is offered today only in France: the plan will be to expand both of those to more markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series C is being led by KKR, with previous investors Idinvest, BPI, Elaia, Brighteye, and H14 also participating. Benjamin Gaignault, Ornikar&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Flavien LeRendu (who also jointly holds the title of CEO), said the startup is not disclosing its valuation, but we understand from a source that it is around $750 million. The company has raised $175 million to date.</p>
<p>Ornikar has been around since 2013 and was founded, in Gaignault&#8217;s words, &#8220;to disrupt driving education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming into the market at a time when most of the process of organizing, learning and booking your driving education was not only very fragmented but completely offline, Ornikar&#8217;s internet-based offering represented a step change in how French people learned to drive: the process not only became easier, but on average about 40% cheaper to arrange.</p>
<p>Ornikar&#8217;s driving education business today includes not just online course materials and booking services, but a network of instructors across 1,000 towns and cities in France, and a business that launched last year in Spain, under the Onroad brand. Some 1.5 million people have taken Ornikar&#8217;s driving education courses to date, with another 2 million using its driving school, with growth accelerating: 420,000 new customers signed up with Ornikar in the last year alone.</p>
<p>Last year was a tricky one for companies in the business of transportation. People were generally staying put and not traveling anywhere, but when they were getting around, they wanted plenty of their own space to do so.</p>
<p>Translating that to markets like France and Spain where many towns will have solid public transportation and taxi services, people might have opted to use these less, looking instead to private vehicles in their place. And translating that to Ornikar, Gaignault said that people being at home more, and looking to use the time productively with a view to driving more in the future, the startup saw business growing by 30% each month last year.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it was in the middle of the pandemic that Ornikar launched its car insurance product, which came out of the same impetus as the driver education services: it was built to fill a hole in the market rethought with Ornikar&#8217;s users in mind.</p>
<p>Car insurance in France &#8212; a €17 billion ($20 billion) market annually &#8212; is dominated by big players, and when it comes to first-time drivers and looking for competitive rates, &#8220;the bigger companies are not comfortable with user experience,&#8221; said Gaignault. &#8220;It’s pretty poor and not aligned with expectations of the customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car insurance product &#8212; sold as Ornikar Assurance &#8212; is now on track to hit some 20,000 users by August (when it will have been in the market for a year).</p>
<p>While it accounts today for a small fraction of Ornikar&#8217;s revenues compared to its driver education platform, that take up &#8212; not just from alums of Ornikar&#8217;s drivers ed, but from those who had never used an Ornikar service before &#8212; is a good sign that it&#8217;s on to something big, Gaignault said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In October we noticed that 80% of our new insurance customers were not coming from Ornikar but from social media, Google ads and other outside sources,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we decided to create a new business unit and explore a business as an insuretech.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, he added, that will not be at the expense of the driving education: the two go hand in hand for a common goal of improving how people drive and improving road safety. Indeed, Gaignault said he envisions a time when one will feed into the other: not only will the driving school serve as a way of bringing in new insurance customers, but insurance rates can be impacted by how many driving courses a person takes to keep their knowledge of the driving code and best practices fresh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ornikar has done a tremendous job creating a great experience for students and driving instructors through engaging online education courses and a well-designed marketplace,&#8221; said Patrick Devine, director at KKR and member of the Next Generation Technology Growth investment team. &#8220;We are thrilled to invest behind Benjamin, Flavien, and their talented team as they expand internationally and accelerate their insurance offering following the successful launches of Onroad in Spain and Ornikar Assurance.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One never knows how a confirmation hearing will go these days, especially one for a young outsider nominated to an important position despite challenging the status quo and big business. <a href="http://www.linamkhan.com/">Lina Khan</a>, just such a person up for the position of FTC Commissioner, had a surprisingly pleasant time of it during today&#8217;s Senate Commerce Committee confirmation hearing — possibly because her iconoclastic approach to antitrust makes for good politics these days.</p>
<p>Khan, an associate professor of law at Columbia, is best known in the tech community for her incisive essay &#8220;Amazon Antitrust&#8217;s Paradox,&#8221; which laid out the failings of regulatory doctrine that have allowed the retail giant to progressively dominate more and more markets. (She also recently contributed to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/big-tech-blows-a-collective-raspberry-at-the-houses-antitrust-report/">House report on tech policy</a>.)</p>
<p>When it was published, in 2018, the feeling that Amazon had begun to abuse its position was, though commonplace in some circles, not really popular in the Capitol. But the growing sense that laissez-faire or insufficient regulations have created monsters in Amazon, Google, and Facebook (to start) has led to a rare bipartisan agreement that we must find some way, any way will do, of putting these upstart corporations back in their place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This in turn led to a sense of shared purpose and camaraderie in the confirmation hearing, which was a triple header: Khan joined Bill Nelson, nominated to lead NASA, and Leslie Kiernan, who would join the Commerce Department as General Counsel, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?511008-1/nasa-administrator-ftc-commissioner-confirmation-hearing">for a really nice little three-hour chat</a>.</p>

<p>Khan is one of several in the Biden administration who signal a new approach to taking on Big Tech and other businesses that have gotten out of hand, and the questions posed to her by Senators from both sides of the aisle seemed genuine and got genuinely satisfactory answers from a confident Khan.</p>
<p>She deftly avoided a few attempts to bait her — including one involving Section 230; wrong Commission, Senator — and her answers primarily reaffirmed her professional opinion that the FTC should be better informed and more preemptive in its approach to regulating these secretive, powerful corporations.</p>
<p>Here are a few snippets representative of the questioning and indicative of her positions on a few major issues (answers lightly edited for clarity):</p>
<p><strong>On the FTC getting involved in the fight between Google, Facebook, and news providers:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Everything needs to be on the table. Obviously local journalism is in crisis, and i think the current COVID moment has really underscored the deep democratic emergency that is resulting when we don&#8217;t have reliable sources of local news.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also cited the increasing concentration of ad markets and the arbitrary nature of, for example, algorithm changes that can have wide-ranging effects on entire industries.</p>

<p><strong>On Clarence Thomas&#8217;s troubling suggestion that social media companies should be considered &#8220;common carriers&#8221;:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think it prompted a lot of interesting discussion,&#8221; she said, very diplomatically. &#8220;In the Amazon article, I identified two potential pathways forward when thinking about these dominant digital platforms. One is enforcing competition laws and ensuring that these markets are competitive.&#8221; (i.e. using antitrust rules)</p>
<p>&#8220;The other is, if we instead recognize that perhaps there are certain economies of scale, network externalities that will lead these markets to stay dominated by a very few number of companies, then we need to apply a different set of rules. We have a long legal tradition of thinking about what types of checks can be applied when there&#8217;s a lot of concentration and common carriage is one of those tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should clarify that some of these firms are now integrated in so many markets that you may reach for a different set of tools depending on which specific market you&#8217;re looking at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(This was a very polite way of saying common carriage and existing antitrust rules are totally unsuitable for the job.)</p>
<p><strong>On potentially reviewing past mergers the FTC approved:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The resources of the commission have not really kept pace with the increasing size of the economy, as well as the increasing size and complexity of the deals the commission is reviewing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was an assumption that digital markets in particular are fast moving so we don&#8217;t need to be concerned about potential concentration in the markets, because any exercise of power will get disciplined by entry and new competition. Now of course we know that in the markets you actually have significant network externalities in ways that make them more sticky. In hindsight there&#8217;s a growing sense that those merger reviews were a missed opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Here Senator Blackburn (R-TN) in one of the few negative moments fretted about Khan&#8217;s &#8220;lack of experience in coming to that position&#8221; before asking about a spectrum plan — wrong Commission, Senator.)</p>
<p><strong>On the difficulty of enforcing something like an order against Facebook:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the challenges is the deep information asymmetry that exists between some of these firms and enforcers and regulators. I think it&#8217;s clear that in some instances the agencies have been a little slow to catch up to the underlying business realities and the empirical realities of how these markets work. So at the very least ensuring the agencies are doing everything they can to keep pace is gonna be important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In social media we have these black box algorithms, proprietary algorithms that can sometimes make it difficult to know what&#8217;s really going on. The FTC needs to be using its information gathering capacities to mitigate some of these gaps.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>On extending protections for children and other vulnerable groups online:</strong></p>
<p>Some of these dangers are heightened given some of the ways in which the pandemic has rendered families and children especially dependent on some of these [education] technologies. So I think we need to be especially vigilant here. The previous rules should be the floor, not the ceiling.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall there was little partisan bickering and a lot of feeling from both sides that Khan was, if not <em>technically</em> experienced at the job (not rare with a coveted position like FTC Commissioner), about as competent a nominee as anyone could ask for. Not only that but her highly considered and fairly assertive positions on matters of antitrust and competition could help put Amazon and Google, already in the regulatory doghouse, on the defensive for once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot has changed in the last decade-ish of instant photography, yet all the while the boxy build of instant cameras has stayed more or less intact. Modern instant shooters have slimmed down and put on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/gift-guide-photography-2020-best-photography-gifts-ideas-for-photographers/"> a variety of calming pastel tones</a>, but they&#8217;re not exactly slender.</p>
<p>But lo, Polaroid — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/weve-come-full-rectangle-polaroid-is-reborn-out-of-the-impossible-project/">the new Polaroid, not the old Polaroid</a> — has done a thing. The company says its latest camera, the Polaroid Go, is the world&#8217;s smallest analog instant camera. And you know, yeah, it looks really quite small.</p>
<p>How small is small? It&#8217;s 4.1 inches long, 2.4 inches tall and a little over 3 inches wide. The Go is undeniably tiny but boasts a handful of useful features, including a selfie timer, selfie mirror and the ability to take dreamy double exposures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the promo photos, Polaroid&#8217;s models hold it like a delicate canapé or casually wield it with a few dainty fingers as it dangles from various stylish-looking accessories (camera straps? necklaces?). The company really wants people to wear this thing, it seems, and I for one am not above it.</p>

<p>With the Go, Polaroid continues the sort of annoying but I guess necessary instant photography trend of making a new film format, which in this case is basically a miniaturized version of its iconic old-school square film. And while the camera is teeny, TechCrunch&#8217;s own tiny camera-haver and forthcoming review writer Devin Coldewey says you don&#8217;t actually lose much size in the shots compared to something like the Instax Mini.</p>
<p>Polaroid claims that the Go marks the &#8220;most significant and exciting change to the Polaroid form factor in decades&#8221; and it&#8217;s probably not wrong. The company&#8217;s improbable return from the dead was likely more exciting, but we don&#8217;t want to undermine how cute this thing is. Let&#8217;s just hope it makes pictures good.</p>
<p>The Polaroid Go will join the Polaroid Now, its standard though now hideously bloated sibling, and the OneStep+, which blends digital and analog and connects to a phone over Bluetooth. It&#8217;s <a href="https://us.polaroid.com/collections/go-film-bundle">on preorder now and will retail for $100</a>, which is the same amount you&#8217;d pay for the regular old new Polaroid camera. But why would you?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TechCrunch spoke with UiPath CFO Ashim Gupta today to learn more about his company's foray into the public markets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After an upward revision, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">UiPath priced its IPO last night at $56 per share</a>, a few dollars above its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uipath-raises-ipo-range-still-targets-lower-valuation-than-final-private-round/">raised target range</a>. The above-range price meant that the unicorn put more capital into its books through its public offering.</p>
<p>For a company in a market as competitive as robotic process automation (RPA), the funds are welcome. In fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">RPA has been top of mind</a> for startups and established companies alike over the last year or so. In that time frame, enterprise stalwarts like SAP, Microsoft, IBM and ServiceNow have been buying smaller RPA startups and building their own, all in an effort to muscle into an increasingly lucrative market.</p>
<p>In June 2019, Gartner reported that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-meteoric-rise-from-unknown-startup-to-35b-rpa-juggernaut/#:~:text=the%20fastest-growing%20area">RPA was the fastest-growing area</a> in enterprise software, and while the growth has slowed down since, the sector is still attracting attention. UIPath, which Gartner found was the market leader, has been riding that wave, and today’s capital influx should help the company maintain its market position.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that when the company had its last private funding round in February, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">brought home $750 million</a> at an impressive valuation of $35 billion. But as TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">noted over the course of its pivot to the public markets</a>, that round valued the company above its final IPO price. As a result, this week&#8217;s $56-per-share public offer wound up being something of a modest down-round IPO to UiPath&#8217;s final private valuation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cu8kiBOfF4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">Robotic process automation platform UiPath raises $750M at $35B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robotic process automation platform UiPath raises $750M at $35B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/embed/#?secret=cu8kiBOfF4" data-secret="cu8kiBOfF4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Then, a broader set of public traders got hold of its stock and bid its shares higher. The former unicorn&#8217;s shares closed their first day’s trading at precisely $69, above the per-share price at which the company closed its final private round.</p>
<p>So despite a somewhat circuitous route, UiPath closed its first day as a public company worth more than it was in its Series F round — when it sold 12,043,202 shares sold at $62.27576 apiece, per SEC filings. More simply, UiPath closed today worth more per-share than it was in February.</p>
<p>How you might value the company, whether you prefer a simple or fully-diluted share count, is somewhat immaterial at this juncture. UiPath had a good day.</p>
<p>While it’s hard to know what the company might do with the proceeds, chances are it will continue to try to expand its platform beyond pure RPA, which could become market-limited over time as companies look at other, more modern approaches to automation. By adding additional automation capabilities — organically or via acquisitions — the company can begin covering broader parts of its market.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with UiPath CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashim-gupta-0372ba5/">Ashim Gupta</a> today, curious about the company’s choice of a traditional IPO, its general avoidance of adjusted metrics in its SEC filings, and the IPO market’s current temperature.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">antitrust hearing in the U.S. Senate</a>, Apple and Google representatives were questioned on whether they have a &#8220;strict firewall&#8221; or other internal policies in place that prevent them from leveraging the data from third-party businesses operating on their app stores to inform the development of their own competitive products. Apple, in particular, was called out for the practice of copying other apps by Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who said the practice had become so common that it earned a nickname with Apple&#8217;s developer community: &#8220;sherlocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sherlock, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software)">has its own Wikipedia entry</a> under software, comes from Apple&#8217;s search tool in the early 2000s called Sherlock. A third-party developer, Karelia Software, created an alternative tool called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelia_Watson">Watson</a>. Following the success of Karelia&#8217;s product, Apple added Watson&#8217;s same functionality into its own search tool, and Watson was effectively put out of business. The nickname &#8220;Sherlock&#8221; <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/06/06/developers-talk-about-being-sherlocked-as-apple-uses-them-for-market-research">later became shorthand</a> for any time Apple copies an idea from a third-party developer that threatens to or even destroys their business.</p>
<p>Over the years, developers claimed Apple has &#8220;sherlocked&#8221; <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/297651/what-does-it-mean-when-a-company-sherlocks-an-app/">a number of apps</a>, including Konfabulator (desktop widgets), iPodderX (podcast manager), Sandvox (app for building websites) and Growl (a notification system for Mac OS X) and, in more recent years, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/apple-flux-ios-93-sherlock/">F.lux</a> (blue light reduction tool for screens) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/the-makers-of-duet-display-and-luna-on-life-after-apples-sidecar/">Duet and Luna</a> (apps that makes iPad a secondary display), as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/apple-puts-third-party-screen-time-apps-on-notice/">various screen-time-management tools</a>. Now Tile claims <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">Apple has also unfairly entered its market</a> with AirTag.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During his questioning, Blumenthal asked Apple and Google&#8217;s representatives at the hearing &#8212; Kyle Andeer, Apple&#8217;s chief compliance officer and Wilson White, Google&#8217;s senior director of Public Policy &amp; Government Relations, respectively &#8212; if they employed any sort of &#8220;firewall&#8221; in between their app stores and their business strategy.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OqSLFymm35"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">Senate antitrust hearing on app stores gives Apple critics a big soapbox</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Senate antitrust hearing on app stores gives Apple critics a big soapbox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/embed/#?secret=OqSLFymm35" data-secret="OqSLFymm35" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Andeer somewhat dodged the question, saying, &#8220;Senator, if I understand the question correctly, we have separate teams that manage the App Store and that are engaged in product development strategy here at Apple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blumenthal then clarified what he meant by &#8220;firewall.&#8221; He explained that it doesn&#8217;t mean whether or not there are separate teams in place, but whether there&#8217;s an internal prohibition on sharing data between the App Store and the people who run Apple&#8217;s other businesses.</p>
<p>Andeer then answered, &#8220;Senator, we have controls in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to note that over the past 12 years, Apple has only introduced &#8220;a handful of applications and services,&#8221; and in every instance, there are &#8220;dozens of alternatives&#8221; on the App Store. And, sometimes, the alternatives are more popular than Apple&#8217;s own product, he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t copy. We don&#8217;t kill. What we do is offer up a new choice and a new innovation,&#8221; Andeer stated.</p>
<p>His argument may hold true when there are strong rivalries, like Spotify versus Apple Music, or Netflix versus Apple TV+, or Kindle versus Apple Books. But it&#8217;s harder to stretch it to areas where Apple makes smaller enhancements &#8212; like when Apple introduced Sidecar, a feature that allowed users to make their iPad a secondary display. Sidecar ended the need for a third-party app, after apps like Duet and Luna first proved the market.</p>
<p>Another example was when Apple built screen-time controls into its iOS software, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/28/apple-defends-its-takedown-of-some-apps-monitoring-screen-time/">but didn&#8217;t provide</a> the makers of third-party screen-time apps with an API so consumers could use their preferred apps to configure Apple&#8217;s Screen Time settings via the third-party&#8217;s specialized interface or take advantage of other unique features.</p>
<p>Blumenthal said he interpreted Andeer&#8217;s response as to whether Apple has a &#8220;data firewall&#8221; as a &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posed the same question, Google&#8217;s representative, White, said his understanding was that Google had &#8220;data access controls in place that govern how data from our third-party services are used.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TDT4CS8zXX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/">Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=TDT4CS8zXX" data-secret="TDT4CS8zXX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blumenthal pressed him to clarify if this was a &#8220;firewall,&#8221; meaning, he clarified again, &#8220;do you have a prohibition against access?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a prohibition against using our third-party services to compete directly with our first-party services,&#8221; White said, adding that Google has &#8220;internal policies that govern that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The senator said he would follow up on this matter with written questions, as his time expired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new bill known as the Fourth Amendment is Not for Sale Act would seal up a loophole that intelligence and law enforcement agencies use to obtain troves of sensitive and identifying information to which they wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have legal access.</p>
<p>The new legislation, proposed by Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rand Paul (R-KY), would require government agencies to obtain a court order <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/27/vermont-passes-first-first-law-to-crack-down-on-data-brokers/">to access data from brokers</a>. Court orders are already required when the government seeks analogous data from mobile providers and tech platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s no reason information scavenged by data brokers should be treated differently than the same data held by your phone company or email provider,&#8221; Wyden said. Wyden describes the loophole as a way that police and other agencies buy data to &#8220;end-run the Fourth Amendment.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paul criticized the government for using the current data broker loophole to circumvent Americans&#8217; constitutional rights. &#8220;The Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable search and seizure ensures that the liberty of every American cannot be violated on the whims, or financial transactions, of every government officer,&#8221; Paul said.</p>
<p>Critically, the bill would also ban law enforcement agencies from buying data on Americans when it was obtained through hacking, violations of terms of service or &#8220;from a user’s account or device.&#8221;</p>
<p>That bit highlights the questionable practices of Clearview AI, a deeply controversial tech company that sells access to a facial recognition search engine. Clearview&#8217;s platform collects pictures of faces scraped from across the web, including social media sites, and sells access to that data to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table">police departments around the country</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/">federal agencies like ICE</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="t9LlnLMEal"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/">Clearview AI landed a new facial recognition contract with ICE</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearview AI landed a new facial recognition contract with ICE&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/embed/#?secret=t9LlnLMEal" data-secret="t9LlnLMEal" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In scraping their sites for data to sell, Clearview has run afoul of just about every major social media platform&#8217;s terms of service. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google have all denounced Clearview for using data culled from their services and some have even sent cease-and-desists ordering the data broker to stop.</p>
<p>The bill would also expand privacy laws to apply to infrastructure companies that own cell towers and data cables, seal up workarounds that allow intelligence agencies to obtain metadata from Americans&#8217; international communications without review by a FISA court and ensure that agencies seek probable cause orders to obtain location and web browsing data.</p>
<p>The bill, embedded below, isn&#8217;t just some nascent proposal. It&#8217;s already attracted bipartisan support from a number of key co-sponsors, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side and Republicans Mike Lee and Steve Daines. A House version of the legislation was also introduced Wednesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve covered Swiss robotics company ANYbotics with some regularity over the years. The company has offered its own take on the quadrupedal robotics space that has, naturally, drawn comparisons to Boston Dynamics’ Spot. Of course, as we noted earlier, the company’s take on the category has been in development for several years, so there may be a case of convergent evolution here.</p>
<p>Today the company announced that it’s ready to take ANYmal to the next level. ANYbotics is positioning its robot as a “end-to-end robotic inspection solution.” Specifically, the robot is designed to inspect places like energy and industrial plants, patrolling areas where it’s not ideal to have a human on-site, 24/7 &#8212; if at all.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141863" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141863" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141863" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ANYbotics-Introduces-End-to-End-Robotic-Inspection-Solution.2021-04-21-14_21_51.gif" alt="" width="800" height="421" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141863" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ANYbotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mounted atop the robot is a customizable payload, featuring a number of different sensors for inspection, including visual, acoustic and thermal readings. The on-board camera features remote pan and tilt options for a better picture of an area.</p>
<p>The ANYmal is capable of walking up stairs and squeezing into areas that might otherwise be inaccessible for more traditional wheeled robotics. It can perform inspections autonomously and return to its charging dock when the battery is low.</p>
<p>The robot is currently in pilot deployment and the company has opened it up to preorders. It expects to start delivering units to customers in the second half of the year. The company is also offering a kind of on-boarding to get clients up to speed.</p>

<p>“Acting as a single point-of-contact, ANYbotics&#8217; experts closely work with the customer in evaluating the tasks to be automated and prepare the organization for the deployment of autonomous mobile inspection robots,” it writes in a release. “The team checks the feasibility and impact in simulations, on-site demonstrations, and long-term pilot deployments. Once the implementation roadmap is established, the team trains the customer in commissioning and supports in scaling the system throughout their facilities.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's the software that can determine if a micromobility company breaks out of the rideshare model and into the sales or subscription model, or becomes subsidized by or absorbed into public transit.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The days of the shared, dockless micromobility model are numbered. That&#8217;s essentially the conclusion reached by Puneeth Meruva, an associate at Trucks Venture Capital who recently<a href="https://www.trucks.vc/blog/the-three-axes-of-micromobility-supply-chains-distribution-and-maintenance"> authored a detailed research brief on micromobility</a>. Meruva is of the opinion that the standard for permit-capped, dockless scooter-sharing is not sustainable — the overhead is too costly, the returns too low — and that the industry could splinter.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Most companies playing to win have begun to vertically integrate their tech stacks by developing or acquiring new technology.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;Because shared services have started a cultural transition, people are more open to buying their own e-bike or e-scooter,&#8221; Meruva told TechCrunch. &#8220;Fundamentally because of how much city regulation is involved in each of these trips, it could reasonably become a transportation utility that is very useful for the end consumer, but it just hasn’t proven itself to be a profitable line of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>As dockless e-scooters, e-bikes and e-mopeds expand their footprint while consolidating under a few umbrella corporations, companies might develop or acquire the technology to streamline and reduce operational costs enough to achieve unit economics. One overlooked but massive factor in the micromobility space is the software that powers the vehicles — who owns it, if it&#8217;s made in-house and how well it integrates with the rest of the tech stack.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the software that can determine if a company breaks out of the rideshare model into the sales or subscription model, or becomes subsidized by or absorbed into public transit, Meruva predicts.</p>
<p>Vehicle operating systems haven’t been top of mind for most companies in the short history of micromobility. The initial goal was making sure the hardware didn&#8217;t break down or burst into flames. When e-scooters came on the scene, they caused a ruckus. Riders without helmets zipped through city streets and many vehicles ended up in ditches or blocking sidewalk accessibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/madrid-authorities-order-scooter-ban/">City officials were angry</a>, to say the least, and branded dockless modes of transport a public nuisance. However, micromobility companies had to answer to their overeager investors — the ones who missed out on the Uber and Lyft craze and threw millions at electric mobility, hoping for swift returns. What was a Bird or a Lime to do? The only thing <em>to</em> do: Get back on that electric two-wheeler and start schmoozing cities.</p>
<h2>How the fight for cities indirectly improved vehicle software</h2>
<p>Shared, dockless operators are currently in a war of attrition, fighting to get the last remaining city permits. But as the industry seeks a business to government (B2G) model that morphs into what companies think cities want, some are inadvertently producing vehicles that will evolve beyond functional toys and into more viable transportation alternatives.</p>
<p>The second wave of micromobility was marked by newer companies like Superpedestrian and Voi Technology. They learned from past industry mistakes and developed business strategies that include building onboard operating systems in-house. The goal? More control over rider behavior and better compliance with city regulations.</p>
<p>Most companies playing to win have begun to vertically integrate their tech stacks by developing or acquiring new technology. Lime, Bird, Superpedestrian, Spin and Voi all design their own vehicles and write their own fleet management software or other operational tools. Lime writes its own firmware, which sits directly on top of the vehicle hardware primitives and helps control things like motor controllers, batteries and connected lights and locks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We all know these constant video calls are doing <em>something</em> to our brains. How else could we get tired and frazzled from sitting around in our own home all day? Well, now Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/brain-research">done a little brain science</a> and found out that yeah, constant video calls do increase your stress and brain noise. Tell your boss!</p>
<p>The study had 14 people participate in eight half-hour video calls, divided into four a day — one day with 10-minute breaks between, and the other all in one block. The participants wore EEG caps: brain-monitoring gear that gives a general idea of types of activity in the old grey matter.</p>
<p>What they found is not particularly surprising, since we all have lived it for the last year (or more for already remote workers), but still important to show in testing. During the meeting block with no breaks, people showed higher levels of beta waves, which are associated with stress, anxiety and concentration. There were higher peaks and a higher average stress level, plus it increased slowly as time went on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Taking 10-minute breaks kept stress readings lower on average and prevented them from rising. And they increased other measurements of positive engagement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141832" style="width: 931px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141832" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141832" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png" alt="Graph showing how breaks keep stress low during video calls." width="921" height="926" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png 921w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=298,300 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=768,772 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=676,680 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141832" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft/Valerio Pellegrini</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly validating even if it seems obvious. And while EEG readings aren&#8217;t the most exact measurement of stress, they&#8217;re fairly reliable and better than a retrospective self-evaluation along the lines of &#8220;How stressed were you after the second meeting on a scale of 1-5?&#8221; And of course it wouldn&#8217;t be safe to take your laptop into an MRI machine. So while this evidence is helpful, we should be careful not to exaggerate it, or forget that the stress takes place in a complex and sometimes inequitable work environment.</p>
<p>For instance: <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/04/13/zoom-fatigue-worse-women/">A recent study published by Stanford</a> shows that &#8220;Zoom Fatigue,&#8221; as they call it (a mixed blessing for Zoom), is disproportionately suffered by women. More than twice as many women as men reported serious post-call exhaustion — perhaps because women&#8217;s meetings tend to run longer and they are less likely to take breaks between them. Add to that the increased focus on women&#8217;s appearance and it&#8217;s clear this is not a simple &#8220;no one likes video calls&#8221; situation.</p>
<p>Microsoft, naturally, has tech solutions to the problems in its Teams product, such as adding buffer time to make sure meetings don&#8217;t run right into each other, or the slightly weird &#8220;together mode&#8221; that puts everyone&#8217;s heads in a sort of lecture hall (the idea being it feels more natural).</p>
<p>Stanford has a few <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/">recommendations</a>, such as giving yourself permission to do audio only for a while each day, position the camera far away and pace around (make sure you&#8217;re dressed), or just turn off the self-view.</p>
<p>Ultimately the solutions can&#8217;t be entirely individual, though — they need to be structural, and though we may be leaving the year of virtual meetings behind, there can be no doubt there will be more of them going forward. So employers and organizers need to be cognizant of these risks and create policies that mitigate them — don&#8217;t just add to employee responsibilities. If anyone asks, tell them science said so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It might be time for neighborhood restaurants and coffee shops to start thinking about a subscription business — at least according to a new Y Combinator-backed startup called <a href="https://www.per-diem.co/">Per Diem</a>. The company is announcing today that it has raised $2.3 million in seed funding led by Two Sigma Ventures.</p>
<p>As co-founder CEO Tomer Molovinsky put it, Per Diem helps local businesses &#8220;build their own Amazon Prime.&#8221; He said that he and his co-founder/CTO Doron Segal started working on this during the pandemic, as local businesses became more willing to consider new models to increase loyalty and regular purchases.</p>
<p>Not that this is an entirely new concept. In fact, Molovinsky said a number of the startup&#8217;s early customers already offered subscriptions of their own, like <a href="https://www.per-diem.co/national/normans-farm-market">Norman&#8217;s Farm Market</a> with its CSA subscription for produce, or <a href="https://www.per-diem.co/new-york/ixv-coffee">IVX Coffee</a> with a program initially focused on filling up reusable mugs with coffee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But apparently these programs were usually managed through spreadsheets or an &#8220;old-school Rolodex,&#8221; making them increasingly difficult to manage as they grew. So Per Diem has built software to handle things like ordering, pickups/deliveries and payments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141825" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141825" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?w=680" alt="Per Diem" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141825" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Per Diem</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Today we offer support for both local delivery and shipping, and then we plan to build that out [with] different types of integrations, delivery partners and shipping partners,&#8221; Molovinsky said. &#8220;But we&#8217;re building on that core fundamental, which is that this is a brick-and-mortar business. That&#8217;s the ultimate differentiator.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Per Diem emphasizes creating a strong in-store experience for subscribers, since that&#8217;s where they build a real relationship with the business.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to build a future where … I&#8217;m getting all my food from warehouses in another state,&#8221; Segal added. &#8220;I want to be able to say, &#8216;Oh, I get my food from John, I get my coffee from Linda.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Per Diem says that after Norman&#8217;s Farm Market used the software to offer vegetable box subscription on its website, it sold over 500 subscriptions in the first month alone. And IVX is now able to offer a full menu of espresso, match and coffee (drip and bean) subscriptions, with the average subscriber visiting the store five days a week.</p>

<p>The startup is currently focused on New York, but it&#8217;s already working with businesses in Phoenix and Washington, D.C. as well, and Molovinsky said there are no real geographic limitations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he said he&#8217;s hoping to create &#8220;more value&#8221; for businesses, which could eventually mean cross-promoting different subscriptions or creating a neighborhood-wide subscription.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to stay focused on what are the things we can unlock for [our customers],&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re struggling with email marketing, so we added tools like that into our system. Over time, we can build up our system to continue to strengthen the relationship between the customer and the business.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong> I’m a female entrepreneur who created my first startup a few months ago. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Once my startup gets off the ground — and as COVID-19 gets under control — I’d like to visit the United States to test the market and meet with investors. Which visas would allow me to do that? </strong></p>
<p><strong>—Noteworthy in Nairobi</strong></p>
<p>Dear Noteworthy,</p>
<p>Congratulations on founding your startup! There are many ways to engage with the U.S. startup ecosystem, and you can start now, even before you physically come to the United States.</p>
<p>I recommend doing some research into the programs and resources offered to entrepreneurs like you through the U.S. Embassy and Consulates near you in your home country. I recently interviewed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lillian-wahl-tuco-460a0548/">Lilly Wahl-Tuco</a>, a foreign service officer who has worked for the U.S. Department of State for 15 years, on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/067-diplomacy-through-supporting-entrepreneurs-with-lilly-wahl-tuco/">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Wahl-Tuco discussed some of the State Department resources &#8212; including programs, competitions and grants &#8212; made available by U.S. embassies and consulates for entrepreneurs living in the area.</p>

<p>Serving as the first <a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-office-of-policy-and-public-outreach/">Environment, Science, Technology and Health (ESTH)</a> officer at the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2015, Wahl-Tuco was tasked with energizing the entrepreneurs of Bosnia. After she traveled around the country, visiting every incubator and meeting several entrepreneurs, Wahl-Tuco said she was surprised that most of the people she talked with didn’t know about the resources that the U.S. government offers through its embassies.</p>
<p>She recommends that entrepreneurs reach out, network and do online research to figure out what’s offered in their country or even if other foreign embassies offer resources and programs aimed at entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Wahl-Tuco also suggested that entrepreneurs reach out to their local U.S. Embassy. For example, you can contact the <a href="https://ke.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Kenya</a> to find out if you can discuss your startup and business plan with an ESTH officer (if there is one) or someone else there. Connecting with embassy staff can open up many opportunities.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The latest hearing to target Big Tech will drill down on competition in Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play. The Senate hearing, <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores">set for Wednesday at 2:30 p,m. EDT</a> and embedded below, will feature testimony from the two big app store gatekeepers, and three companies that have banded together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness/">to critique the immense power</a> that Apple and Google command in the mobile software market.</p>
<p>Last year, 13 app makers created the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness/"> Coalition for App Fairness</a>, a group organizing against Apple in particular for its stranglehold over app distribution and the hefty fees it collects from software developers. The group is linked to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-17-coalition-for-app-fairness-behind-north-dakota-bill-against-apple">legislation in states like North Dakota</a> that seeks to make state laws more more favorable to software makers by removing app store fees and has expanded since its inception.</p>
<p>Spotify, Tile and Match Group (which owns Tinder, Hinge and other dating apps) are all members of the coalition and will be testifying in the Senate antitrust subcommittee hearing Wednesday. That committee is helmed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">an emerging tech antitrust hawk</a> who&#8217;s made reining in Big Tech&#8217;s power a cornerstone of her political brand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No tech CEOs will be giving testimony this time around — they&#8217;ve sent legal counsel instead — but the dynamic might be interesting given that the two Big Tech companies will appear alongside their fierce critics, who are aligned with the lawmakers who called the hearing.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnCUmJvNIr0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The hearing comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">a day after Apple launched AirTags</a>, its own Tile-like product that can geolocate lost items like keys and wallets. Tile has criticized Apple for more than a year over those plans, claiming the tech giant implemented policies to hamstring the market leader in a product category it planned to compete within. The company previously testified before the House&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110386/witnesses/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-DaruK-20200117.pdf">airing those concerns last January</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome competition, as long as it is fair competition,&#8221; Tile CEO C.J. Prober said Tuesday following Apple&#8217;s big event. &#8220;Unfortunately, given Apple’s well-documented history of using its platform advantage to unfairly limit competition for its products, we’re skeptical.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prober called lawmakers&#8217; interest in examining Apple&#8217;s policies &#8220;entirely appropriate&#8221; in light of Tile&#8217;s history of issues with the company.</p>
<p>Software makers have long been waging a battle against Apple over its iron grip on the app world. Last year, Epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/epics-latest-argument-in-its-fight-against-apple-keeps-antitrust-issues-front-and-center/">elevated that struggle</a>, picking a fight with Apple over the 30% cut the company takes on payments made through its App Store. Apple punished the company for its attempt at a workaround for the fees, kicking Epic&#8217;s hit game Fortnite out of the App Store and prompting Epic to launch an antitrust suit against the $2 trillion company. Epic&#8217;s day in court kicks off next month, on May 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Right on schedule, Google today launched the third developer preview of <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12">Android 12</a>, the latest version of its mobile operating system. According to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12">roadmap</a>, this will be the last developer preview before Android 12 goes into beta, which is typically also when you&#8217;ll likely see the first over-the-air updates for nondevelopers who want to try it out. For now, developers still have to <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/get">flash a device image</a> to their supported Pixel devices.</p>
<p>Google notes that with the beta phase coming up, now is the time for developers to start compatibility testing to make sure their apps are ready. Currently, the plan is for Android 12 to reach platform stability by August 2021. At that point, all the app-facing features will be locked in and finalized.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new in this preview? As usual, there are dozens of smaller new features, tweaks and changes, but the highlights this time around are the ability for developers to provide new haptic feedback experiences in their apps and new app launch animations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new app launch experience may be the most noticeable change here for both developers and users. The new animation will take the app from launch to a splash screen that shows the app&#8217;s icon and then to the app itself. &#8220;The new experience brings standard design elements to every app launch, but we’ve also made it customizable so apps can maintain their unique branding,&#8221; Google explains. Developers will get quite a bit of leeway in how they want to <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/window/SplashScreen">customize this splash screen</a> with their own branding. The most basic launch experience is enabled by default, though.</p>
<p>Rich haptic feedback is also new in this release. It&#8217;s hard not to look at this and think of Apple&#8217;s now mostly abandoned Force Touch, but this is a bit different. The idea here is to provide &#8220;immersive and delightful effects for gaming, and attentional haptics for productivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other new features in this release include a new call notification template that is meant to make it easier for users to manage incoming and ongoing calls. Google says these new notifications will be more visible and scannable. There are also improvements to the Neural Networks API for machine learning workloads and new APIs to support a wider range of ultra high-resolution camera sensors.</p>
<p>With Android 12, Google is also deprecating its RenderScript API for running computationally intensive tasks in favor of GPU compute frameworks like Vulkan and OpenGL.</p>
<p>You can find a full breakdown of all of the changes in this release <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12">here</a>.</p>
