										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Developing new packaged foods and consumer goods can take a couple years as companies research, prototype and test products. In a society that runs on social media, however, people expect to see trends land on store shelves much more quickly. Founded in 2018, <a href="https://www.aipalette.com/">Ai Palette</a> uses machine learning to help companies spot trends in real-time and get them retail-ready, often within a few months. The startup, whose clients include Danone, Kellogg’s Cargill and Dole, announced today it has raised an oversubscribed $4.4 million Series A co-led by pi Ventures and Exfinity Venture Partners. Both will join Ai Palette’s board.</p>
<p>The round also included participation from returning backers food tech venture firm AgFunder and Decacorn Capital, and new investor Anthill Ventures. It brings Ai Palette’s total raised to $5.5 million, including a seed round <a href="https://e27.co/exclusive-foodtech-startup-ai-palette-gets-us1m-seed-funding-from-decacorn-capital-others-20190823/">announced in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Ai Palette is based in Singapore, with an engineering hub in Bangalore. Its customer base started in Southeast Asia, before expanding into China, Japan, the United States and Europe. Some of its clients include Danone, Kellog’s, Cargill and Dole.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The present and future of food tech investment opportunity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/the-foodtech-investment-opportunity-present-and-future/embed/#?secret=cCXuLNmkSB" data-secret="cCXuLNmkSB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Based in Singapore, with engineering hub in Bangalore. Customer base started in Southeast Asia and India, and expanded to China, Japan, the United States and Europe. Ai Palette supports 15 languages, which the company claims is the most of any AI-based tool for predicting consumer packaged goods (CPG) trends. Its funding will be used to expand into more markets and fill engineering and data science roles.</p>
<p>Ai Palette was founded in 2018 by chief executive officer Somsubhra GanChoudhuri and chief technology officer Himanshu Upreti, who met through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/a-lof-of-efffing-money/">Entrepreneur First</a>, the “talent investor” that recruits and teams up potential founders.</p>
<p>Before Ai Palette, GanChoudhuri worked in sales and marketing at Givaudan, the world’s largest manufacturer of fragrances and flavors. This allowed him to see how product innovation is done for many types of consumer products, ranging from snacks and fast food to packaged goods. Many of the companies he worked with were beginning to realize that a two-year product innovation cycle could no longer meet demand. Upreti, an advanced machine learning and big data analysis expert, previously worked at companies including Visa, where he build models that can handle petabytes of data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EF raises $115M new fund, aiming to create another 300-plus startups in the next three years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/a-lof-of-efffing-money/embed/#?secret=uk2edHerlt" data-secret="uk2edHerlt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ai Palette’s first product is Foresight Engine, which tracks trends like ingredients or flavors, analyzes why they are popular and predicts how long demand will last. It also identifies “white space opportunities,” or situations where there is unmet demand. For example, GanChoudhuri said the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people eat—they are now eating health snacks up to six times a day in front of screens—so companies have the chance to release new kinds of products.</p>
<p>Foresight Engine gives contextual information, said Upreti. “For example, is a food item eaten on the go, or at a cafe. Is a product consumed socially or individually? What’s trending at kids’ birthday parties? For a specific product of ingredient, images provide information on product pairings and product format.”</p>
<p>The platform’s uses data from sources like social media, search, blogs, recipes, menus and company data. “Datasets popular to each market are prioritized, like a local recipe or a food delivery app,” said GanChoudhuri. “And they are tracked over the years to determine growth trajectory with a stron degree of confidence.”</p>
<p>Some specific examples of how Ai Palette’s tech has translated into new products include brands that want to launch a new flavor, like for a potato chip or soda, in a specific country. They can use the Foresight Engine to not only see what trends are rising, but which ones have the potential to become long-term favorites, so they don’t invest in a product that will almost instantly lose its popularity.</p>
<p>Many of Ai Palette’s clients have used it to react to new trends and consumer behavior patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not surprisingly, people in many markets are interested in healthy food or ones that are supposed to boost immunity. For example, in Southeast Asia there is more demand for lemon and garlic, while acerola and yerba mate are trending in the United States.</p>
<p>On the other hand, “in China, taste is paramount, even over health, because people are looking for food that brings back a sense of normalcy,” said GanChoudhuri. Meanwhile in India, there is demand for products with longer shelf life as people continue to cope with the pandemic, but many consumers are also seeking interesting snacks to ease the boredom of lockdown, with kimchi and other Korean flavors becoming especially popular.</p>
<p>Ai Palette’s ability to work with many languages is one of the ways it differentiates from other machine learning-based trend prediction platforms. It currently supports English, simplified Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Bahasa Indonesian, Bahasa Melayu, Tagalog, Spanish, French and German), with plans to add more as it targets new European countries, Mexico, Latin America and the Middle East.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When is the last time your doctor treated you at home?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was once common practice for doctors to visit sick patients in their homes: In 1930, 40% of all consultations were house calls. By 1980, that figure was less than 1%.</p>
<p>Today, urgent care centers occupy Main Street storefronts and 33% of all medical expenditures occur in hospitals. It&#8217;s clear that the additional overhead is generating higher prices, but not necessarily better results, according to Sumi Das and Nina Gerson, who lead healthcare investments at Capital G.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can improve both outcomes and costs by moving care from the hospital back to the place it started — at home,&#8221; they write in a post that explores <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/back-to-the-suture-the-future-of-healthcare-is-in-the-home/">five innovations enabling at-home care</a> and identifies investment opportunities like acute care and infrastructure development.</p>
<p>Today, in-home care comprises just 3% of overall healthcare spending, but Gerson and Das estimate that will expand to 10% in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make these improvements, in-home healthcare strategies will need to leverage next-generation technology and value-based care strategies. Fortunately, the window of opportunity for change is open right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ritu Narayan founded Zūm with her two brothers in 2016 to disrupt student transportation, a space that hasn&#8217;t seen much innovation since pupils began finding their way to and from little red schoolhouses.</p>
<p>Since then, Zūm has inked partnerships with school districts around the country to create more efficient routes and reduce vehicle emissions.</p>
<p>By 2025, Narayan says her company will have 10,000 electric school buses and plans to put the fleet into service to generate power and feed it back to the grid.</p>
<p>To learn more about the company&#8217;s development, its immediate plans for the future and how the pandemic impacted operations, read on.</p>

<p>For The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm looked at recent financial data from scooter sharing service Bird, which &#8212; like Lyft, Uber, Airbnb and others &#8212; took a beating during the pandemic as potential riders stayed home.</p>
<p>Bird flipped its business model and its results improved, but it still has a ways to go. “In the bull case, Bird can get rid of its adjusted losses in a few years,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“If any issues arise at the top of the company’s table — say, for example, that rides per scooter do not scale as the company rolls out more hardware, or merely slower than expected — the anticipated profitability results could evaporate or be pushed into the future.”</p>

<p>By 2030, India&#8217;s SaaS industry is estimated to comprise 4%-6% of the global market and generate between $50 billion and $70 billion in yearly revenue, according to a SaaSBOOMi/McKinsey report.</p>
<p>“With the right approach, it won’t be long before the Indian SaaS community becomes a large-scale employer of talent, a significant contributor to India’s GDP and a creator of unmatched products,&#8221; says Manav Garg, CEO and founder of Eka Software Solutions.</p>
<p>In a guest post, he lays out several key growth drivers, which include &#8220;the largest concentration of developers in the world&#8221; and the fact that &#8220;SaaS is not a winner-take-all market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even so, the region still faces challenges, since &#8220;growth requires a growth mindset.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Alex Wilhelm has repeatedly noted in The Exchange, neoinsurance companies, from healthcare to auto to home and rental, have taken a whacking by the market.</p>
<p>But he hadn’t quite figured out why until he chatted with Pie Insurance co-founder and CEO John Swigart, who had an interesting hypothesis.</p>
<p>Summing up their conversation in a single sentence: &#8220;From the public markets’ perspective, it’s the results, stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ron Miller interviewed three Cisco executives to learn more about the company&#8217;s “rich history of buying its way to global success”:</p>
<ul>
<li>CFO Scott Herren</li>
<li>Derek Idemoto, SVP for corporate development and Cisco investments</li>
<li>Jeetu Patel, EVP and GM, Security and Collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its founding, Cisco has acquired 229 companies, buying more than 30 startups in the last four years that focus on everything from edtech to event management.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, one of the big reasons for all these acquisitions could be about maintaining growth,&#8221; writes Ron.</p>

<p>“Inflation may or may not prove transitory when it comes to consumer prices, but startup valuations are definitely rising — and noticeably so — in recent quarters.”</p>
<p>That’s Alex Wilhelm’s summation of a recent PitchBook report rounding up valuation data from U.S. startup funding events.</p>
<p>He dug into the report and analyzed what the numbers mean for startup valuations and potential exits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://moviesanywhere.com/">Movies Anywhere</a>, an app that allows you to centralize your digital movie collection from across services, is rolling out a new feature that will help you make better sense of your growing library. The company today introduced an AI-powered feature called &#8220;My Lists,&#8221; which automatically groups movies together based on any number of factors &#8212; like genre, actors, franchise, theme and more.</p>
<p>For digital movie collectors with larger libraries, the feature could make browsing through the available options feel more like scrolling through the recommendations you&#8217;d find on a modern-day streaming service, like Netflix. That is, instead of scrolling down through endless pages showing you all your purchased movies in order of purchase or alphabetically, as before, you can now quickly scan rows where the content is organized in ways that make it easier to discover what&#8217;s actually in your library.</p>
<p>For example, if you had purchased all the movies from a particular franchise, they would now be on their own row together. This is an improvement over how you had to locate these movies in your collection before &#8212; where they&#8217;d be sandwiched between the other titles you bought in between the franchise purchases.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Streaming services face their real test in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/streaming-services-face-their-real-test-in-2021/embed/#?secret=u32yo8loS5" data-secret="u32yo8loS5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You may also discover that you own a lot of movies within a particular category, like &#8220;Action Thrillers,&#8221; or those with a central theme, like &#8220;strong female friendships,&#8221; which could help you narrow down your movie night selection.</p>
<p>These algorithmically created lists can also be edited, allowing you to add or remove titles &#8212; or even delete the list altogether.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193535" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193535" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2193535" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="490" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg 1737w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=768,553 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=680,490 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=1536,1106 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193535" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Movies Anywhere</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plus, you can now make lists of your own, too. So you could make a list of favorites, movies you want to watch with your family, or however else you want to further organize your collection. You could even use the feature to make a &#8220;to watch&#8221; list of movies you&#8217;ve purchased, but hadn&#8217;t yet made time for.</p>
<p>The Movie Anywhere app has been around for years, but is now jointly operated by Disney, Universal, WB, Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox, after migrating to a new platform back in 2017. Its biggest selling point for digital movie collectors is that you can in one place get to all the movies you bought from various services. That includes digital downloads offered by iTunes, Vudu, Prime Video, YouTube, Xfinity and others. Before, you would have to switch from app to app to figure out if you had ever purchased a given title.</p>
<p>My Lists is one of many features the company has added over time to keep its app feeling current. Last year, for instance, it introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/movies-anywhere-officially-launches-its-digital-movie-lending-feature-screen-pass/">digital movie lending feature called Screen Pass</a>, and it earlier had launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/movies-anywhere-watch-together-parties-163017748.html">co-watching feature called Watch Together</a>, which let users watch with up to nine friends.</p>
<p>The new My Lists is available today in the Movies Anywhere mobile app, desktop and on streaming devices from the navigation bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Linktree, the popular “link in bio” service with more than 16 million users, is partnering with PayPal to expand its recently <a href="https://help.linktr.ee/en/support/solutions/articles/48001172633-what-are-commerce-links-">launched “Commerce Links” tools</a> for direct payment on Linktree globally. The Melbourne-based startup says creators in over 200 countries where PayPal operates can now accept payments through the transaction tools.</p>
<p>Launched in March, Commerce Links allow users to take payments directly on their Linktree profile without opening a new browser or tab. The new integration lets Linktree customers connect their PayPal account and receive payments from their followers or customers via PayPal, a debit card or a credit card. Linktree notes users can also access information regarding their transactions, payment conversion rate and more. The company says the available relevant data is meant to help creators manage their digital presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the creator economy grows, creators want new ways to collect payments and support from their audience with as little friction as possible,&#8221; said Linktree co-founder and CEO Alex Zaccaria in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to be collaborating with PayPal to further expand our solutions to our users globally and enable them to further manage and monetize their digital presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are two types of Commerce Links that creators can use to take payments from their followers and customers: A “Support Me Link” allows Linktree users to collect payments and donations from their visitors, while “Request Links” lets customers and followers request goods and services from creators directly from their Linktree profile.</p>
<p>Linktree says its collaboration with PayPal is the latest in a series of creator-focused efforts. The partnership announcement comes days after Linktree announced its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linktree-announces-acquisition-of-songlinkodesli-and-launches-music-link-feature-301358565.html">acquisition of automated music link aggregation platform Songlink/Odesli</a>. Linktree is integrating Songlink/Odesli into its newly launched “Music Link” feature, which automatically displays the same song or album across all music streaming services to let users listen to content on their preferred platform.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Linktree now competes with several “link in bio” platforms, including Shorby, Linkin.bio and Beacons. In March, Linktree announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">raised $45 million in Series B funding</a>. The funding round was co-led by Index Ventures and Coatue, with participation from returning investors AirTree Ventures and Insight Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity attacks against organizations of all sizes, the need to secure and manage user identities is of growing importance. Based in San Francisco, ForgeRock has raised $233 million in funding across multiple rounds. The company&#8217;s last round was a</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/forgerock-nabs-93-5m-for-its-id-management-platform-gears-up-next-for-an-ipo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$93.5 million Series E</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced in April 2020, which was led by Riverwood Capital alongside Accenture Ventures. At that time, CEO Fran Rosch told TechCrunch that the round would be the last before an IPO, which was also what former CEO Mike Ellis told us after the startup&#8217;s</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/identity-startup-forgerock-lands-88-million-series-d-investment/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$88 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the timing of its IPO might have been unclear over the last few years, the company has been on a positive trajectory for growth. In its</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543916/000119312521254144/d127368ds1.htm"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">S-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ForgeRock reported that as of June 30, its annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $155 million, representing 30% year-over-year growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While revenue is growing, losses are narrowing as the company reported a $20 million net loss down from $36 million a year ago. There certainly is a whole lot of room to grow, as the company estimates that the total global addressable market for identity services to be worth $71 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many competitors that ForgeRock faces is Okta, which went public in 2017 and has been growing in the years since. In March, Okta</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cloud identity startup Auth0 for $6.5 billion in a deal that</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/making-sense-of-the-6-5b-okta-auth0-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a few eyebrows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another competitor is Ping Identity, which went public in 2019 and is also growing, reporting on August 4 that its ARR hit $279.6 million in its quarter ended June 30, for a 19% year-over-year gain. There have also been a few big exits in the space over the years, including Duo Security, which was</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/cisco-is-buying-duo-security-for-2-35b-in-cash/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by Cisco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for $2.35 billion in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ForgeRock has a good access management tool and they continue to be a strong player in customer identity and access management (CIAM),” commented Michael Kelley, senior research director at Gartner.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley noted that in 2020, ForgeRock converted most of its core access management services to a SaaS delivery model, which helped the company catch up with the rest of the market that already offered access management as SaaS. Also last year the company expanded into identity governance, introducing a brand new identity, governance and administration (IGA) product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think one of the more interesting products that ForgeRock offers is ForgeRock Trees, which is a no-code/low-code orchestration tool for building complex authentication and authorization journeys for customers, which is particularly helpful in the CIAM market,” Kelly added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ForgeRock was founded in 2010, but its roots go back even further to an open-source single sign-on project known as OpenSSO that was created by Sun Microsystems in 2005. When Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in early 2010, a number of its open-source efforts were left to languish, which is what led a number of former Sun employees to start ForgeRock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, ForgeRock has expanded significantly beyond just providing a single sign-on to providing an identity platform that can handle consumer, enterprise and IoT use-cases. The company&#8217;s platform today handles identity and access management as well as identity governance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to scale is a key selling point that ForgeRock makes in the S-1, noting that its platform can handle over 60,000 user-based access transactions per second per customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As of June 30, 2021, we had four customers with 100 million or more licensed identities, the company stated in the S-1. &#8220;Our ability to serve mission-critical needs in complex environments for large customers enables us to grow our base of large customers and expand within each of them. &#8220;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following its announcement late last month, Facebook’s new 128GB model of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Oculus Quest 2</a> is now available to buy. You can purchase the VR headset from the <a href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Oculus;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:company’s website" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">company’s website</a> for the same $299 price as the previous 64GB base model. “Long story short? We’ve created this 128GB model so that players can easily store and access more games and apps on a single device,” Facebook says of the new variant.</p>
<p>Facebook announced the 128GB model at the same time it issued a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quest-2-foam-facial-interface-recall-163432642.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">voluntary recall of the Quest 2</a> to address an issue with the original face insert that came with the headset. The company temporarily stopped selling the Quest 2 for about a month so that it could add a new silicone face cover inside the box of each new unit. If you’re a current Quest 2 owner, you can request Facebook send you the new silicone cover by visiting the My Devices section of the account settings. The new 128GB model also comes with the silicone cover inside the box.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From a high level, all of the recent deal-making in corporate cards and spend management shows that it’s not enough to just help companies track what employees are expensing these days.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, spend management startup Ramp said it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">raised a $300 million Series C</a> that valued it at $3.9 billion. It also said it was acquiring Buyer, a “negotiation-as-a-service” platform that it believes will help customers save money on purchases and SaaS products.</p>
<p>The round and deal were announced just a week after competitor Brex shared news of its own acquisition — the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brex-buys-weav-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platforms-for-50m/">$50 million purchase</a> of Israeli fintech startup Weav. That deal was made after Brex’s founders invested in Weav, which offers a &#8220;universal API for commerce platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a high level, all of the recent deal-making in corporate cards and spend management shows that it’s not enough to just help companies track what employees are expensing these days. As the market matures and feature sets begin to converge, the players are seeking to differentiate themselves from the competition.</p>
<p>But the point of interest here is these deals can tell us where both companies think they can provide and extract the most value from the market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			These differences come atop another layer of divergence between the two companies: While Brex has instituted a paid software tier of its service, Ramp has not.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Earning more by spending less</h2>
<p>Let’s start with Ramp.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/"> Launched in 2019</a>, the company is a relative newcomer in the spend management category. But by all accounts, it’s producing some impressive growth numbers. As our colleague Mary Ann Azevedo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the company says it has seen its number of cardholders on its platform increase by 5x, with more than 2,000 businesses currently using Ramp as their “primary spend management solution.” The transaction volume on its corporate cards has tripled since April, when its last raise was announced. And, impressively, Ramp has seen its transaction volume increase year over year by 1,000%, according to CEO and co-founder Eric Glyman.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ramp&#8217;s focus has always been on helping its customers save money: It touts a 1.5% cash back reward for all purchases made through its cards, and says its dashboard helps businesses identify duplicitous subscriptions and license redundancies. Ramp also alerts customers when they can save money on annual versus monthly subscriptions, which it says has led many customers to do away with established T&amp;E platforms like Concur or Expensify.</p>
<p>All told, the company claims that the average customer saves 3.3% per year on expenses after switching to its platform — and all that is before it brings Buyer into the fold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flockjay.com/">Flockjay</a>, a bootcamp startup that helps laid off people and job seekers break into tech, cut half of its own employees amid a broader pivot to a B2B SaaS platform, TechCrunch has learned from sources close to the company.</p>
<p>The layoffs impacted every nontechnical team at Flockjay, including admission advisers, biz ops and development, partnerships, recruiting and marketing professionals. An estimated 30 to 45 people were laid off via an all-hands meeting, which accounts for at least half of Flockjay’s full-time staff. A hiring list of those impacted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6835668009177235456/">has already been highly circulated on LinkedIn.</a></p>
<p>“As a mission-driven organization, we care deeply about our graduates not only landing jobs, but also earning promotions and becoming future leaders of their companies. We learned while growing how important it is to invest early in building scalable support for our alumni, the teams they are on, and all mission-aligned sales organizations to level the playing field,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/shaanh?lang=en">CEO Shaan Hathiramani</a> in a statement to TechCrunch. “That meant making the difficult but necessary decision to run our classes in a more limited capacity while we focus on building that platform. We recognize that this decision has real human consequences, especially considering how talented and tightknit our team is.”</p>
<p>The startup graduated from Y Combinator in 2019 with a simple goal: serve as an onramp for people to break into tech careers. Flockjay’s core offering is a 10-week sales training bootcamp that helps place graduates into sales jobs across tech companies — about 80% of the company’s students find a job within the first six months of graduation,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/backed-by-marc-benioff-flockjay-pitches-its-sales-training-service-as-an-onramp-to-tech-careers/"> the company said in January.</a> The graduates of the course, otherwise known as Flockjay Tech Fellows, make an average of $75,000 upon graduation.</p>
<p>This core offering will continue to function but in a limited capacity for now, according to documents obtained by TechCrunch. It will come at a cost to diverse talent. In a previous interview, Flockjay confirmed that roughly 40% of students don’t have a four-year college degree; half of the students identify as female or nonbinary, and half of the company’s students identify as Black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>As Hathiramani&#8217;s comment alludes to, the company has spent years training students on how to be competitive hires for sales teams, so assumedly, it has key insight on what tech companies need today from an infrastructure and human perspective. A B2B SaaS tool focused on sales operations and efficiency could bring Flockjay more predictable revenue and assumedly less labor-intensive work.</p>

<p>Layoffs could signal changing tides for the broader edtech industry, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/edtechs-next-mission-go-everywhere/">a sector revitalized by the pandemic.</a> While it is true that learners shifted online, there are still questions around what purpose non-accredited training programs, such as Flockjay, serve, one investor said. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/career-karma-series-a/">With so many options in the market,</a> users have optionality on what service they frequent — and the service may indeed be the one that has a flashy university partnership that validates their program and offers a safety net.</p>
<p>Flockjay’s struggles also put a spotlight on the highly scrutinized income-share agreements, ISAs. The financial instrument essentially allows students to avoid paying upfront fees to attend a bootcamp, and then ultimately pay back class fees through a percentage of their future income. While ISAs play a role in making education more accessible in the beginning, satisfying those agreements post-employment can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/lambda-school-lawsuits/">where the controversy begins around liability.</a> Lambda School, a well-known company in the tech bootcamp world, also uses ISAs. The startup announced that it would be doing a broader restructuring earlier this year, while also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">laying off 65 of its employees.</a></p>
<p>Flockjay has raised $11 million in known ventures and capital to date. Since its founding, the startup has attracted investments from Serena Williams, Gabrielle Union and Will Smith, along with institutional investors including Lightspeed, Coatue, Y Combinator, eVentures, Salesforce Ventures, the Impact America Fund and Cleo Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fika.vc/">Fika Ventures</a> is a five-year-old, LA-based seed-stage fund that has been funding mostly business-to-business startups, as well as fintech companies and a sprinkling of healthcare IT startups &#8212; as long as they don&#8217;t involve hardware or FDA approval.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s investors apparently think it&#8217;s doing a decent job. After raising $41 million for its debut fund, followed by a $77 million fund that Fika closed in 2019, the outfit is today announcing a third flagship fund with $160 million to invest, along with an opportunity-type fund with $35 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a major endorsement for such a young firm. Still, even with upwards of 10 promising portfolio companies &#8212; including Formative, a Santa Monica, California-based platform for K-12 teachers to create assessments that raised<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/formative-a-student-learning-and-analytics-platform-raises-70m-to-challenge-the-summative-test-based-approach-to-education/"> $70 million</a> in June; Pipe, a Miami-based startup that lets companies sell their recurring revenue streams on its platform and raised $250 million at a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">$2 billion valuation</a> in May; and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://papayaglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Papaya Global</a>, an Israeli startup that sells payroll, hiring, onboarding and compliance service and raised <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/papaya-global-raises-100m-more-at-a-1b-valuation-for-tools-to-hire-pay-and-manage-distributed-workforces/">$100 million</a> earlier this year &#8212; it&#8217;s getting harder right now to do what they do, say firm cofounders Eva Ho and TX Zhou. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a crazy time,&#8221; Ho offers.</p>
<p>We had a candid conversation with the pair yesterday, edited lightly for length below.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This is now one of the bigger seed-stage firms in LA. What percentage of your investments are local?</strong></p>
<p>EH: We feel like we have a home court advantage here, so about 40% of our deals are here, then the rest are in markets like Seattle, New York, Boston, Austin, Chicago. We recently did a deal in Toronto because they have a nice AI community there. But we still very much believe in needing boots on the ground, so go after geographies where we can fly to board meetings and be there physically to support [our founders] when they need us.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Your new flagship fund is more than twice the size of your last fund. How will that impact how much you invest?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TZ: Our check sizes will grow a bit in tandem with the market. As you know, seed rounds are now quite a bit larger. I think initial checks will be in the $1 million to $3 million range; with the last fund, we reserved up to $6 million per company and now we&#8217;ll reserve up to $10 million.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Tell us a little about investing in a market where everybody is a founder, and everyone is also an investor. </strong></p>
<p>EH: It&#8217;s definitely a crazy time. It feels like we&#8217;re running a marathon <em>and</em> trying to be in a sprint. We have to have the long view and make bets with that horizon in mind, but at the same time, the decisions for initial and follow-on rounds have gotten just a lot faster.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you continue to make good decisions when things are moving so fast?</strong></p>
<p>EH: The things we&#8217;ve been doing include increasing the size of the team and doing more work upfront on an industry so that we have more prepared minds coming in. But it continues to be a struggle because everything has been sort of compressed.</p>

<p>TZ: I think in the past, seed funds could get away with being pure generalists, even within sectors. But we&#8217;ve been forced over the last 12 months to really understand even more sub sectors within each of our verticals. For example, within fintech, we&#8217;ve kind of taken a deep dive in real estate and insurance, and that helps us come into deals [prepared] given how fast they&#8217;re moving these days.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What is the fastest deal you&#8217;ve done?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: In the past, deals that we were looking at were getting done in two to three weeks; now the average time is probably a week to a week-and-a-half to make a final decision. I&#8217;d say the fastest we&#8217;ve moved is in five days, in a situation where we&#8217;ve known the entrepreneur for years so there was strong validation on a personal level. There was also good founder-market fit in terms of what they wanted to do.</p>
<p>EH: We just pull ourselves out of certain rounds that are moving [super fast] and/or valuation expectation upfront is just crazy. You see a lot of pre-seed rounds right now that are pre-product, pre-traction, pre-revenue that are done at $15 million or $20 million or $30 million post-money valuations. We&#8217;ll certainly flex for the right things, but there is just a lot of froth in the market right now.</p>
<p><strong>TC: If the terms are right, are you funding pre-seed, pre-product, pre-traction teams?</strong></p>
<p>EH: To be very frank, we have moved a little earlier in some cases. In the first fund, we [invested about] 15% in pre-seed startups, which to us means very early product and very early traction and sometimes no traction. In fund two, we&#8217;ve invested maybe 25% in pre-seed deals because the really good founders who&#8217;ve been shown that they&#8217;re able to execute and have vision &#8212; they get snapped up quickly, so you have to adapt and evolve a bit and move downstream a little more. That said, I think almost all the companies we fund have some sort of [minimum viable product] and some initial design partners in place, even if they don&#8217;t have any meaningful revenues yet.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What percentage of your investments in your most recent fund have gone to repeat founders?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: I&#8217;d say 15% to 20%. Obviously, we can&#8217;t and don&#8217;t limit ourselves to [serial entrepreneurs], but with repeat founders, deals move even faster than before.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the most absurd thing you&#8217;ve seen in this go-go market?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: I think the most absurd thing we&#8217;ve heard are funds that are making decisions after a 30-minute call with the founder.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you ever pass on a company because you&#8217;re not that excited about the rest of the cap table?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: The speed of deals has forced us to really quickly home in on what we care about. In the past, we had the luxury of having this long laundry list of things we wanted to check off and in a positive way, we&#8217;ve been forced to home in on the three to five things that we really care about for each deal.</p>

<p>The bigger challenge is that investors who decide in 30 minutes create unrealistic expectations by founders. Sometimes they expect everyone to process information that quickly, and I think what they&#8217;re missing is that these funds are not processing the information.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s one way you get founders to slow down and pay attention?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: We actually give every founder that we&#8217;ve come close to making a decision on a complete list of every single founder that we&#8217;ve backed in the past with their contact information.</p>
<p>Initially, we did this to help us win deals, but I think very quickly founders get a sense of what it&#8217;s like to work with us, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly every top investment bank is chasing Byju’s and nudging the most valuable Indian startup to seriously explore the public markets as soon as next year.</p>
<p>Most banks have given Byju’s a proposed valuation in the range of $40 billion to $45 billion, but some including Morgan Stanley have pitched a $50 billion valuation if the startup lists next year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>The startup, which has raised $1.5 billion since the beginning of the pandemic last year, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">most recently valued at $16.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The banks’ excitement comes as the Indian public market has shown a glimpse of strong appetite for consumer tech stocks. Food delivery Zomato had a stellar $1.3 billion debut on Indian stock exchanges last month. Scores of other top startups including Paytm, PolicyBazaar, Nykaa, Ixigo and MobiKwik have also filed paperworks for their IPOs.</p>
<p>Byju Raveendran (pictured above), the founder and chief executive of the eponymous startup, has publicly suggested in the past that he may list the firm in two to three years. According to a senior executive, who wishes to not be named as the matter is private, and an investor, the startup has not set a concrete timeline for an IPO.</p>
<p>In the immediate future, odds of Byju’s raising again is high. The startup has received several inbound requests from investors to raise at a valuation of about $21.5 billion, the people said.</p>
<p>The startup has used a significant portion of its recent fundraises to acquire firms. Earlier this year, it acquired Indian physical coaching institute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">Aakash for nearly $1 billion</a>. It has also acquired Great Learning, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/byjus-acquires-reading-platform-epic-for-500-million-in-us-expansion-push/">U.S.-based Epic</a>, among others, for over $1 billion in cash and stock deals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.</p>
<p>The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth, and those of several other online learning startups including Unacademy and Vedantu.</p>
<p>As of early this year, Byju’s said it had amassed over 80 million users, 5.5 million of whom are paying subscribers. Byju’s, which is profitable, is on track to generate revenue of $300 million in the U.S. this year (per Raveendran), and as high as $1.1 billion in revenue overall by the end of the calendar year, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Byju’s declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global startup community is currently enjoying a period of fundraising success that may be unprecedented in the history of technology and venture capital. While this is happening around the world, few startup hubs in the world are reveling in a greater boost to their ability to attract capital than Boston.</p>
<p>The well-known U.S. city is a traditional venture capital hub, but one that seemed to fall behind its domestic rivals Silicon Valley and New York City in recent years. However, data indicates that Boston’s startup activity in fundraising terms has reached a new, higher plateau, funneling record sums into the city’s upstart technology companies this year.</p>
<p>And, according to local investors, there could be room for further acceleration in capital disbursement.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The Exchange wanted to better understand what&#8217;s driving Boston’s rapid-fire results, and discover if there is any particular need for caution or concern. Is the market overheated? According to local investors<a href="https://twitter.com/robgo"> Rob Go</a> from NextView, <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieagoldstein">Jamie Goldstein</a> from Pillar VC, <a href="https://twitter.com/lilylyman">Lily Lyman</a> from Underscore and <a href="https://twitter.com/sanjivkalevar">Sanjiv Kalevar</a> from OpenView, things may be more than warm, but Boston’s accelerating venture capital totals in 2021 are not based on FOMO or other potentially ephemeral trends.</p>
<p>Instead, Boston is benefiting from larger structural changes to at least the U.S. venture capital market, helping close historical gaps in its startup funding market and access funds that previously might have skipped the region. And local university density isn’t hurting the city’s cause, either, boosting its ability to form new companies during a period of rich investment access.</p>
<p>Let’s talk data, and then hear from the investing crew about just what is going on over in Beantown.</p>
<h2>A record year in the making</h2>
<p>When discussing venture capital data, we often note that it is somewhat laggy, with rounds announced long after they are closed. In practice, this means that more recent data can undersell how a particular quarter has performed. With Boston’s 2021 thus far, all that we can say is that if this data includes normal venture capital lag, it will simply be all the more incredible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ispace, a Japanese space startup that aims to lead the development of a lunar economy, has unveiled its design for a large lander that could go to the moon as early as 2024.</p>
<p>Tokyo-based ispace said this next-gen lander, dubbed Series 2, would be used on the company’s third planned moon mission. The lander is both larger in size and payload capacity than the company’s first lander, coming in at around 9 feet tall and 14 feet wide including legs. The vehicle will be capable of carrying up to 500 kilograms to the moon’s surface and 2,000 kilograms to lunar orbit. Series 1, which will fly in 2022 and 2023, has a maximum payload capacity of only 30 kilograms.</p>
<p>Crucially, the new lander is designed to be able to survive the frigid lunar nighttime, possibly as long as a two-week stint on the moon’s surface. It’s also capable of landing on either the near or far side of the moon, including its polar regions.</p>
<p>The new lander has a few other features as well: It has multiple payload bays, and an advanced guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system to ensure the craft sticks the landing on the moon&#8217;s surface. The GNC technology is being provided by engineering developer Draper, a company with a deep footprint in the space industry. Draper is also one of 14 eligible contractors for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.</p>
<p>Ispace said in a statement that the lander has completed its preliminary design review; the next stage is manufacturing and assembly, which will be completed in partnership with General Atomics, a defense and aerospace technology company.</p>
<p>The partnership with Draper — a CLPS contractor — is key, as ispace wants its Series 2 to compete in the NASA program. “Over the next few months, we will work closely with Draper and General Atomics to prepare for the next NASA CLPS task order,” Kyle Acierno, CEO of ispace’s U.S.-based subsidiary, said.</p>
<p>Ispace is developing the next-gen lander out of its North American offices in Colorado, and it intends to also manufacture the vehicle in the United States. In the meanwhile, the company is still at work preparing for its first two lunar missions in 2022 and 2023. The company said the Series 1 lander is undergoing final assembly of the flight module at a facility in Germany owned by space launch company ArianeGroup. The customer manifest for the first mission is full, but ispace did say payload capacity is still available for the subsequent mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The lander unveiling comes just weeks after ispace announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/japanese-startup-ispace-raises-46m-to-support-planned-moon-missions/">the close</a> of a $46 million Series C funding round, capital it said at the time would go toward the second and third planned missions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re less than one month away from kicking off our flagship global event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. And we’re feeling the adrenaline rush that can only come when more than 10,000 startup icons, experts, founders, investors and makers gather to learn, inspire, connect, collaborate, compete and network.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">Buy your pass here</a> and brace yourself for three full days of Disrupt.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at just some of the opportunities that can help you move the needle on your startup aspirations.</p>
<p>You’ll find plenty of startup action on two distinct stages. First up, the Disrupt main stage featuring in-depth interviews and panel discussions with a who’s-who of tech, policy and celebrity-slash-entrepreneurial talent — like Calendly CEO Tope Awotona, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and movie-star-turned-pot-businessman Seth Rogen.</p>
<p>The Extra Crunch stage is where you’ll find a deep bench of subject-matter experts sharing practical how-to content. You’ll take away actionable insights you can put into practice now — when you need it most. We’re talking essential topics like <strong>How to Raise Your First Dollars</strong> and <strong>The Subtle Challenges of Assessing Product-Market Fit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip of the tech iceberg:</strong> Check out the full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 agenda</a> and don’t forget — your pass includes video-on-demand. You can relax knowing you won’t miss a single presentation.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the hundreds of innovative startups strutting their considerable stuff in Startup Alley, the virtual expo area. Dive into an ocean of opportunity — ask for a product demo, schedule a 1:1 video meeting or explore potential ways to collaborate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Networking is a huge part of Disrupt, and you’ll find multiple ways to make valuable connections. Whether they happen spontaneously in our virtual event platform (the chat is where it’s at!) or curated meetups through CrunchMatch, our AI-powered platform, you’ll meet smart, exciting people eager to make a business connection. Who knows where a simple conversation can lead?</p>
<p>Don’t miss Startup Battlefield — the epic pitch competition that launched big-name companies like Dropbox, Mint, TripIt, Vurb and many more. Top early-stage startups from around the world — from any country and industry — will compete for a shot at $100,000 in equity-free prize money. You might just catch the next unicorn in its pony stage. It’s more than thrilling — as noted by Jessica McLean, director of Marketing and Communications, Infinite-Compute:</p>
<blockquote><p>Watching the Startup Battlefield was fantastic. You could see the ingenuity and innovation happening in different technology spaces. Just looking at the sheer number of other pitch decks and hearing the judges tear them down and give feedback was very helpful.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place September 21-23 — that’s less than a month away, folks! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your pass</a>, plan your schedule and get ready to join your people and move your business forward.</p>

Other than the name, USDP remains fundamentally identical [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.paxos.com">Paxos</a>, the company behind the Paxos Standard stablecoin (PAX), has <a href="https://www.paxos.com/the-digital-dollar-that-always-equals-a-dollar-paxos-standard-pax-is-now-pax-dollar-usdp/">announced</a> that it is changing the name of its crypto asset. Paxos Standard is now Pax Dollar, and you’ll soon be able to identify it on your favorite cryptocurrency exchange, wallet or explorer under the USDP ticker.</p>
<p>Other than the name, USDP remains fundamentally identical to PAX. Like other stablecoins, USDP has been invented so that its value doesn’t fluctuate over time when you compare it to fiat currencies. The value of USDP is indexed to USD. At any point in time, one USDP is worth one USD.</p>
<p>Stablecoins provide many advantages. Sending money is as easy as moving crypto assets from one wallet to another. You don’t have to enter intermediary bank information, worry about local regulation, etc. Many people around the world don’t have bank accounts — stablecoins and cryptocurrency wallets could potentially become an alternative to traditional bank accounts.</p>
<p>You can also use stablecoins to take advantage of DeFi projects (decentralized finance). For instance, you can contribute to lending pools and earn interest from your stablecoin holdings.</p>
<p>In addition to USDP, other popular stablecoins include USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT). As you can see, a naming convention has emerged over time. And Paxos says that it is changing the name of its stablecoin for this reason in particular.</p>
<p>Whenever Paxos issues new tokens, it stores some USD and USD equivalent in a bank account. Right now, Paxos <a href="https://www.paxos.com/a-regulated-stablecoin-means-having-a-regulator/">uses</a> US Treasury Bills with short maturities as USD equivalent. Auditing firms regularly check the company’s claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paxos tries to position itself as a company that is deeply committed to regulation. It has recently written <a href="https://www.paxos.com/a-regulated-stablecoin-means-having-a-regulator/">a report</a> highlighting the differences between USDP, USDC and USDT. According to the company, USDC and USDT shouldn’t be considered as regulated assets because of their reserves. Paxos wants to emerge as the most legitimate player in the space so that big corporate clients choose Paxos as their preferred partner.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Circle announced that USDC would <a href="https://www.centre.io/blog/usdc-reserves-composition">switch</a> to cash and cash equivalent for USDC reserves. I’m sure we’ll hear more from cryptocurrency companies and their stablecoin reserve strategies in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“In order to become a better writer, read your written words out loud.”</p>
<p>That’s one of the first, and best, writing tips I ever received. I always found the advice ironic because it required me to change the medium of my writing to become a better writer. Still, all these years later, it&#8217;s true: Vocalizing your words helps identify typos and incomplete thoughts, but also notice more subtle things like awkward turns of phrases or a weird rhythm in your sentence structure. Best of all, if you find yourself bored of your own text while reading out loud, you know readers will be, too.</p>
<p>This is all to say that writing, even for those who love writing, is a deeply human art built on top of non-obvious rules. While those complications don’t exactly scream for a tech solution, <a href="http://noredink.com">NoRedInk</a>, a San Francisco-based startup, has spent nearly a decade trying to help students get better at their writing through software.</p>
<p>NoRedInk announced today that its digital writing curriculum, which pairs adaptive learning with Mad Libs-style prompts, has helped it raise a $50 million Series B led by Susquehanna Growth Equity, with participation from True Ventures. Other investors in the company include GSV, Rethink Education and Kapor Capital.</p>
<p>The financing event comes nearly six years after its Series A, a signal that the company has ambition to scale meaningfully in the coming months and years. With millions more, though, NoRedInk has to address its biggest challenge: the intricacies of the subject matter that it wants to make simple.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffscheur"> Jeff Scheur</a> built NoRedInk in 2012 when he was an English teacher in Chicago. The site served as a way to help kids get more than &#8220;red ink&#8221; on their papers, a nod at how teachers often use red ink to mark corrections and suggestions on assignments.</p>
<p>“Kids get feedback on their paper and they have no idea what to do with it,” Scheur said. “They see the grade, but they tend to just throw it out … so I started building tools to figure out how to help [students] apply very difficult to learn skills that we expect kids to know, but don’t explicitly teach them.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since launch, NoRedInk’s goal is to help students with writing skills ranging from how to structure an essay to how to cut fluff from their arguments to how to cite correctly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193365" style="width: 875px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193365" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2193365" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png" alt="" width="865" height="458" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png 2182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=1536,812 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=2048,1083 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-WritingAssignments.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193365" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NoRedInk</p></div></p>
<p>“One of the great challenges about teaching writing is that we want to demystify the process of becoming a great writer without reducing the art form of expression,” he said. “So that means providing kids with lots of targeted personalized practice, and helping them realize that there’s no one way to write.”</p>
<p>It thus makes sense that NoRedInk uses adaptive learning, an educational method that uses an algorithm to get inputs of learners, such as strength areas or preferences, to create an output that better meets them where they are. After asking students for their favorite characters and role models, NoRedInk creates personalized writing exercises targeting each student’s interests, then guides them through the writing process with light support.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193362" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193362" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2193362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png" alt="noredink" width="857" height="344" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png 6814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=768,308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=680,273 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=1536,616 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=2048,821 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NoRedInk-Practice2.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NoRedInk</p></div></p>
<p>Scheur described part of the goal of NoRedInk as “breaking down difficult to learn skills with various degrees of scaffolding.”</p>
<p>To date, more than 10 billion exercises have been completed on NoRedInk’s practice engine &#8212; which is data the company uses to underscore problem areas, shared struggles and potential blind spots of traditional curriculum for its districts.</p>
<p>NoRedInk has a free-but-limited version of its platform for teachers to try, but offers a full-fledged premium version that integrates with learning management systems and other classrooms to offer a school and district a view of progress.</p>
<p>As the business expands, NoRedInk might need to get deeper into drafts in order to win over market share. Will it ever play the role of suggesting tone the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/grammarly-raises-90m-at-over-1b-valuation-for-its-ai-based-grammar-and-writing-tools/">that AI-based grammar and writing unicorn Grammarly does</a>? For now, it appears not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grammarly is a great consumer app, it&#8217;s a modern-day version of Grammar spellcheck that Microsoft Word did all those years ago,&#8221; Scheur said. &#8220;NoRedInk is very different; it&#8217;s what schools and districts use to teach skills.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aileen Lee is one of the most prestigious and successful venture capitalists of the past decade. Before starting her own firm in Cowboy Ventures, Lee was a partner at KPCB for more than 12 years. Her portfolio includes DocSend, Ironclad, Philz Coffee, StyleSeat and many, many more.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Lee join us alongside one of her portfolio company founders, Guild Education&#8217;s Rachel Carlson, on an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-with-cowboy-ventures-and-guild-education?ref=2981607eb662">Click to register for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live brings founders and their investors together to pop the lid off of the black box that is fundraising. How did they meet? Why did they choose each other? What got them to yes? How do they work together now?</p>
<p>These are the pieces of the fundraising process that often aren&#8217;t covered in your average &#8220;how to fundraise&#8221; blog posts and programming, and we&#8217;re here to get these questions answered.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> also features the ECL Pitch-off, which gives folks in the audience the chance to raise their hand and pitch their startup to our guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. Let&#8217;s get to know our guests.</p>
<p>Lee has been one of the most sought-after investors in Silicon Valley for as long as I&#8217;ve been in tech. A founding partner at All Raise, she is committed to diversity and inclusion and has an eye for talent, realizing that the former often precedes the latter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She&#8217;s been on the Midas List a handful of times, and is also listed as one of Forbes&#8217; most influential people.</p>
<p>Rachel Carlson founded Guild Education in 2015 and has led the company since. Guild has raised upwards of $370 million from investors that include General Catalyst, Felicis, Bessemer and more.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about how to get to yes, what sings in a pitch deck and how they operate as partners to this day.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every time you turn around, someone new is winning the war in California around organizing workers in the sharing economy.</p>
<p>Labor struck first when California legislators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/gig-worker-bill-ab-5-passes-in-california/">passed</a> Assembly Bill 5, requiring all independent contractors working for gig economy companies to be reclassified as employees. That was expected to set off a chain reaction in state legislatures nationwide, until two things happened.</p>
<p>First, COVID-19 hit and quickly became all-encompassing, making it virtually impossible for lawmakers and regulators to focus on anything but surviving the pandemic. Second, Uber, Lyft, Instacart and others funded and voters approved Prop 22 in California, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/prop-22-results/">striking down</a> AB-5 and returning sharing economy workers to independent contractor status.</p>
<p>On the same day that Prop 22 passed, Democrats captured both chambers of Congress in Washington, but their margins were so slim (50-50 in the Senate and a nine-vote majority in the House), that federal legislative action on the issue was near impossible. Across the country, politicians read the tea leaves of Prop 22 and decided to mainly stay away. That kept the issue at bay during the 2021 state legislative sessions.</p>
<p>But the tide started to turn again this summer. First, U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Virginia) introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/842?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22protecting+the+right+to+organize%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1">PRO Act</a> in February 2021, stating that workers would be reclassified using an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/the-lobbying-is-fast-and-furious-as-gig-companies-seek-relief-from-pro-labor-supreme-court-ruling/">ABC test</a>, in addition to rolling back right-to-work laws in states and establishing monetary penalties for companies and executives who violate workers’ rights.</p>
<p>The bill handily passed the House in March, but has since stalled in the Senate, despite receiving a hearing and energetic support by high-profile senators including Bernie Sanders and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s appointees to the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board are decidedly in favor of full-time-worker status. And now, a California Superior Court judge has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">ruled</a> Prop 22 unconstitutional, saying it violates the right of the state legislature to pass future laws around worker safety and status.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sharing economy companies are expected to appeal, and the case could <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/20/uber-lyft-prop-22-unconstitutional/">ultimately</a> wind up before the California Supreme Court.</p>
<p>So now what? The courts will ultimately determine the status of sharing economy workers in California, but since the decision will be about the specific legal parameters of California’s referendum process, it won’t determine the issue elsewhere. And despite noise from Washington, Congress isn’t passing the PRO Act any time soon (Democrats may try to include it in the reconciliation for the $3.5 trillion American Families Plan, but the odds of its survival are low). That means the action returns to the states.</p>
<p>New York is the biggest battleground outside of California. Democrats have amassed a supermajority in both chambers of the legislature, and New York lacks a referendum vehicle to overturn state law.</p>
<p>Sharing economy workers are the biggest organizing opportunity for private sector unions in decades, and labor will use all of its influence to pass worker classification reform in 2022.</p>
<p>However, Kathy Hochul, New York’s new governor, is a moderate, and state legislators recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/uber-new-york-union-bill-is-dead-for-this-year-sponsor-says">abandoned</a> a half-baked plan brokered by gig companies to safeguard independent contractor status, indicating a resolution on the issue will likely take time.</p>
<p>Illinois is fertile ground for worker reclassification, too, but the state <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/lyft-won-big-in-california-now-its-set-its-sights-on-illinois/">remains</a> a question mark.</p>
<p>There’s also a chance of movement in Massachusetts, where gig companies are making a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/uber-ceo-calls-massachusetts-gig-economy-ballot-measure-the-right-answer/">play</a> to establish a ballot initiative very similar to Prop 22. Legislators in <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattles-covid-19-rules-have-paid-off-for-delivery-app-drivers-whats-next/">Seattle</a> and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/ab5-gig-worker-employees-independent-contractors-philadelphia-uber-lyft-20190911.html">Pennsylvania</a> have also signaled an interest in exploring the issue.</p>
<p>And just a few months after most state legislative sessions conclude next summer, we’ll hit the midterm elections, which could produce a Republican wave (especially in the House) that would yet again quash the chances of worker classification legislation passing anywhere.</p>
<p>In other words, this is going to ping back and forth for at least the next few years in the courts, in state legislatures, and in the halls of Congress and federal agencies. If you’re a sharing economy investor and you want this issue resolved once and for all, that peace of mind isn’t coming. And the market, rather than accepting that this will be an unresolved issue for the next few years, will probably overreact to each individual action, whether it’s a lower court ruling or a piece of legislation making its way through a state.</p>
<p>In reality, the answer is the same as it’s always been: Trying to shoehorn sharing economy workers into one of two existing categories &#8212; 1099 or W-2 &#8212; doesn’t work. We still need to recognize that the inherent nature of work has changed over the last decade, and we need to recognize that both parties &#8212; the sharing economy companies and the unions &#8212; are only looking out for their own interests and coffers at the expense of what’s best for actual workers.</p>
<p>California is not going to resolve this issue. It’s just swung back and forth from one extreme to another. Congress is not going to resolve this issue because it almost never resolves anything.</p>
<p>So the game comes down to states like Illinois, New York and Massachusetts. It comes down to legislators and leaders trying to craft good public policy at the expense of their donors and supporters and Twitter followers &#8212; and then it comes down to their colleagues doing the same.</p>
<p>It means sacrificing politics for policy. That almost never happens. And it probably won’t happen here, either. So if you’re trying to game out where this issue is going, accept the uncertainty and expect that a thoughtful, smart resolution &#8212; locally or nationally &#8212; is unlikely. It’s a dissatisfying conclusion but, sadly, it epitomizes exactly where our politics stand today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A quick survey of many of the most highly valued electric vertical take-off and landing companies shows one thing in common: All of them are developing aircraft powered by batteries. But a growing suite of aviation companies, turned off by what they see as the energy density limitations of lithium-ion batteries, are turning instead to hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p>This is where HyPoint comes in. The two-year-old company has been working with a number of eVTOL companies, like ZeroAvia, on air-cooled hydrogen fuel cell systems that it says have triple the power-to-weight ratio of traditional liquid-cooled hydrogen fuel cells. Now, the fuel cell developer is adding Piasecki Aircraft Corporation to its list of partners.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two companies is being minted with a $6.5 million multiphase development agreement for the design and certification of hydrogen fuel cell systems. Through the partnership, HyPoint aims to deliver five full-scale, 650 kilowatt hydrogen fuel cell systems for ground testing, demo flights and the certification process.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system that has four times the energy density of existing lithium-ion batteries, double the specific power of existing hydrogen fuel cell systems, and that costs up to 50% less relative to the operative costs of turbine-powered rotorcraft. HyPoint unveiled a prototype of the new technology in March.</p>

<p>Through the deal, Piasecki will have exclusive license to the tech created as a result of the partnership. It aims to use the technology for use in its PA-890 manned helicopter, which it says would be the first hydrogen-powered helicopter on the market. HyPoint will maintain exclusive ownership of the fuel cell system.</p>
<p>The two companies said in a statement that they intend to make the system available to other eVTOL makers as well. “Piasecki is ready to support other eVTOL makers with Hypoint,” HyPoint CEO Alex Ivanenko told TechCrunch</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The agreement started with a feasibility study, in which HyPoint created a very small-scale prototype to show proof-of-concept. Now, the company is in the design stage, at work building a single power module (each 650 kW system contains several), and an integration concept of the system in Piasecki’s aircraft. The single power module will be ready by the end of this year, with the first 650 kW system being delivered to Piasecki in 2023, and a commercially available product by around 2025.</p>

<p>The two companies have also developed a certification roadmap that outlines when HyPoint needs to deliver systems, to ensure that they’re ready for testing and demo flights with the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>“Our objective is to develop full-scale systems within two years to support on-aircraft certification testing in 2024 and fulfill existing customer orders for up to 325 units starting in 2025,” John Piasecki, CEO of Piasecki, said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said on Tuesday the company plans to offer free temporary housing to 20,000 Afghan refugees around the world amid the Taliban’s rise to power in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Chesky said the company will cover the costs for the housing, using funds from contributions to its nonprofit Airbnb.org and a specific Refugee Fund established by that division, as well as personal contributions from Chesky himself. Airbnb will also work alongside NGOs through Airbnb.org, which provides people with emergency housing in times of crisis.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting today, Airbnb will begin housing 20,000 Afghan refugees globally for free.</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Chesky (@bchesky) <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1430067315228352512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“The displacement and resettlement of Afghan refugees in the U.S. and elsewhere is one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time. We feel a responsibility to step up,” Chesky said <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1430067315228352512">in a tweet.</a></p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, Chesky said Airbnb hosts who are willing to offer up their residences will soon be able to sign up to accommodate a refugee family fleeing Afghanistan. Airbnb plans on sharing more details on how hosts and the broader community can support the initiative. Chesky said he hopes Airbnb’s initiative will inspire other business leaders to do the same.</p>
<p>The company said it has already worked with partners to place 165 refugees in safe housing after reaching the U.S. this past weekend. Airbnb plans to work with resettlement agencies to evolve the initiative and provide support as necessary.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airbnb’s initiative comes at a time when tens of thousands of people are attempting to flee Afghanistan. Amid the crisis, companies and governments are facing increasing pressure to aid refugees fleeing the country. There are currently nearly 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan, according to the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/afghanistan.html">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>. Since August 15, countries have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-evacuation-war-footing-g7-meets-pullout-deadline-2021-08-24/">evacuated around 58,700 people</a> from the country’s capital, Kabul.</p>
<p>“As tens of thousands of Afghan refugees resettle around the world, where they stay will be the first chapter in their new lives. For these 20,000 refugees, my hope is that the Airbnb community will provide them with not only a safe place to rest and start over, but also a warm welcome home,” Chesky said in a statement.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting Airbnb has historically provided free housing to those in need over the past few years. In 2017, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/29/airbnb-free-housing-immigration-ban/">company offered free housing</a> to stranded refugees, students and green card holders affected by former President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html?">executive order</a> limiting refugees. More recently, Airbnb provided free or subsidized housing for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/airbnb-to-provide-free-or-subsidized-housing-for-100000-covid-19-healthcare-workers/">100,000 healthcare workers</a> amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Airbnb notes it has connected approximately 25,000 refugees to temporary housing over the past four years.</p>
