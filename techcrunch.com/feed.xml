										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just as many other employee services have gone digital, so too is mental health. In the consumer space there are growing startups like <a href="https://www.equoogame.com/">Equoo</a>, but the race is now on for the employee.</p>
<p>And since telemedicine has gone digital and video-based, so too is mental health provision. A number of companies are already playing in this space, including Spill Chat, On Mind, Lyra Health, Modern Health, Ginger and TalkSpace For Business.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oliva.health/">Oliva’s</a> take on this is not to create a marketplace or pre-recorded videos, but to put trained professionals in front of employees to talk directly to them. And there is even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032713005120?via%3Dihub">science</a> to back it up. Indeed, some research suggests Psychotherapy via the internet <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130730091255.htm">is as good if not better</a> than face-to-face consultations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Oliva’s on-demand, professional-led mental healthcare for employees and managers has now attracted investment to the tune of a $2.2m pre-seed investment round, led by <a href="https://www.moonfire.com/">Moonfire Ventures</a>, the new seed-stage VC firm from Atomico co-founder Mattias Ljungman.</p>
<p>The UK and Spain-based startup has also attracted angel investment from tech executives from Amazon, Booking.com, DogBuddy, Typeform, Hotjar, TravelPerk, and more.</p>
<p>Oliva is founded by Javier Suarez, who previously co-founded TravelPerk, and Sançar Sahin, who previously led marketing teams at Hotjar and Typeform, so both are well blooded in startups.</p>
<p>Suarez says he was inspired to create a mental health startup after the rigors of TravelPerk: “Employees are a company&#8217;s greatest asset &#8211; the better they feel, the better your company performs. But organizations are not set up to support their employees’ mental health in and outside of the workplace, which creates a massive problem for teammates, managers, and the organization as a whole. We’ve launched Oliva to give employees access to comprehensive online mental healthcare and to help organizations overcome the related challenges—from attracting &amp; retaining talent and training managers to supporting remote workers.”</p>
<p>Privacy is addressed via the use of a secure and encrypted personal portal, where employees can chat with a care provider who matches them with a professional. They get  1-to-1 video therapy sessions from a range of mental health professionals, and can also track their progress. </p>
<p>The team has also attracted Dr. Sarah Bateup, who has spent over two decades teaching and training mental healthcare professionals, who is now Chief Clinical Officer.</p>
<p>She said: “Oliva improves the way mental healthcare is accessed, supported, and paid for, while also adding more ongoing oversight and accountability to the process. Our ambition is for Oliva to be viewed as a badge of quality and set a new standard for workplace mental healthcare.”</p>
<p>Mattias Ljungman, Founder at Moonfire Ventures, added: “Mental health has been an overlooked area of care and wellbeing, especially in the workplace. Oliva&#8217;s founders are the only team we’ve seen taking a holistic, impact-driven approach to supporting mental health. While employer-funded mental health is becoming a well-established model in the US, Oliva is the first to bring a truly comprehensive approach to UK and European businesses.”</p>
<p>Oliva platform is integrated with Slack, providing employees with mental health drop-in sessions, therapy courses, and dedicated training and support for managers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What with the planet collapsing and democracy under constant attack from all quarters &#8211; you know, just the usual &#8211; one or two members of the global population have, idly or not, wondered if the private sector might want to step up? I mean, as well as shooting billionaires into space. At the same time, even! Luckily, many businesses want to do better. But there are one or two hurdles. Incorporating “purpose” into their digital offering, such as donating to a non-profit at the end of a moving documentary, is harder than it looks. Businesses don’t have the capacity to build in donation software; they can’t continually verify and audit good causes; and processing donations is fraught with legal complications, compliance, and regulatory risk. What is to be done?</p>
<p> <a href="https://pennies.org.uk/">Pennies</a> is one organization that bills itself as the digital equivalent of the traditional charity collection box. However, perhaps what we need is… drum roll… an API?</p>
<p>Step forward <a href="https://poweredbypercent.com/">Percent</a>. Founded in 2017, Percent provides an API allowing firms to customers to donate to good causes, matching a donation made when making a payment, or rounding up a financial transaction, for instance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s now closed a $5M venture round led by Morpheus Ventures, allowing it to expand in the US, as well as its existing presence in the UK and Australia. The UK’s Nationwide Building Society &#8211; also an early investor and customer of the product &#8211; is a co-investor in the round.</p>
<p>The company says its API-first platform takes care of auditing and compliance processes to prevent fraud and money-laundering whilst also parsing tax-efficient disbursements of funds into 200 countries worldwide. It says 7 million non-profit causes have been added to the platform and it&#8217;s vetted the potential recipients of donations.</p>
<p>Henry Ludlam, Founder, and CEO of Percent, said: “Percent was founded to become the global API-first infrastructure behind all giving. This will be the foundation for a better, fairer future of capitalism in which every financial transaction has social and environmental good built into it.”</p>
<p>In an interview I asked him if the pandemic had accelerated the opportunity: “Because of COVID, suddenly now we have brands that are really desperate to build purpose into their business in a way that they just weren&#8217;t doing 18 months ago. It’s really been an amazing shift. We’ve just seen a huge shift in what consumers expect from businesses. Consumers expect businesses to build purpose into what they do now.”</p>
<p>He said that the product could be even built into &#8211; surprise! &#8211; streaming services: “Say you’ve seen a documentary. And at the end of the documentary, you feel particularly moved, like you watched a David Attenborough or something like that. You could then actually be able to quickly and easily build donations into the end of it. So using our API, it would pull up a list of nonprofits, so right there and then the customer could make a donation. We&#8217;re also working with a crypto platform where you can round down your transactions and donate to any nonprofit as well. There&#8217;s loads of really cool stuff we are working on which is coming out soon.”<br />
 <br />
Kristian Blaszczynski, Managing Partner of Morpheus Ventures, said: “With the events of the last several years, it has become more apparent that aligning brands with purpose is driving consumer behavior and spend. However, today, the process of donating to non-profits is incredibly archaic, manual, and inefficient… Percent’s API-first platform abstracts away all of these complexities and automates the processes, allowing businesses to align closer to their stakeholders and focus on their core business.”</p>
<p>Percent could well be pushing at an open door. Kantar Research says that only 22% of people could name a brand they thought was doing a good job addressing issues such as climate change, plastic waste, and water pollution. On the flip side, 95% of businesses <em>think</em> that “purpose” is at the heart of what they do. The disparity could not be more stark.</p>
<p>Is Percent the stripe for donations? We&#8217;re about to find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.yapily.com">Yapily</a> has raised a $51 million Series B funding round led by <a href="https://sapphireventures.com">Sapphire Ventures</a>. The company has been working on a single, unified open banking API for several European markets. Developers can leverage that programming interface to interact with third-party bank accounts directly from their own products.</p>
<p>“The core difference between us and most of the players in the space is our focus on the infrastructure,” founder and CEO Stefano Vaccino told me. Unlike Tink or TrueLayer, Yapily operates in the background. You never see a Yapily logo anywhere and the company provides no front-end interface.</p>
<p>Another difference is that Yapily focuses exclusively on API integrations. Due to recent regulatory changes in Europe (PSD2), banks now have to offer official APIs to integrate with third-party services. While some still don’t offer APIs, many of them are now complying with the rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By focusing on official APIs, Yapily can offer a snappier and more reliable experience. Other startups working on unified open banking APIs rely on a mix of official APIs, screen scraping and private APIs. Screen scraping can be particularly slow and private APIs sometimes stop working overnight.</p>
<p>When it comes to coverage, Yapily supports more than 1,500 banks across eight different countries. “We have between 90 and 99% coverage in the U.K., France, Spain, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Italy and the Netherlands,” Vaccino said. You can see the full list of banks on <a href="https://www.yapily.com/coverage/">this page</a>. According to Vaccino, only Tink has a similar level of coverage in Europe.</p>
<p>You can use Yapily’s API for several different purposes. For instance, the API lets you check the balance on a bank account, check the account holder name and fetch the last two years of transaction.</p>
<p>But the startup has also noticed that more and more customers rely on open banking to initiate payments from a bank account. Compared to card payments, account-to-account payments are cheaper. Cards also expire, leading to churn. Yapily’s API can be used for one-time payments, international payments, bulk payments and recurring payments.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand its commercial presence across Europe. In addition to the U.K., Germany and Italy, Yapily will hire new team members focused on France and Spain.</p>
<p>The startup will also build integrations with banks in new markets in Northern Europe and the Baltics — and then beyond Europe. “At the beginning of next year, we’re going to look at Latin America and especially Brazil,” Vaccino said. Brazilian banks already have a lot of open banking APIs.</p>
<p>Right now, Yapily has around 100 customers, such as American Express, QuickBooks, Bux, Vivid Money, Volt and Moneyfarm. By focusing on the infrastructure layer, other fintech startups are taking advantage of Yapily to build applications on top of the startup’s API. It&#8217;s an interesting go-to-market strategy and it seems to be working well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Expense management has long been a pain point for employees and accounting departments: for many, tracking and parsing how money is spent on behalf of a company is just too bogged down in legacy software ill-equipped to handle more modern demands. Today, a UK startup building solutions to bring the process into the 21st century is announcing a major round of funding to double down on its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.soldo.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soldo</a>, which provides a platform to issue employees with prepaid company cards that are linked through to an automated expense management system, has closed $180 million in funding. Soldo currently has some 26,000 customers, ranging from small medium-sized businesses, through to mid-market enterprises and up to large multinationals across 30 countries, with Mercedes Benz, GetYourGuide, Gymshark, Bauli, and Brooks Running among some of the more popular of them. Alongside that, by way of APIs, it also integrates <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">with the popular accounting packages used by organizations today &#8212;</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> NetSuite, QuickBooks, Zucchetti, and Xero, along with options to connect Soldo to more than 50 expense management platforms including Concur and Expensify.</span></p>
<p>The round, a Series C, is being led by Singapore&#8217;s Temasek, with Sunley House Capital, Advent International’s crossover fund, Citi Ventures, and previous backers Accel, Battery Ventures and Dawn Capital, also participating. Silicon Valley Bank also provided debt financing of an undisclosed amount.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>London-based Soldo also did not disclose its valuation is in a statement on this latest investment, but as a point of reference, when it started to raise this money, back in December, the company was valued at around $278 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/168373-90/company/profile#deal-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. In the event, Soldo said the round was oversubscribed on the back of strong growth for the company: spend volume on its platform has grown four-fold since its series B, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/07/soldo-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$61 million round in 2019</a>. (Note: Soldo&#8217;s main operations are in London, but it also has a small corporate HQ is in Dublin, as it picked up an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/fintexit/">e-money license</a> in Ireland in 2019, part of its Brexit hedging.)</p>
<p>More generally &#8212; and perhaps because many of us are spending more time away from the head office, or perhaps because some of us are finally getting out on the road again to meet people &#8212; expense management is getting a lot of attention at the moment. Just earlier this month, one of Soldo&#8217;s bigger competitors, Denmark&#8217;s Pleo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/pleo-raises-150m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-new-approach-to-managing-expenses-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $150 million at a $1.7 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>It is a massive market to play for: Europe’s addressable market for expense management runs at $170 billion, the company said.</p>
<p>The crux of the challenge that Soldo aims to fix is that expenses is usually a very fragmented, non-digitised business, and employees that rack up expenses are usually not accountants: that is to say, handling them correctly is not one of their core competencies. The expenses themselves, meanwhile, have evolved to cover a lot of different things, a by-product of everything becoming easier to buy online and also how we work today: they might include subscriptions, travel and entertainment, office supplies for your home office, and making purchases on behalf of your company for marketing campaigns or online advertising, and more.</p>
<p>When expenses are happening digitally, they are easier to track, but very often they are for services or goods being purchased IRL, and that is when the other issues arise: people often forget to get receipts, or lose them before they fill out their reports, or pay for things out of their own pocket, and more.</p>
<p>And on top of that, expenses are made on corporate cards, or by way of bank transfers. The former can be expensive and hard to control, while the latter has its own challenges: it&#8217;s a slow process and often requires multiple people to clear a payment.</p>
<p>Soldo&#8217;s approach to fixing this is to first of all make it easier to issue employees with cards, prepaid in order to control spend on them better. It then links the card to an app, which creates automatic prompts that pop up for you every time you make a purchase with a card, to be reminded to capture a receipt and upload it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soldo’s vision is manage the total spend across the breadth of a company, whether that be advertising, software subscriptions, travel and entertainment, vendor management or salaries across all payment methods. When we look at this way, expense management is only one of the many possible use cases and cards are only one of the many ways that a company might transfer money to suppliers,&#8221; Carlo Gualandri, CEO and founder of Soldo, told TechCrunch in an email. In contrast to competitors like Pleo, he noted &#8220;that we have a broader and more complete focus on managing all the possible needs of a company, way beyond travel and expenses. This is important because the value for the customer of using a spend management platform increases as a more significant share of company spend gets moved onto it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the company&#8217;s growth since being founded five years ago hit a big speed bump in the form of Covid-19. Its recovery from that is a testament to how it&#8217;s found a place even in the current market.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic did almost completely wipe out travel and expenses as a use case of companies’ spend – given limited numbers of workers were travelling, or expensing lunches, for example, in lockdown,&#8221; said Gualandri. &#8220;It was quite shocking to see all of Europe switch off, country by country, in the first weeks of March of last year as the lockdown kept people in their homes. And with that, a significant part of our financial services revenues also disappeared because business travel is the most common and widespread use of corporate cards.&#8221; But then, two things happened, he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of other company spend use cases grew significantly. We saw the global shift to ecommerce and the digitalisation of the finance department.  From supporting workers at home to other business activities there was a definite move toward online procurement and that requires a card for the payment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Also, many companies started distributing their products or services online and with that they shifted a large share of their spend toward online marketing, an example of a key spend which is normally paid for using cards.  So, there was definitely a case of certain spend categories going down and others going up and rapidly so. A number of pandemic related problems emerged that we realised we could solve.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Our experience in software and payments technology gives us deep insight and we are confident Soldo stands at the forefront of finance digitalisation,&#8221; said Simon Lambert, a director at Sunley House, Advent International’s crossover fund, said in a statement. &#8220;The company operates in a large and fast-growing market, and we are thrilled to partner with its outstanding management team as they seek to build Europe’s leading pay and spend automation platform.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.ut-ec.co.jp/english/">The University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners </a>(UTEC) is launching a new program to address a problem the venture capital fund says many deep-tech founders face. They may raise pre-seed capital from an incubator or accelerator program, but reach a funding gap before moving on to early-stage rounds. Without financial resources, it takes longer to commercialize their technology, no matter how promising.</p>
<p>UTEC, an independent venture fund associated with The University of Tokyo and other academic institutions, created the <a href="https://ufp.jp/en/">UTEC Founders Program</a> (UFP) to address that gap. It offers two tracks: equity, which invests up to $1 million with flexible terms, and grants, a non-dilutive donation of about $50,000 (or occasionally up to $100,000) awarded to recipients every six months.</p>
<p>UFP’s <a href="https://ufp.jp/en/apply/">applications</a> are open to deep-tech researchers and founders anywhere in the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>UTEC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/utec-one-of-asias-largest-deep-tech-investment-firms-launches-new-275m-fund/">launched a $275 million fund in May</a>, and typically writes first checks of about $1 million to $5 million. Its aggregated assets under management are about $780 million, which the firm says makes UTEC the largest venture capital fund in Japan for science and tech companies, and one of the largest deep-tech funds in Asia.</p>

<p>After getting feedback from deep-tech researchers and entrepreneurs, the fund’s partners realized that even though they might have developed potentially impactful tech, it might not be immediately ready for seed funding. Many teams would also benefit from swift funding to continue preparing their tech for commercialization, instead of waiting through a lengthy due diligence process.</p>
<p>In an email, UTEC principals and UFP leads Hiroaki Kobayashi and Kiran Mysore told TechCrunch, “Just like entrepreneurs who create new product offerings to cater to unmet market needs, we at UTEC endeavor to be more nimble and offer new investment products to serve science and technology researchers and entrepreneurs. UFP is UTEC’s attempt to channel over 15 years of deep-tech investing experience and learnings into an early-stage technology commercialization initiative.”</p>
<p>The equity track is primarily for seed and pre-Series A startups, and offers flexible investment terms like SAFE notes, KISS and J-KISS (the Japanese version of Keep It Simple Security), convertible notes and bonds, or common stocks. It accepts applications throughout the year, and successful candidates are contacted for a first interview within three days. Mysore said that the entire due diligence and investment committee process will be completed within four weeks of the first interview.</p>
<p>The grant track is aimed at pre-launch or early-stage startups, and the funds can be used for things like prototyping, testing the market and recruitment. Applications are opened every six months, with about five teams selected each time. The deadline for the first batch of applicants is July 31 and decisions will be made in September.</p>
<p>Deep-tech teams who participate in UFP also get access to UTEC’s network of more than 115 Japanese and global startups, academic institutions, government organizations and corporations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung just sent out invites for its next Unpacked event. There are those companies that like to sneak hints into their invites &#8212; and then there’s Samsung. The note leads with the big, bold words “Get ready to unfold” and features a pair of flat-colored objects that can reasonably be said to resemble the form factors of the Galaxy Z Fold and Flip, respectively.</p>
<p>In keeping with…the general state of the world over the past year-and-a-half, the event will be held virtually on Wednesday, August 11. Interestingly, the company is also opening up preorders on its “next flagship,” sights and specs unseen. Perks for early preorders include “12 free months of Samsung Care+, up to an extra $200 trade-in credit and a special pre-order offer.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/76CQYkwLD0Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But honestly, it’s generally best to wait until you actually see the thing and maybe even read a review or two.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack (so to speak) ahead of the event. First, I’m probably not alone in expecting that the company would focus its next big event on the upcoming Galaxy Watch. The big event at MWC was a bit of a dud (not unlike MWC itself), offering up more information on the upcoming wearable partnership with Google, in lieu of announcing any hardware.</p>
<p>As the company noted at the time, “The upcoming One UI Watch will debut at an upcoming Unpacked event later this summer, sporting the new UI, as well as the forthcoming joint Samsung/Google platform.”</p>
<p>It seems reasonably likely that this will be the event where that will occur, even if the new watch doesn’t get top billing. For one thing we’re running out of summer. For another, rumors have the new Galaxy Watch set for a late-August (the 27<sup>th</sup>) release.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>All told, this could well be a pretty huge summer event for the company, bucking last year’s trend of meting out devices one by one at virtual invents. Word on the street is we could be seeing a Galaxy Watch 4, Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3, Galaxy S21 FE (“Fan Edition” &#8212; basically the latest version of the company’s budget flagship) and even the Galaxy Buds Pro, which will more directly take on the AirPods Pro (which are getting a bit long in the tooth).</p>
<p>What’s missing in all of this? No points if you said the Note. Samsung’s well-loved phablet is<a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/reminder-galaxy-note-21-not-coming-2021/"> reportedly not coming this year</a>, as chip shortages continue to plague the industry. That would be a big hit to Samsung’s six-month cycle, though we’ll see how that all plays out soon enough.</p>
<p>The August 11<sup>th</sup> event kicks off at 10AM ET / 7AM PT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla will allow other electric vehicles to access its global network of chargers later this year, CEO Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday. The comment follows years of chatter by Musk that signaled the company was amenable to the idea.</p>
<p>Until now, there have never been any details about how or when the company would open up its Supercharger network of 25,000 chargers. Details are still slim. For instance, it&#8217;s unclear where it would initially open up, which automakers have reached agreements with Tesla and whether Tesla owners would get priority. However, Musk did finally attach a timeline of sorts by noting this would kick off before the end of 2021.</p>
<p>He later added in another tweet that its network would eventually be open to other EVs in every country that it has chargers. Tesla Superchargers are located in North America, Asia and Europe as well as Middle Eastern countries UAE and Israel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. </p>
<p>It’s one fairly slim connector for both low &amp; high power charging. </p>
<p>That said, we’re making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1417593502351826946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk has talked about either sharing the technology behind his Tesla Superchargers or opening them up for use to other EVs for years now. Way back in 2014, Musk said he&#8217;d be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/09/tesla-wants-to-open-its-supercharger-standard-to-other-electric-car-makers/">willing to open up the designs</a> in order to build a standard that can be used interchangeably across the industry. This would allow competing electric car models to charge up at the Supercharger network.</p>
<p>He has mentioned some version of this at various events and during earnings calls ever since. In 2018, Musk said in response to a question during an earnings call that the Supercharger network is not a walled garden, a reference meant to express that it is not designed to prevent other EVs from using it. However, it should be noted that Superchargers are not compatible to other EVs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always said that we&#8217;re &#8212; this is not intended to be a walled garden, and we&#8217;re happy to support other automakers and let them use our Supercharger stations,&#8221; Musk said in 2018. &#8220;They would just need to pay the share of the cost proportionate to their vehicle usage. And they would need to be able to accept our charge rate or at least &#8212; and our connector, at least have an adaptor to our connector. So this is something we&#8217;re very open to, but so far none of the other car makers have wanted to do this. But it&#8217;s like not because of opposition from us. This is not a walled garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two common connectors used for rapid charging are Combined Charging System (CCS) or CHAdeMO. CCS, a direct current connector that is an open international standard that in recent years has gained popularity in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Tesla has its own connector, which means automakers would have to provide or sell an adapter to owners of its EVs to access the Supercharger network. It&#8217;s a different story in Europe. Tesla uses the CCS direct current connector in Europe, making this the most likely region for Tesla to open up first.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is giving its users a tiny bit more power to see what they want — and not see what they <em>don&#8217;t</em> want — in its content discovery hub. The company introduced a new toggle called &#8220;Sensitive Content Control&#8221; on Tuesday that allows anyone to screen posts that it thinks could be offensive, hiding them from the Explore tab.</p>
<p>The new feature appears in the settings menu and lets users choose to either allow more content that could be &#8220;upsetting or offensive,&#8221; limit that content or &#8220;limit even more.&#8221; The phrasing is kind of weird but it acknowledges that the company&#8217;s moderation efforts aren&#8217;t perfect, and that&#8217;s realistic at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can think of sensitive content as posts that don’t necessarily break our rules, but could potentially be upsetting to some people – such as posts that may be sexually suggestive or violent,&#8221; Instagram explained in the <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-sensitive-content-control">announcement</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch asked the company to expand on what kinds of posts are screened out under each category and if human or algorithmic moderation determines what is sensitive, but did not receive a response.</p>
<p>We also asked if the company has any plans to create separate toggles for violence and sexual content, considering that a lot of people comfortable with the latter might be less inclined to see violence bubble up among the app&#8217;s makeup tutorials and influencer junkets.</p>
<p>On Instagram, &#8220;sensitive&#8221; content is a massive catch-all category for stuff it allows but doesn&#8217;t want to be seen as directly promoting. In its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/313829416281232">own guidelines on content it recommends</a>, Instagram states that sexually suggestive content like &#8220;pictures of people in see-through clothing&#8221; aren&#8217;t eligible for the Explore tab. Instagram&#8217;s definition of sensitive content also includes dangerous forms of content like &#8220;exaggerated health claims&#8221; and posts promoting weight loss supplements.</p>

<p>Instagram is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/arts/design/instagram-free-the-nipple.html">notorious</a> for over-policing content that the platform deems to be sexual. A campaign from Black plus-size model Nyome Nicholas-Williams <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/25/instagram-row-over-plus-size-model-forces-change-to-nudity-policy">successfully pressured the platform</a> into relaxing one of its overly restrictive nudity rules last year.</p>
<p>Instagram contextualized the new content controls as part of a new effort to give users more power to determine what shows up in their feed. &#8220;We believe people should be able to shape Instagram into the experience that they want,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, noting that recent changes like being able to disable comments also give users more choice.</p>
<p>While the company is giving users more control over its algorithm in some small ways, it&#8217;s also considering giving them less. Last month, Instagram<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/instagram-suggested-posts-test-topics/"> began testing algorithmic suggestions mixed into the main feed</a>, a design choice that would let the company inject the platform with even more of what it wants you to see.</p>

There was a livestream, though the Blue Origin space company was a bit more salesy than I was comfortable with. Regardless, the humans went up and came down, and the rocket and everyone aboard survived. The crew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/bezos-and-crew-host-a-giddy-press-conference-after-blue-origins-inaugural-crewed-launch/">was pretty stoked about it all</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">European startups are thriving:</a> </strong>Of all the startup markets in the world, Europe’s is among the very hottest. And according to venture capitalists that TechCrunch spoke with, the pace of investing activity on the continent is not set to slow much in the back half of 2021. This year will set all-time records in the European startup market for capital raised.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/square-launches-business-bank-accounts/">Square builds a business bank:</a> </strong>What has lots of small-biz customers and big fintech aspirations? Well, a lot of tech companies, but also Square. The company has put together a business bank for its business customers. How long until Square is simply a bank for individuals and companies alike? A good rule of thumb for fintech: No matter where a startup <em>starts</em> in financial technology, it will end up doing all things. Or die trying.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Holy heck there were a lot of funding rounds announced today. TechCrunch covered a huge chunk of the total, so many that we can’t get to them all here. But after checking in on China, we have your speed-read all the same. Let’s go!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/"><strong>All about the Chinese startup scene:</strong></a> Are you a little behind on China’s technology regulatory crackdown? Don’t worry if so. Our own Rita Liao is on the case and has a brilliant roundup of what’s going on with Didi and other China-based companies that went public on the U.S. market. The gist is that data may not be the new oil, as some liked to say a few years back, but data is proving to be a geopolitical flashpoint. As it turns out, the Europeans were early on this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the venture capital rundown, in brief format to allow for the inclusion of more items:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/rxall-grabs-3-15m-to-scale-its-drug-checking-and-counterfeiting-tech-across-africa/"><strong>Taking on counterfeit drugs in Africa:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s what RxAll is doing, and it has landed $3.15 million to pursue its vision. Launched in 2016, the company wants to combat fake drugs and the health problems that they cause.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/chargepoint-to-buy-european-charging-software-startup-for-295m/">Charging consolidation:</a> </strong>TechCrunch covered the deal between ChargePoint and the frustratingly punctuated has·to·be, in which the first company spent $295 million to buy the latter. Our read is the deal will allow ChargePoint “a boost in its pursuit to gain market share beyond North America” in the EV charging market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/titan-valued-at-450m-as-a16z-leads-58m-series-b/"><strong>Titan raises $58M to bring active wealth management to the masses:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If Robinhood did a good job making retail investing open to the masses by cutting fees to zero, Titan wants to pull a similar trick with the active-management world of wealth management. The company raised a $12.5 million Series A earlier this year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/little-spoon-scoops-up-44m-to-grow-its-childrens-nutrition-delivery-service/"><strong>$44M for Little Spoon’s baby food mission:</strong></a> Feeding children is a daily challenge. Finding good things for them to eat that they will actually consume is even harder. Little Spoon wants to solve the matter by helping parents of young kids subscribe to D2C baby foods while also selling vitamins and the like.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/path-robotics-raises-another-100m/"><strong>Path Robotics raises (again):</strong></a> The Ohio-based Path Robotics is back at the fundraising well this week, picking up a $100 million Series C. The round comes after the startup raised a $56 million Series B in May. What does it do? Welding robots!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/capchase-raises-280m-to-scale-its-financing-platform-for-subscription-businesses/"><strong>More money raised to buy SaaS revenue:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Capchase has put together a $280 million round of funding (debt and equity) to grow its business of buying future software revenues for present-day cash. It’s a big market that Pipe also plays in.</li>
</ul>
<p>To close out our startup and venture capital news, some updates on venture capitalists that want to fund startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/hyper-is-a-new-fund-that-offers-300k-checks-and-promises-of-a-media-slingshot-for-founders/"><strong>Hyper’s $60M concept:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Part venture firm, part venture-funded media group, the Product Hunt sister company is looking to put capital and connections to work. TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino has the details.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/pillar-vc-closes-192m-for-two-funds-targeting-saas-crypto-biotech-manufacturing/"><strong>New Boston funds:</strong></a> Pillar VC has raised new capital in two chunks, including $169 million for its Pillar III capital pool and a $23 million second fund. The VC firm intends to invest broadly, including into SaaS, hardware and other categories. The investing group is perhaps best known for buying <em>common</em> stock in companies it backs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the operators out there, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/marketing-cube-founder-maya-moufareks-lessons-for-customer-focused-startups/">TechCrunch has a chat</a> with Maya Moufarek, the founder of Marketing Cube, who spent more than 15 years working for companies like Google and American Express before launching her own growth consultancy about startup marketing. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>How we built an AI unicorn in 6 years</h2>
<p>Few startups go to market with the exact product their founders first envisioned.</p>
<p>Today, Tractable is known for developing tech that allows drivers to upload photos of their vehicles after a collision so its AI can assess the damage. Its first paying customer, however, used Tractable to inspect plastic pipe welds.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, that customer also fired them just as the founders were raising their first round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We struck gold with car insurance,&#8221; says co-founder Alex Dalyac, as it was &#8220;a huge and inefficient market in desperate need of modernization.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an Extra Crunch guest post, he shares several takeaways from the last six years spent scaling a unicorn that have value founders of all stripes. Step one?</p>
<p>&#8220;Search for complementary co-founders who will become your best friends,&#8221; advises Dalyac.</p>

That’s a pretty big haul. Of course, Facebook is using the service as a way to drive Facebook Pay usage, among other goals.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Tesla in full self-driving mode makes a left turn out of the middle lane on a busy San Francisco street. It jumps in a bus lane where it’s not meant to be. It turns a corner and nearly plows into parked vehicles, causing the driver to lurch for the wheel. These scenes have been captured by car reviewer AI Addict, and other scenarios like it are cropping up on YouTube. One might say that these are all mistakes any human on a cell phone might have made. But we expect more from our AI overlords. </span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlIdu7prsAw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/the-station-rimac-bugatti-is-born-tesla-releases-fsd-beta-v9-and-ola-raises-500m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla began sending out over-the-air software updates for its Full Self-Driving </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(FSD) beta version 9 software, an advanced driver assist system that relies only on cameras, rather than cameras and radar like Tesla’s previous ADAS systems.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reaction to videos displaying unsafe driving behavior,</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrHCz4wnW8g&amp;ab_channel=ChuckCook"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like unprotected left turns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other reports from Tesla owners, </span><a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-software-lacks-safeguards-a6698414036/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Reports issued a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday saying the software upgrade does not appear to be safe enough for public roads, and that it would independently test the software update on its Model Y SUV once it receives the necessary software updates. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Running preproduction software is both work &amp; fun. Beta list was in stasis, as we had many known issues to fix. </p>
<p>Beta 9 addresses most known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.</p>
<p>Safety is always top priority at Tesla.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1413306409693892613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consumer organization said it’s concerned Tesla is using its existing owners and their vehicles as guinea pigs for testing new features. Making their point for them, Tesla CEO Elon Musk did urge drivers not to be complacent while driving because “there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.” Many Tesla owners know what they’re getting themselves into because they signed up for Tesla’s Early Access Program that delivers beta software for feedback, but other road users have not given their consent for such trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla’s updates are shipped out to drivers all over the country. The electric vehicle company did not respond to a request for more information about whether or not it takes into account self-driving regulations in specific states &#8212; 29 states have enacted laws related to autonomous driving, but they differ wildly depending on the state. Other self-driving technology companies like Cruise, Waymo and Argo AI told CR they either test their software on private tracks or use trained safety drivers as monitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Car technology is advancing really quickly, and automation has a lot of potential, but policymakers need to step up to get strong, sensible safety rules in place,” says William Wallace, manager of safety policy at CR in a statement. “Otherwise, some companies will just treat our public roads as if they were private proving grounds, with little holding them accountable for safety.”</span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrHCz4wnW8g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the </span><a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-orders-crash-reporting-vehicles-equipped-advanced-driver-assistance-systems"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued a standing general order that requires manufacturers and operators of vehicles with SAE Level 2 ADAS or SAE levels 3, 4 or 5 automated driving systems to report crashes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NHTSA’s core mission is safety. By mandating crash reporting, the agency will have access to critical data that will help quickly identify safety issues that could emerge in these automated systems,” said Dr. Steven Cliff, NHTSA’s acting administrator, in a statement. “In fact, gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FSD beta 9 software has added features that automates more driving tasks, like navigating intersections and city streets with the driver’s supervision. But with such excellent graphics detailing where the car is in relation to other road users, down to a woman on a scooter passing by, drivers might be more distracted by the tech that’s meant to assist them at crucial moments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tesla just asking people to pay attention isn’t enough — the system needs to make sure people are engaged when the system is operational,” said J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ake Fisher, senior director of CR’s Auto Test Center in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We already know that testing developing self-driving systems without adequate driver support can — and will — end in fatalities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisher said Tesla should implement an in-car driver monitoring system to ensure drivers are watching the road to avoid accidents like the one involving </span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUXnii6LS7sDGCMIPJONh4V1D0fnMzDRUvpVdpPv-2FA8zLFIOyL4ZNTne7il-2FvdpaFup37499oGJr3Kc8TkVcKiuBj-2F-2Bk8snUtzg-2Fm2dJHXo8I5CzmD8Zi2jZ923vWJgUh2Kvdi-2BgZcSqBbFCYq56Ru2yzv8Yd7iKn6i-2F9lN2zk79Wy29D_YXLroU-2F9DCpI7O51hK6BzZhp-2BHFw-2Ff1p-2FQqgy5BN7zlbXXU3QuI5uWV4cLwI8tyismDjxrzyJEupSggHlXXKI1YHTmavNgrfFl9mPxOK2tcTqI7edyTBdQopaOGCOHv8B2k48sSG3rrSKNel9vp-2BP3OBvyDOc1QzeHZch7pLFiqGwuRSzMZA-2BeSfneGiX9LX-2FJDTQuJAHA3Fpr2kyz6NQd8ESN4gGV1cwNJPTna-2F1-2FTm9Oil3DI3Vu6luqUpPYVQXUIZRc9UZaUWlLuGmCouwDoQ-2BayQ7N7L0qbto4LYc-2FrXFisJ3Q5wCBRPaMqtH0FE8HHFcH-2Bq044BMHIdq1Jdw-2F0ScanX7zmbrr6AEo-2BIxic-3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s self-driving test vehicle, which struck and killed a woman in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Phoenix as she crossed the street. </span></p>

This biotech-powered approach can save farmers money and time and ultimately may be easier on the environment — a huge opportunity that investors have <a href="https://blog.pivotbio.com/press-releases/series-d">plowed $430 million into in the company&#8217;s latest funding round</a>.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is among the nutrients crops need to survive and thrive, and it&#8217;s only by dumping fertilizer on the soil and mixing it in that farmers can keep growing at today&#8217;s rates. But in some ways we&#8217;re still doing what our forebears did generations ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fertilizer changed agriculture — it&#8217;s what made so much of the last century possible. But it&#8217;s not a perfect way to get nutrients to crops,&#8221; said Karsten Temme, CEO and co-founder of Pivot Bio. He pointed out the simple fact that distributing fertilizer over a thousand — let alone ten thousand or more — acres of farmland is an immense mechanical and logistical challenge, involving many people, heavy machinery and valuable time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not to mention the risk that a heavy rain might carry off a lot of the fertilizer before it&#8217;s absorbed and used, and the huge contributions of greenhouse gases the fertilizing process produces. (The microbe approach seems to be considerably better for the environment.)</p>
<p>Yet the reason we do this in the first place is essentially to imitate the work of microbes that live in the soil and produce nitrogen naturally. Plants and these microbes have a relationship going back millions of years, but the tiny organisms simply don&#8217;t produce enough. Pivot Bio&#8217;s insight when it started more than a decade ago was that a few tweaks could supercharge this natural nitrogen cycle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all known microbes were the way to go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re naturally part of the root system — they were already there. They have this feedback loop, where if they detect fertilizer they don&#8217;t make nitrogen, to save energy. The only thing that we&#8217;ve done is, the portion of their genome responsible for producing nitrogen is offline, and we&#8217;re waking it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other agriculture-focused biotech companies like Indigo and AgBiome are also looking at modifying and managing the plant&#8217;s &#8220;microbiome,&#8221; which is to say the life that lives in the immediate vicinity of a given plant. A modified microbiome may be resistant to pests, reduce disease or offer other benefits.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not so different from yeast, which as many know from experience works as a living rising agent. That microbe has been cultivated to consume sugar and produce a gas, which leads to the air pockets in baked goods. <em>This</em> microbe has been modified a bit more directly to continually consume the sugars put out by plants and put out nitrogen. And they can do it at rates that massively reduce the need for adding solid fertilizer to the soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken what is traditionally tons and tons of physical materials, and shrunk that into a powder, like baker&#8217;s yeast, that you can fit in your hand,&#8221; Temme said (though, to be precise, the product is applied as a liquid). &#8220;All of a sudden managing that farm gets a little easier. You free up the time you would have spent sitting in the tractor applying fertilizer to the field; you&#8217;ll add our product at the same time you&#8217;d be planting your seeds. And you have the confidence that if a rainstorm comes through in the spring, it&#8217;s not washing it all away. Globally about half of all fertilizer is washed away&#8230; but microbes don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, the microbes just quietly sit in the soil pumping out nitrogen at a rate of up to 40 pounds per acre — a remarkably old-fashioned way to measure it (why not grams per square centimeter?), but perhaps in keeping with agriculture&#8217;s occasional anachronistic tendencies. Depending on the crop and environment, that may be enough to do without added fertilizers at all, or it might be about half or less.</p>
<p>Whatever the proportion provided by the microbes, it must be tempting to employ them, because Pivot Bio tripled its revenue in 2021. You might wonder why they can be so sure only halfway through the year, but as they are currently only selling to farmers in the northern hemisphere and the product is applied at planting time early in the year, they&#8217;re done with sales for the year and can be sure it&#8217;s three times what they sold in 2020.</p>

<p>The microbes die off once the crop is harvested, so it&#8217;s not a permanent change to the ecosystem. And next year, when farmers come back for more, the organisms may well have been modified further. It&#8217;s not quite as simple as turning the nitrogen production on or off in the genome; the enzymatic pathway from sugar to nitrogen can be improved, and the threshold for when the microbes decide to undertake the process rather than rest can be changed as well. The latest iteration, Proven 40, has the yield mentioned above, but further improvements are planned, attracting potential customers on the fence about whether it&#8217;s worth the trouble to change tactics.</p>
<p>The potential for recurring revenue and growth (by their current estimate they are currently able to address about a quarter of a $200 billion total market) led to the current monster D round, which was led by DCVC and Temasek. There are about a dozen other investors, for which I refer readers to <a href="https://blog.pivotbio.com/press-releases/series-d">the press release</a>, which lists them in no doubt a very carefully negotiated order.</p>
<p>Temme says the money will go toward deepening and broadening the platform and growing the relationship with farmers, who seem to be hooked after giving it a shot. Right now the microbes are specific to corn, wheat and rice, which of course covers a great deal of agriculture, but there are many other corners of the industry that would benefit from a streamlined, enhanced nitrogen cycle. And it&#8217;s certainly a powerful validation of the vision Temme and his co-founder Alvin Tamsir had 15 years ago in grad school, he said. Here&#8217;s hoping that&#8217;s food for thought for those in that position now, wondering if it&#8217;s all worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic affecting every aspect of life and industry, it&#8217;s no surprise that digitization is coming to construction fast. Construction suppliers are increasingly under the same pressure as other sectors to perform at a higher level. We’ve seen the rise of companies like Dozer, Reno Run and Toolbox try to address this, but often the model is closer to a vertical integration rather than something more open. Even with that, it’s still the case that to order concrete or bricks, construction companies have to negotiate each time, with simultaneous record keeping.</p>
<p>This is the argument of <a href="https://brokrete.com/">Brokrete</a>, which bills itself as the “Shopify of construction.”</p>
<p>The startup has now raised a $3 million seed financing round led by Xploration Capital, which was joined by unnamed new strategic investors and existing investors. The startup graduated from Y Combinator’s winter cohort last year. Other strategic investors include Ronald Richardson, Avlok Kohli (CEO of AngeLlist Ventures) and the MaRS Investment Accelerator Fund (IAF). The funding will be used to expand in North American and European markets. Brokrete also launched Storefront, an e-commerce platform for suppliers in the construction industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jordan Latourelle, the company’s founder and CEO said: “Construction today is a largely offline, $1.2 trillion market where legacy commerce is the norm. Brokrete’s Storefront product equips suppliers with the tools required to enhance their operations by orders of magnitude. I founded Brokrete after seeing an industry left behind by e-commerce giants. Now we are becoming the operating system for e-commerce in the construction industry, while staying easy and affordable at the same time.”</p>
<p>Brokrete says its platform is code-free, white-labeled, multi-channel and industry-specific to sell and manage orders online. Suppliers get an iOS and Android app for e-commerce to receive offline orders from more &#8220;traditional&#8221; customers. It then provides order management, payouts, dispatching, logistics and real-time delivery. There are also financial and operational ERP integrations. Brokrete claims to work with 1,000+ contractors and to have a 250+ supplier network.</p>
<p>Latourelle told me: “We&#8217;re giving the construction industry an opportunity to use it on a Shopify way, and create their own store. It’s like a branded storefront for suppliers.”</p>
<p>Eugene Timko, managing partner at Xploration Capital said: “Construction is one of the few remaining large industries with mostly undigitized supply chains. Historically the key problem was the lack of real-time access to actual stocks which prevented producers and distributors from going online. Now with Brokrete’s end-to-end solution, these businesses can not only sell through Brokrete’s marketplace but can also enable their own direct online channels. Similar to Shopify, this has allowed many thousands of previously offline businesses to start accepting orders online.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration tripled down on its commitment to reining in powerful tech companies Tuesday, proposing committed Big Tech critic Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division.</p>
<p>Kanter is a lawyer with a long track record of representing smaller companies like Yelp in antitrust cases against Google. He currently practices law at his own firm, which specializes in advocacy for state and federal antitrust enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout his career, Kanter has also been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/20/president-biden-announces-jonathan-kanter-for-assistant-attorney-general-for-antitrust/">White House press release</a> stated. Progressives celebrated the nomination as a win, though some of Biden&#8217;s new antitrust hawks have enjoyed support from both political parties.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The Justice Department already has a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download">major antitrust suit against Google</a> in the works. The lawsuit, filed by Trump&#8217;s own Justice Department, accuses the company of &#8220;unlawfully maintaining monopolies&#8221; through anti-competitive practices in its search and search advertising businesses. If successfully confirmed, Kanter would be positioned to steer the DOJ&#8217;s big case against Google.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/opinion/dont-hand-our-tvs-over-to-google.html">2016 NYT op-ed</a>, Kanter argued that Google is notorious for relying on an anti-competitive &#8220;playbook&#8221; to maintain its market dominance. Kanter pointed to Google&#8217;s long history of releasing free ad-supported products and eventually restricting competition through &#8220;discriminatory and exclusionary practices&#8221; in a given corner of the market.</p>
<p>Kanter is just the latest high-profile Big Tech critic that&#8217;s been elevated to a major regulatory role under Biden. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">Biden named fierce Amazon critic Lina Khan</a> as FTC chair upon her confirmation to the agency. In March, Biden named another noted Big Tech critic, Columbia law professor Tim Wu, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html">to the National Economic Council</a> as a special assistant for tech and competition policy.</p>
<p>All signs point to the Biden White House gearing up for a major federal fight with Big Tech. Congress is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/technology/antitrust-overhaul-congress.html">working on a set of Big Tech bills</a>, but in lieu of — or in tandem with — legislative reform, the White House can flex its own regulatory muscle through the FTC and DOJ.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/politics/white-house-section-230-facebook/index.html">new comments to MSNBC</a>, the White House confirmed that it is also &#8220;reviewing&#8221; Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a potent snippet of law that protects platforms from liability for user-generated content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, R-Zero, a pandemic-era biosafety company, announced the acquisition of CoWorkr &#8212; a company that develops room occupancy sensors. The acquisition marks a shift in focus for R-Zero as people return to work, vaccines are rolled out and companies that sprung up in response to the COVID-19 adapt to another phase of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When R-Zero was founded in April 2020, the company primarily focused on developing hospital-grade UVC disinfection systems, or lights that can neutralize certain types of viruses (more on this later). As companies scrambled for ways to sanitize buildings, the company racked up a total of $58.8 million in funding at a $256.5 million valuation. R-Zero now has about 1,000 private and public sector clients that range from correctional facilities to the Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics, to the South San Francisco Unified School District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoWorkr was founded in 2014 and had totaled about $200,000 in seed funding, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coworkr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the acquisition of CoWorkr, R-Zero plans to develop an internet of things-style sensor network to manage both personnel and cleaning in the workplace, says R-Zero founder Grant Morgan. The company is moving beyond simply disinfecting air and surfaces, and will focus on managing the flow of people (and the viruses and bacteria) in public spaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like an OS for the workplace. That’s what we’re building: Tools that help both create and maintain indoor environments with health and productivity at their core,” Morgan tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Redmond and Keenan May, both co-founders of CoWorkr, will remain on in full-time roles, where they will run a corporate real estate initiative, and develop an IoT capacity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve spent a lot of time with our customers and understanding our customers’ initiatives, especially in commercial real estate,” Redmond tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority are moving to a hybrid working scenario and that means you know they really need occupancy information,” she continues. “Our initiative in joining with R-Zero is very much highlighted by what the future of hybrid work looks like and what the future of commercial real estate looks like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-CoWorkr, R-Zero’s flagship product was a UVC light called Arc &#8212; a rectangular light that can be wheeled into an office space once janitorial staff leave the office. It also offered a product called Arc Air, an air filter that also uses UVC light to kill germs, and that could be used in occupied spaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVC lights had a brief moment of fame in mid-2020 for several reasons: they seemed like powerful ways to disinfect communal spaces, and there were certain incentives for companies to apply tech-based solutions to COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVC lights have been used in hospitals for decades to sanitize surfaces like scanners, or to sanitize air when inserted into UV air ducts. Studies have shown it can inactivate </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85425-w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flu viruses in the air</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Limited evidence also noted that UVC can also inactivate </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85425-w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SARS-CoV-2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67211-2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other coronaviruses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by destroying the virus’ outer protein coating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These lights were also used in real-life during the pandemic. The New York Metropolitan Transport Authority, for example, purchased </span><a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/05/19/mta-invests--1-million-in-uv-light-machines-to-clean-subways"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worth of UVC lights to disinfect subway cars each evening. The CARES act passed in March 2020 was to allow companies and public sector institutions to use government loans to </span><a href="https://www.pandemicoversight.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/GSA%20CARES%20Act%20Spend%20Plan%20%281%29.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase cleaning services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including UV lights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, some consumer-facing lamps drew their fair share of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/health/coronavirus-transmission-indoors.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For one, they can cause eye injuries or burns if people are exposed to them for a long period of time. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7571309/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of UVC disinfection (notably, written by two scientists with ties to a UVC disinfection company) offered a blunt assessment noting that “nonscientific performance claims” were “widespread” in the nascent industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, R-Zero’s Arc does have third-party testing to its name &#8212; it was shown to reduce 99.99% of two viruses: a common cold coronavirus, and a surrogate for norovirus on surfaces. It was also 99.99% effective in killing off </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. Coli </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Methicillin-resistant </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staphylococcus aureus </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(MRSA). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite back-and-forth over the utility of some UVC lights as disinfection technology, some analysts suggest this industry isn’t going anywhere (for one, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/lg-uv-robots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LG has entered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the UV-based cleaning space). Tim Mulrooney, a commercial services equities analyst for William Blair, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/lg-uv-robots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that we’re living through a “paradigm shift” in how people think about hygiene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polling from 2020 suggests that cleaning procedures were top of mind for employees and customers alike. Of 3,000 people </span><a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/content/dam/deloittedigital/us/documents/offerings/offering-20200626-safety-cleanliness-covid.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveyed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Deloitte, 64% of employees said that regular cleaning of shared spaces was important to them and 62% of customers wanted surfaces cleaned after every interaction. (This is despite evidence that surfaces aren’t thought to be a way that COVID-19 spreads.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, it’s unclear how the rise of vaccines might impact perceptions of office cleanliness. But Morgan is betting that companies (and employees) are now more aware of the germs in our midst than they might have been pre-pandemic, and will be eager for ways to control their spread &#8212; that includes managing the flow of people within an office. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For R-Zero that means moving beyond UVC disinfection to focus on occupancy management, with the acquisition of CoWorkr. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan calls CoWorkr’s sensors R-Zero’s “eyes and ears.” R-Zero plans to announce two UVC-based products that address air cleanliness in occupied spaces, and will use CoWorkr&#8217;s sensors to ensure “full automation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, CoWorker&#8217;s battery-powered thermal sensors allow employers to know which rooms in an office are being occupied. That information, he says, could help trigger the use of a UV-based air filter or other cleaning products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That information could also tell janitorial staff to clean the room more thoroughly that evening — or conversely, to forgo cleaning a room that hasn&#8217;t been touched all day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What our customers are seeing is that they’re getting an immediate ROI. Our customers are reducing labor costs by 30-40%,” says Morgan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, says Morgan, the company is bullish on the idea that people will still crave clean workspaces; perhaps due to some lingering “scar tissue” from the pandemic, he notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“​​In almost 100% of cases, our customers are looking at this as a long term investment,” Morgan adds. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A report last week hinted at some of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1">Netflix&#8217;s gaming ambitions</a>. In <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">its Q2 2021 earnings report</a>, the company confirmed some things. First, Netflix says it &#8220;will be primarily focused&#8221; on mobile at first, looking to expand on its interactivity projects like <em>Black Mirror Bandersnatch </em>and its Stranger Things games. The upcoming titles will be available at no additional cost as part of your subscription and the company was clear it will keep up the pace on movies and television.</p>
<p>&#8220;We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,&#8221; the company said in a letter to its shareholders.</p>
<p>2020 was a big year for Netflix. With everyone stuck at home and movie theaters closed, the streaming service attracted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">16 million new customers in three months</a>. As expected, in 2021 that pace has dramatically slowed and the new customer numbers continue to be a struggle. In its earnings report, the company says it added 1.5 million subscribers in Q2, which was actually a bit better than its forecast mark of one million. However, that&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2021-201731732.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">lower than Q1 2021</a>, which saw the company tack on 3.98 new customers globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Netflix says it forecasts new customer additions to hit 3.5 million in Q3 2021, up from 2.2 million during the same three-month a year ago. If it does so, the company explains that would bring the total new subscriber tally to 54 million over the last two years. The pace may have slowed for Netflix, but overall it&#8217;s doing just fine. Revenue was still up 19 percent year-over-year at $7.3 billion for the quarter.</p>
<p>According to Netflix&#8217;s own numbers, <em>Shadow and Bone </em>was a popular series this quarter, streaming to over 55 million &#8220;member households&#8221; in less than a month. The show has already been renewed for a second season based on those numbers. <em>Sweet Tooth, </em>a series based on a DC comic, was streamed by 60 million households the first month it was available. Unscripted series like <em>Too Hot to Handle </em>and <em>The Circle </em>were popular selections as well, as was true crime docuseries <em>The Sons of Sam. </em>In terms of movies, Zac Snyder&#8217;s <em>Army of the Dead </em>hit 75 million households in the first month. Netflix also explained that <em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines </em>is now its biggest animated film to date, streaming to 53 million households.</p>
<p>Netflix says COVID-related production delays led to a &#8220;lighter&#8221; first half of 2021 in terms of content, but the pace will pick up throughout the rest of the year. The company&#8217;s Q3 lineup includes new seasons of <em>La Casa de Papel</em> (<em>Money Heist</em>), <em>Sex Education</em>, <em>Virgin River</em> and <em>Never Have I Ever</em> in addition to live action films like <em>Sweet Girl</em> (Jason Momoa), <em>Kissing Booth 3 </em>and <em>Kate</em> (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Plus, there&#8217;s the animated film <em>Vivo</em>, which will feature new music from Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Natasha Mascarenhas look into recent figures from U.S. edtech giant Duolingo.</p>
<p>It announced a first price range of $85 to $95 per share, which Alex and Natasha note “feels strong.”</p>
<p>“If Duolingo poses a strong debut, consumer edtech startups will be able to add a golden data point to their pitch decks,” they write. “A strong Duolingo listing could also signal that mission-driven startups can have impressive turns.”</p>
<p>But if it struggles?</p>
<p>“The wave of consumer edtech apps may lose some enthusiasm about going public.”</p>

<p>Seven years ago, ad executive Jen Young and tech entrepreneur Jeff Cavins stepped away from the careers they&#8217;d built to launch Outdoorsy, an RV rental marketplace.</p>
<p>Last month, they announced a partnership with high-end camping company Collective Retreats and raised a $90 million Series D and $40 million in debt to speed up an already impressive rate of growth.</p>
<p>To learn more about their approach to building a transportation company that caters to people who crave a taste of nomadic existence, Rebecca Bella interviewed Young and Cavins for Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>Their conversation explored the impacts of COVID-19, their business strategy and why they decided to take on $30 million in debt financing:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jeff Cavins:</strong> We like to look at macro trends as a business and I think U.S. monetary policy is going to get us all in a little bit of trouble. So we wanted to lock in a credit facility for the company at advantageous terms.</p></blockquote>

<p>The good news for biotech startups is that investment in the sector is soaring.</p>
<p>“Along the way, founders will need to procure additional investments, develop strategic partnerships and stave off competition,” Kevin A. O&#8217;Connor, a partner in the Intellectual Property practice group at Neal Gerber Eisenberg, writes in a guest column. “All of which starts by protecting the fundamental asset of any biotech company: its intellectual property.”</p>

<p>At our recent Early Stage event, we had the opportunity to talk with Arvind Purushotham, the managing director and global head of Citi Ventures, about how startups should think about corporate venture arms, including what a check from an enterprise like Citi can mean, and how to leverage that kind of goliath once it’s already a financial partner.</p>
<p>For founders trying to understand the benefits and potential pitfalls of working with a corporate venture arm versus a more traditional venture team, it’s worth zipping through this discussion.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm considers what Robinhood’s first IPO price range ($38 to $42 per share) means for the U.S. consumer fintech giant and whether we can expect it to raise the range again before it debuts.</p>
<p>In picking apart Robinhood’s latest filing, Alex noticed an aside about decreased crypto trading volume.</p>
<p>“Because Robinhood deals with consumers, who might decide to trade less in time, it has more uncertainty in its future growth than, say, Zoom,” he notes.</p>

<p>Zoom plans to spend a little less than a sixth of its value on Five9, which sells software that allows users to reach customers across platforms and record notes on their interactions.</p>
<p>Alex Wilhelm notes “that Five9’s revenue growth rate is a fraction of Zoom’s.”</p>
<p>“The larger company, then, is buying a piece of revenue that is growing slower than its core business. That’s a bit of a flip from many transactions that we see, in which the smaller company being acquired is growing faster than the acquiring entity’s own operations.</p>
<p>“Why would Zoom buy slower growth for so very much money?”</p>

<p>Few companies have deeper insights into the day-by-day state of venture capital than AngelList.</p>
<p>According to the company’s data, over 51% of the “top tier U.S. VC deals” involve their platform and tools, giving them a remarkably expansive view of everything going on.</p>
<p>AngelList Venture CEO Avlok Kohli joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage to discuss topics ranging from the state of the market to his thoughts on why there’s suddenly so much money flooding into VC (sending valuations to the sky), and where AngelList could go from here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499555122323457">announced</a> today it will begin testing a new set of features for TweetDeck, the company&#8217;s often-ignored social media dashboard aimed at Twitter&#8217;s power users, which Twitter <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content">may soon turn into</a> a new subscription service. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1417501900409171971">a post from </a>Twitter Product Lead Kayvon Beykpour, the revamped version of the Twitter client will include a full tweet composer, new advanced search features, new column types and a new way to group columns into clean workspaces.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re testing new features in TweetDeck for a small group in the U.S., Canada and Australia. These include a full Tweet Composer, new advanced search features, new column types, and a new way to group columns into clean workspaces. <a href="https://t.co/7bTiwBPmea">https://t.co/7bTiwBPmea</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1417501900409171971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Beykpour earlier this year had teased Twitter&#8217;s plan to introduce an overhauled version of TweetDeck. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder">an interview with The Verge</a>, he admitted that Twitter hadn&#8217;t &#8220;given TweetDeck a lot of love recently,&#8221; but said that would soon change with a revamp, which he then described as a &#8220;pretty big overhaul from the ground up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The update appears to be making good on that promise with a handful of notable changes.</p>
<p>For example, Twitter tells TechCrunch the new tweet composer will allow you to add GIFs, polls or emojis to your tweets, including scheduled tweets, not just photos and videos, as before. You also will be able to write threads and tag your images.</p>
<p>In addition to the large list of existing column options, users will be able to access new column types, including Profile, Topics, Explore, Events, Moments and Bookmarks. Unfortunately, this seems to have come at the expense of other column types, including Activity, Followers, Likes and Outbox, which have been removed.</p>
<p>The new advanced search feature lets you use Boolean queries. And you can now choose between viewing either the top tweets or the latest tweets in the first columns.</p>
<p>But one of the app&#8217;s more clever new additions is a feature called &#8220;Decks,&#8221; which will allow you to organize sets of columns into separate workspaces. This could help users who want to create different workspaces associated with different themes or interests. Or, for social media managers, it could help them keep up with tweets related to their many different clients, perhaps.</p>
<p>Despite the benefits some of the changes could provide, a number of responses from testers who gained access to the new TweetDeck weren&#8217;t all that positive. Users are complaining in particular about the loss of<a href="https://twitter.com/mike_the_maggot/status/1417529744157982723"> the &#8220;Activity&#8221; </a>column option that shows whenever anyone you follow on Twitter favorites a tweet or follows another user, as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/warnvod/status/1417578434226753540">the missing messages column</a>.</p>
<p>Others are annoyed that the Timeline <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_the_maggot/status/1417529744157982723">defaults to top tweets</a> instead of new tweets, that <a href="https://twitter.com/FredEOwens/status/1417553149049643017">you can&#8217;t create</a> a column for <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanBarkan/status/1417515620774580231">your direct messages</a> and that <a href="https://twitter.com/natethenate/status/1417565485898493956">collections are gone.</a> Some said it&#8217;s<a href="https://twitter.com/redgypsee/status/1417528004444491781"> too difficult</a> to resize the columns and they couldn&#8217;t figure out how to <a href="https://twitter.com/RohitAlexander/status/1417553207614640130">use it with multiple accounts</a>. Others said it needed<a href="https://twitter.com/luca/status/1417558362858864644"> a bottom scroll bar and the ability</a> to turn off images. <a href="https://twitter.com/natethenate/status/1417565489052585986">As one user put it</a>, &#8220;[This] isn&#8217;t a new TweetDeck. It&#8217;s a multi-column Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worse, a post from TweetDeck itself about the update appeared to show a completely different type of app than what people were used to &#8212; with wide columns and a very large photo image taking up too much space. These would be the sort of changes that would ruin the information-dense experience most TweetDeck users prefer.</p>
<p>However, a <a href="https://twitter.com/EricZuck/status/1417531258201063424">more reassuring screenshot</a> from Twitter employee Eric Zuckerman, who works in news partnerships, showed off a version of the new TweetDeck that looks very much like the app people know and love, with tight columns, smaller images a smaller font size.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve been using the new TweetDeck preview for 9 months. If you&#39;re a longtime user and thrown off by the image below, rest assured you can customize your columns to look and behave very much like the version you know and love. For example, here&#39;s mine: <a href="https://t.co/i9bT1Mkfr8">pic.twitter.com/i9bT1Mkfr8</a> <a href="https://t.co/16dHgdVXAQ">https://t.co/16dHgdVXAQ</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s post also promoted the updated TweetDeck as something that would &#8220;incorporate more of what you see on Twitter.com,&#8221; which further confused and concerned <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499555122323457">many TweetDeck users</a> who replied by pointing out that they use TweetDeck because it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> look or operate like Twitter&#8217;s web app <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499555122323457">and is free of the many extra features</a> Twitter introduces.</p>
<p>A Twitter engineer, Angelo Tomasco,<a href="https://twitter.com/angetomasco/status/1417544518795243523"> clarified</a> that the changes aren&#8217;t only about making TweetDeck &#8220;look more like Twitter&#8221; &#8212; they&#8217;re about a shared infrastructure that will bring health and safety updates to TweetDeck and allow Twitter developers to spend less time playing catch-up with Twitter so they can instead build out new features and address user feedback.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s not only about making it &quot;look more like Twitter&quot;. The shared infrastructure brings all sort of health and safety features out of the box, and we as developers have to spend less time to play catch-up and more time to develop new features and address feedback.</p>
<p>&mdash; Angelo Tomasco (@angetomasco) <a href="https://twitter.com/angetomasco/status/1417544518795243523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Whatever your opinion, you can at least be assured that the version of TweetDeck arriving today to testers is not the final product.</p>
<p>Twitter says it will roll out the new version to a small group of randomly selected people in the U.S., Canada and Australia to start. (Of course, app researcher Jane Manchun Wong has <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1417520652634836992">already found a workaround</a> for that limitation, if you&#8217;re interested!)</p>
<p>And Twitter says it will listen and respond to user feedback about the changes.</p>
<p>It will have to, in fact, as Twitter tells us this test is about exploring how it could make TweetDeck a part of its subscription offerings in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this test, we hope to gather feedback to explore what an enhanced version of TweetDeck could look like within Twitter’s subscription offerings later on,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson said. &#8220;We’ll have more to share later as we learn from this test,&#8221; they noted.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Maine has joined a growing number of cities, counties and states that are rejecting dangerously biased surveillance technologies like facial recognition.</p>
<p>The new law, which is the strongest statewide facial recognition law in the country, not only received broad, bipartisan support, but it passed unanimously in both chambers of the state legislature. Lawmakers and advocates spanning the political spectrum &#8212; from the progressive lawmaker who sponsored the bill to the Republican members who voted it out of committee, from the ACLU of Maine to state law enforcement agencies &#8212; came together to secure this major victory for Mainers and anyone who cares about their right to privacy.</p>
<p>Maine is just the latest success story in the nationwide movement to ban or tightly regulate the use of facial recognition technology, an effort led by grassroots activists and organizations like the ACLU. From the Pine Tree State to the Golden State, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/topic/stopping-face-recognition-surveillance/?redirect=facerecognition">national efforts</a> to regulate facial recognition demonstrate a broad recognition that we can’t let technology determine the boundaries of our freedoms in the digital 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facial recognition technology poses a profound threat to civil rights and civil liberties. Without democratic oversight, governments can use the technology as a tool for dragnet surveillance, threatening our freedoms of speech and association, due process rights, and right to be left alone. Democracy itself is at stake if this technology remains unregulated.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Facial recognition technology poses a profound threat to civil rights and civil liberties.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We know the burdens of facial recognition are not borne equally, as Black and brown communities &#8212; especially Muslim and immigrant communities &#8212; are already targets of discriminatory government surveillance. Making matters worse, face surveillance algorithms tend to have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/">more difficulty</a> accurately analyzing the faces of darker-skinned people, women, the elderly and children. Simply put: The technology is dangerous when it works &#8212; and when it doesn’t.</p>
<p>But not all approaches to regulating this technology are created equal. Maine is among the first in the nation to pass comprehensive statewide regulations. Washington was the first, passing a weak law in the face of <a href="https://www.aclu-wa.org/story/we-need-face-surveillance-moratorium-not-weak-regulations-concerns-about-sb-6280">strong opposition</a> from civil rights, community and religious liberty organizations. The law passed in large part because of strong backing from Washington-based megacorporation Microsoft. Washington’s facial recognition law would still allow tech companies to sell their technology, worth millions of dollars, to every conceivable government agency.</p>
<p>In contrast, Maine’s law strikes a different path, putting the interests of ordinary Mainers above the profit motives of private companies.</p>
<p>Maine’s new law prohibits the use of facial recognition technology in most areas of government, including in public schools and for surveillance purposes. It creates carefully carved out exceptions for law enforcement to use facial recognition, creating standards for its use and avoiding the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html">potential for abuse</a> we’ve seen in other parts of the country. Importantly, it prohibits the use of facial recognition technology to conduct surveillance of people as they go about their business in Maine, attending political meetings and protests, visiting friends and family, and seeking out healthcare.</p>
<p>In Maine, law enforcement must now &#8212; among other limitations &#8212; meet a probable cause standard before making a facial recognition request, and they cannot use a facial recognition match as the sole basis to arrest or search someone. Nor can local police departments buy, possess or use their own facial recognition software, ensuring shady technologies like Clearview AI will not be used by Maine’s government officials behind closed doors, as <a href="https://data.aclum.org/public-records/frt-ma/private-companies/clearview_ai/">has happened</a> in other <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement">states</a>.</p>
<p>Maine’s law and others like it are crucial to preventing communities from being harmed by new, untested surveillance technologies like facial recognition. But we need a federal approach, not only a piecemeal local approach, to effectively protect Americans’ privacy from facial surveillance. That’s why it’s crucial for Americans to support the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7356/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded">Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act</a>, a bill introduced by members of both houses of Congress last month.</p>
<p>The ACLU supports this federal legislation that would protect all people in the United States from invasive surveillance. We urge all Americans to ask their members of Congress to join the movement to halt facial recognition technology and support it, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, has expanded its autonomous vehicle testing program to New York City as part of its strategy to develop and deploy the technology.</p>
<p>New York City joins a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/mobileye-is-bringing-its-autonomous-vehicle-test-fleets-to-at-least-four-more-cities-in-2021/">number of other cities</a>, including Detroit, Paris, Shanghai and Tokyo, where Mobileye has either launched testing or plans to this year. Mobileye launched its first test fleet in Jerusalem in 2018 and added one in Munich in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we want to build something that will scale, we need to be able to drive in challenging places and almost everywhere,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Mobileye president and CEO Amnon Shashua</span> said during a presentation Tuesday that was streamed live. As part of the announcement, Mobileye also released a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/press-kit-mobileye-new-york-city.html?cid=em&amp;source=elo&amp;campid=smg_WW_bracbu_EMPR_EN_2021_0720_Mobileye_Now_Testing_C-MKA-22955_T-MKA-25848&amp;content=smg_WW_bracbu_EMPR_EN_2021_0720_Mobileye_Now_Testing_C-MKA-22955_T-MKA-25848&amp;elq_cid=1494219&amp;em_id=71560&amp;elqrid=3d46c6de890543179e4aad43e5930f23&amp;elqcampid=45621&amp;erpm_id=4074574">40-minute unedited video</a> of one of its test vehicles equipped with a self-driving system navigating New York&#8217;s city streets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These vehicles, which began testing in New York City last month, are driving autonomously (with a safety operator behind the wheel) using only cameras. The vehicles are equipped with eight long-range and four parking cameras powered by its fifth-generation system on chip called EyeQ5.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobileye is bringing its autonomous vehicle test fleets to at least four more cities in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/mobileye-is-bringing-its-autonomous-vehicle-test-fleets-to-at-least-four-more-cities-in-2021/embed/#?secret=vcBa5EjdsI" data-secret="vcBa5EjdsI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That does not mean that Mobileye is taking a camera-only approach to autonomy once it deploys. The company has also developed another subsystem with lidar and radar, but no cameras, that also drives autonomously. The two subsystems of sensors and software will be combined and integrated to provide redundancy in robotaxis. The camera-only subsystem is what Shashua described as at &#8220;the cost level for consumers&#8221; and one that will be used to evolve driving assist systems. Later this year, Mobilieye&#8217;s camera-only system using the EyeQ5 SoC will be launched in a Geely Auto Group vehicle.</p>
<p>New York City has been in Shashua&#8217;s sights for more than six months. He<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> first mentioned a desire to test on public roads in New York during the virtual 2021 CES tech trade show in January with the caveat that the company would need to receive </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">regulatory approval. Now, with that regulatory approval in hand, Mobileye is the only company currently permitted to test AVs in the state and city. GM&#8217;s self-driving subsidiary Cruise outlined in 2017 a plan to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/cruises-self-driving-chevrolet-bolts-are-coming-to-new-york-next-year/">test AVs in New York</a> and even mapped parts of lower Manhattan. The company never scaled up the test program in NYC, deciding instead to focus on its primary target for commercial deployment: San Francisco. </span></p>
<p>Mobileye applied for a permit through New York State&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology demonstration and testing program. The company met the requirements outlined in the program, which includes compliance with all federal standards and applicable New York State inspection standards as well as a law enforcement interaction plan, according to Mobileye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything special about receiving approval, you simply need to go through this process, Shashua said, who described it as lengthy and in some ways similar to the stringent requirements to test in Germany. &#8220;I think what is special is that it&#8217;s very, very difficult to drive here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mobileye is perhaps best known for supplying automakers with computer vision technology that powers advanced driver assistance systems. It’s a business that generated nearly $967 million in sales for the company. Today, 88 million vehicles on the road are using Mobileye’s computer vision technology.</p>
<p>Mobileye has also been developing automated vehicle technology. Its full self-driving stack &#8212; which includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology — is combined with its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy.</p>
<p>Mobileye&#8217;s REM mapping system crowdsources data by tapping into consumer and fleet vehicles equipped with its so-called EyeQ4, or fourth-generation system on chip, to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems. That data is not video or images but compressed text that collects about 10 kilobits per kilometer. Mobileye has agreements with six OEMs, including BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen, to collect that data on vehicles equipped with the EyeQ4 chip, which is used to power the advanced driver assistance system. On fleet vehicles, Mobileye collects data from an after-market product it sells to commercial operators.</p>

<p>Mobileye&#8217;s technology is mapping nearly 8 million kilometers day globally, including in New York City.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The strategy, Shashua contends, will allow the company to efficiently launch and operate commercial robotaxi services as well as bring the technology to consumer passenger vehicles by 2025. Shashua explained this dual approach in an interview with TechCrunch in 2020. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;There was realization that dawned on us awhile ago,&#8221; he said at the time. &#8220;The Holy Grail of this business is passenger car autonomy: where you buy a passenger car and you pay an option price and with a press of button it can take you autonomously to wherever you want to go. The realization is that you can’t reach that Holy Grail if you don’t go through the robotaxi business.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Shashua said Mobileye was the only company that has its foot in both camps. (Although it should be noted that Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet does have some strategic overlap.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building our technology in a way that supports scale, especially geographic scale, using our crowdsourced mapping technology and building new sensors such that the entire package — the entire system — will be under $5,000 cost to allow consumer AVs, and on the other hand, we have a division building a mobility-as-a-service or robotaxi service,&#8221; Shashua said Tuesday. &#8220;This is one of the reasons why we purchased Moovit last year, to enable the customer facing of all the layers above the self-driving system to enable mobility-as-a-service business.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tech boom in Southeast Asia isn’t just seeding a wave of new entrepreneurs building the next generation of unicorns, it’s also ushering young talent into the roles of first-time managers. And NewCampus, a Singapore-based startup co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hellowillfan/?originalSubdomain=sg">Will Fan</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaofei?originalSubdomain=sg">Fei Yao</a>, announced today that it has raised millions of dollars to help coming of age companies train their maturing workforce to help them grow into those new, larger roles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newcampus.co/">NewCampus</a> is an online, live learning platform that hopes to train rising managers within hyper-growth organizations. Its leadership “sprints” focus on topics like retaining knowledge, and what goes into curating a safe environment for teams. The company was part of SuperCharger Ventures’ inaugural edtech accelerator, and today announced that it has attracted millions of dollars in investor interest.</p>
<p>The startup has closed a seed financing round of $2.5 million in a round led by Juvo Ventures’ Maia Sharpley. Other investors include Zanichelli Venture, M Venture Partners, 27V, Pavan Katepalli, the former chief learning officer at Trilogy Education, along with existing investors SOSV and 500 Startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While first describing itself as a membership gym for<strong> </strong>learning experiences, the 2019-founded startup raised capital to further invest in its latest iteration: an up-skilling platform for SMBs.</p>
<p>Currently, NewCampus builds content in-house, and then asks industry experts to come in and add in their flair of expertise. Users are expected to dedicate between four to five hours a week for work, with 90 minutes of that time devoted to live, instructor-led workshops. The material differs from other online programs by focusing on more philosophical skills, like how to create a safe environment for teams or how to retain knowledge, instead of topics like like Finance 101. Currently, its content looks more general, serving the emerging manager in tech, not the first-time manager handling a fintech startup during a pivot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179909" style="width: 812px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179909" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2179909" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png" alt="newcampus-ux-seed" width="802" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png 1640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179909" class="wp-caption-text">NewCampus offers live classes for first-time managers. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> NewCampus</p></div></p>
<p>There’s a lot of workforce training tools on the market right now: Udemy, BetterUp, Skillshare, Udacity; but NewCampus is confident that it can win by selling to a market it believes is underserved: Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>NewCampus targets companies that have a presence of between 500 to 1,000 people in the Southeast Asia region. Fan mentioned how companies like Grab, GoJek and Carousell still turn to local trainers in countries like Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore &#8212; giving his company an opportunity to come in and bring more advanced pedagogy and branding.</p>
<p>While India’s frenzy of hiring and retaining talent is not to be missed, the co-founder says that the startup is looking in other, less-crowded markets.</p>
<p>“[The customer] may be a 600-person fintech company with an HQ in Hong Kong, but their management team is sitting in Hong Kong, their sales teams in Sydney, Melbourne, their dev team is in Indonesia and their sales team is in Philippines, and already that breakdown of managing remote teams is sophisticated and nuanced in its own way,” Fan said.</p>
<p>Yao likened the momentum around improving diversity and inclusion efforts in the United States to the momentum around enhancing cross-cultural communication in Southeast Asia, “because of how fragmented the market is and how fast teams are growing across the region.” She added that a lot of United States-based upskilling products “don’t speak to the rest of the world,” which gives NewCampus a chance to curate an instructor pool, time zone focus and product for its end users.</p>
<p>Smaller organizations can buy annual subscriptions for their managers to take general content courses, while larger organizations can pay for in-house programs that NewCampus will then manage and run themselves. As with any B2B business model, selling to an institution versus an individual appears to be more lucrative over time when the startup starts serving hundreds and thousands of managers. However, Yao stressed that NewCampus’ strategic advantage is more in helping upskill smaller organizations.</p>

<p>“It actually really does serve underserved businesses that don&#8217;t have access to traditional training facilities at those price points,” Yao said. “At the same time, a lot of the companies that we’re currently working with are more familiar with keeping something that’s within their company, it’s a bit of a balance of both.” The split between individual programming and in-house programming is currently 50/50.</p>
<p>Currently about 80% of NewCampus’ learners and 60% of its instructors identify as women.</p>
<h2>Testing the tester</h2>
<p>The test for NewCampus is if it can scale its content to be effective and inclusive of hundreds of thousands of emerging managers. This will require the company to niche down its content to specific managerial paths depending on profession, or grow bigger and serve seasoned managers as well.</p>
<p>NewCampus is pursuing university accreditation, which suggests that it sees itself eventually becoming a replacement for traditional degrees. Fan likened it to how fintech startups acquired banking licenses half a decade ago, in an attempt to build brand awareness and trust.</p>
<p>Per a number of investors who had seen NewCampus’ pitch deck, the university licensing move is a nod to NewCampus’ initial bet: that it could become an alternative to the MBA.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will edtech empower or erase the need for higher education?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/will-edtech-empower-or-erase-the-need-for-higher-education/embed/#?secret=2tPoNdGNDh" data-secret="2tPoNdGNDh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The issue with modern business schools is that much of the utility in higher-ed isn’t the content, but the network and brand name making its way to a student&#8217;s resume. While NewCampus may thus lean on accreditation as differentiation, it really needs to lean on different ways to signal to society that its content &#8212; and consumers of its content &#8212; matters. Yao thinks that investors may be off on NewCampus’ interpretation of replacing the business school degree.</p>
<p>“They’re thinking of big names, like Stanford and Harvard,” she said. “We’re taking on the vertical of business education as a whole, the people who come to us, they’re not the people who haven’t gotten into Harvard, they’re 100% the people who had never considered Harvard to begin with.”</p>
