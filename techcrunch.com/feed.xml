										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In February, <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://disha.ng/">Disha</a>, a Nigeria-based platform that allows digital creators to curate, sell digital content, create portfolios and receive payments from their audience globally, announced that it was closing shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the news, Disha had bootstrapped to more than 20,000 users; at some point, it claimed to have a monthly growth rate of about 100%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Three days after announcing its shutdown, however, Disha did an about-face and said it was thinking of new options for the company and would share an update once it made a new decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, a Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/sharononyinye_/status/1455475527251369989?s=21">noticed</a> Disha FAQs on Flutterwave’s support documents, suggesting that the unicorn company might have acquired the creator platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Disha’s FAQs have been <a href="https://support.flutterwave.com/en/collections/3195568-disha-faq">removed</a>, Flutterwave confirmed to TechCrunch today that it has indeed bought the two-year-old platform. The terms of the deal are undisclosed; however, some sources say the purchase price is in six figures.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Flutterwave has been rumoured to acquire some startups in the past, this is its first public announcement of any acquisition since launching in 2016 to tackle Africa’s payments problems. And what&#8217;s more surprising is that the buy is outside payments or fintech.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disha </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Evans Akanno, Rufus Oyemade and Blessing Abeng in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is one of the well-known platforms built from Africa, including <a href="https://selar.co/">Selar</a> and <a href="https://irawotalents.com/">Irawo</a>, targeting creators and influencers globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Disha provided them with tools to create a one-page site so they could curate and share links, content, portfolios and a checkout system to receive payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Disha had users globally, its revenues were low, making </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> above $1,000 in monthly recurring revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With little revenues and limited resources, Disha showed signs of struggle, even ex-CEO attested to this in a now-deleted LinkedIn post where he expressed burnout while running Disha and Cregital, a design agency he founded and was CEO, a role he stepped down from in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We [the founders] decided to shut down the company because we ran out of resources to continue driving the very valid vision we had,” ex-CTO Oyemade told TechCrunch in an email. “With Flutterwave, we now have a way to drive both value for creators and revenue to sustain the business. We are happy to have gotten the call from Flutterwave, which actually kept hopes alive.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oyemade will continue to lead the technology behind the product with a new role as software and architectural lead</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akanno and Abeng, the ex-CMO, left the company to pursue other projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave says Disha will continue to be an independent product with a distinct brand and operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From now on, it wants to focus on features and integrations that help creators </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> schedule meetings and exhibitions, build sustainable income through subscriptions and leverage emerging technologies in the creator space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did Flutterwave make this acquisition? Certainly, it will bolster Disha’s payments checkout process and grow the platform’s base by allowing users to make transactions in over 150 currencies and 34 countries worldwide. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Flutterwave wants to take part in the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-famga-creator-economy/">$100 billion global creator economy</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has created an opportunity for millions of freelancers and creators to use no-code tools to monetize their craft and community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recently, we have diversified into building tools that will help freelancers, businesses and now creators grow,&#8221; Flutterwave CEO Olugbengba &#8220;GB&#8221; Agboola said in an email. &#8220;We saw Disha as an opportunity to capture a new market of indie creators that need innovative tools to showcase their craft and get paid. This acquisition cements our place as a growth partner for freelancers and businesses. For us, Flutterwave Store is to small businesses what Disha is to creators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is an increasing appetite to create, own, sell or share digital experiences such as NFTs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With the majority of NFT creators based in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe, Disha is well-positioned to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions around owning and selling these digital experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave knows that, and via this acquisition, the fintech is betting that Disha is its ticket to eat at that growing NFT table, where more than $10 billion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nft-sales-surge-107-bln-q3-crypto-asset-frenzy-hits-new-highs-2021-10-04/">spent</a></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Q3 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Disha is a global tool and the global creator economy is enormous, and with NFTs growing in popularity, there’s no limit to how huge the creator economy can grow,” GB said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market for complementary and alternative medicine &#8212; a wide-ranging area that includes practice-based work like yoga as well as a huge range of supplements and everything in between &#8212; has been on a massive upswing , with the global industry valued at <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/complementary-alternative-medicine-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$82.3 billion in 2020</a> and growing at a fast clip in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Now, a company called <a href="https://fullscript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fullscript</a>, which has built a wholesale backend and storefront builder to power the supplements businesses of alternative health practitioners providing these services, is getting a big infusion of cash to meet the opportunity. The Ottawa, Canada-based company has raised $240 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its business across North America, and developing more tools to serve its customers: practitioners building complementary and integrative treatment plans (bringing together both traditional and modern approaches) for their patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe integrated medicine will be medicine in the future,&#8221; Fullscript co-founder and CEO Kyle Braatz said in an interview. &#8220;Sixty percent practitioners are already focusing on wellness and prevention. It&#8217;s more than just pharmaceuticals, and patients are doing more than just popping a pill.&#8221; The company today offers a stock of some 20,000 products from some 300 brands.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231940" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The investment is coming from HGGC and Snapdragon Capital Partners &#8212; respectively a mid-market firm more known for private equity investments and a firm that invests in primarily health and wellness businesses. Fullscript&#8217;s valuation is not being disclosed, but for some context, the company has been around since 2012 and had only raised about $25 million previously, growing largely by being bootstrapped. And one reason that it will have come to investors&#8217; attention now is its financial track record on its own steam: it&#8217;s going to make $300 million in revenue this coming fiscal year, growing from a mere $40 million five years ago.</p>
<p>Fullscript is based in the same city as Shopify, and Braatz likened a little of what his company does in its own B2B2C model to what Shopify has achieved in the world of e-commerce.</p>
<p>Just as the latter has provided an easy way for companies selling online to build and operate their own web-based storefronts (a business that has been huge, and seen Shopify extending into a lot of adjacent areas as a result), Fullscript is addressing the needs of practitioners online.</p>
<p>Among Fullscript&#8217;s services, it helps them source supplements; set up and fulfill prescriptions for those treatments from Fullscript&#8217;s dispensary, either to pick up in their offices or have delivered to their homes; manage their patients&#8217; bigger treatment plans through an integrated approach that brings data from these treatments into a patient&#8217;s wider electronic health records; and provide supplementary reading and other educational materials about the supplements that are being dispensed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Just as Shopify empowers merchants, we empower practitioners,&#8221; Braatz said. And just as Shopify has brought a number of different tools online for its merchant customers to build out their businesses on the Shopify platform, so too is Fullscript developing more technology to grow its proposition. That will include more analytics for its customers, more tools for patients to monitor their own progress and purchases, and so on.</p>
<p>Fullscript&#8217;s rise comes amid a much bigger push for online health services, and specifically those geared at selling medicines and supplements. That means more potential competition from Amazons of this world (Amazon being already a <a href="https://gritdaily.com/why-amazon-is-king-of-the-supplements-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major destination for vitamins and other supplements</a>), and more attention being paid to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others like Ro</a> trying to make headway in this space. But also a greater acceptance and understanding that the online component of this business is here to stay.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all smooth sailing. Complementary therapies have been a mixed bag when it comes to general acceptance and usage of them.</p>
<p>On one side, consumers, and a widening pool of traditional and modern practitioners are increasingly looking at these alongside the pharmaceutical approach. But on the other, there are a few reason why that hasn&#8217;t been more mainstream. For starters, insurance companies do not always provide coverage for these treatments as they do for the more standard medical treatments. One of the reasons for this is that, for better or worse, pharmaceutical approaches are trialled, tested, approved by regulators and generally entered into a realm of acceptance that makes it more likely that an insurance company (or practitioner) will opt for those treatments. The same has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not been the case for supplementary medicines</a>, not least because some of the effects might be harder to quantify. And partly because of that, or even from direct experience, there are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51312441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of reputable skeptics</a> when it comes to those effects.</p>
<p>Insurance is not part of the backend for the moment for Fullscript, and all of the payments for products are made by patients directly themselves.</p>
<p>In the defense of integrative approaches, however, there are plenty of reasons why consumers and the medical industry might also criticize the pharmaceutical approach, too (not least because it&#8217;s not 100% foolproof, the costs, the side effects and so on). Indeed, Braatz noted that attitudes towards integrative approaches are gradually starting to change, not least because of the many reasons that conventional approaches do not work perfectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the whole integrative market is just starting to leverage insurance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Practitioners starting to be compensated because compensation is evolving from volume to value-based. And we see hospital systems starting to build and acquire integrative clinics to keep patients out of hospital systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evolution, in effect, is as much a part of the investment strategy here as the current business is.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are long term believers in the Fullscript story, and we thought that its platform, the tech they developed, and the reviews of that we&#8217;ve seen of it from the industry, would be an exciting investment. There is a ton of potential,&#8221; said Bill Conrad of HGGC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investor interest in African fintech continues to grab headlines with large fundraises. Today, Africa’s largest digital payments network <a href="https://mfsafrica.com/">MFS Africa</a> joins the fray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised $100 million in Series C financing — split between $70 million equity and $30 million debt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private equity fund <a href="https://www.africinvest.com/news-and-media/news/africinvest-s-permanent-vehicle-five-achieves-its-fourth-close-bringing-afdb-as-investor/">AfricInvest FIVE</a> co-led the Series C round with existing investors Goodwell Investments and LUN Partners Group.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors CommerzVentures, Allan Gray Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest also joined the round</span>, while ShoreCap III returned as an existing investor with other funds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement is the icing on the cake for the company, which has made several significant acquisitions and investments in the last couple of years rarely matched by any fintech on the continent.</span></p>
<p>In a call with TechCrunch, founder and CEO <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dare-okoudjou">Dare Okoudjou</a> was quick to highlight MFS Africa’s mission on the continent: to make it easy for Africans to send and receive money just as they do with calls.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For someone who spent more than a decade in the telecoms as an engineer and executive, Okoudjou has been around long enough to know how difficult it was to make a phone call in Africa. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though calls are still expensive in Africa when compared to the rest of the world, the process of making them has become pretty simple thanks to mobile phone penetration and advancement in telecommunications. With MFS Africa, Okoudjou envisions the same for payments on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way we take for granted the fact that we can communicate with anybody around the world via a mobile phone, my dream is that it should be the same with a mobile wallet,” CEO Okoudjou told TechCrunch during an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you sign to any mobile wallet somewhere in the world, starting with Africa, it should be enough to transact with anybody else in the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the grand mission of the company.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started the company in 2009, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions from Kenya to Zambia, Uganda, Zimbabwe and the Ivory Coast, and vice versa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s the company continued to grow, it became </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the product had use cases for small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, at the time, more than half of its users in East Africa reported using the platform for business reasons, according to Okoudjou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, by merging fragmented and disparate payment schemes across the continent into one seamless network the same telecom networks operate, MFS Africa became the go-to platform for individuals and businesses to transact across borders and currencies.</span></p>
<h2>MFS has made a series of acquisitions and investments this past year</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based company connects more than 320 million mobile money wallets across 35+ African countries and 700 corridors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also covers a broad range of financial services around bank accounts, prepaid cards and virtual debit cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a presence in Africa’s largest market, Nigeria, remained elusive for the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hat changed last month when <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/10/20/mfs-africa-acquires-baxi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it acquired Baxi</a>, an agent banking platform developed by Capricorn Digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria is quite different from the typical MFS market, where mobile money agents run the show</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the West African country, agent banking networks are more prominent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because they offer a similar range of services in digitizing cash like mobile money agents in East Africa, it made sense for MFS to acquire Capricorn and have access to its more than 90,000 agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does the acquisition give MFS Africa an entry into the Nigerian market, but it also opens the company to a sophisticated agent network unseen in other African markets, said Okoudjou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile money agents are primarily helpful in providing customers with cash deposits and withdrawals whereas agent network platforms like Capricorn, via its Baxi boxes, provide underbanked and unbanked Nigerians with access to transfers, withdrawals, airtime purchases, utility bill payments, pay-TV and data subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Agent networks are the most digitalized segment of SMEs already on the continent because very often they have other businesses selling other things. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are plugged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the economy and the fabric of society,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So if you’re thinking about bringing digital payment and digital at large to SMEs in Africa, this is a pretty good place to start</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again that what’s happening in Nigeria may end up being the blueprint for the rest of the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Baxi acquisition is completed, pending approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Okoudjou says a customer can walk to a Baxi agent and make cross-border payments to Benin, Cameroon or China, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitating payments from Africa to China falls outside the purview of MFS Africa’s holistic pan-African payments approach. However, it’s an opportunity too good to ignore: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China-Africa bilateral trade is one of the fastest-growing corridors globally, with a value <a href="http://www.sais-cari.org/data-china-africa-trade">topping $192 billion</a> in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okoudjou says the company began considering the corridor when it kickstarted the acquisition of Beyonic, a Ugandan digital payments provider for small and medium-sized businesses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Johannesburg-based company had surveyed these businesses to understand their needs better and found out the most pressing issue they faced, asides from accessing loans, was sending and receiving payments to and from China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa is currently working on setting interoperability between payment networks in the Asian country and Africa, starting from Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">before spreading to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The timeline for rollout might be next year, according to some sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, MFS Africa </span><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1873964/mobile-money-giant-mfs-africa-acquires-beyonic-for-enterprise-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1873964/mobile-money-giant-mfs-africa-acquires-beyonic-for-enterprise-solutions/"> acquired Beyonic</a>; with Baxi, the company has made two consecutive acquisitions in the space of a year and some months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And coupled with minority stakes in smaller fintechs such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/ivorian-fintech-julaya-raises-2m-to-digitize-business-payments-in-francophone-africa/">Julaya</a>, Maviance and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/">Numida</a>; health insurance product Inclusivity and agritech platform Akorion, MFS Africa has done a decent job using investment and acquisitions — methods Okoudjou terms “inorganic growth” — to exert its influence across the continent.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MFS Africa leads $2.3M seed round in Ugandan fintech startup Numida&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/embed/#?secret=2nKojlgC7M" data-secret="2nKojlgC7M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, MFS Africa raised its Series B and closed at $23 million after some extensions. With this Series C round, its total equity raise is over $95 million while debt stands at $30 million (the company is raising debt for the first time). Emerging markets lender <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/emerging-markets-lender-lendable-seeks-100m-to-fund-fintech-companies/">Lendable</a> and Norsad provided the debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debt presents an opportunity for many founders and startups to have cheaper funding because they do not have to give out equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In MFS Africa’s case, it raised debt financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to finance the floats needed for real-time settlements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If someone is sending money from Kenya to Uganda in less than a minute, someone needs to be out of pocket. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We manage that across all these countries across all these partners, and you need a little bit of oil to grease the system,” said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized we don’t need to raise equity since there is a debt market for that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s one of the reasons we looked at debt and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again, as the ecosystem matures, more companies will also do a combination of debt and equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa intends to use the new investment in several ways. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it wants to double down on its expansion efforts and add more regional offices across the continent and in the U.S. and China</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It recently opened new offices in Abidjan, Kampala, Kinshasa, Nairobi and Lagos while moving its headquarters from Mauritius to London.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 12-year-old company has also earmarked some funding to strengthen its Governance, Risks and Compliance (GRC) functions and treasury and liquidity pool. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to hire more talent within and outside the continent and continue investing in other African tech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/juliustichelaar">Julius Tichelaar</a>, a partner at AfricInvest FIVE, said his firm led the round because MFS Africa’s broad range of financial and payments services resonates with AfricInvest FIVE’s financial inclusion strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cross border payments remain an important challenge in many African markets today and MFS Africa is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniquely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positioned to confront this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to join MFS Africa’s world-class management team on its mission and to support its growth journey,” he concluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.amenitiz.io">Amenitiz</a>, a Barcelona-based startup that describes its products as the operating system for independent hoteliers, B&amp;Bs and cottages. In more technical terms, Amenitiz has been building a vertical software-as-a-service product that combines everything you need to run a hotel.</p>
<p>The company just raised a $7.5 million (€6.5 million) seed round led by Point Nine. Backed, Otium and several business angels, such as Avi Meier, Matt Robinson and Carlos Gonzales, also participated in today’s round. Jean-Christophe Taunay and Arthur Waller are also going to be independent board members.</p>
<p>In particular, Amenitiz takes care of three important bricks in the hotel industry —&nbsp;it’s a property management system, it acts a channel manager and it let you accept direct bookings more easily.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You may have noticed that the same hotel is listed on many different websites that mostly belong to two companies —&nbsp;Booking Holdings (Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Kayak…) and Expedia Group (Expedia, Hotels.com, HomeAway, Trivago…). As distribution channels are highly fragmented, it has become complicated to manage listings on all those websites.</p>
<p>Hotels usually rely on channel managers to avoid cumbersome micro-management work. A channel manager can manage your listings across dozens of booking sites at once. Bookings are synchronized, which means that your hotel will appear as full on Hotels.com when you have sold the last room on Booking.com.</p>
<p>And a channel manager becomes even more useful when it integrates directly with your property management system (PMS). That tool lets you manage your hotel. For instance, you can allocate rooms, add an extra night and get an overview of the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on legacy technology, Amenitiz wants to create a proper software-as-a-service alternative that works well out of the box. As an added benefit, you can build cool stuff on top of this foundation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, the startup also helps you create a website your for your hotel or B&amp;B. On this site, you can let users book rooms directly using the startup’s booking module. And even if people want to book a room with a phone call or a WhatsApp message, you can send a payment link and track the booking in Amenitiz.</p>
<p>So far, Amenitiz has attracted 3,000 properties. With today’s funding round, Amenitiz plans to add more features, such as revenue management. It’ll triple the size of its teal with a focus on the French, Italian and Spanish markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenyan edtech startup</span><a href="https://craydel.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Craydel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a platform for comparing colleges, course options and tuition fees, has secured $1 million in a pre-seed round that will go toward improving its search and recommendation technology and enhancing its online resources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by Enza Capital, a private venture fund that invests in early-stage tech startups across Africa. Other investors in the round include Future of Learning Fund, a Kenya-based edtech backer; BriteGaze, a South African artificial intelligence fund; Bisk Ventures; a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm and Tekton Ventures; a San Francisco-based technology investment firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya-based Chandaria Capital, Nigeria-based LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund, and an array of other angel investors including founders and top executives of Africa’s leading SaaS, e-commerce and education startups joined, as well.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231607" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craydel was launched earlier this year by co-founders </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-sardana-a570497/?originalSubdomain=ke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manish Sardana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-nguru-38677638/?originalSubdomain=ke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Nguru</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shayne-aman-premji/?originalSubdomain=ke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shayne Aman Premji</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was inspired by the lack of a reliable portal in Africa to guide decisions on college and course selection. This provided a window of opportunity for the trio to bring to life a platform that would eliminate this challenge. Through Craydel, the founders said, they are giving power back to students by providing them with access to a portal that offers verified information about colleges to help them in decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An estimated $30 billion is spent every year on higher education in Africa,&#8221; Sardana, Craydel&#8217;s CEO, said. &#8220;But the current student experience in accessing higher education is abysmal. There is no aggregation of choices, and decision-making is influenced by biases and misinformation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are transforming the way students discover, compare and apply to higher education in Africa,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craydel provides students with options at every level, including online certificate programs, for which they can enroll to test the waters before settling on a final decision about the careers they want to pursue. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe in the power of the youth in Africa to create lasting transformative change. And Craydel is driven to empower them to access the best education pathways to unleash their true potential,” said Sardana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premji, Craydel’s chief financial officer, told TechCrunch that the edtech startup also takes the students through a career assessment to ensure they are a good fit for the chosen program and college. It also guides them on course application and visa processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has so far partnered with more than 90 universities and vocational colleges in Africa and abroad, and currently provides a listing of 3,000 higher education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new funding, Craydel is set to embark on a new path to build its search and recommendation engine for more spot-on suggestions, as well as build resources that will help students and professionals in the decision-making.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This paradox of choice is sometimes not a good thing,&#8221; Premji said. &#8220;So, we&#8217;re building using AI at the search and recommendation engine, which is proprietary technology to us. Through it, students or working professionals will tell us their interests, grades, budgets. We will also talk about their career aspirations and conduct aptitude assessments. The outcome of all these assessments is a curated list of the leading potential choices for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The edtech space in Africa is still nascent, but it is expected to grow as internet penetration deepens &#8212; connecting more people &#8212; and as more students enroll in higher education across the continent.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://kenza-bouhaj.medium.com/edtech-in-africa-a-landscape-6bb03c299b33"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending on education in Africa is expected to grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to $740 billion by 2030, at a 14% compound annual growth rate, and edtech spending is projected to expand fast, reaching $57 billion by 2030. Africa’s burgeoning young population provides an opportunity for the growth of companies such as Craydel, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">edtech providing solutions for many challenges, including those of accessibility, quality, affordability and information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​Kenya has several edtech startups, including</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/yc-backed-kidato-raises-1-4m-seed-to-scale-its-online-school-for-k-12-students-in-africa/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which launched last year to offer live lessons for students up to 18 years old; <a href="https://enezaeducation.com/">Eneza Education</a>, which enables learning through mobile technology; and <a href="https://e-limu.org/">e-Limu</a>, a literacy app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Access to higher education and skills development for Africa&#8217;s growing youth population remains fragmented, yet is a fundamental cornerstone to our accelerated development,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Enza Capital managing partner Mike Mompi, who is set to join Craydel’s board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Craydel is building the rails to democratize access to higher education and to support millions of Africans up this curve.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian food delivery firm Zomato is in talks to back logistics firm Shiprocket, savings app Magicpin, and health and fitness firm CureFit, four people familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>All these investment talks are at final stages and some may close as soon as this week, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>The investment in Shiprocket is part of a broader round that is being led by Singapore&#8217;s Temasek, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Indian newspaper Economic Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/shiprocket-eyes-200-million-from-temasek-and-others/articleshow/86025605.cms">first reported</a> about Temasek and Shiprocket talks. MoneyControl also reported about some of these talks and <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/exclusive-zomato-wants-to-do-an-info-edge-scouts-for-investments-in-startups-7698731.html">Zomato&#8217;s investment strategy</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Deepinder Goyal, co-founder and chief executive of Zomato, has explored investment opportunities in his personal capacity as well as through the firm in at least over half a dozen startups in recent months, according to sources at many of those firms.</p>
<p>In June, the publicly listed firm Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/zomatos-100-million-investment-to-turn-grofers-into-a-unicorn/">invested $100 million in online grocer Grofers</a>, and according to two people familiar with the matter, has told the younger firm that it is open to fully acquiring it at a later stage if certain metrics are achieved.</p>
<p>Zomato declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapid on-demand grocery and convenience delivery craze that has taken over Europe and the U.S. this past year is gradually making its way into Africa and the Middle East.</span></p>
<p>Today, the spotlight is on RabbitMart, or <a href="https://www.rabbitmart.com/">Rabbit</a> for short, a startup coming out of stealth with <span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million in pre-seed funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit is the latest of a long list of startups investors are willing to pump money into globally to deliver groceries and other items from neighbourhood fulfilment centres to people’s homes in 20 minutes or less. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Egypt and Africa at large, Rabbit is one of the pioneers alongside Breadfast, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/egypts-breadfast-wants-to-build-gopuff-for-africa-and-middle-east-gets-26m-backing/">announced</a> that it would begin to complete deliveries in less than 20 minutes. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227366" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based Global Founders Capital, Raed Ventures, Foundation Venture, MSA Capital and Goodwater Capital participated in this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pre-seed round, a new record for its stage in Africa and the Middle East, surpassing Egyptian fintech Telda at $5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmadyousry">Ahmad Yousry</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/walidshabana">Walid Shabana</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismail-hafez">Ismail Hafez</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarek-elgeresy-256a9987">Tarek El Geresy</a> founded Rabbit in June. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Yousry, in an interview with TechCrunch, said the founders began discussing the idea of replicating fast delivery models in Egypt after noticing that he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced a sequence of slow and failed deliveries whenever he ordered groceries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You make an order, but you’re not quite sure if it’s gonna come or it’s going to be out of stock,” he said. “You’re not quite sure if it’s going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be delivered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 100% or it’s going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be delivered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on time or delayed. You’re not quite sure what you are going to get.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a surface level, groceries are items people forget to buy and panic when they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">suddenly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need them, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is why most on-demand platforms in Europe, such as Getir and Gorillas, launched first in that vertical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But over time, they found out that on-demand retail &#8212; offering other items that an impulse buyer would need in, say, a supermarket &#8212; was a bigger market and opportunity.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the case with Yousry and his co-founders; they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studied use cases where people bought stuff from e-commerce platforms but would wait days to get it and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled on basic fashion items, cosmetics, toys and household items.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whatever the consumer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wants under 20 minutes, we’re going to let the market dictate what we sell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’re not limiting ourselves as a grocery player,” he said, differentiating the company from other grocery delivery platforms such as GoodsMart and Appetito in Egypt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit operates similarly to other international on-demand convenience delivery startups before it. It has taken the Amazon model, large warehousing and broken it down into small pieces &#8212; micro-fulfilment centres &#8212; in four neighbourhoods across Cairo: Mohandeseen, Zamalek, Maadi and Nasr City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit buys these five categories of items (groceries, basic fashion items, cosmetics, toys and household items) from third-party suppliers, stores them in its warehouses, adds a markup and sells through an app with a flat delivery fee for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it controls the end-to-end experience on its platform. It has a live inventory tracking system in its warehouses to monitor what’s on the shelf and equip riders &#8212; some employed, some self-employed &#8212; with the necessary protective gear and technology to make the deliveries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-month-old startup plans to add a new fulfilment centre every other week till the end of the year to cover several major cities in the next 12 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit has been in stealth since June and only launched last month. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its first two days, about 30% of the orders delivered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in less than 20 minutes; last week, the number increased to 90%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way we look at it is straightforward. If McDonald’s can deliver sandwiches in 30 minutes, and they still have to make the sandwich, then if we get things right, we can easily deliver in 20 minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many publications covering the frenzy happening within the on-demand convenience delivery space have probed the question of whether these companies can fulfil their delivery times without breaking their riders. It’s a situation Gorillas has faced this year; in a bid to execute deliveries in less than 10 minutes, it has attracted protests from some drivers demanding improved working conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yousry says Rabbit’s tech and operations are such that an in-house team takes care of receiving an order and packaging in 120 seconds or less</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, the rest, about 18 minutes, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for drivers to complete the order. This way, Yousry hopes the company will not have to be at loggerheads with its drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s exactly the reason why we went with 20 minutes and not 10. We could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do 10 minutes, but if we do, we’re stretching our delivery riders </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it wouldn’t account for their health and safety,” said Yousry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us, there are two minutes under the roof, and there’s the rest on delivery time; it gives the couriers time to drive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">safely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They don’t need to rush, and they abide by traffic regulations and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">take things slower.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, only a few people have used the service, and while Yousry does not give hard numbers on traction, he said the company now completes more than 50 orders per location daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He expects Rabbit to process hundreds of thousands of orders per month soon. But with a little more than 50 riders, how does it plan to achieve that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? The CEO said the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is currently recruiting over 100 roles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across driver, in-store and human resources departments to meet the high influx of demand it expects after going live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment, Lorenzo Franzi, a partner at Global Founders Capital, said, “The Rabbit team is setting a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">totally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new standard for the grocery industry in Egypt and the broader region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They offer a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new experience to customers compared to traditional grocers and local stores</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Talal Alasmari of Raed Ventures said his firm backed the six-month-old startup because the founders have the vision and expertise to lead the “ultra-fast delivery domain” in Egypt, the Middle East and Africa.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mathpresso, the Seoul-based edtech company behind QANDA, an AI-based learning app for K-12 students, announced today it has added Google as a new investor.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s undisclosed investment is not part of its Series C raised in June, the company said without providing its valuation.</p>
<p>The additional investment event comes five months after its $50 million Series C, which brought its total funding to $105 million as of June. The company&#8217;s previous backers include SoftBank Venture Asia, MiraeAsset Venture Investment, Smilegate Investment, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation and Legend Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mathpresso expects to create synergies with Google in terms of its global market expansion and technological advancement.</p>
<p>More than 85% of QANDA’s users are outside of Korea, in Japan and Southeast Asia. The Seoul-headquartered startup has offices in Tokyo, Hanoi, Jakarta and Bangkok and offers seven languages: English, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Indonesian.</p>
<p>Mathpresso was founded in 2015 by co-CEO Ray Lee and Jake Lee, who developed QANDA as a 1:1 Q&amp;A service platform. In 2016, Mathpresso launched QANDA, which provides detailed math solutions and personalized learning content catered to each user’s level. QANDA’s AI-based optical character recognition (OCR) technology, added in 2017, recognizes text and mathematical formulas in a photo and enables users to search for answers in seconds.</p>
<p>Approximately 10 million photos are uploaded every day on QANDA platform, the statement said. The company claims that the QANDA app has amassed over 45 million registered users and 3 billion education data points, with over 12 million monthly active users in 50 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mathpresso added new features on QANDA earlier this year, including the premium subscription model that offers unlimited “byte-sized” micro-video lectures and the community feature that enhances collaborative learning like an online study group.</p>
<p>“The investment by Google opens up exciting opportunities for Mathpresso and enhances our ability to serve students around the world,” said Chief Financial Officer of Mathpresseo Soo Nahm. “Together with the recent Series C funding, this investment will help us accelerate our global market expansion as well as our technological advancement.”</p>
<p>QANDA is available on Android, iOS and Web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nio, a Chinese electric vehicle startup listed on the NYSE, will be in at least six European markets by 2022.</p>
<p>The firm shared its ambitions for Europe on its earnings call this week. Nio is already taking orders for its electric SUVs and shipping small batches<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/chinese-ev-maker-nio-is-stepping-outside-of-china-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in Norway</a>, its first stop outside China. It didn&#8217;t identify which five countries it will enter next year.</p>
<p>The young carmaker challenges behemoths like Tesla and covets a slice of the luxury car market. I wasn&#8217;t convinced that the seven-year-old startup could lure customers away from Mercedez Benz or BMW. But recently, a friend, who used to be religious about German cars, paid about $70,000 for a Nio sports sedan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228968" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What hooks him isn&#8217;t the car&#8217;s sleek design or its marketed 600-kilometer range. It&#8217;s the experience <em>around</em> owning a Nio.</p>
<p>When his wife goes shopping, my friend passes time with his daughter in one of Nio&#8217;s owner clubs, which sit in posh malls across China&#8217;s affluent cities. He shows me a Nio app, which has data on his car&#8217;s status and lets him speak to a human assistant in real-time. The app also has a news feature, an e-commerce store and a user forum. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I bought a lot of stuff off its store,&#8221; he says while scrolling through other owners&#8217; posts. What Nio has created is an all-in-one &#8220;super app&#8221; that Chinese users have gotten used to, thanks to Tencent and Alibaba.</p>
<p>Now Nio is exporting that user experience to Europe, home to some of the world&#8217;s most revered automakers.</p>
<p>To be sure, Norway is a small market with a population of five million people. Nio still has a long way to go before proving its potential in larger markets like Germany and the United Kingdom. Its success, then, hinges on whether it could delegate real power to its country managers. It&#8217;s up to founder William Li to decide how much control to give to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-schwarz-66354a46/?originalSubdomain=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Schwarz</a>, Nio&#8217;s first Europe CEO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orders in Norway had &#8220;exceeded expectation&#8221; and &#8220;a quarter&#8221; of the customers who tried its cars ended up placing an order, Nio said on this week&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>The company proposes a &#8220;battery-as-a-service&#8221; model that allows people to buy its car without a battery and pay for a BaaS subscription later. But the vision requires the setup of a charging network throughout a new country, which is no small feat in the age of COVID.</p>
<p>At least early customer feedback in Norway appears positive. &#8220;It seems that everyone is quite excited about the battery swapping stations and the battery as a service business model,&#8221; the firm revealed in its <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/13/nio-inc-nio-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q2 earnings</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/13/nio-inc-nio-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of June</a>, Nio had over 40 staff in Norway. In Oslo, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCDzQTNGStE&amp;ab_channel=NIO%E8%94%9A%E6%9D%A5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muji-esque customer club</a> recently opened. It already operates a design center in Munich, an engineering force in the U.K. and an autonomous driving team in San Jose.</p>

<p>Xpeng, Nio&#8217;s archrival in China, has yet to expand out of China but has plans to do so, according to a recent <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/26/xpeng-inc-xpev-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">analyst call</a>. Starting 2023, Xpeng will launch &#8220;at least two or three new vehicles every year&#8221; supporting its flagship driver assistance system. It also &#8220;intends to make these future new models, including hardware, software and services simultaneously available in China and in international markets,&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an exciting and challenging time for China&#8217;s new EV makers, which are supercharged with investor money and advanced technology. But as Chinese companies, they are coping with an increasingly hostile global environment. And as they let algorithms play a bigger role in steering vehicles, they will face a barrage of questions about how they protect user safety and data privacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge has ruled that Apple can&#8217;t push back the deadline to update App Store policies, as previously ordered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">in the court&#8217;s decision</a> on California&#8217;s Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit. Though Apple largely won that lawsuit when the judge declared that Apple was not acting as a monopolist as Epic Games had alleged, the court sided with the Fortnite maker on the matter of Apple&#8217;s anti-steering policies regarding restrictions on in-app purchases. The court&#8217;s original ruling stated that Apple would no longer be allowed to prohibit developers from pointing to other means of payment besides Apple&#8217;s own payment systems, but Apple wanted that decision put on hold until its appeals case was decided &#8212; a delay that would have effectively pushed back the App Store changes by a matter of years.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">September 10, 2021 ruling</a> issued by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on the Epic Games antitrust case had ordered Apple to no longer stop developers from:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> &#8220;&#8230;including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231630" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The court also said Apple couldn&#8217;t prevent developers from communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through their account registration within the app.</p>
<p>Apple in October <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-developers-to-contact-customers-about-other-payment-methods/">officially updated its App Store rules</a> to address developers&#8217; ability to communicate with their users, as that change was also a part of its settlement with a group of U.S. developers in a class-action lawsuit over the same matter. However, upon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">its appeal of the Epic Games lawsuit</a>, Apple asked for a stay on the injunction Judge Gonzalez Rogers had put into place which would open up the App Store to non-Apple payment systems.</p>
<p>Per the ruling, the required App Store policy changes had an early December deadline, as the judge ordered the injunction to be implemented within 90 days of the September 10 ruling. That meant, if Apple wasn&#8217;t granted this stay on the injunction, it would have to permit developers to point to alternative means of payment inside their iOS apps.</p>
<p>During a November 9 hearing to hear arguments both for and against the stay, Apple&#8217;s legal counsel argued that the changes Apple was being forced to implement would &#8220;upset the platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They will harm consumers. They will harm developers. That is the fact. It is going to happen,&#8221; said Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher partner Mark Perry, a lead lawyer for Apple on the Epic Games case. He reiterated Apple&#8217;s position that allowing links inside apps could introduce security and privacy risks into the iOS ecosystem.</p>
<p>Epic Games&#8217; counsel, Gary Bornstein, pointed out that Apple said during the trial that its first-party payments platform competed with web payments. It can&#8217;t turn around and now say that raising consumer awareness about this competitive alternative would now cause &#8220;irreparable harm.&#8221; He added, too, that Apple shouldn&#8217;t be left to sort out the changes on its own as, so far, many of the steps Apple has taken to open up the App Store were in response to either class action lawsuits or legislative and regulatory developments. Apple disagreed, pointing to other pro-consumer changes it has made, like the App Store privacy labels.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the judge ruled today that Apple failed to successfully argue its case for a stay and denied the motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, Apple’s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court’s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction, namely incipient antitrust conduct including supercompetitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins and which have not been correlated to the value of its intellectual property,&#8221; wrote Judge Gonzalez Rogers. &#8220;This incipient antitrust conduct is the result, in part, of the anti-steering policies which Apple has enforced to harm competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Apple said it intends to try again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Epic Games didn&#8217;t have any immediate comment.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s decision, if upheld, could have a significant impact on the App Store&#8217;s business model, as developers looking to skirt Apple&#8217;s commissions would be able to point their users to other payment methods when the policy is updated. The fallout from the decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business">could cost</a> the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-stands-to-lose-a-few-billion-dollars-annually-from-ruling?sref=gni836kR">billions</a>, depending on how many developers take up the opportunity and how many consumers decide to pay outside the App Store.</p>
<p>Already, some in the market were moving forward to capitalize on that potential change before the policy had been officially revised.</p>
<p>For example, Paddle, a solutions provider for subscription businesses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/in-hopes-of-app-store-changes-paddle-develops-an-alternative-to-apples-payments-system/">announced</a> rather prematurely it would introduce a new in-app purchasing system aimed at iOS developers that would allow a drop-in replacement to Apple’s own payments system as soon as the injunction went into effect. (A full replacement for Apple’s in-app purchase system  wouldn’t be permitted, however, only external links.) Facebook, meanwhile, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">rolled out a system for direct creator payments</a> bypassing the App Store. This system was technically permitted because Facebook isn&#8217;t taking a cut of creator revenues for the time being. But with a decision that permits other payment mechanisms, that system could change in the future opening up a new revenue stream for the social network.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how exactly Apple will rewrite its rules to comply with the court&#8217;s decision if it&#8217;s not able to convince the court to grant its motion. When South Korea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">issued a new law</a> also requiring app stores to allow for other payment mechanisms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">Google complied</a> while adjusting <a href=“ https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments”>fees</a>, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/">Apple said</a> its current policies were in compliance due to how the law was written.</p>
<p>The court reminded Apple it had 90 days to comply with the injunction per the original ruling and still has approximately 30 days before it goes into effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric automaker Rivian <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has priced its initial public offering at $78 a share, pushing it far above its targeted share price as investors dove in the year&#8217;s most highly anticipated IPO.</span></p>
<p>Updated: the story haas been updated to reflect the regulatory filing figures.</p>
<p>The company offered 153 million shares of common stock at the $78 per share price, according to regulatory filing was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521324915/d439957ds1mef.htm">posted late Friday evening</a>. Rivian also gave underwriters an option to buy another 22.95 million shares, a higher number than previously expected.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231786" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The gross proceeds from the offering is expected to be about $11.9 billion, before accounting for commissions, discounts and other expenses. That amount also excludes the underwriters option to buy additional shares. If underwriters exercise those options, Rivian stands to raise a total of $13.8 billion.</p>
<p>On a fully dilated basis, that places Rivian&#8217;s valuation at more than $77 billion.</p>
<p>The company, which is backed by Amazon, said in a filing earlier this month that it planned to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also had an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares. It then upped the range to between $72 and $74 due to investor interest in company.</p>
<p>Rivian filed October 1 to become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/">publicly traded company</a> in the United States. The S-1 document did not disclose the targeted share price at the time. An amended document filed Monday provided the new information, which included interest from repeat backer Amazon and newcomer Blackstone in Rivian.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Coatue Management, Franklin Templeton, Capital Research Global Investors, D1 Capital Partners LP, Third Point LLC, funds affiliated with Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Dragoneer Investment Group LLC and certain entities affiliated with Soros Fund Management LLC have indicated an interest in buying up to $5 billion of shares of Class A common stock.</p>
<p>A recent filing by Amazon shows the e-commerce giant already holds more than a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">20% stake in Rivian</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beating the street and its own guidance, Zynga reported record third-quarter revenue of $705 million, up 40% from the same period last year and reaching its largest mobile audience ever of 183 million monthly active users, up 120% year over year.</p>
<p>Despite warning in the second quarter of a material impact from Apple’s privacy policy changes that caused a dramatic 30% sell off in its stock from August 5 through November 4, Zynga’s share price jumped today on news that it had better than expected user-acquisition performance and is back on track to finish the year strong.</p>

<p>TechCrunch spoke with Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau on how the mobile game giant has been able to navigate the advertising crisis while making moves to expand cross-platform and onto the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Weathering the storm<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>On <a href="https://qz.com/1997873/apples-idfa-privacy-update-threatens-to-upend-the-ad-industry/">April 26</a>, when Apple changed its IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers) and required developers to use its ATT (App Tracking Transparency) tool to allow users to opt out of being tracked across iOS apps, it shook the mobile ad ecosystem. New users gained during the lockdown dropped off in droves as pandemic restrictions lifted but as targeting became more difficult, acquisition costs soared. Companies began to report a <a href="https://www.consumeracquisition.com/idfa-impact-q2-earnings-reports">15%-20% hit to revenue</a> according to marketing firm Consumer Acquisition. Among those most affected were ad platforms like <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snap-snapchat-q3-2021-stock-drop-1235094751/">Snapchat</a>, advertisers like <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1456369493890850818?s=20">Peloton</a> and Zynga, which is both an ad platform and advertiser.</p>
<p>“The midpoint of this year was tough,” Gibeau told TechCrunch. “We were one of the first ones out of the chute with the combination of IDFA and the great reopening demand issues. To navigate, we pulled back on our ad spend and began to experiment with new tools and techniques, and by September, we started to see yields come back to normal.”</p>
<p>Gibeau said they waited to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/zynga-farmville-3-launches/">FarmVille 3</a> until growth rates returned, and he was excited to see the game shoot to the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the top free iPad and iPhone app store, respectively, after its November 4 launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I’m happy to report that we feel the worst is behind us and we are scaling up our spending for new games as we head into the fourth quarter. The key to navigating this period has been how we use our first-party data with the Chartboost platform,” he said, referencing the ad network Zynga acquired earlier this year.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of data about what happens when players come into our games, the events they play and what advertisers are doing in our existing supply. First-party data allows us to build models that make predictions about the types of returns or auctions that would be beneficial to us,” he said.</p>
<p>Zynga is also partnering with Unity, Google and Iron Source, among others, to find ways to better target players.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of smart people attacking this problem. It’s more a function of time than there’s not going to be a solution,” he said. “Over the long term, Apple is building a capable platform to support a healthy advertising market while protecting player privacy, and we’re happy to work with them on this,” he said.</p>
<h2>Rocking hypercasual</h2>
<p>Although 80% of Zynga’s business is subscriptions and microtransactions from in-app purchases, a fifth of the company’s revenue is from advertising, a fast-growing segment being driven by the popularity of hypercasual games, which are games with simple interfaces that can typically be played in fewer than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Zynga nearly doubled its advertising revenue over the prior-year period, said Gibeau, attributing its success to Rollic, an Istanbul-based game studio that Zynga <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">acquired a year ago</a> that helped it become a top-three publisher in the category.</p>
<p>“If you look at the number of installs on the app stores, hypercausal is the largest category. These are very inexpensive games that reach massive audiences and utilize advertising as its primary means of monetization. It’s a very lucrative place for us to be and a great feeder of users into our network that ties into our ambitions to create an at-scale publishing and advertising platform that will be a growth driver for us into 2022 and beyond,” said Gibeau.</p>
<h2>All roads lead to the metaverse</h2>
<p>Zynga’s next big game release is <a href="https://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-hunters">Star Wars: Hunters</a>, which is soft launching on Android in select markets next week and testing on iOS and Switch in the New Year, Gibeau said. It’s the company’s first cross-platform game on console and FarmVille 3 was its first cross-platform launch on macOS.</p>
<p>Gibeau explained his interest in making Zynga’s mobile games playable on other platforms.</p>
<p>“FarmVille fans and Star Wars fans are everywhere, so it really behooves us to be platform agnostic and make our experience available as many places as possible,” he said. “At the end of the day, we’re a social game company that believes it’s more fun to play games together than by yourself. So as part of our culture, we like to innovate and try new things.”</p>
<p>Since 2020, Zynga has had games on <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/snap-hits-100-million-players-teams-with-zynga-and-launches-more-chat-games/">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/zynga-to-put-words-with-friends-style-game-on-google-nest-devices-in-bid-to-lure-nongamers">Google Nest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/amazon-and-zynga-partner-on-word-pop-a-words-with-friends-spinoff-created-for-alexa/">Amazon Alexa,</a> and just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/tiktok-ventures-into-mobile-gaming-initially-in-partnership-with-zynga/">released its first game on TikTok called Disco Loco 3D</a>, which is a free-to-play music and dance challenge.</p>

<p>“In gaming you can get caught out if you miss the next platform. If you get that wrong, it can be pretty painful. So we thought it would be cool to develop experiences on these social platforms to see if there’s any interest. With Snapchat, we partnered with them to help them figure out how to make gaming more a part of their ecosystem, and we’re seeing some good results — but it’s early days,” said Gibeau emphasizing that these games are intended to be proof of concept more than revenue generators.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile">Netflix Gaming</a> having launched on November 2 with former Zynga chief creative officer Mike Verdu at the helm, Gibeau said, “For Netflix, there’s a lot to learn in terms of how they want to approach the subscriptions end of the business and how their users interact with the games, so I don’t know if they’re ready yet for third-party content, but it would be great to talk with them at some point in the future.”</p>
<p>He added, “Whether it’s Netflix or Roblox or Epic or Valve, if they have a platform and it makes sense for our content to be there and reach an audience, we’ll definitely investigate it.”</p>
<p>But perhaps Zynga’s biggest venture ahead lies with the hire of former EA executive Matt Wolf to head up its new blockchain gaming division. As the NFT craze sweeps the gaming industry, blockchain startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">Mythical Games</a>, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/20/forte-raises-185m-at-1b-valuation-for-blockchain-game-platform/">Animoca and Forte</a> have reached billion-dollar valuations in the past few months to help developers create permanent collectible items that can be used across games.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of capital and talent heading into the space,” said Gibeau, explaining the timing of the decision. “Our founder and chair, Mark Pincus, and longtime board member, Bing Gordon, are very hot on the sector and we believe that blockchain is going to be part of the fabric of gaming long term.”</p>
<p>Gibeau said Wolf is setting up a skunkworks project to identify the best path forward and will be looking at things like how owning a farm in the FarmVille franchise could drive greater engagement and retention.</p>
<p>“We plan to move at Zynga speed so you should start to see some things from us in the coming months,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://mevo.com/pages/mevo-camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mevo Start 3-pack with the Mevo Multicam App</a> three-camera kit costs $999. Add some good lights and a half-decent microphone, and you have a full multi-cam streaming setup for less than $2,000. That would have been completely unthinkable just a few years ago, and let&#8217;s just take a minute to consider how absolutely astonishing how far we have come. Add a rock-solid internet connection, and you have essentially replicated the core functionality of a satellite van full of equipment costing two orders of magnitude more than this kit.</p>
<p>Could a professional broadcast news crew use a Mevo Start kit? No &#8212; you would need higher reliability, better redundancy and equipment facing the needs of a live news reporter. But if you come at the same problem from another angle, things start to make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>What if you are a YouTube streamer who wants to up your game? Perhaps you have been using a collection of web cameras and <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBS</a> to run your livestreaming, and you just want a setup that is easier to disassemble and re-assemble. Maybe you are a music streamer on Twitch. You&#8217;ve done a couple of streams with your band, and you are keen to up your game with multi-camera livestreaming. Or perhaps you want to start livestreaming events that happen in various venues. In that context, Mevo Start 3-pack suddenly seems to seem like an absolute bargain. Best of all, once you get it set up the first time, it is very quick to set up and re-assemble.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s the theory, at least. Taking a step back, the question becomes whether it works this well in practice.</p>
<p>Every now and again, a tech reviewer is facing an impossible task: How do you review a product that wasn&#8217;t made for you, and how do you give meaningful input on whether that product is fit for the audience it was designed for? Mevo Start 3-pack with the Mevo Multicam App from <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/creators/products-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logitech for Creators</a> is precisely one of those products. I&#8217;m not a Twitch, YouTube or Facebook streamer &#8212; but on the other hand, I do have a journalism degree with a focus on broadcast journalism, and I fondly remember being trained as a news anchor and live television reporter. I was on the live link unit (i.e. the satellite van) for BBC News for a hot minute. I used to be a TV producer.</p>
<p>The problem is, when you have extensive experience in professional aspects of an industry, you approach a product with different expectations. When I was at the BBC, if the signal to the satellite dropped for even a fraction of a second in the middle of a live broadcast, you wouldn&#8217;t believe the level of stress in the RxTx (receiving and transmissions) center back at the newsroom. But, put simply, this kit isn&#8217;t designed to replace a small truck&#8217;s worth of equipment meant to broadcast breaking news to millions of people. It&#8217;s meant to make life easier for YouTube streamers.</p>

It is an excellent and elegant way to do multi-camera streaming. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On paper, the product looks like a very, very good idea &#8212; but that isn&#8217;t the same as saying that Mevo Start is perfect &#8212; it was clearly designed by people who haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time in dark clubs setting up camera equipment, and it&#8217;s obvious to me that the product team never had to set up and dismantle the kit 30 times in rapid succession. If they had, they&#8217;d have made some subtly different decisions that can have a disproportionate effect on the final product.</p>
<p>One truly stupid decision, for example, is the power button on the cameras. It is completely flush with the body, and while it is rubberized, it doesn&#8217;t have a divot on the button, or any way to find it by touch. To make matters worse, the button is matte black against a matte black camera body. Try to find that in the dark while trying to set up the cameras between two sets of musicians. To be fair to Mevo, this is often the case with the product design: It is designed in CAD packages and tested out in a brightly lit hardware lab, and only too late does someone think to set it up in the various use cases in which users might use the cameras.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231537" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231537" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231537 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231537" class="wp-caption-text">The back of the camera includes a USB-C port for power, a MicroSD card slot for local recording, a microphone input and an almost-impossible-to-find-in-the-dark power button. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Sorry to harp on about one design feature, but given it is literally the only button on the camera, it seems important. One thing I love about the power button is that it is pretty hard to press in &#8212; you have to use quite a bit of force to actuate it. That is great: It is hard to press the button by accident, and accidents are the last thing you want during a livestream. What is less great is that when you are setting something up for a livestream in a hurry, you&#8217;re going to have your hands full &#8212; I found myself needing to turn the cameras on and off with one hand regularly because I had a microphone or another piece of equipment in the other hand. That means that when you are pressing the power button on the camera, the only way to get real leverage is to hold the camera in place on the opposite side of the camera, at the same height as the power button. Unfortunately, that means that the only natural way to press the power button is to also grab the lens for leverage. I probably don&#8217;t have to spell this out, but I will anyway &#8212; the lens is literally the only part of the camera that would benefit from not having greasy fingerprints on it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231539" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231539" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231539 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231539" class="wp-caption-text">The only way to turn the camera on and off with one hand is to hold the camera like this. My fingers are pressing the button &#8212; but look at where my thumb goes. The very next thing you need to do is clear the thumbprints off your lens. Why?! <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Camera button aside, the cameras have a bunch of super-smart design features as well. There&#8217;s a small light hood to shield the dome-shaped lens from stray light, which hugely helps reducing light flares. The tripod thread can be taken out of the bottom of the camera, turning it into a much larger thread so you can fit it on a microphone or light stand. The light LED on the front of the camera uses a green LED to show which of the cameras are ready to go live &#8212; and a red one that shows which camera actually <em>is</em> live. The cameras have built-in batteries that drastically simplify the setup; you don&#8217;t need a power source to start streaming &#8212; great for on-the-go live broadcasts. All of these things are very well-thought-through features.</p>
<p>Getting the camera set up was profoundly frustrating. Straight out of the box, all three cameras needed firmware upgrades. It&#8217;s possible that this is an effect of me using an Android phone, and that the iOS version of the app is more mature, but the process ended up taking several hours of indecipherable error messages. I was finally able to get things to work, but that involved me having to restart my phone six times &#8212; once to get it to connect to each camera in the first place, then once to recover from a failed firmware upgrade.</p>
<p>I reached out to Mevo&#8217;s press team when I ran into these firmware issues. They offered to put me in touch with the development team to get me up and running. I thought about it, but decided to decline their offer. As a hardware reviewer, I get the benefit of being able to get on the phone with someone who helped build the product, but as a consumer, it&#8217;s often a very different experience.</p>
<p>If I had bought these cameras for my own use, at this point I would have returned them to Mevo: In my many years as a hardware reviewer, I have never tested out a product where I needed to restart my phone six times before I was even able to start the review process. I gave up for a few days, and when I finally was ready to put the cameras through their paces in earnest, there was another set of firmware upgrades. This time, I got through the process pretty smoothly, but having to update the camera firmware twice in a few weeks isn&#8217;t exactly encouraging.</p>
<p>The core problem is one of trust. There are a lot of products where it doesn&#8217;t matter if you have to try something twice or even three times. If you try to change the temperature on your Nest thermostat, and it doesn&#8217;t take the first time, that&#8217;s kind of okay. You try again, it works. You shrug it off. Livestreaming is not like turning on the air conditioner &#8212; when you have a couple of thousand people watching a live gig, stress levels are running high, and even the smallest technical issues can cause tremendous amounts of stress. My context for this is a live satellite link with potentially millions of viewers and a live television news broadcast getting ruined by the newsroom not getting a live report from the field. Perhaps other livestreamers are more Zen about technical issues than I am.</p>

Without the insert, it fits on a microphone stand. The insert is double threaded: one side is the size of a light stand and the other side has a tripod-size thread. Very clever indeed. Also worth noting that the cameras get fingerprint marks on them very easily &#8212; not great for product photography, but not an issue when you are using the cameras. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Once I was able to get the product set up fully, it had a chance to shine. The Mevo apps powering the cameras are outstanding. The multi-camera app lets you prepare a shot from one camera and fade between cameras. You can zoom in, use overlays and even configure digital panning movements. For what is, at its core, a pretty simple setup, you can create extraordinarily powerful results.</p>
<p>Despite my frustrated rage with the setup process, the Mevo cameras deserve a break: I tested the cameras in a number of different contexts, and they never let me down once. No hiccups, no buffering, no delays, no disconnections.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231535" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231535" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231535 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231535" class="wp-caption-text">Multi-camera streaming is perfect for creative pursuits, live music and live-action events. Mevo represents incredible value in a small package. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The problem was that I was never fully able to trust the cameras, and as a result, I would probably never use them for a livestream I care about. Would I set up a three-camera setup and do a livestream of my foster kittens playing? Absolutely, and that would be both worth watching and beyond adorable. Would I use it to livestream a friend playing a concert at a local bar to his dozens of livestreaming fans? Probably not &#8212; my stress level would be too high, and I would need to do many hours of streaming without any problems before I would even start to trust the cameras enough to rely on them for anything important.</p>
<p>And herein lies the conundrum. Livestreaming is so high-stakes and stressful that it&#8217;s crucial that you feel that you can trust your equipment. Part of building that trust is the first-use experience with a product, and Mevo&#8217;s cameras were some of the worst devices I have ever reviewed in that respect. But the flip side is also true: The life of a reviewer is that you see devices with their first versions of the firmware, and with software that was maybe not <em>quite</em> ready for prime time yet. I am willing to accept that Mevo might be able to sort out the problems I found in my review and that three or six months from now, the cameras will be great.</p>
<p>O<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">n paper and in theory, at least, they could be a cost-effective and near-perfect solution for livestreamers who want to dip their toes in the multi-cam world. I would have to revisit the product in a few months to know whether or not to recommend it. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Workhorse Group is hemorrhaging money. During the company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings call, Workhorse reported an <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_2602c9bad137b59411e9819ecc4d09aa/workhorse/news/2021-11-09_Workhorse_Group_Reports_Third_Quarter_2021_185.pdf">$81 million loss</a>, blaming an increase in operating costs and a suspension of production due to recalls. Revenue is also in the negative to the tune of $576,600, which is largely related to refunds issued to customers who had their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/workhorse-group-suspends-deliveries-recalls-c-1000-electric-delivery-van/">C-1000 cargo delivery vans recalled</a> due to safety issues.</p>
<p>Workhorse sold 41 vans this year before it had finished ensuring the design was in compliance with federal safety standards set by the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). The company was forced to suspend sales in order to complete testing, recall all of the vehicles and slow production to two trucks per week.</p>
<p>Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch admitted on Tuesday that, aside from federal safety issues, the C-1000 just might not be up to the task of heavy duty deliveries. The company is performing additional testing of the current truck design, which Dauch said is presently &#8220;not robust nor is it profitable.&#8221; What&#8217;s more likely to happen is that Workhorse will scrap it and reconfigure the van&#8217;s design altogether, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps">something the company said it might do back in August</a>. Workhorse said it expects to provide a production forecast early next year, even going so far as to promise delivery of &#8220;best-in-class vehicles for the commercial electric vehicle market starting in 2023.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231702" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That might be hard to do without raising more money from investors who are likely wary of empty promises. Dauch took the helm of Workhorse in July when the company was chaotically trying to ship its non-compliant vehicles that were built with parts bought via online auctions from Asia. Dauch acknowledged that he inherited a company plagued by poor leadership and a lack of communication, with a cash burn rate that was not only unsustainable, but also downright detrimental. Workhorse&#8217;s supply chain was, and remains, not yet Tier 1 qualified and it lacks a range of systems for production, which in all fairness is common for a startup, says Dauch.</p>
<p>Workhorse is also currently under investigation by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. The SEC probe is related to trading in the company&#8217;s securities before the award of a United States Postal Service contract to build the agency&#8217;s next-generation mail truck — Workhorse ended up not winning that bid, which caused its shares to plummet. The Justice Department&#8217;s investigation is &#8220;related&#8221; to the SEC probe, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/business/energy-environment/workhorse-electric-vehicle-earnings.html">according to the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p id="sDpV9v">Despite powerful headwinds, Dauch thinks Workhorse is still poised for success in large part due to macroeconomic trends and regulatory factors that are driving future growth. The pandemic only solidified the importance in e-commerce that the entire world is experiencing. With tightening government emissions regulations and the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/infrastructure-bill-explained/index.html">passing of the U.S. infrastructure bill</a>, the need for electric delivery vans will only grow. No one has yet cornered this market, so Workhorse thinks it still has time to get itself together and take a slice of that pie.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have near-term financial flexibility based on our improved balance sheet and reduced monthly cash consumption rate,&#8221; said Dauch during the conference call, also noting Workhorse&#8217;s &#8220;solid purchase orders&#8221; and &#8220;strong customer support.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the third quarter of 2021, Workhorse&#8217;s selling, general and administrative expenses — which include &#8220;higher compensation-related costs due to increased headcount, severance pay, stock-based compensation, legal costs and insurance costs&#8221; — increased to $10.6 million compared to $6 million in the same period last year.</p>
<p>In June, Workhorse filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the USPS for awarding its contract to defense contractor Oshkosh Defense. Workhorse had been fighting for this coveted spot since 2015. The startup dropped the lawsuit in September, probably after it had a look at its balance sheet and realized it couldn&#8217;t afford to take USPS to court. Indeed, during the earnings call, Workhorse CFO Greg Ackerson pointed to dropping the lawsuit as one of the key actions taken to reduce spending.</p>
<p>Workhorse also converted $172.5 million of debt into equity, slowed inbound material, eliminated air freight and reduced consulting by adding in-house expertise, according to Ackerson. That said, the startup&#8217;s R&amp;D expenses increased to $2.8 million compared to $1.6 million in Q3 of 2020, which was related mainly to increased headcount and higher consulting costs. Presumably, Workhorse needs to spend a little more on talent in order to get a functioning, and safe, electric van that&#8217;s ready for production before the company loses its &#8220;loyal&#8221; customer base.</p>
<div class="css-53u6y8">
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Workhorse’s stock was down 3.6% at the close on Tuesday afternoon and trading at $6.64. Shares have fallen more than 80% since February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced today that it will no longer allow advertisers to target users based on potentially &#8220;sensitive&#8221; topics like health, sexual orientation, or religious and political beliefs. &#8220;Lung cancer awareness,&#8221; &#8220;LGBT culture&#8221; and &#8220;Jewish holidays&#8221; are just some of the interest categories that will no longer be targeted starting early next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision to remove these Detailed Targeting options was not easy and we know this change may negatively impact some businesses and organizations,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, saying input from civil rights experts, policymakers and other stakeholders contributed to its decision. Advertising revenue is Facebook&#8217;s leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-reports-revenue-miss-plans-to-break-out-ar-vr-top-lines/">source of income</a>, so any major change to ad policy can have significant ramifications.</p>
<p>Facebook can target users based on information provided in their profile, like their age, location or gender. But the platform never made it possible to target people based on the sexual orientation listed in their profile, a representative from the company told TechCrunch. Rather, the advertising that will be removed refers to ads that are served based on your profile&#8217;s interest categories.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231629" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook assigns these interest categories to your profile based on your activity. Based on how you engage with Facebook content, you might be assigned categories that Facebook would call &#8220;sensitive,&#8221; like &#8220;American Jewish culture,&#8221; &#8220;LGBT rights&#8221; or &#8220;Barack Obama.&#8221; Starting January 19, advertisers will no longer be able to target their ads based on interests like these. Other interest groups like &#8220;rock climbing&#8221; and &#8220;knitting,&#8221; not being sensitive, will still be targetable &#8212; there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/technology/meta-facebook-ad-targeting.html">tens of thousands</a> of these categories, sensitive or not.</p>
<p>Users can see their profile&#8217;s interest groups by navigating on desktop to Settings and Privacy &gt; Settings &gt; Ads &gt; Ad Settings &gt; Categories used to reach you &gt; Interest Categories. If you don&#8217;t want to receive ads based on a certain interest, you can opt out.</p>
<p>This change in ad policy comes as Meta &#8212; the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">newly renamed</a> parent company to the Facebook platform &#8212; faces increased scrutiny after a series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">senate hearings</a> related to documents leaked by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">whistleblower</a> Frances Haugen. As more documents are leaked to the press, Meta has gone on the defensive, claiming that some journalists&#8217; reporting has <a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1450154004730707972">misrepresented</a> its actions.</p>
<p>But Facebook&#8217;s ad policy has been a topic of concern for years. Leading up to the U.S. presidential election in 2020, Facebook placed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/facebook-to-block-new-political-ads-1-week-before-nov-3-adds-more-tools-and-rules-for-fair-elections/">limitations</a> on the kinds of political ads that could be created. In 2018, Facebook conducted a similar removal of over 5,000 targeting options for ads after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) filed a <a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_18_085">complaint</a> against Facebook that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/19/hud-complaint-accuses-facebook-ads-of-violating-fair-housing-act/">accused it of helping</a> landlords and home sellers violate the Fair Housing Act. Before that, in 2016, Facebook disabled &#8220;ethnic affinity&#8221; targeting for housing, employment and credit-related ads after <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ProPublica report</a> suggested that these capabilities could be used for discriminatory advertising. When it comes to housing and employment, it&#8217;s illegal to target ads based on certain demographics. Another <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters">report from ProPublica</a> spurred Facebook to remove ad targeting based on anti-Semitic interest categories.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to better match people’s evolving expectations of how advertisers may reach them on our platform and address feedback from civil rights experts, policymakers and other stakeholders on the importance of preventing advertisers from abusing the targeting options we make available,&#8221; the company wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/removing-certain-ad-targeting-options-and-expanding-our-ad-controls">blog post</a>. &#8220;The decision to remove these Detailed Targeting options was not easy and we know this change may negatively impact some businesses and organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Facebook said it made these decisions based on concerns about how data could be abused by bad actors, there are instances in which this data could be used in a potentially positive way, which worried some stakeholders. For example, if someone was interested in &#8220;Diabetes awareness,&#8221; they could be connected with nonprofits working to treat the condition.</p>
<p>Still, Facebook offers businesses a number of tools to access a specific audience. If users are opted into ad tracking on an iPhone, for example, Facebook advertisers can use that information for ad targeting. Businesses can also leverage <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1090330204367211?id=2469097953376494&amp;helpref=search&amp;sr=1&amp;query=ENGAGEMENT%20CUSTOM%20AUDIENCES">engagement custom audiences</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328&amp;helpref=search&amp;sr=4&amp;query=lookalike%20audiences">lookalike audiences</a> and other techniques for reaching users, as the company outlines in its blog post.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wolt represents DoorDash’s sixth acquisition and its second in 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand delivery giant DoorDash announced Tuesday it was acquiring food delivery company Wolt in an all-stock deal valued at €7 billion, or $8.1 billion.</p>
<p>Talking about the acquisition, Tony Xu, co-founder and CEO of DoorDash said in a statement that the move “will accelerate our product development, bring greater focus to each of our markets and improve the value we provide to consumers, merchants, as well as Dashers and couriers around the world.”</p>
<p>Finland-based Wolt was founded in 2014 by Miki Kuusi, who, upon the deal closing, will run DoorDash International and report to Xu. The company has over 4,000 employees across 23 countries and its technology enables users to easily discover and receive food via its platform by selecting a restaurant, placing the order and hitting send.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231738" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wolt has raised over $850 million to date, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wolt/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to its Crunchbase profile</a>. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/wolt-closes-530m-round-to-continue-expanding-beyond-restaurant-delivery/">most recent funding round was $530 million</a> in January, led by Iconiq Growth, with participation from Tiger Global, DST, KKR, Prosus, EQT Growth and Coatue.</p>
<p>Wolt represents DoorDash’s sixth acquisition <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doordash/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Crunchbase data</a> and its second in 2021, which includes an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/doordash-acquires-salad-making-robotics-startup-chowbotics/">acquisition of Chowbotics</a> earlier this year. The latest transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>DoorDash was one of the benefactors of the global pandemic, <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/DASH-Q2-2021-Letter-to-Shareholders_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managing to set records</a> for orders and the value of those orders as reported in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/airbnb-doordash-report-earnings-as-covid-threatens-to-slow-the-irl-economy-again/">second-quarter earnings</a> for the three-month period ending June 30. However, the company was unprofitable overall with a net loss of $102 million for the quarter.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello friends! Welcome to Daily Crunch for November 9, 2021. Today we have lots of good news and some bad news. The good? Another startup is taking on the incumbent web search provider, and we’re seeing more funds in more places raise bigger investing vehicles. The bad? Well, it depends on whether or not you are a Robinhood user. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/robinhood-data-breach/"><strong>Robinhood’s data breach steals from the user and gives to the hacker:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A social-engineering hack led to Robinhood’s internal tools being accessed by an external party. Per TechCrunch reporting, “more than 5 million customer email addresses and 2 million customer names taken, as well as a much smaller set of more specific customer data.” For a company that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">posted somewhat lackluster earnings</a>, it’s not a great look.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/you-com-lands-20m-series-a-to-reimagine-the-search-engine/"><strong>You.com wants to take on Google:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The list of startups taking on Google search is starting to get somewhat lengthy. <a href="https://brave.com/search/">Brave</a> is at it. So is <a href="https://neeva.com/">Neeva</a>. <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> has <em>been</em> working on the matter. And now You.com has $20 million to help with its search service, which, I found today while testing it, has a somewhat radical interface on display.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/"><strong>Twitter gets the blues:</strong></a><strong> </strong>But it’s pretty happy about it. Why? Because Twitter’s subscriber service, Blue, is now out in more markets. This led to a wave of folks signing up and playing around with the service, at least on my timeline. So far people seem to like it. It’s cheap, and given how much time so many of us spend on Twitter, something of a no-brainer at this stage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/health-tech-startup-color-raises-100m-at-a-4-6b-valuation/"><strong>Health tech startup Color snags $100M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After raising $167 million earlier this year, Color is back to the funding well with yet another nine-figure round. The startup’s “software and infrastructure provide tools for preventative health and infectious disease management by making healthcare programs more accessible,” TechCrunch reports. Given that the company is now valued like a public company, it will be interesting to see how quickly Color files an S-1.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/chicagos-origin-ventures-just-closed-its-biggest-fund-yet-with-130-million-in-commitments/"><strong>Good news for Chicago:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, the Midwest is seeing its startup fundraising totals boom, but not all that capital is flowing from local sources. More of it might in the future with the city’s Origin Ventures securing its biggest fund yet.</li>
<li>TechCrunch’s Brian Heater has some really neat notes on a startup building tiny robots <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/these-tiny-robots-inspired-by-starfish-larva-move-courtesy-of-ultrasound/">here</a>. Which I bring up so that you can read it, <em>and</em> so that you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up</a> for his upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/actuator/">robotics newsletter called Actuator.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/solidus-labs-rakes-in-another-15-million-as-crypto-risk-monitoring-tools-take-off/"><strong>$15M to track crypto shenanigans:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Per TechCrunch, crypto risk monitoring is increasingly big business, leading to Solidus Labs raising eight figures for its work in the market. It can detect manipulation and other sorts of market distortions that folks likely care about, given just how much money is sloshing around the crypto markets these days.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/medium-snatches-up-projector-and-beefs-up-management-team/">Medium buys Projector:</a> </strong>In its current permutation, Medium is a publishing platform with a focus on external contributors. I think. It’s been a few cycles since I was last hype about the company. Regardless, the former publisher — plastisher? — bought a startup called Projector, and TechCrunch has the story.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/talent-hack-raises-17-million-led-by-emergence-to-power-the-fitness-creator-economy/"><strong>Emergence invests in Talent Hack:</strong></a> Focused on fitness creators, Talent Hack has raised a $17 million round for its service that provides “payment processing, website design and publishing, scheduling software, email automation and CRM” to its target niche. Given how big the creator economy is today, seeing targeted services crop up is not a surprise.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/airbase-announces-free-tier-plans-to-return-nearly-all-interchange-revenue-to-its-customers/"><strong>Airbase goes free, challenges rivals:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In the Great Corporate Spend Wars, the free-versus-paid discussion took on a new bent this morning with Airbase announcing a zero-cost tier of its previously paid service, and that it is going to return nearly all of its interchange revenues to users. Damn. Expect rival moves from Ramp and Brex in short order.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/truveta-is-making-progress-towards-building-a-living-medical-portrait-of-america/"><strong>Truveta raises $100M for its health-data platform:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Working with north of a dozen healthcare providers, Truveta is now quite a lot richer than it was and is ready to start letting early adopters use its data service. The company’s tech can provide a daily snapshot of America’s health, including how different vaccines are performing in the market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/identity-verification-startup-socure-raises-450m-at-4-5b-valuation-adding-tiger-global-as-new-investor/"><strong>If something safe is secure, is something that is <em>very</em> safe Socure?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Look, we’re just trying to figure out this startup’s name. Regardless, the company just raised $450 million at a $4.5 billion valuation. The richly valued private company uses AI and ML to confirm online identities. It has now raised through a Series E, which stands for Enough already; go public.</li>
<li>And to close us out, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/sweetgreens-ipo-pricing-guidance-illuminates-valuation-range-for-tech-enabled-companies/">has notes concerning Sweetgreen’s early IPO price range</a>.</li>

<p>Looking to the future, Anna Heim <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/15-sectors-pi-ventures-expects-deep-tech-to-disrupt-in-the-next-5-years/">analyzed pi Ventures’ Deep Tech Shifts 2026 report</a>, which explores 15 deep tech subsectors expected to reach an inflection point in the next five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you invest too early in an innovation, then you will have suboptimal returns,” said founding partner Manish Singhal. “If you invest too late, you may also end up getting suboptimal returns, because it is no longer a cutting-edge thing.</p>
<p>“If investment and the timing of innovation getting to a resonance point come together, then good things happen.”</p>

The Apple CEO did not make any news regarding his company, other than to indicate that it doesn’t appear to have near-term crypto hopes and or dreams. Still, is it possible to be surprised that any person with a wealth roughly the size of the moon or greater owns some crypto assets? No.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A bipartisan group of House lawmakers has introduced legislation that would give people more control over the algorithms that shape their online experience. If passed, the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21100363-buck_030_xml-filter-bubble" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Filter Bubble Transparency Act</a> would require companies like Meta to offer a version of their platforms that runs on an &#8220;input-transparent&#8221; algorithm that doesn&#8217;t pull on user data to generate recommendations.</p>
<p>The bill would not do away with &#8220;opaque&#8221; recommendation algorithms altogether but would make it a requirement to include a toggle that allows people to switch that functionality off. Additionally, platforms that continue to use recommendation algorithms need to have a notification that informs people those recommendations are based on inferences generated by their personal data. The prompt can be a one-time notice, but it would need to be presented in a &#8220;clear, conspicuous manner,&#8221; according to the proposed bill.</p>
<p>The legislation was introduced by Representatives Ken Buck (R-CO), David Cicilline (D-RI), Lori Trahan (D-MA) and Burgess Owens (R-UT). It&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=0CA78D6E-C0A8-4BDB-9AA9-1900238810E5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">companion bill</a> to legislation Senators John Thune of South Dakota and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced this past June. &#8220;Consumers should have the option to engage with internet platforms without being manipulated by secret algorithms driven by user-specific data,&#8221; Buck told <a href="https://www.axios.com/algorithm-bill-house-bipartisan-5293581e-430f-4ea1-8477-bd9adb63519c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Axios</em></a>, the first outlet to report on the legislation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231716" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lawmakers have frequently criticized social media giants for using recommendation algorithms to boost user engagement, but so far, there&#8217;s been little legislative action to curb their use. In the aftermath of the January 6th US Capitol attack, a group of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/democrats-facebook-twitter-youtube-suggestion-algorithms-194136288.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">30 Democratic lawmakers</a> called on Meta (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">then known as Facebook</a>), Twitter and YouTube to make substantive changes to their recommendation engines but ultimately stopped short of threatening regulatory action. Although the Filter Bubble Transparency Act has bipartisan support across the House and Senate, it&#8217;s unclear if it would pass.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Discord is already the de facto home for NFT communities, but the company could be planning to deepen those connections in a big way.</p>
<p>On Monday, Discord founder and CEO Jason Citron tweeted a screenshot depicting Discord integrated with popular crypto wallet service MetaMask and WalletConnect, an open protocol that many mobile crypto wallets are built on. Citron employed the NFT Twitterverse phrase &#8220;probably nothing,&#8221; shorthand for <em>this will be a huge deal</em>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">probably nothing <a href="https://t.co/p4P6MoNGgd">pic.twitter.com/p4P6MoNGgd</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231693" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Jason Citron (@jasoncitron) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1457841222995693570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The wallet support looks purely exploratory for now. Citron didn&#8217;t offer any details on how a hypothetical crypto integration would work or how serious Discord is about exploring crypto integrations and the company also declined to provide specifics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re always exploring and hacking away at things we think will improve Discord for all the communities we serve,&#8221; a Discord spokesperson told TechCrunch, adding that the screenshot was from a recent hackathon.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s interest in adding crypto features into the social chat app might be hypothetical, but if the company was to build in support for Ethereum those plans could go well beyond payments. Discord also recently polled users on their thoughts about NFTs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh No <a href="https://t.co/YEfVt8Xrwe">pic.twitter.com/YEfVt8Xrwe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jason Scott (@textfiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1457751651465449475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Discord became a natural home for thousands of NFT projects this year. Many of those projects keep in touch with followers, send updates and track sales and market movement through dedicated Discord servers. It&#8217;s also the app of choice for coordinating distribution events, where NFTs are &#8220;minted&#8221; and sold or given out to supporters before eventually making their way onto trading platforms like OpenSea, often at huge markups (yes, usually for JPEGs).</p>
<p>While Discord could just have transactions in Ethereum and other digital currencies in mind, it&#8217;s also possible that Citron&#8217;s hint about MetaMask support suggests a more ambitious plan centered on NFTs. A coin like Ethereum can be used for basic payments and transactions, but the cryptocurrency also serves as the technical backbone for most NFTs, which are tracked and traded through smart contracts on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain.</p>
<p>Discord is a savvy company that likely has a good idea of how people are already using NFTs to express their digital identities. Discord is a text and voice chat app where the main expression of user identity is through what avatar you pick — something that NFTs are all about right now. On Twitter and Discord, NFT-savvy users already pick their rarest — and often priciest — NFT to use as their PFP (profile picture). With MetaMask support, Discord could become a place where people display their NFTs in galleries linked to user profiles or choose &#8220;verified&#8221; avatar images, with ownership backed up through the blockchain.</p>
<p>The company is particularly well positioned to leverage its foothold in the burgeoning Web3 space — the next phase of the internet that many people predict will be defined by a wave of decentralization, digital goods and ownership-based virtual identity. But Discord&#8217;s also got a good thing going as it stands now.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Citron&#8217;s tweet combined with the survey the company sent out about &#8220;Discord &amp; Web3&#8221; proved polarizing. A number of accounts rallied Discord users to cancel their premium Nitro subscriptions, which provide feature perks for a monthly fee, citing concerns that Discord might go all-in on NFTs. &#8220;Canceled my nitro sub, fuck @discord, and fuck NFTs,&#8221; one tweet with nearly 10,000 likes stated.</p>
<p>Others flocked to Citron&#8217;s tweet to bemoan Discord&#8217;s nascent crypto plans as scams and spam clogs up their community servers. Citron reassured some Twitter users that Discord created a new team to specifically address the rampant sketchy behavior that plagues many servers, including those centered around swapping and selling NFTs. &#8220;Spam and security are a top priority for us in this space,&#8221; Citron wrote. &#8220;We have recently spun up team working on it specifically. More to come soon.&#8221;</p>
