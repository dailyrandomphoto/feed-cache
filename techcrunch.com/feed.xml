										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of investors including Sequoia Capital India and Steadview Capital are in talks to back Polygon, which operates a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, by way of tokens purchase, three sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>The investors are looking to purchase tokens worth $50 million to $150 million, sources said, requesting anonymity as the talks are private. As is common with these token transactions, investors will be able to buy the coins at a slight discount. (20% discount on the average of price of MATIC in the past one month, from what I have heard.)</p>
<p>Deliberations are ongoing, so the terms may change. Nobody had a comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Polygon, formerly known as Matic, has established itself as one of the most popular layer two solutions. The firm, whose market cap has exceeded $14 billion, processes over 7.5 million transactions a day and allows thousands of decentralized apps to continue to use Ethereum as the settling layer but avoid the increasingly pricey gas fee.</p>
<p>Aave, Sushi Swap, and Curve Finance are among some of the largest bluechip projects that have deployed on Polygon, which has amassed one of the largest developer ecosystems (even when compared to some layer 1 blockchains).</p>
<p>An investment will mark a shift in the investors&#8217; perception of Polygon, which until recent years struggled to receive backing from most prominent venture firms in India. (Most VCs in India, it&#8217;s worth noting, were also not actively tracking the web3 space until a few quarters ago.) Furthermore, Polygon has had to confront at least one episode where some of its early investors requested their money back during a bear cycle, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The firm returned money to some of those investors and survived. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the themes with the Polygon team. Their perseverance is next level,&#8221; said a former employee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Polygon, which received backing from entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban this year, is among dozens of side-chains and roll-up networks that is hopeful that Ethereum will continue its dominance even as a handful of other layer one projects such as Polkadot, and Solana, which is backed by Multicoin Capital and A16z, are attempting to court the nascent but fast-growing developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>On Bankless podcast earlier this year, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal said the web3 developer ecosystem today is centred around Ethereum and he is hopeful that the network effect won&#8217;t dissipate. On the same podcast, Nailwal and Mihailo Bjelic, another co-founder of Polygon, said Polygon is increasingly expanding its offerings to build a blockchain infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alibaba is reassigning roles to four of its executives in one of the biggest reshuffles in its recent history, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211205005036/en/Alibaba-Group-Announces-CFO-Succession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Maggie Wu, the e-commerce titan&#8217;s former chief financial officer, will step down next April and be replaced by Toby Xu, current deputy CFO. Wu will continue to be a partner in Alibaba Partnership, an exclusive group of personnel with major influence on the company&#8217;s directions, and will remain as an executive director on the Alibaba board.</p>
<p>Wu was instrumental in Alibaba&#8217;s three public listings since she joined about 15 years ago: Alibaba.com (the firm&#8217;s B2B marketplace) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2007, Alibaba Group Holding on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 and on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2019. Alibaba is one of the U.S.-listed Chinese firms that have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/27/alibaba-second-listing-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pursued secondary listings</a> in Hong Kong amid rising U.S.-China tensions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in 1999, Alibaba already went through a major reshuffle when Jack Ma passed the torch as CEO to Daniel Zhang<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/13/aliglobal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2015</a> and further appointed him as chairman<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/09/alibaba-announces-ceo-daniel-zhang-will-succeed-jack-ma-as-chairman-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The announcement of Alibaba’s CFO transition today is the culmination of extensive preparation over many years and a part of Alibaba’s leadership succession planning,&#8221; said Wu in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The markets will always have ups and downs, but Alibaba has ambitious long-term goals. We are in a relay race and we must have new generations of talent to take the company forward. I trust Toby even more than I trusted myself when I first took up the CFO position years ago,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Xu joined Alibaba from PwC three years ago and first appeared as deputy CFO at the firm&#8217;s investor day last year. He has overseen several major deals at Alibaba, including the <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/article?news=p200721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-commerce titan&#8217;s partnership</a> with Starbucks in China.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside the CFO succession, Alibaba also unveiled major reorganization to buttress its two-pronged strategy of domestic and international e-commerce, Daniel Zhang said in an <a href="https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-introduces-more-agile-organizational-structure-to-accelerate-domestic-and-international-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal letter</a>.</p>
<p>Jiang Fan, who steered the firm&#8217;s core revenue drivers, its consumer-facing marketplaces in China, for years, will lead the newly-formed International Digital Commerce. The international unit includes Southeast Asia-focused Lazada, in which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/18/alibaba-doubles-down-on-lazada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Alibaba acquired control in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to focus on becoming a truly globalized company, and we believe that overseas markets present many exciting potential and opportunities for us to capture,&#8221; wrote Zhang in his letter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm&#8217;s domestic consumer-oriented and wholesale marketplaces will be merged to form the new China Digital Commerce unit and come under the stewardship of Trudy Dai. Dai has been spearheading two of Alibaba&#8217;s new growth drivers, Taobao Deals, its bazaar targeting lower-income demographics in China, and Taocaicai, its neighborhood grocery service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.pariti.io/">Pariti</a>, the Kenya-based community-led marketplace building the digital infrastructure for startup ecosystems in emerging markets, has raised $2.85 million seed, the company confirmed to TechCrunch today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S.-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">Harlem Capital</a>. In Africa, it’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first deal of the diversity-focused fund that secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">$134 million for its second fund</a> earlier this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other investors &#8212; Better Ventures, Accelerated Ventures, Diverse Angels, AVG Basecamp and New General Market Partners participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re thrilled to be working with Harlem Capital,” co-founder and CEO Yacob Berhane said of Harlem’s participation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Their focus on data, process and supporting underserved ecosystems aligns </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfectly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with our mission and makes them an amazing partner for us to build with.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243112" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-pariti-is-connecting-founders-with-capital-resources-and-talent-in-emerging-markets/">covered</a> Pariti in March, the company which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">connects founders in emerging markets to resources, talent and capital, was fresh out of finding product-market-fit.</span></p>
<p>Pariti was founded by<a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/yacob-berhane-38981541"> Yacob Berhane</a> and<a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/wayele"> Wossen Ayele </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019. This past year, CEO Berhane said the company has grown 795% and attributed this growth to the pandemic and how the African tech ecosystem has hit an inflection point, minting half a dozen unicorns within this period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic was a Black Swan event because we saw a major jump in activity on our platform. Remote staffing and remote investing accelerated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tremendously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a bet we made a while back but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anticipate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what was coming,” Berhane said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And after taking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ten years to get Africa’s first unicorn, we had six announced in roughly six months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This led to a significant increase of interest from local and international investors for African startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti has over 880 companies across 42 countries on its platform, up from 500 early this year. But Berhane does not share any other numbers to reflect the progress from the 100 freelance experts and 60 investors TechCrunch reported in March.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Pariti is connecting founders with capital, resources and talent in emerging markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-pariti-is-connecting-founders-with-capital-resources-and-talent-in-emerging-markets/embed/#?secret=4mKVGzkX5w" data-secret="4mKVGzkX5w" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ecosystems.500.co/resources/africa-500s-next-ecosystem-hub">Data from BCG</a> says that Africa appears to be at the dawn of a startup revolution, with the ecosystem “growing at a 46% annual rate, which is six times faster than the global average.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with some founders needing support more than ever after in an inefficient ecosystem with trust issues, platforms like Pariti will become critical for founders and investors to negotiate on neutral terrain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti’s principal product is the Recommendation Engine, where founders submit their companies for review and feedback from experts on the platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the engine suggests personalized next steps for the founders to take in areas where the company needs help</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kenya-based marketplace also helps talent monetize their skills and VCs and angels to find, vet and execute deals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane mentions that Pariti’s pitch assessment and recommendation engine also has some predictability features where the platform can tell how companies will perform with fundraising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we’ve looked at the companies that have been able to go on and raise money after submitting the Pariti pitch review, and companies that score over 70 on a Pariti score have a 50% likelihood of connecting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with investors,” the CEO said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But companies that score above 78 have shown correlation to having 8x likelihood of raising capital, which is pretty dramatic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a few founders who have used the platform and spoke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anonymously to TechCrunch, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti also helped them get into global accelerators such as Y Combinator and Techstars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane confirmed that five companies have gotten into Y Combinator after using Pariti</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the startups is <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/fingo-africa">Kenyan neobank Fingo</a>, a startup highlighted in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-pariti-is-connecting-founders-with-capital-resources-and-talent-in-emerging-markets/">previous article</a> that had secured a $250,000 pre-seed round in March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Pariti builds this community of founders, investors and freelancers that have the right mindset to elevate this ecosystem, nobody has to be a gatekeeper. You’re fostering a certain mentality of ‘we will get further together.’ It’s bigger than any one of us,” Berhane stated, emphasizing the need for Pariti to democratize access to global investors and accelerators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coaching and mentorship services have picked up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the platform, too, appearing in different forms: VC fellows to founder, founder to founder, expert to founder, and investor to founder, the company said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With access to this support and investors, companies have raised over $20 million in debt and equity this past year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti seed funding will allow it to build SaaS workflows to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forms of raising capital, from traditional equity and debt to DeFi solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to enhance its talent marketplace, create a bespoke solution for investors looking to invest and support founders, hire talent, build bigger communities and expand into new markets.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MarketForce, a Kenyan B2B retail and financial services distribution startup, has expanded into five additional markets across Africa to grow <a href="https://marketforce360.com/rejareja-on-demand-salesforce.html">RejaReja</a> &#8212; its retailer ‘super app’ that makes it possible for informal merchants to order and pay for inventory digitally, accept payments for utility bills, and access financing for their businesses.</p>
<p>The startup has today announced entry of RejaReja, the B2B retail marketplace, into Ethiopia, Ghana, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda, after successful pilot programs, coming about two months after it grew beyond Kenya by launching in Nigeria.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/kenyas-marketforce-raises-2m-plans-to-focus-on-its-b2b-retail-marketplace-rejareja/">MarketForce</a> has partnered with Cellulant, a pan-African payments company that makes it possible for local and international merchants to accept “locally relevant and alternative” payment methods from their customers, to expand into these new markets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243165" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are working with Cellulant to open the new markets, and the reason is they already have a presence in these markets and have partnerships with both banks and billers. This will ensure that we focus on acquiring new merchants,” MarketForce’s co-founder and CEO, Tesh Mbaabu told Techrunch.</p>
<p>Cellulant has partnerships with 46 mobile-money operators in Africa, 120 banks and serves 35 African countries with a physical presence in 18, according to the payments firm. RejaReja is set to tap Cellulant&#8217;s coverage to grow across the continent.</p>
<p>“We have been piloting this partnership for six months and are happy to announce the plan to extend the fruitful relationship we have built with MarketForce in Kenya&#8230;This collaboration will make our digital financial services available to millions of Africans, with the goal of significantly boosting financial inclusion and incomes for merchants across Sub-Saharan Africa,” said Cellulant chief business officer, David Waithaka.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243166" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243166" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243166" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg 5176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243166" class="wp-caption-text">Cellulant chief business officer, David Waithaka and MarketForce co-founder and CEO Tesh Mbaabu. <strong>Image credits</strong>: MarketForce.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mbaabu said that they aim to grow their RejaReja merchants tenfold to 1 million by the end of next year. RejaReja has experienced a rapid growth since its launch in December 2020 with over 87,000 orders made through the platform to date at an average basket value of $151. It is expected to record $60 million in annualized transaction volume by the end of this month.</p>
<p>“In November we hit 100,000 merchants in Kenya and Nigeria and this number is growing quite rapidly. Currently, we are growing 40% month on month. This shows how strong our service is,” said Mbaabu.</p>
<p>“The growth is because the merchants are seeing the value, it is a vote of confidence in our platform by the merchants. And a lot of them are using technology for their businesses for the first time,” said Mbaabu, who co-founded MarketForce with Mesongo Sibut in 2018 as an SaaS product for the formal markets. The service’s active users include Unilever, Pepsi, Safaricom and CocaCola. MarketForce recently raised $2 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The startup’s plan for RejaReja is to have a presence in every market across sub-Saharan Africa in the near future by building an all inclusive platform for the informal merchants, who sell a huge chunk of the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa about <a href="https://nextbillion.net/informal-retailers-mobile-solutions-emerging-markets/">80%</a> of household retail is delivered through informal retailers but these shops are faced with a number of challenges like stockouts, earnings instability and financing that make it hard for their businesses to grow.</p>
<p>MarketForce, through RejaReja, is providing solutions to these challenges by ensuring next-day delivery of goods, and using their data to develop the credit profiles needed to secure loans. The startup has partnered with <a href="https://pezesha.com/">Pezesha</a> &#8212; a digital financial marketplace platform &#8212; to extend loans to its merchants.</p>
<p>Mbaabu said, “we see RejaReja being the largest retail distribution network in sub-Saharan Africa.”<br />
“The goal is to empower all these merchants to grow their incomes and profits in a digital age, to access inventory, to act as special agents for various financial services, and to make extra income as a result. We are able to extend working capital loans too.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://stackedinvest.com/">Stacked</a>, a web-based platform that provides passive investment tools for retail investors interested in crypto, just announced it raised a $35 million Series A co-led by <a href="https://www.alameda-research.com/">Alameda Research</a>, a crypto trading firm owned by <a href="https://ftx.com/">FTX</a> founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bybit and BitDAO partner <a href="https://www.mirana.xyz/">Mirana Ventures</a> co-led the round alongside Alameda. <a href="https://fisv.com/">Fidelity International Strategic Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.drwvc.com/">DRW Venture Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.av.vc/">Alumni Ventures</a>, and <a href="https://jumpcap.com/">Jump Capital</a> also participated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chicago-based company, which launched in April 2020, raised a $1 million seed round in September 2020. The latest round brings its total funding to “just shy of $40 million,” co-founder and CEO Joel Birch told TechCrunch in an interview. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243103" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use the funds to double its 40-person employee base in the next six to eight months and invest in user acquisition, growth and marketing. Until this fundraise, Stacked had grown its business with no formal marketing spend, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacked has automated over $10 billion worth of transactions for tens of thousands of new investors in 2021, per the company. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also secured status as a registered investment advisor (RIA) with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) this summer in preparation to widen its product offerings, the company told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the very near future, we&#8217;re going to continue to evolve our platform away from automating strategies and giving people this easy investment platform into actually offering structured products like risk-adjusted portfolios and giving curated investment advice to individuals based on their risk tolerance,” Birch said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the SEC has not yet approved a crypto ETF for trading in the U.S., products like Grayscale’s trusts have become popular with investors seeking price exposure to the asset class. Birch said Stacked’s product differs from those sorts of products in that it is available to all retail investors, regardless of whether they are accredited, and allows users to hold custody of their digital assets. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacked, which acts as a layer on top of a user’s existing crypto brokerage account, offers a range of pre-built portfolios it calls “stacks” based on a risk score it assigns to each user after they take a suitability assessment. It partners with “a handful of the most reputable exchanges in the world,” including Coinbase, FTX, and Binance, per Birch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its core product is currently free to use and allows users to manage portfolios across multiple crypto exchanges, auto-rebalance and compound their portfolios, and lend cryptocurrency through FTX’s exchange, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacked makes money by charging a percentage fee on transactions in its two-sided open marketplace, which sells automated trading strategies, according to Birch. Investors use the exchange to buy strategies designed by well-known traders and influencers in the crypto space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the “next few weeks,” the company plans to launch a feature that will allow users to copy any “stack” as a template and customize it by making direct edits, Birch said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exchanges are interested in backing Stacked because its users tend to stay active on those exchanges for longer than average, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just think that you will see more of that in the crypto ecosystem &#8212; exchanges acting as the infrastructure rails,” Birch said. “They have great custody solutions, liquidity, security, all these very complicated things. But the user experience is usually pretty simple, and it&#8217;s a fairly technical product, so I think you&#8217;ll see tons of products continue to get built on top of the infrastructures that exchanges build.”</span></p>
<p>Birch first heard about bitcoin in 2015 while he was working at Grubhub, where he spent nearly five years leading restaurant growth. Once a homeless immigrant, Birch got his start as an entrepreneur launching a dropshipping business at age 17. A self-described &#8220;tech nerd,&#8221; he dropped out of college three times before completing his bachelor&#8217;s degree to explore his interest in building an internet business.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2012 to 2013, we saw major funding [for startups] and saw [Silicon] Valley, really starting to come to fruition,&#8221; Birch said. &#8220;So I started looking at a place I could move to work for a startup. I wanted to integrate myself into the tech ecosystem, so that way, I could one day be a tech founder myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He applied to jobs at startups in Chicago and landed at Grubhub when it had just 13 employees. At Grubhub, he was surrounded by engineers, data scientists, and business operations professionals who supported and mentored him.</p>
<p>Once he learned about bitcoin, he started working on business ideas in the space and got connected with Stacked cofounder Stephen Beavis. According to Birch, &#8220;the rest is history,&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sense, an HR tech startup that helps some of the world’s largest staffing and recruitment agencies timely find and hire talent, has grown its valuation to $500 million in a new financing round, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-headquartered startup has raised $50 million in its Series D financing round, it said. SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the financing round, pushing the five-and-a-half-year-old startup’s to-date raise to $90 million. The multiple-fold surge in the valuation comes just six months after Sense closed its Series C round, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p><a href="http://sensehq.com/">Sense</a> focuses on catering to the blue-collar workers and helps firms manage the talent’s entire lifecycle at the firm.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243091" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hiring knowledge workers may take up to six months, but in “this world, where you’re hiring a warehouse packager, companies need him or her to join today,” explained Anil Dharni, co-founder and chief executive of Sense, in an interview with TechCrunch. He declined to comment on the valuation.</p>
<p>The vast majority of professional social networks and other recruitment platforms are currently designed to serve knowledge workers, he said. “But for people like Uber drivers and Amazon warehouse workers, such platforms are not relevant,” he said, describing the challenge.</p>
<p>The startup, which says it uses automation, artificial intelligence, and personalization in its screening processes, has courted over 600 customers including Amazon, Sears, Vaco, and Kenny that use the Sense platform to scale their hiring, he said.</p>
<p>Citing its internal figures, Sense said its customers see an average of a whopping 263% increase in the number of candidates they are able to screen using the platform and reduce the time it takes to fill roles by up to 81%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our latest funding is not only validation of the need for personalized talent engagement in today’s candidate-centric world but is also an accelerant for our platform globally as we help reshape the future of work,” he said.</p>
<p>Sense offers a number of services including chatbots that, Dharni said, help businesses remove biases from their hiring practices.</p>
<p>In the last one and a half years, the startup’s platform has also been used to hire healthcare workers, he said.</p>
<p>Dharni got the idea to launch Sense after facing challenges in hiring talent at his previous firms, said Dharni, who previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/10/anil-dharni-gre/">co-founded gaming firm Funzio,</a> which was acquired by GREE for $210 million.</p>
<p>“We realized that talent is what makes or breaks a company. If you can’t attract the right people, your company is not going to be successful. It doesn’t matter what your TAM [total addressable market] or business model is,” he said.</p>
<p>“It was with that realization that I decided that the next startup we are going to do, it’s going to be around solving for the talent space,” he said.</p>
<p>Dharni said Sense is going after a $200 billion opportunity that remains largely untapped.</p>
<p>Sense has also more than doubled its revenue and employee headcount in the past one year. The startup now plans to expand Sense’s offerings in several markets including the Western Europe, he said.</p>
<p>“We believe the critical nature of the Sense platform in enabling enterprise customers to find and hire quality talent faster has been clear. As it expands both nationally and globally, we have no doubt in their ability to positively transform how companies build great teams and compete,” said Sumer Juneja, Managing Partner of SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p class="p1">While Elon Musk has shitposted his way to crypto sainthood, Jack Dorsey has been spreading the blockchain gospel far more earnestly than most.</p>
<p class="p1">As CEO of Twitter — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">which he was until Monday when he unexpectedly resigned</a> — the bulk of his most impassioned official communications have not focused on the power of the Twitter platform or even the deep opportunities for his other company — fintech giant Square. The former double-CEO has spent the past year spreading the gospel of bitcoin, and using his multibillion-dollar enterprises to share that same message by pushing crypto-embracing features more aggressively than his peers.</p>
<p class="p1">He hasn’t minced words. “#Bitcoin will unite a deeply divided country. (and eventually: world),” he tweeted in August.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">At a bitcoin-centric conference in Miami this year, he was even more lavish with his praise: “For me Bitcoin changes absolutely everything. What I’m drawn to the most about it is the ethos, is what it represents, are the conditions that created it, which are so rare and so special and so precious. I don’t think there’s anything more important in my lifetime to work on and I don’t think there’s anything more enabling for people around the world.”</p>
<p class="p1">His executive fervor led both Twitter and Square toward embracing bitcoin and blockchain-centric features that sit deep inside platforms relied on by millions. In July, Dorsey said that would be a “big part” of the company’s future. Recent initiatives at Square have included a hardware wallet to store bitcoin and the exploration of building a dedicated bitcoin mining system.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jack Dorsey says bitcoin will be a big part of Twitter&#8217;s future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/jack-dorsey-says-bitcoin-will-be-a-big-part-of-twitters-future/embed/#?secret=pnLGrbuEs0" data-secret="pnLGrbuEs0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1">For platforms with a multitude of unsolved and often pressing issues, Dorsey’s seemingly unilateral public focus on the revolutionary power of bitcoin hasn’t always sat well with onlookers, who already worried whether his status as a dual-CEO meant he was less in-tune with the needs of his individual companies. Early last year, activist-investor hedge fund Elliott Management issued a list of demands to Twitter — chief of which was that Dorsey would step down &#8212; after quietly bulking up a sizable stake in the company.</p>
<p class="p1">Dorsey’s announcement that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter sent the company’s stock soaring Monday. While some rejoiced that Twitter may meet its full potential under a full-time CEO, others speculated on what Dorsey was doing and whether he might be leaving Twitter to start a “web3” company focused solely on bitcoin and blockchain-based technologies. It seems that rather than spin up a new company from scratch, Dorsey has aimed to rethink the existing stack of opportunities inside his other company, Square. On Wednesday, he announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">sweeping rebrand</a>, renaming the fintech company initially known for its little plastic credit card dongles, as Block, a not-so-subtle nod to CEO/founder Dorsey’s deepening infatuation with the blockchain.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike the public companies of yesteryear, which could juice their stock price by adding “Blockchain” to their company name, Square is no penny stock — it’s worth nearly $90 billion already. At this point, it’s worth noting that Square has explicitly indicated that there will not be a wide reorganization accompanying rebrand, though Square Crypto is getting its own brand — <i>Spiral</i>. That said, it’s difficult not to read between the lines, given Dorsey’s bitcoin boosterism and the recent Square initiatives, like hardware wallets and mining rigs, which could re-position the company as crypto-first.</p>
<p class="p1">In many ways, Block’s hodgepodge of properties, including music streaming app Tidal and the Cash App, seems like a potential full-stack web3 empire, or it could just mean the opportunity to piss off an awful lot of different stakeholders by haphazardly weaving crypto technologies into products that don’t need them.</p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p>Here are a few stories this week I think you should take a closer look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/faecbook-giphy-cma-order/"><b>UK antitrust watchdog orders Meta to sell off Giphy</b></a><br />
Facebook, now Meta, has found itself in a regulatory environment that may leave it struggling to carry out M&amp;A business as usual. The U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority has ordered Meta to reverse its acquisition of gif giant Giphy and sell off the startup. &#8220;The tie-up between Facebook and Giphy has already removed a potential challenger in the display advertising market. Without action, it will also allow Facebook to increase its significant market power in social media even further, through controlling competitors’ access to Giphy GIFs,&#8221; one of the group&#8217;s leaders said in a statement.</p>
<p>Facebook may have changed its name to disguise consumer distaste for their corporate brand, but its regulatory problems aren&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/facebooks-top-crypto-executive-david-marcus-is-leaving-the-company/"><b>Facebook&#8217;s top crypto exec leaves company</b></a><br />
Facebook&#8217;s top cryptocurrency expert is leaving the company after years of plotting an ambitious entrance for the company into the crypto world. David Marcus, a long-time crypto supporter, previously led the company&#8217;s Messenger app team. His departure marks another major exit by a long-time Facebook executive — in September, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer announced he was stepping down from his role after 13 years at the company.</p>
<p>Despite being one of the most influential execs in the crypto space, Marcus was unable to get too much out the door at Facebook due to regulatory pressure. He indicated in his announcement that he is looking toward entrepreneurial pursuits next.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/twitter-expands-safety-policy-bans-posting-images-of-people-without-their-consent/">Twitter revamps safety policy </a><br />
</b>Twitter&#8217;s new CEO found himself in hot water just a day into his tenure as user backlash mounted against the company&#8217;s new safety policies. The policies, which were framed as a way to prevent harassment and abuse, outlaw sharing images or videos of private individuals without their consent. “When we are notified by individuals depicted, or by an authorized representative, that they did not consent to having their private image or video shared, we will remove it,” Twitter said in its <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a>. “This policy is not applicable to media featuring public figures or individuals when media and accompanying Tweet text are shared in the public interest or add value to public discourse.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very broad rule that&#8217;s certain to lead to further controversy. Twitter clearly received more backlash than expected; whether this leads to unexpected consequences in implementation is the broader question.</p>

<h2>added things</h2>
<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our newly renamed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch+</a> subscription service this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/lets-talk-about-the-saas-selloff/"><b>Let&#8217;s talk about the SaaS selloff</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;We are not only seeing software stocks flirt with bear-market territory in technical terms, but also a pretty notable pullback in the value of even the <em>fastest-growing</em> technology companies. This means that public valuation multiples — key indicators for yet-private unicorns and younger startups — are shrinking. Have valuations shifted enough to slow the current venture capital bonanza? Probably not. But we could be closer to that tipping point than you’d think&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/essential-steps-to-thriving-and-surviving-while-fundraising/"><b>Steps to survive and thrive while fundraising</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;So how do you prepare for this important stage in your company’s growth, navigate the challenges of a fundraise, and not let the process overwhelm the responsibility of still running your business? While not every fundraise is the same, founders can tap the experience of others who have been down this path to ensure their fundraising efforts are efficient and, most importantly, successful&#8230;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/hiding-in-plain-sight-3-ways-to-recruit-engineers-who-fly-under-linkedins-radar/"><b>3 ways to recruit engineers that fly below LinkedIn&#8217;s radar</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;Companies can’t let how they’ve hired in the past influence their approach today — doing so means missing not just the quantity of developers, but the quality and diversity of them. The remote revolution didn’t just broaden where we can recruit, it’s expanded who we can bring on board. With that in mind, these are the best ways to tap into the hidden developer gems&#8230;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The killer app of any tech is to make your life easier and more comfortable; the GPS in your car helps you find the best route to a restaurant when traffic is backed up, if you have cruise control, you can set a speed on the highway to ensure that you don&#8217;t get a ticket. These vehicle features are modern-day must-haves, yet because these complex systems are so instrumental to our daily lives, we only think about them when they&#8217;re not working or, in the case of the Rebelle Rally, blocked for competition.</p>
<p>Competitors in the Rebelle Rally &#8212; the annual off-road navigational competition for women &#8212; got to play test engineer for eight days, an experience that provided a deep understanding of what automotive-grade really means, all while competing to find hidden checkpoints in the desert for points.</p>
<p>Running a high-tech product at or near its limit in a tech-adverse environment is one way that auto manufacturers test vehicles during pre-production. Car manufacturers travel all over the world to places with extreme weather and temperatures to test vehicles to ensure that the vehicle in your driveway can withstand everything from sub-zero temperatures, snow, mud, and rain to intense heat, sand, and wind, all while running at or near the limit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243036" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Yet, it&#8217;s a part of the process that very few even consider — that is until you&#8217;re in the middle of a sandstorm or navigating across a desert, both of which I faced while behind the wheel of a 2020 Porsche Cayenne S. That experience showed just how robust automotive-grade is, and gave me a tiny taste of the kind of testing that these vehicles go through before they&#8217;re put into the hands of consumers.</p>
<h2>Competing in the extreme</h2>
<p>The Rebelle Rally is part geocaching and part off-roading competition that takes place in a variety of settings across the western desert in the United States each October. It was created by veteran rally driver and navigator, Emily Miller and 2021 marks its sixth year. Miller has said that she started the rally specifically for stock vehicles&#8211;or those that have not been modified to tackle rugged off-road terrain, as a way for women to really test the limits of the vehicle in their driveway.</p>
<p>Each day of the competition, 52 teams set out to find hidden geofenced checkpoints littered across the landscape using nothing more than paper maps, handheld compasses, and map rulers to locate them. Some checkpoints have visible flags, while others have no marker whatsoever, and each checkpoint has a specific open and closing time.</p>
<p>Competitors use a hand-held GPS locator, an Iridium Yellow Brick tracking device, to check in at each checkpoint and earn points which are based on a variety of factors, including location, level of off-road driving difficulty, and accuracy or how close they get to the correct geofenced point. At the end of the competition, the team with the most points takes the podium.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This year the competition covered more than 1,500 miles of off-road trails in California, Arizona, and Nevada, and manufacturers like Porsche, Rivian, Volkswagen, Jeep, Nissan, and Toyota often put teams of women into OEM-owned vehicles to show just how capable their crossovers, SUVs, and trucks are. This year, eleven manufacturer-sponsored teams competed.</p>
<p>The competition was a first for me and Porsche North America.</p>
<p>According to Miller, the rally is &#8220;designed as a proving ground. We have some [companies] that have engineers participating so they can literally live and compete in the vehicles they design, some that see it as an authentic, hard-core test drive for journalists, employee development, customer opportunities and incentives. And the content collected comes from some of the most scenic landscapes anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<h2>When sand and modern vehicles meet</h2>

<p>This year&#8217;s event posed a more difficult challenge than in years past as a result of the weather.</p>
<p>We endured extremes that ranged from lows in the 30s with rain, snow, and sleet to a tremendous sandstorm that lasted 24 hours at Big Dune, near Beatty, Nevada. Overnight, during that storm, gusts reached upwards of 60 mph, created total white-out conditions, and forced most of the competitors, including my teammate Beth Bowman and I, to sleep in our vehicles as a safety precaution.</p>
<p>The wind and blowing sand shredded and destroyed tents and caused an extremely unsafe condition for the fuel truck, which normally provides the 50-plus competitors with fuel each night.</p>
<p>Those are just the kind of weather conditions that people like Ralf Bosch, the director of Cayenne testing at Porsche, celebrate when testing a vehicle. &#8220;Sand is a terrible torture for a modern vehicle. There&#8217;s lots of cooling, clutches and drive shafts that have to be specially designed so that they don&#8217;t break down in the dunes,&#8221; Bosch said.</p>
<p>Bosch and his team travel all over the world — from Finland to Africa — to test prototype Cayennes, both combustion and hybrid-powered, in extreme weather.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look for extreme cold, for extreme wet and drizzly and salty weather, extreme temperatures with mud and snow, to be sure that these conditions don&#8217;t affect the car too much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We drive the vehicles for days in sand storms, and then we pack them in snow and ice and cold until everything is frozen and aim to have no fault indications.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s highly unlikely that an owner will ever take their Cayenne to the wilds of Yellowknife in Canada, a popular and extreme winter testing site for auto manufacturers, this kind of rigorous testing is a regular practice in the industry. This testing helps carmakers ensure that the technology, both inside and out, is automotive grade. That means that everything from the GPS in your vehicle, the auto/stop-start system, to the engine or motor, will run in all kinds of conditions&#8211;especially at the extremes&#8211;without breaking down or failing completely.</p>

<p>The Rebelle Rally poses unique challenges for modern vehicles, especially as they become even more tech-laden. Since GPS and digital compasses are not allowed in the Rebelle, our Cayenne S, which we nicknamed Ruby after its scarlet interior, went through an extensive process shepherded by Porsche to ensure that the navigation system was totally confused and showed the incorrect data in order to meet the rules and regulations of the competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to disable the GPS capabilities on the Cayenne S, we removed all antennas (GPS, GSM and WiFi), and additionally programmed the PCM to only search for non-U.S. satellites so it would not connect to our U.S. based satellite network,&#8221; Kyle Milliken, the Porsche press fleet technician who worked the system, said.</p>
<p>That meant that the entire time we were driving in remote areas of the desert, the system thought we were somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, and its digital compass was completely useless.</p>
<p>Like most modern vehicles, our Cayenne S had one single screen that controlled everything from climate to ride height and traction. Those last two features are absolutely crucial when taking on any challenging off-road trail in an all-wheel-drive vehicle, as you need to be able to actively manage and control ride height and power distribution. Had Porsche not adequately confused the GPS, the Rally would have physically blocked our access to that screen, rendering us unable to do much more than put the car in drive, reverse, park and neutral.</p>

<p>Unlike the first-generation Cayenne, which has a rightful reputation as an off-road beast (as it had a robust chassis and came complete with locking differentials and a transfer case accessed through physical buttons), a modern Cayenne&#8217;s off-road features and programs can only be accessed through the main center console screen.</p>
<p>In addition to this, you must be able to access the screen (and its menus) to change a tire on a modern Cayenne S outfitted with air suspension, as Ruby was. You have to turn off the auto-leveling feature that makes the Cayenne comfortable on-road and off to jack the car up. Had the Rally blocked our screen because of the GPS, we&#8217;d have had a far more difficult time competing.</p>
<p>Some of the very good off-road settings that come with the air suspension on the Cayenne S (my favorites were Sand and Rocks with the chassis height on Terrain) got a little too smart during our version of torture testing.</p>
<p>While training in the Oceano Dunes in late August, Beth and I struggled to get intentionally stuck in the soft sand so we could practice the self-rescue skills we would need in the Rally. The traction control system on the Cayenne would override and stop the wheel spin when I gunned it to dig us in on that training. Luckily, during the Rally itself, we never got stuck — nor did I blow a tire or break anything on the vehicle. The Cayenne proved to be so solid that we even rescued another vehicle that got stuck in the Glamis Dunes.</p>

<p>All of this is a testament to the robustness of the extreme testing that goes into the development of automotive-grade technology and components, particularly those in the modern Cayenne. Despite a massive sandstorm (plus two more small ones that pelted us over the eight-day stint), extremely harsh environments, and tricky driving, the Cayenne S performed just as expected every single day.</p>
<p>Each morning, Ruby purred to life, kept us comfortable and warm (or cool), and never threw a single fault. We never had to blow out the air filter or brakes and drove straight from the eerie Glamis dunes onto the highway and back to the chaos of Los Angeles, doing nothing more than adding air back to the 20-inch tires we ran on.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s precisely what &#8220;automotive grade,&#8221; testing is designed to do&#8211;keep you on the road no matter what kind of weather or environment you&#8217;re facing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s so good on the road, you think that it can&#8217;t be that good in such a sandy and dirty condition,&#8221; As Bosch said. &#8220;We try to keep the off-road performance by improving the on-road performance in the Cayenne and it&#8217;s a very capable vehicle.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>This week, President Biden will gather leaders from <a href="https://www.state.gov/participant-list-the-summit-for-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 countries</a> to attend his long-promised virtual Summit for Democracy. After a year of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/04/biden-democracy-summit-technology-519530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consultation, coordination and action,</a> these leaders will come together once more for a second summit to report on progress on the initial set of commitments to protect<a href="https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> human rights, counter authoritarianism and corruption</a>.</p>
<p>Having been born in the former Soviet Union, I cannot help but feel a sense of optimism about the summit. Even as a very young child, I felt the chill that came from living in a place that restricted freedom of expression and speech and where information and just about every aspect of life were greatly controlled by the state or a select few in power. My personal experiences make me grateful to be an American citizen. But having lived under an authoritarian regime, I’m acutely sensitive to the reasons this summit is taking place: the democratic recession taking place around the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>No area is as critical in this democratic competition as technology. If leaders hope to make progress on the three core tenets of the summit, they will have to ensure that technology serves democracy and human rights. This includes facilitating investments in open internet and critical infrastructure as a way to counter digital authoritarianism, countering disinformation, strengthening societal resilience and making greater investments in emerging technologies and tech entrepreneurship that are consistent with democratic values and diversity.<br />

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/04/biden-democracy-summit-technology-519530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reporting</a> indicates that we are likely to see commitments made on strengthening the internet, increasing funds for media literacy and civic education and enforcing export controls for dual-use technologies, among other initiatives. These are all useful steps. But if they are to last beyond the summit, they will require public-private-civic partnerships to truly implement and scale. Here are three areas that merit our collective attention:</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/democracy-task-force/special-report/2021/reversing-the-tide/strategies-and-recommendations#developing-technology-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital authoritarianism</a>, the use of technology to repress citizens domestically via regulation, censorship and export of technologies, has become a pervasive global problem. We don’t have to look much farther than China and its pioneering <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/exporting-digital-authoritarianism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state-controlled internet</a> or Russia and its ever-<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/18/russia-growing-internet-isolation-control-censorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tightening control</a> over internet infrastructure, online content and privacy. What’s more, by exporting this form of authoritarianism to other regions of the globe, including Africa and Latin America, these countries are helping foster <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/78381/system-rivalry-how-democracies-must-compete-with-digital-authoritarians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“system rivalry”</a> between democracies and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>There is much the private sector, civil society and governments can do together to counter this evolving threat. This includes working together to develop critical infrastructure in emerging markets while tightening export controls of repressive technologies. At the subnational level, the U.S. and its allies should work to increase access to the internet and promote internet freedom, with a particular focus on marginalized communities. Civil society in particular should use its voice to advocate for local regulations and practices to keep both governments and the private sector accountable. Multinational corporations, too, should harness their power for good by conducting human rights assessments in countries they are operating in, to ensure that they are neither committing human rights abuses nor inadvertently aiding authoritarian regimes in their business practices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Second, disinformation, the intentional spread of falsehoods and half-truths, continues to be a serious threat to democracies globally. In recent years we have seen election and COVID-related disinformation in the United States and around the world spreading like wildfire on social media platforms, mainstream media and through our trusted networks. <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1793.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia</a>, <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/beijings-global-megaphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China</a>, <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/14/politics/fbi-qanon-threat-assessment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domestic actors</a> have carried out disinformation campaigns not only to cause chaos and confusion, but as we saw during the January 6 insurrection, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/01/22/united-states-capitol-siege-disinformation-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflict serious harm</a>. What’s more, these disinformation campaigns have bled over to hateful rhetoric against marginalized communities, including women and girls, the LGBTQ+ community and journalists. This is one area where governments, private sector and civil society <em>should</em> and <em>must </em>act on their commitments in the coming year. Otherwise, democracies simply will not be able to keep up with information pollution — on or offline.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to do that. The bipartisan Task Force on the U.S. Strategy to Support Democracy and Counter Authoritarianism, on which I served, proposed the establishment of a <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/democracy-task-force/special-report/2021/reversing-the-tide/strategies-and-recommendations#footnote2_kn6nlr7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Task Force on Information Integrity and Resilience </a>in order to build trust in the information environment. Our proposal was grounded in the belief that while this task force may be led by leaders of like-minded countries, both the private sector and civil society should have strong participation to collaborate and share information on disinformation, online hate and harassment in order to anticipate, preempt and counter these threats. Ultimately, the goal should be to build societal resilience for the long term.</p>
<p>Third, the private sector and civil society must invest in and scale partnership with governments to implement initiatives on digital and media literacy, and civics education in existing and nascent democracies, reaching citizens beyond the capitals. At the same time, in the coming year, the private sector, especially digital platforms and mainstream media, need to double down on providing credible, quality information to citizens, because, to put it simply, our lives depend on it. There have been a number of <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/transatlantic-group-promotes-regime-of-online-transparency-and-accountability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposals</a> on increasing transparency and accountability of digital platforms to prevent algorithmic bias, misuse of data and the spread of malicious content. Ultimately, as we seek to build the best information ecosystem possible, these principles are about building trust — between citizens, content providers, governments and industry.</p>
<p>We will not be able to move the needle on countering these threats without a deep investment in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. Investments in identifying and exposing these threats — and understanding their impact — should not be exclusive to the U.S. or Europe. As startups develop these technologies, they should ensure their products can safely scale to emerging markets.</p>
<p>Spurring innovation and entrepreneurship in emerging markets is the final area where the private sector and civil society have a meaningful opportunity to work with governments. <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/06/20/entrepreneurs-and-small-businesses-spur-economic-growth-and-create-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research</a> shows that innovation and entrepreneurship create economic growth, and this is true for the technology sector as well. The surest way to inoculate developing countries from authoritarian tech is to invest in the next generation of talent, especially youth, women and girls, and other marginalized communities. Developing credible local voices, entrepreneurs and innovators who can use emerging technologies to counter the authoritarian threats posed to their countries just may represent the best way to reach our desired outcomes.</p>
<p>When it comes to technology, we are in a competition for influence between democratic values and the authoritarian-imposed way of life. This year’s summit paves the way for meaningful democratic resurgence. But as we move into a year of action and consultation, it is public-private-civic partnerships that will enable the scaling and implementation necessary for a technological agenda in service of democracy.</p>

The Credit Karma CEO was about to announce that the company he founded 13 years earlier was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/intuit-credit-karma/">about to be acquired</a> for more than $7 billion. Meanwhile, the stock market was in free fall.</p>
<p>“I remember waking up and the Dow futures were down something like 600 points because the COVID pieces were starting to hit the market,” Lin said. “I&#8217;m up at 5 o&#8217;clock in the morning, the Dow is flashing red … and we&#8217;re all like, ‘Are we going to do this?’”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;What had been a very profitable business for a very long time is all of a sudden very unprofitable, because you can&#8217;t pivot on a dime. We had a lot of decisions to make.”							<cite>Ken Lin, Credit Karma CEO</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Markets were getting jittery as it became clear the coronavirus had spread beyond China’s borders as case numbers were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/world/europe/italy-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiplying in Italy</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/world/asia/china-coronavirus-world-health-organization.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Korea</a>. The S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-market-pandemic-11582590444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell 3.5% that day</a> and kicked off a weeklong sell-off in global securities as the WHO warned COVID-19 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/viruss-global-spread-may-not-be-contained-who-says-11582567815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could soon become a global pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>“Needless to say, we all agreed that it was the right decision [to move forward] and that all the externalities and unknowns at that point were immaterial,” Lin said. “So we pushed forward with it and we got the deal signed and announced.”</p>
<p>By the time the deal closed — on December 3, one year ago — Credit Karma had seen its business impacted by a tightening of the credit markets and had been forced to divest its tax business after a Justice Department review.</p>
<p>But in the 12 months since, Credit Karma, which operates as a mostly independent unit within Intuit, has seen a dramatic rebound in its business thanks in part to a reversal in the financial markets, but also due to commercial adoption of its Lightbox decision-making engine and acceleration of consumer interest from integrations with Intuit products.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><i>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><i>subscribe here.</i></a></p>
<p>While we have certainly talked through what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-dorsey-twitter-and-we-have-thoughts/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">Jack Dorsey’s resignation</a> means for Twitter (and now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">how it impacts Block</a>), I’m still thinking about a few lines from his resignation tweet.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder-led,&#8217;” Dorsey wrote. “Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I’ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.” Dorsey added that he believes “it’s critical that a company can stand on its own, free of its founder’s influence or direction.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242754" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is a bold statement: Success as a founder can look like hiring smart enough people so that you are no longer relevant to making the company work day in, day out. If you go on vacation, and your team can’t function without Slacking you every few minutes, that is more representative of the strength of the company than the strength of the team.</p>
<p>Last month, I wrote about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/">importance of establishing the difference</a> &#8212; both in ownership and incentive &#8212; between a founder, a founding team member, an adviser, an investor, an angel investor and an early employee. This week, I want to switch gears and talk about when it’s time to unlearn those titles, or at the very least, evolve from them. As Floodgates partner Iris Choi mentioned in our recent podcast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/have-we-reached-peak-founder-friendliness/">about founder friendliness</a>, founders eventually become the “VP of nothing.”</p>
<p>No one will disagree with the notion that a startup needs to be successful beyond its founder, but the process of shifting that individual from essential to non-essential can be uncomfortable (especially in our current environment that’s hyper-friendly toward founders). My take, as I argued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo/">earlier</a>, is that we’ll start to see due diligence change to address more than how a founder views their sector in a decade. Entrepreneurs could be pushed on their ability to hire, change their minds and understand when it is time to walk away. Removing the idea from the identity so that the company doesn’t feel innately tied to a founder is healthy for the longevity of the company but will require some real conversations on attribution.</p>
<p>I interviewed founders and investors to get a temperature check on how comfortable they are with the idea of recommending, and executing, on the promise of decentralized authority in this market. For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/04/founders-need-to-uncouple-their-own-idea-from-its-creator/">Founders need to uncouple their own idea from its creator.</a> Alex and Amanda also chimed in on the topic, arguing precedent, and that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo/">founders aren’t rockstars so we should stop treating them as such.</a></p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about rebranding season, accidental churn and freshly venture-backed layoffs.

<h2>Tis the season to rebrand</h2>

<p>Jack Dorsey is taking up a lot of space. Days after the Twitter co-founder resigned from the social media platform, his other company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">Square, rebranded to Block</a>. The name change has allegedly been in the works for over a year, but it feels timely given that Facebook changed its corporate branding to Meta just over a month ago.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Block is supposed to encompass Square’s growing suite of products, which includes music streaming service Tidal, Cash App, TBD, and of course, Square. It’s also a nod to the company’s interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. I don’t hate the name, but if you’re in the mood for a chuckle, <a href="https://investors.block.xyz/governance/leadership/default.aspx">just take a look at its executive leadership page.</a></p>

<p>Butter! The startup wants to help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/butter-raises-7m-to-end-accidental-churn-due-to-payment-failure/">every subscription company deal with customers who accidentally churn</a> &#8212; pun intended &#8212; due to payment failures. The product isn’t sales tech, but rather a fintech service that detects problems with renewals or sign-up issues where charges are declined due to being attempted in another country.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong>, per CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijay-menon-0b87b141/">Vijay Menon</a>: The international payments failure market is underserved by some of the largest payment providers, such as Stripe, which focus on domestic services. Butter wants to serve growing markets like Brazil, India and Mexico. Before he even launched his startup, the entrepreneur helped Microsoft recover over 10 million Xbox live subscriptions, chalking up to more than $100 million in recovered revenue. Now, Butter has $7 million to tackle even more.</p>

<p>It’s more common than you think. This week, digital mortgage lender Better.com announced that it is getting a $750 million cash infusion ahead of an impending public market debut. Then, one day later, it announced layoffs, confirming that it cut 9% of its overall staff.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> As Mary Ann Azevedo reports, it’s possible that the layoffs were a condition to getting that deal approved &#8212; but it still feels harsh to add millions to your balance sheet and cut staff within the same breath. The layoffs are mainly taking place in the United States and India. While we’re nowhere near 2020’s slew of unicorn layoffs, rising concerns about the omicron variant and a toughening market for some sectors could mean more instability to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242489" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple this week <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=10y39zv4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its anticipated annual list of the best apps and games of the year across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch. This year, children’s app maker Toca Boca won iPhone App of the Year for “Toca Life World,” and Riot Games’ “League of Legends: Wild Rift” was the iPhone Game of the Year. Other winners included iPad App of the Year “LumaFusion” from LumaTouch; iPad Game of the Year “MARVEL Future Revolution” from Netmarble; Mac App of the Year “Craft,” from Luki Labs Limited; Mac Game of the Year “Myst,” from Cyan; Apple TV App of the Year “DAZN,” from DAZN Group; Apple TV Game of the Year “Space Marshals 3,” from Pixelbite; Apple Watch App of the Year “Carrot Weather,” from Grailr; and the Apple Arcade Game of the Year: “Fantasian,” from Mistwalker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this year&#8217;s group of winners is the subtle statement Apple is making with its editorial picks. For instance, Toca Boca &#8212; which has produced more than 40 kids&#8217; apps to date and <a href="https://twitter.com/tocaboca/status/1371884474858897409?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated</a> its 10-year anniversary this year &#8212; is a reminder that developers are building long-term businesses on the App Store and Apple helped play a role in supporting that success. Other winners are those that compete with Apple&#8217;s own first-party apps, including <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carrot Weather</a> (which also uses weather data from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-dark-sky-android-version-shutting-down-in-july/">Apple-owned</a> Dark Sky), Pages rival <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/luki-labs-limited/id1487937126">Craft</a> and iMovie competitor <a href="https://luma-touch.com/lumafusion-for-ios-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LumaFusion</a>.</p>
<p>These are not necessarily coincidences. 2021 was a year that&#8217;s seen much backlash and upheaval for the App Store, which has faced increased regulatory scrutiny, new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">legislation</a> in global markets and various lawsuits over the App Store’s commission-based business model — including the ongoing one with Epic Games, now under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">appeal</a>. As a result, Apple has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">adjusted</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-developers-to-contact-customers-about-other-payment-methods/">clarified</a> its policies and even<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/"> reduced</a> its commissions in some cases, as dictated by the market demands and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/">settlement</a> agreements. But despite all these changes, the winning lineup reminds us that the quality of the apps on the App Store remains high.</p>
<p>Apple also released its year-end list of the most-downloaded apps, led by TikTok (iPhone&#8217;s top free app), Procreate Pocket (iPhone and iPad&#8217;s top paid app), Among Us! (iPhone and iPad&#8217;s top free game), Minecraft (iPhone and iPad&#8217;s top paid game), YouTube (iPad&#8217;s top free app) and The Oregon Trail (top Apple Arcade app.) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/apple-announces-the-2021-app-store-award-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/">The full lineup is here.</a></p>
<h3><strong>Google Play introduced its &#8220;Best of 2021&#8221; app awards, too</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2240091" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240091" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240091" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best_of_2021-blog_header-01.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best_of_2021-blog_header-01.png 2096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best_of_2021-blog_header-01.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best_of_2021-blog_header-01.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best_of_2021-blog_header-01.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best_of_2021-blog_header-01.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best_of_2021-blog_header-01.png?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best_of_2021-blog_header-01.png?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best_of_2021-blog_header-01.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240091" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google Play also this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/balance-and-pokemon-unite-top-google-plays-best-of-2021-awards/">announced</a> its own year-end list of the best apps and games on Google Play. This year, Google expanded its awards lineup to include apps and games on tablets, Wear OS and Google TV. Its U.S. winners included meditation app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elevatelabs.geonosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balance</a> as its app of the year and top game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite">Pokémon UNITE</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cbs.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paramount+</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dts.freefiremax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garena Free Fire MAX</a> won the user’s choice awards.</p>
<p>In 2020, Google&#8217;s award winners had reflected a world undergoing a pandemic, where stressed users had turned to apps and soothing games to relax — like top sleep app Loóna, which was last year’s “Best App,” or escapist games like winner Genshin Impact.</p>
<p>But with the early days of the pandemic now behind us, some of this year’s award winners were apps that focus on personal growth and creativity, instead of just relaxing or escaping. In addition to Best of 2021 app Balance, which offers personalized meditation, other personal development-styled winners include <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moonly.android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moonly</a>, an app for “harmonizing your life” with the lunar calendar; a “comedic relaxation” app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.launchpad.laughscape" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laughscape</a>; a hypnotherapy app for women, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clementine.clementineapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clementine</a>; better sleep app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northcube.sleepcycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleep Cycle</a>; mentorship community <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mentorspaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mentor Spaces</a>; habit tracker and planner <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blu.rabito" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rabit</a>; and an app for navigating grief from loss, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.empathy.companion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empathy</a>.</p>
<p>Other winners showcased how we adapted to pandemic life, as with audio chatroom <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clubhouse.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clubhouse</a>, tools for reducing screen time, like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cliffweitzman.speechify2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speechify</a>, or those for reconnecting with nature, like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conceptivapps.blossom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blossom</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>The Amazon Appstore stopped working on Android 12 and almost no one cared</strong></h3>
<p>In a telling piece of news that may reflect how little traction the Amazon Appstore has with the general public, the Amazon-run Android marketplace stopped working on Android 12 devices over a month ago, and there&#8217;s been almost no media coverage until this week. On Monday, however, tech news site <a href="https://liliputing.com/2021/11/android-12-launched-a-month-ago-and-amazon-appstore-still-wont-run-on-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liliputing</a> finally called attention to the matter, which followed the October release of Android 12. It said that not only did the Amazon Appstore not run on Android 12 devices, apps and games also couldn&#8217;t be launched because of how the Appstore handles DRM. The site noted some 90-plus users had posted <a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q000087E2wvSAC/amazon-appstore-not-working-after-android-12-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaints</a> in a thread on Amazon&#8217;s forums about the problem, to which Amazon&#8217;s moderators had only replied that the company was &#8220;investigating the issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon wouldn&#8217;t provide TechCrunch with any details as to what the underlying issues were either, only acknowledging the problem was impacting the &#8220;small number of Amazon Appstore users that upgraded to Android 12.&#8221;<em> (Oof! Burn!) </em>While, sure, Android users aren&#8217;t as quick to jump to new versions as iOS users are, that the entire Amazon Appstore would fail on the latest Android release makes us wonder if anyone at Amazon had even run the thing on a beta build ahead of Android 12&#8217;s launch at all? Or maybe they were too busy with <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/fe7771ac-f2df-42be-ac51-eb7fe0df1b5b/amazon-and-microsoft-announce-next-steps-for-bringing-the-amazon-appstore-to-windows-customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that Microsoft deal</a> to bother?</p>
<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3><strong>Platforms: Apple</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>As the holidays draw near, Apple&#8217;s iOS 15.2 beta 4 has been released</strong> to both <a href="https://developer.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers</a> and <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public testers</a>. It also <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/83627/apple-stops-signing-ios-151-downgrades-and-restores-no-longer-possible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped</a> signing iOS 15.1, making downloads and restores no longer possible.</li>
<li><strong>A report by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/02/apple-commision-outside-of-the-app/">9to5Mac</a> pointed out how Apple said in a legal filing that it could collect commission on in-app purchases that take place outside its App Store </strong>when asking for an extension on the injunction resulting from the Epic Games lawsuit. The claim had been first spotted and <a href="https://twitter.com/drbarnard/status/1466413735220760584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466413735220760584%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Fapple-commision-outside-of-the-app%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> by David Barnard, leading to the coverage. Apple of course wants more time to implement the required changes, and used this argument about non-App Store IAPs (among many, <em>many</em> other reasons) as why it should be granted the extra time. But it&#8217;s too soon to read into the filing&#8217;s statements as an indication of Apple&#8217;s future plans. Tapping into non-App Store payments in order to commission them is a complex matter and one that could open Apple up to increased liability due to fraudulent transactions. Sure, Apple may very well do that, but it also might not. But right now, this is only proof that Apple is trying <em>really hard</em> to get an extension, and nothing more.</li>

His departure will free him up to work full-time at the other company he&#8217;s been running, Square (now renamed Block), which seems to be more closely connected with his current interests in cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. Twitter&#8217;s CTO Parag Agrawal has become CEO and is already making changes. Two Twitter execs, head of engineering Michael Montano and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/16/technology/twitter-culture-change-conflict.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial</a> VP of design Dantley Davis, are leaving the company, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/03/twitter-agrawal-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post reported</a>.

<li><strong>Bumble surpassed the $1 billion mark in consumer spending,</strong> according to data from <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/market-data-bumble-surpasses-1-billion-consumer-spend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Annie</a>. The dating and networking app is one of only 15 other non-gaming apps, and the only dating app outside of Tinder, to have hit this milestone. In addition to Bumble and Tinder, other billion-dollar club members include YouTube, Netflix, Tencent Video, TikTok, iQIYI, Pandora Music, LINE, Disney+, HBO Max, BIGO LIVE, Google One, LINE Manga, piccoma and Youku. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bumble-investors-should-be-more-thankful-11637848981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The WSJ also remarked</a> this week that Bumble, with a fully diluted valuation of around $6.6 billion, <strong>is starting to look undervalued. </strong></li>

The employees also said they had been unlawfully stripped of their Tinder stock options. The suit sought “billions of dollars” in damages at the time of its filing. While they didn&#8217;t get quite that number, after the court dismissed some of their claims for damages, $441 million is no small number. Match said it&#8217;s paying the settlement in cash. It had around $510 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter. </span></li>

The event had been sponsored by Supercell, which benefitted from the viral success of the video which had topped 100 million views. In the six days followed the YouTube video&#8217;s release, Brawl Stars&#8217; downloads grew 41% week-over-week to 1.4 million. The majority (263,000) were from U.S. users. Player spending also grew 54% week-over-week worldwide to reach $8.2 million. The surge may not be all MrBeast-related, however. The Brawl Stars World Finals had just taken place November 26-28, which may have also boosted installs.</li>

<li><strong>Apple and Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/agcm-fines-apple-google/">were fined €10 million apiece</a> by Italy’s competition and market authority (<a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AGCM</a>),</strong> which said the companies didn&#8217;t provide their users with clear enough information on commercial uses of their data. Both were accused of omitting information during the account creation phase. For Apple, that includes when users first set up their Apple ID to access its digital storefronts, like the App Store.</li>
<li><strong>U.K.&#8217;s antitrust watchdog has ordered Facebook (now called Meta) to sell Giphy,</strong> the online and mobile GIF platform it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">acquired</a> for $400 million in May 2020.</li>

<h3><strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Android devices will soon automatically turn off runtime permissions &#8212; which allow apps to access data or take actions on your behalf</strong> — for downloaded apps you haven’t used in a while. The feature was also a part of <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-december-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android&#8217;s winter update</a> and will roll out this month on Android 6.0 and higher.</li>

The apps had posed as QR scanners, PDF scanners and cryptocurrency wallets that had been discovered on Google Play for months.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/twitter-expands-safety-policy-bans-posting-images-of-people-without-their-consent/">expanded</a> its safety policy by banning the posting of images and videos of private individuals without their consent.</strong> This doesn&#8217;t mean users can&#8217;t post images, necessarily, but if the private individual asks for the image to be taken down, Twitter will do so. The <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/twitters-new-privacy-policy-could-clash-with-journalism.php?a=home-hero&amp;utm_source=cjr-org&amp;utm_content=homehero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Columbia Journalism Review</a> cautioned that the new policy&#8217;s wording could lead to difficulties in balancing what&#8217;s in the public interest (which is permitted) with individual privacy. Already things are not going well. Twitter Safety has <a href="https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1465831941157052416" target="_blank" rel="noopener">locked</a> the account of an extremism researcher who had posted videos of right-wing extremists who were discussing plans for assaulting a reporter in <em>public</em>, where legally, there&#8217;s no expectation of privacy.</li>

<p>The new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/indie-app-santa/id1594011307?ign-itsct=apps_box_appicon&amp;ign-itscg=30200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indie App Santa app</a> is an advent calendar of sorts for those who love to download and try out iOS apps. The idea began last year as a Twitter account, which drove around 40,000 downloads to the apps the day they were featured. This year, the team at App Craft Studio decided to expand the project to the web, a native iOS app (with Home Widgets and Push notifications), in addition to social accounts on Twitter, Gumroad and Patreon.</p>
<p>According to creator and indie developer François Boulis, the team wasn&#8217;t sure if Apple&#8217;s App Store Review would approve their new app because it could be considered a &#8220;mini App Store&#8221; &#8212; which is against Apple&#8217;s rules. But the app passed through App Review on its first try, he says.</p>
<p>The new iOS app presents an advent calendar-like interface where each day you can tap to open a door and reveal a new deal on an indie developer&#8217;s app. The app will work from December 1 through December 24, and is a free download (with the option to pay to support its development).</p>
<p>So far, the app has revealed deals including a free version of MrClockface, a clock widget app; a free version of visual calendar Structured Pro; and puzzle game Blackbox. Most of the apps featured throughout the month will also be free, except for YarnBuddy (December 8), which will offer its $39.99 IAP for just $9.99 on the day of its featuring.</p>
<p>But India App Santa&#8217;s deals don&#8217;t last forever &#8212; you have to grab them as they arrive, or you&#8217;ll miss out.</p>

<p>A new startup called <a href="https://alms.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alms</a> is building a social network that focuses on users’ well-being through participation in creator-led challenges in areas like personal growth, sustainability and others focused on positive impacts. Instead of driving the collection of “likes,” as on other social apps, Alms aims to encourage real-world engagement through its challenges and the specific steps and actions that must be taken. The idea, explains Alms founder Alexander Nevedovsky, is to design an app that guides users to a happier and more meaningful life when they use it. At launch Alms has 30 creators on board, and more in the pipeline, and has attracted a couple of thousand users in its first few days on the App Store.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polestar will spend the next three years executing a lofty electric vehicle launch schedule that will culminate with the Precept concept, a &#8220;Rosetta Stone&#8221; of sorts that provides a physical representation of the company&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>Polestar, the former Volvo company that spun out to become its own brand, refers to the concept as its &#8220;manifesto.&#8221; In other words, the Precept, which will go into production as the Polestar 5, tells consumers and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/swedish-ev-maker-polestar-reportedly-preparing-to-go-spac-at-21b-valuation/">eventual shareholders</a> what the EV automaker intends to become.</p>
<p>The next several years will be spent moving further away from its Volvo roots and closer to its own brand, Greg Hembrough, head of Polestar USA, told TechCrunch in an interview at a company presentation in New York. During the presentation, Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath, along with other members of the automaker&#8217;s leadership team, laid out a plan to expand to new markets, increase sales volume ten-fold and launch three new cars in the process. This ambitious plan is predicated on the company&#8217;s core values of design, sustainability and innovation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243026" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The road so far</h2>
<p>In 1996, Polestar was introduced to the world as a racing company that sold and developed performance software for Volvo Cars. Intertwined from the start, the union became official in 2011 when Polestar became a Performance partner, imbuing Volvo vehicles with enhanced sport characteristics. It was fully acquired by Volvo Car Group in 2015. It spun off shortly thereafter as its own brand, birthing its first car, the first-and-only hybrid Polestar 1 in 2017 and full EV Polestar 2 in 2019.</p>
<p>Between the two models, Polestar has sold roughly 29,000 vehicles, with the four-door EV Polestar 2 dominating the bulk of those sales. It&#8217;s currently the only Polestar in full swing, as the Polestar 1&#8217;s limited production recently concluded and the upcoming Polestar 3 SUV is expected to get underway sometime in 2022.</p>
<h2>Future design</h2>
<p>From the jump, the Precept is meant to convey as much of the Polestar tenets as can be visually conveyed, the most prominent of which is luxury and performance. It&#8217;s also key to Polestar&#8217;s brand identity, distinguishing itself from its sibling brand and becoming something unique.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that if people take a look at the Polestar 1 and Polestar 2, they continue to see a little bit of the DNA from one of our sibling companies,&#8221; Hembrough told TechCrunch. &#8220;The Precept&#8217;s intent was to not only give you an indication of our future design language is going to be, but also a clear indicator of elements you&#8217;ll see from a design perspective and sustainability perspective. These things are far greater now than just a wish list, these are things that will actually be brought into production.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With this in mind, the business end of the Precept starts to tell a story. The Volvo family resemblance begins to fade, in favor of a more distinct, signature look. For instance, the distinct &#8220;Thor&#8217;s Hammer&#8221; headlights from the sibling brand are now &#8220;dual blades,&#8221; and appear to split the original design in half physically, if not also symbolically.</p>

<p>The &#8220;shark nose&#8221; facia has further intricacies, such as the absence of a vestigial grille for engine cooling, replaced by the &#8220;SmartZone&#8221; sensor suite.

<h2>Innovation</h2>
<p>When it comes to tech, Polestar has a full plate. There&#8217;s the fun stuff like its ambitions for its vehicles to have a certain level of automated highway piloting, but it&#8217;s moot if the cars fail to outperform the competition.</p>
<p>Underneath the surface of the Precept is an aluminum architecture indicative of the sporty underpinnings the Polestar 5 will have. The grand tourer will have an electrical system based off of the one that will be incorporated into the Polestar 3 and will have Nvidia-powered computing integrated. Its motor will be the &#8220;P10,&#8221; a 450 kilowatt unit in development that the company is targeting to be one of the most powerful ones out there, producing roughly 603 horsepower. This is married to a 800 volt battery pack that can switch to 400 to match the charging infrastructure, and will also support bi-directional charging.</p>

<p>With so much to focus on, Hembrough says concentrating on the user experience keeps Polestar on the right course. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the things we began building very early with the Polestar 2, being the first company with an Android Automotive operating system that includes embedded Google services. Over-the-air software updates are rolled out to customer vehicles monthly, and there&#8217;s a surprise and delight with everything from having a web browser to games to a video player.</p>
<p>&#8220;We begin to take it very quickly to the next level with the Polestar 3 and as indicated in the Precept, things like ocular tracking is a convenience but also a safety opportunity as well. UX will continue to be part of that innovation, but we will never stray away from safety,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>A great deal of emphasis was placed on the issue of sustainability, with a focus on reducing carbon impact, if not neutralizing it from production entirely.</p>
<p>Polestar has declared its intention to produce a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/polestar-will-have-to-question-everything-in-order-to-build-the-first-climate-neutral-ev/">fully carbon neutral vehicle by 2030</a>. It&#8217;s not a self pat on the back, either, it&#8217;s a conversation customers are actively engaged in, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look back, five or ten years ago, I think that&#8217;s one of the last things consumers would be talking about, but the world has changed so dramatically, those are all things consumers are very conscious about and asking about,&#8221; Hembrough said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243031" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/precept-innterior-alex-k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243031" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2243031 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/precept-innterior-alex-k.jpg" alt="polestar precept electric vehicle interior-" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/precept-innterior-alex-k.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/precept-innterior-alex-k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/precept-innterior-alex-k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/precept-innterior-alex-k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/precept-innterior-alex-k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/precept-innterior-alex-k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/precept-innterior-alex-k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2243031" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>The declaration of its &#8220;Polestar 0&#8221; project has galvanized a sense of urgency in the company, and the methods planned vary in scope. To start, there are new and innovative materials at play in the interior of the Precept, such as carbon-fiber-like bio-composite components derived from flax. The seats are a weave of recycled PES plastics. It&#8217;s a fabric that&#8217;s already in use in the fashion and footwear world, and one of the ways Polestar looks to differentiate itself with the old ways of automaking. &#8220;Those things aren&#8217;t just taglines, they&#8217;re at our core,&#8221; Hembrough said.</p>
<p>Outside of innovative materials, Polestar will employ carbon capture tech to achieve its goals, as well as increasing transparency within its supply chain level and insisting on improved supplier practices.</p>
<h2>Beyond 2025</h2>
<p>Even with these bold endeavors laid out, it just scratches the surface of Polestar&#8217;s intentions.</p>
<p>The automaker is shooting to produce a fully carbon neutral car by 2030, but what happens after that? Plotting a course that far into the future is truly sailing into the unknown, and even Polestar admits that time will tell if these efforts will be enough to make a difference. It does have one other goal — to become a fully climate neutral company by 2040 — that will dictate many, if not all, of its choices over the next 18 years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Three themes this weekend, my dear friends. The first is fear, namely <em>market concern. </em>The second is loathing, or my gut reaction to a particular bit of corporate news. And, finally, corporate gifting, a dive into a fascinating startup war. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>Fear</h2>
<p>DocuSign took a gut punch this week, with the e-signature company’s stock price dropping by more than 40% on Friday as I write to you. That’s among the worst post-earnings share-price movements I have ever seen, aside from cases of fraud or other corporate shenanigans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242939" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What happened? DocuSign <a href="https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/DocuSign-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2022-Financial-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beat revenue expectations</a> in its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2022). But the company’s billings — a proxy for future revenue — came in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/docusign-shares-tank-30-amid-revenue-forecast-miss-142636595.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharply under expectations</a>. And the company’s CEO, Dan Springer, said this in its investor letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>After six quarters of accelerated growth, we saw customers return to more normalized buying patterns, resulting in 28% year-over-year billings growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Springer thinks the market is overreacting and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/docu-sign-shares-fall-40-ceo-said-he-is-buying-5-million-worth-of-more-stock-183938500.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intends to buy DocuSign shares next week.</a> Are the markets making too much of what appears to be a return to more regular growth at DocuSign?</p>
<p>Maybe not? I’ve been talking to folks about this since it happened — including my dear friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Miller</a>, who keeps me sane at work — trying to work out if we’re seeing Wall Street impatience or something else. I’m leaning toward the latter.</p>
<p>Per Yahoo Finance data, DocuSign is worth around $27 billion after its huge declines. Or about 12.4x its current run rate. For an already-public tech company showing strong hints at future revenue deceleration, who among us will stand up and say that that is too low?</p>
<p>A lot of folks, but that’s because the general climate for SaaS multiples has been so hot for so long. Not <em>too </em>long ago, DocuSign at 12.4x its present-day run rate after posting billings growth of 28% would have been fine, if not good. So, a return to prior norms could be in the air?</p>
<p>Fear. That’s what I expect to taste if we are seeing multiple compressions among software companies. So very many private-market bets have been placed on the expectation that public valuations for comps would stay high. But after a few awful days for tech stocks more generally this week, the climate in tech could finally be shifting away from a 100% risk weighting toward something more balanced.</p>
<h2>Loathing</h2>
<p>Better.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">pulled three-quarters of a billion dollars from its SPAC debut forward</a>, giving it access to ample funding for its operations. Then it fired a chunk of its staff. The CEO said 15% during a call with the laid-off staffers. Better <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">insists that the number is actually 9%</a>. The discrepancy is wild, given that the CEO was reading from notes and claimed that he had made the call to execute the layoffs. If he made the decision, how did he get the number wrong?</p>
<p>Regardless, here’s a master class in how not to fire a huge stack of your workers:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7GVklRqHRY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>(We’ve preserved a copy of the video, of course, in case that version gets yanked.)</p>
<p>Don’t forget: You are not family at your place of employment. You are an asset that it wants to leverage and derive profit from!</p>
<h2>Corporate gifting</h2>
<p>Turn the clock back to early 2020. In February of that year, right before the turn of the pandemic, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/online-to-offline-platform-sendoso-raises-40m-after-growing-330-in-2019/">covered Sendoso’s $40 million Series B</a>. The company is in the corporate gifting space and has since gone on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/sendoso-nabs-100m-as-its-corporate-gifting-platform-passes-20000-customers/">raise a $100 million Series C</a>.</p>
<p>Separately, an investor I know connected me to another player in Sendoso’s market, Postal.io, or just Postal. The two compete for market share in the <em>send stuff to current and potential customers </em>market, which is, it turns out, huge.</p>
<p>Regular Exchange readers will already be wondering if we didn’t touch on this recently. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/divining-the-real-value-of-my-favorite-fintech-sub-niche/">We did!</a> Back in September, taking a look at Postal and its progress right before Disrupt.</p>
<p>But I’ve since extracted some growth metrics from Postal and Sendoso that I wanted to append to our continuing coverage of the space. Why do we care? Because akin to the OKR software space, or the instant grocery delivery market, there’s an interesting startup cluster to track.</p>
<p>Sendoso and Postal compete with Alyce and Reachdesk, for example, among others. That’s a lot of startup activity for the online-to-offline market channel. And the market is big enough — Sendoso told The Exchange that the “U.S. corporate gifting market is projected to reach $242 billion by the end of this year,” citing Coresight — for several players to grow at once.</p>
<p>Postal was the most free with metrics, sharing that it has seen 70% subscription revenue growth for the last five consecutive quarters. The startup has also seen GMV scale 3,765% from Q3 2020 to Q3 2021, as customers rose from 35 to 286. That’s why it managed to raise capital in September, we figure.</p>
<p>Sendoso was more coy with numbers regarding its recent performance. The startup grew 330% in 2019, recall, but regarding its recent results did not deign to share an updated figure. Instead, Sendoso said that it has 900 customers (north of 20,000 seats at those companies, for detail), and that its warehouses “in North America, Europe and Asia [have] handled upward of 3 million sends in over 165 countries.”</p>
<p>We didn’t get new numbers from Alyce or Reachdesk in time for publication, but if they do share results, we’ll bring them to you next week.</p>
<p>Also like the OKR startup market, there’s variation within the larger theme. In the case of corporate gifting, Postal is building a more digital offering, connecting goods companies to buyers, while Sendoso has a larger IRL footprint including its own physical item aggregation points. We do love to have business cases battle it out in real time.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, however, that intense competition doesn’t leave all parties unscathed. In the OKR market Koan failed to make it to its next fundraising milestone, and Microsoft scooped up one of the startup cohort. In the instant grocery space, 1520 just went kaput. Not that Sendoso or Postal are in danger of running out of cash, but if and when their market does find a point of consolidation will be interesting to see.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today, the age of corporate social justice is dawning. With the business case for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) now more vital than ever, we&#8217;re beginning to see organizations truly embrace social activism.</p>
<p>And while social justice was, rightly, the initial impetus, companies are finally waking up to the business case for diversity initiatives. Recent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research by McKinsey</a> shows that organizations with the most ethnically diverse teams are 36% more likely to financially outperform those with the least. This is because diversity increases revenue, boosts innovation, sparks creativity and leads to better decision-making.</p>
<p>But the truth is, the more diversity you have, the more challenging it can be.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The problem is that business leaders and diversity advocates have failed to consider an approach to diversity that goes beyond &#8220;add diversity and stir.&#8221; Diversity is not a numbers game wherein the solution is to merely increase the numbers of traditionally underrepresented groups in your workforce.</p>
<p>Now, as the world adjusts following the pandemic, it&#8217;s time to stop pretending that outdated diversity programs work. So let&#8217;s explore some of the measures leaders can take to root out bias and subjectivity from the outset, and instead adopt an approach of “radical objectivity” &#8212; combining data and human science to ensure that talent and merit win every time.</p>
<h2>Inclusion is about more than hitting diversity recruiting optics</h2>
<p>Diversity in the workplace starts with an inclusive culture. Unfortunately, many companies get this wrong. This is because diversity is quantitative &#8212; it&#8217;s the extent of heterogeneity within your workforce. On the other hand, inclusion describes the experiences of different individuals in the workforce and the degree to which they&#8217;re invited to participate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Delivering on inclusion, therefore, is about more than hitting diversity recruiting optics. Done right, an inclusive culture should help to foster a sense of belonging and shared values. By arming themselves with data and insight instead of diversity quotas, forward-thinking organizations can create an environment in which individuals of all backgrounds can thrive.</p>
<p>So how do they get there?</p>
<h2>It starts with language</h2>
<p>Diversity initiatives often fail because they land too late in the employee journey to have a lasting impact. Change needs to be embedded in the talent acquisition process, which means evolving the way that you engage with your prospective employees &#8212; starting with language.</p>
<p>The words you choose to bring your business to life will make the difference: Words are influential ambassadors of your workplace&#8217;s culture. Technology and data analysis can help you here, providing robust insights on the messages you&#8217;re sending.</p>
<p>For example, are you using gender-coded or inclusive-coded language to attract inclusion-minded people? Are you taking the time to update your communications regularly to make sure they&#8217;re understanding of different cultural contexts &#8212; not just gender and ethnic but organizational and generational, too?</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just the language that you use in your marketing that matters. Have you considered the words used by your hiring managers and recruiters? At Inbeta, we use technology that enables organizations to move beyond the basics when it comes to inclusion.</p>
<p>For example, we bury specific questions in our recruitment interviews, the answers to which can be linguistically analyzed to understand the genuine values and behaviors of candidates, recruiters and hiring managers. This means you no longer need to rely on simplistic “bias checker” software, which tends to be based on outdated research with few controls on data integrity.</p>
<p>Remember, the best candidates have options. So what will you say that makes them want to work for you?</p>
<h2>Moving past preconceptions</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s also essential to bear in mind that, when it comes to language, it works both ways. When deciding whether to hire someone, we need to move past conceptions of how the ideal candidate should talk. That, too, leads to homogeneity. Technology and training in tandem can help with that.</p>
<p>At Inbeta, we recently partnered with a prominent high-street retailer to recruit a board director and encountered in our search a prominent candidate from a working-class background. However, the initial assumption from their tone and the way they articulated was that they had got to their accomplished position through “grit” and “graft” and lacked the strategic capability required for the new role.</p>
<p>Our linguistic intelligence coupled with human expertise surfaced early on that this was not the case and allowed us to counteract the biases at play. We were able to advocate for the individual and design a bespoke coaching intervention that raised the profile within the process, showcasing objective potential and ensuring they were given an equitable chance. The individual is now in the final stage, despite the disadvantage their socioeconomic background would have otherwise caused them.</p>
<h2>Looking where others wouldn&#8217;t (or couldn&#8217;t)</h2>
<p>Traditional approaches are too static to uncover all the potential that&#8217;s out there.</p>
<p>A standard executive search process will typically entail significant manual desk research reviewing historical databases that are only as up-to-date as the day each CV was written. Failing that, you&#8217;re at the mercy of the headhunter&#8217;s black book of acquaintances &#8212; or perhaps a combination of the two. Either way, the process is far from efficient, let alone equitable.</p>
<p>We use a suite of technologies that allows us to identify “hidden” talent without relying on either approach. We&#8217;re currently working with a leading fashion brand to hire a customer and digital director, for example, and the use of our tools has meant that we&#8217;ve been able to rapidly deliver a long list of 74 high-priority real-time candidates within 48 hours.</p>
<p>This is a potential talent pool that would take more traditional search processes weeks to develop &#8212; and that&#8217;s before validation. Not only are we able to map candidates quickly and efficiently, by leveraging technology, we can independently execute due diligence to quantify these leads: Are they exhibiting typical job-seeking behaviors? What are their cultural drivers? Do they have the desired leadership qualities?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just about speed and efficiency &#8212; although, of course, that&#8217;s a bonus &#8212; this is, crucially, about surfacing candidates that would usually be overlooked in the search process.</p>
<h2>Moving beyond cultural fit</h2>
<p>In tackling unconscious bias, it&#8217;s also worth considering what a truly inclusive approach to talent acquisition looks like. Companies have long hired for “cultural fit,” but there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of bias in these mindsets.</p>
<p>By aiming to hire people whose attributes mesh with the company&#8217;s goals and values, your resulting workplace is one in which everyone looks, thinks and acts alike. Instead, organizations must move away from a practice that aims to mold people to fit their norms.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a recent story that always springs to mind. In the run-up to the pandemic, I was working with a significant multinational retail group to source a group chief digital officer as part of a very high-profile board restructure.</p>
<p>The individual we surfaced had no fashion experience and limited retail experience. Furthermore, their mindset couldn&#8217;t have been further from that of the existing C-suite, meaning they would have been entirely overlooked by the majority of headhunters. But, on the other hand, this individual had outstanding digital expertise, a career spanning innovation across several FTSE100 companies. And on top of all this, they’d been operating as a digital nomad in remote central Africa.</p>
<p>Their technical proficiency, coupled with their incredibly diverse mindset, meant that they were the perfect person to revolutionize a very traditional organization. But they simply wouldn&#8217;t have been identified had we been seeking out somebody who was a so-called “cultural fit.” By getting past the cultural fit default, companies are far more likely to build teams with the diversity of mindset, experience, ethnicities and backgrounds that they claim to be seeking.</p>
<h2>Rewiring the system</h2>
<p>Ultimately, taking a holistic view of diversity means looking beyond numbers; a tick-the-box program doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>
<p>Cultural change is challenging, perhaps even more so when the objective is creating an inclusive culture. But without a concerted effort to change organizational culture and foster inclusion, diversity initiatives are likely to fail.</p>
<p>The easiest way to address this is to re-examine your hiring process with a radically objective approach. Companies today need to leverage technology and data to mitigate implicit bias wherever they can and match that with human touch and cultural intelligence. The route to diversity success is to perpetually listen, adapt and develop.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>About 30 years ago, the political scientist Joseph Nye overturned convention when he suggested that states exert not just “hard” power — i.e., military might — but “soft” power as well. Soft power, Nye wrote is &#8220;when one country gets other countries to want what it wants … in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, soft power is rule by attraction, not by force. Countries with greater cultural, economic, scientific and moral influence, the theory goes, “punch above their weight,” converting that influence into material gains. It encompasses everything that isn’t guns, soldiers or materiel. Queen Elizabeth II is a soft power all-star, as is Rihanna. But so too are Hollywood, sushi, Louis Vuitton and Copacabana Beach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The likes of Broadway, Michael Jordan, Harvard and Starbucks have long made America, a superpower by conventional means, a soft power one as well. But much of American soft power in recent years can be attributed to our technological ingenuity. After all, the biggest names in technology — Amazon, Facebook, Google — are American. The world’s rich almost universally use iPhones; the world’s top firms run on Microsoft Windows. And world leaders from Narendra Modi to the Pope rely on Twitter and Instagram to reach their followers.<br />

<p>The world’s OS, in other words, is American. And that means the majority of the world lives on technology that is based, for the most part, on American values like free speech, privacy, respect for diversity and decentralization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Silicon Valley is perhaps the biggest overseas draw America has. As many as <a href="https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/covid-19-immigrant-tech-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40%</a> of software workers are immigrants. Google, Tesla and Stripe all have immigrant founders. When I attended Stanford a decade ago, I witnessed firsthand the endless march of visiting delegations. Germans, Australians — even Russian President Dmitry Medvedev — all came with some version of the same question: How do we replicate Silicon Valley back home?</p>
<p>American politicians have been right to point to our tech sector as one of America’s best exports. But what happens when it stops being a force for good? Is it possible for soft power to actually go in reverse and <em>detract</em> from a nation’s influence?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After all, the harmful externalities of technology are amply documented — <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59006615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake news</a> in India, a gencoide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ginned up</a> in Myanmar, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/tech-giants-told-to-remove-extremist-content-much-faster/">ISIS propaganda</a> in Britain. Europe has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/europe-tech-digital-tax.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone</a> after tech giants like Apple and Google for dodging taxes and violating privacy while Amazon has come <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/12/uk-must-compel-amazon-to-improve-worker-conditions-say-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under fire</a> in Britain for worker abuses. And tech’s unhealthy impact on children and teens is rightfully coming under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/snap-tiktok-youtube-senate-hearing-congress/">increased scrutiny</a>.</p>
<p>As tech is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">tied</a> more and more to hard power — and as American supremacy relies more and more on Big Tech firms — Washington is left with a conundrum: If, as Nye, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577389923098678842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posited</a> in 2012, “credibility is the scarcest resource,” is America able to separate the increasingly baleful actions (and reputations) of its tech firms from Brand USA?</p>
<p>This whole situation reminds me of the COP26 climate change negotiations that wrapped up last month in Glasgow. Aren’t rich countries, many argue, responsible for the actions of their energy companies? It’s a controversial question, but one thing is certain: Exxon Mobil no longer burnishes America’s image. In fact, as the economic costs of climate change are increasingly priced in, it is more likely a liability than an asset.</p>
<p>Unlike its oil giants, America’s tech industry is not precipitating a civilizational crisis. We generally find their products useful. They have generated massive economic activity. And they do have positive externalities. To take one not-so-hypothetical example, Apple iPhones are now used to record human rights abuses, which are posted on Alphabet’s YouTube and shared on Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>But when American tech firms spread hate or abet violence in other countries, they reflect poorly on the U.S. And if the U.S. is to bask in their glow, it should also take responsibility for their shortcomings, if for no other reason than its own reputation.</p>
<p>Of course there is no shortage of Washington politicians seeking to bring Big Tech to heel. The Biden administration is working hard to coordinate with allies on a great number of regulatory actions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">Congress</a> and agencies like the FCC and FTC are poised to take meaningful antitrust action.</p>
<p>These moves, as well as broader reforms like the recent global corporate <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/g20-leaders-endorse-global-minimum-corporate-tax-deal-2023-start-2021-10-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax deal</a> at the G20, go some way toward ameliorating corporate abuses. But while regulatory efforts rightly focus on protecting American consumers, they should also take some responsibility for the very real lives harmed abroad.</p>
<p>What would that look like? For one, antitrust investigations might examine tech firms’ monopolies in foreign markets. U.S. standards for free speech may not be applicable in blanket fashion, but regulators might nudge American tech firms to apply the same care in serving poor foreign markets as they do at home, starting with more content moderation in foreign languages. They should also consider adopting more locally nuanced rules in foreign markets (while avoiding doing the bidding of whomever is in charge).</p>
<p>Governments should also work more with the tech giants to share intelligence about how their products are used — both organically to ill effect and maliciously by foreign actors. American diplomats on the ground might regularly brief tech executives about the on-the-ground impact of their products and nudge them toward policies that are less harmful. They might require experimentation with more forms of external oversight, as Facebook has done with its Oversight Board. At a minimum, they might proactively work together to ensure American technologies don’t fuel nascent or ongoing crises, as appears to be the case in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/11/1045084676/facebook-is-under-new-scrutiny-for-its-role-in-ethiopias-conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethiopia</a> right now. But the U.S. shouldn&#8217;t shy away from more aggressively using its Entity List to sanction companies involved in human rights abuses.</p>
<p>There is much firms can do on their own proactively as well. LinkedIn, to its credit, stopped doing business in China when faced with increasing censorship on its platform. When pushed, the platform decided that its (liberal) values were too important to sacrifice. Fourteen years after handing over dissidents’ user data to Chinese authorities, Yahoo stopped doing business in China as well. And tech workers should speak up too. Many have objected when their firms work with the Pentagon or other national security agencies; they ought to be as — if not more — critical of work with authoritarian governments.</p>
<p>Tech firms have more power than they think. When they let undemocratic governments get away with outrageous requests like censoring content, spying on dissidents and denying technology to democracy activists, they risk diminishing the magic that makes American tech firms so attractive in the first place. We are all poorer for the self-censorship already practiced by American firms (when was the last time a movie depicted China in a negative light?). Exporting self-censored technology would be exponentially worse.</p>
<p>Tech executives have grown fond in recent years of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/technology/the-phony-patriots-of-silicon-valley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defending</a> their companies (and their monopolies) on patriotic grounds. But when tech errs, it is far more harmful than producing an offensive movie. Policymakers must make clear that if American tech firms expect goodwill from Washington, they should make good on their words and consider how their actions directly harm American interests and values. They must recognize that tech’s reputation is America’s as well.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All founders want their companies to thrive without them, but the readiness to act on that awareness continues to be one of the more uncomfortable conversations within today’s market. After all, the glorification of founders (and our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo/">constant habit of treating them like rockstars)</a> has some validity: Visionaries are intrinsically interesting humans, wild enough to bet that people would <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">sleep in strangers&#8217; homes</a> or come to a <a href="https://twitter.com/home">bird-friendly app</a> to share their unfiltered thoughts every single day.</p>
<p>This tension &#8212; of society both positioning a founder as the figurehead of a startup’s success and realizing that succession is key to the longevity of any business &#8212; is why a few lines within Jack Dorsey’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720">recent Twitter resignation tweet</a> stood out to me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">not sure anyone has heard but,</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242698" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I resigned from Twitter <a href="https://t.co/G5tUkSSxkl">pic.twitter.com/G5tUkSSxkl</a></p>
<p>&mdash; jack<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder-led,&#8217;” Dorsey wrote. “Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I’ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.” Dorsey added that he believes “it’s critical that a company can stand on its own, free of its founder’s influence or direction.”</p>
<p>Dorsey started a conversation that I’ve now been having with founders and investors all week: Removing the idea from the founder’s identity so that the company doesn’t feel innately tied to its creator is healthy for the company. But will require some real conversations on attribution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, I wrote about the importance<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/"> of establishing the difference</a>, both in ownership and incentive, between a founder, a founding team member, an adviser, an investor, an angel investor and an early employee. This week, we need to talk about why it’s important to understand how governance can change over time, and why a founder&#8217;s job title one day might just be “the VP of Nothing.”</p>
<h2>Unlearning the weeds</h2>
<p>“At some point, the founder becomes the VP of nothing,” <a href="https://twitter.com/donutsdidthis">Iris Choi</a>, partner at <a href="https://www.floodgate.com/">Floodgate,</a> said during our latest Equity podcast. “In the beginning you are the head of product, head engineer &#8212; both an individual contributor, as well as the person picking up all the loose ends or filling in the gaps.”</p>
<p>The identity crisis begins when a company gets to the growth stage. Then, founders look less like the scrappy engineer pulling an all-nighter and more like the visionary who is responsible for hiring talent and making sure “the trains are running on time.”</p>
<p>“To a certain extent, you have to let the founder be elevated and not just be in the weeds anymore,” Choi said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fractional co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hellastellah">Stella Han</a> recently went through Y Combinator and raised millions in a seed round. Her business is all about making ownership more accessible to strangers and friends, which means she’s had to have conversations with her co-founder about how to practice that internally as well.</p>
<p>“When you’re a co-founder, you’re very active in the execution of the product, versus being an executive leader, [when] it’s about how well you can empower other people to take the reins and take things into action and have the company grow,” she said. “When you need a conductor for the orchestra, it&#8217;s about communicating that vision and that magic and then having everyone be able to be a team and carry out that whole experience together and deliver it to the audience and the consumers.”</p>
<p>While it’s not controversial to begin building a smart executive team around a brilliant founder as the company scales, it is contrarian to tell the person who thought of an idea that it’s time for them to step down and make room for another acting CEO. In other words, what do you do if you’re not ready to step down or at least away?</p>
<p>Han thinks it comes down to incentive alignment.</p>
<p>​​“Ego is a huge part of a person, and maybe that&#8217;s why they might be doing something that seems right to them but maybe it&#8217;s not for the company overall,” she said, adding that the founder (and any other incoming or existing executives) need to figure out “what is the more holistic bigger-picture incentive that everyone should be aligned on.”</p>
<p>Then, she said, founders need to remove themselves from “being so in the weeds in the heated moment and doing what&#8217;s overall the best.”</p>
<p>Getting more comfortable with decentralizing power within companies will require a broader shift in how investors write checks. Today, having an idea and then getting credit for that idea is an entrepreneur’s most lucrative currency when it comes to pitching a venture capitalist to bet on them. What can replace that incentive?</p>
<h2>Due diligence gets a tweak</h2>
<p>“All businesses want star founders who recruit star teams and turn those into an ecosystem that is the next PayPal Mafia,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/blairsilverberg">Blair Silverberg</a>, the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://humcapital.com/">Hum Capital. </a>“Very few businesses ever achieve this vision. The reason is lack of clarity between what teams do, how those actions produce results for the business, and how the individuals involved can take the ownership for the wins they create with them as they start new or join new businesses.”</p>

<p>Silverberg is describing some of the promises of Web3, which wants to formalize processes so it’s easier to transparently see who owns, and executes, parts of businesses. But, the entrepreneur doesn’t think we have to wait until the school of thought becomes mainstream to see a shift happen.</p>
<p>“The concept of a hedge fund manager having a portable track record is incredible to think about in the context of an operating business,” he said. “If we can create a world where a similar track record exists, we can match society’s capital with talent at the level of people, not just businesses.” And, as we talked about last month, in an ideas economy, proof of who came up with the winning business strategy matters (both legally and financially).</p>
<p>Within the pitch Zoom, though. I think early-stage investors who want to bet on a successful company &#8212; versus a single person &#8212; will need to push co-founders on their ability to hire, change their minds and understand when it’s time to walk away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonia-seth-gokhale-b0906014/detail/photo/">Sonia Gokhale</a>, a GP at early-stage fintech fund <a href="https://www.venturesouq.com/">VentureSouq</a>, said that even when she invests, she’s usually looking for co-founders rather than a single founder, both because it de-risks a company in case of unplanned succession, and it’s helpful to have someone to balance out the other.</p>
<p>“A lot of our founding team spends part of due diligence focused on if the two founders work together well. Is there chemistry between them? Are there synergies? Do we have a gut feeling?” she said. “And if we sense any tension that shows up, that’s a red flag.”</p>

<p>Dorsey’s argument that it is critical for a company to stand on its own may not require forcing every single founder out of their company at some point. Instead, as Sounding Board’s Christine Tao pointed out, it can just be an awareness held by “good leadership.”</p>
<p>“CEOs are just people too &#8212; and while a lot of our identity may get wrapped up in our companies &#8212; we&#8217;re not perfect,” she said. “Companies evolve and change, and may need different leadership at different times.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Internet of Things (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/iot/">IoT</a>) devices — essentially, electronics like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fitness-trackers/">fitness trackers</a> and smart lightbulbs that connect to the internet — are now part of everyday life for most.</p>
<p>However, cybersecurity remains a problem, and according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/kaspersky/">Kaspersky</a>, it’s only getting worse: there were 1.5 billion breaches of IoT devices during the first six months of 2021 alone, according to the antivirus provider, almost double from 639 million for all of 2021. This is largely because security has long been an afterthought for the manufacturers of typically inexpensive devices that continue to ship with guessable or default <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/password/">passwords</a> and insecure third-party components.</p>
<p>In an effort to try to improve the security credentials of consumer IoT devices, the U.K. government this week introduced the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/the-product-security-and-telecommunications-infrastructure-psti-bill-factsheets">Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure bill</a> (PST) in Parliament, legislation that requires IoT manufacturers, importers, and distributors to meet certain cybersecurity standards.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242629" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The bill outlines three key areas of minimum security standards. The first is a ban on universal default passwords — such as &#8220;password&#8221; or &#8220;admin&#8221; — which are often preset in a device’s factory settings and are easily guessable. The second will require manufacturers to provide a public point of contact to make it simpler for anyone to report a security vulnerability. And, the third is that IoT manufacturers will also have to keep customers updated about the minimum amount of time a product will receive vital security updates.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This new cybersecurity regime will be overseen by an as-yet-undesignated regulator, that will have the power to levy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gdpr/">GDPR</a>-style penalties; companies that fail to comply with PSTI could be fined £10 million or 4% of their annual revenue, as well as up to £20,000 a day in the case of an ongoing contravention.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the PSTI bill sounds like a step in the right direction, and the ban on default passwords especially has been widely commended by the cybersecurity industry as a “common sense” measure.</p>
<p>“Basic cyber hygiene, such as changing default passwords, can go a long way to improving the security for these types of devices, Rodolphe Harand, managing director at YesWeHack, tells TechCrunch. “With a new unique password needing to be provided by manufacturers, this will essentially offer an additional layer of protection.”</p>
<p>But others say the measures — particularly the ban on easy-to-guess passwords — haven&#8217;t been thought through, and could potentially create new opportunities for threat actors to exploit.</p>
<p>“Stopping default passwords is laudable, but if each device has a private password, then who is responsible for managing this?&#8221; said Matt Middleton-Leal, managing director at Qualys. &#8220;It’s common for end-users to forget their own passwords, so if the device needed repair, how would the specialist gain access? This is dangerous territory where manufacturers may have to provide super-user accounts or backdoor access.”</p>
<p>Middleton-Leal, along with others in the industry, are also concerned about the PSTI bill’s mandatory product vulnerability disclosure. While sensible in principle, since it ensures security researchers can contact the manufacturers privately to warn of flaws and bugs so they can be fixed — there’s nothing in the bill that requires bugs to be fixed before they are disclosed.</p>
<p>“If anything, this increases risk when the vulnerability becomes common knowledge, as bad actors then have a red flag to focus their efforts upon and find ways to exploit it,” Middleton-Leal added.</p>
<p>John Goodacre, director of UKRI’s Digital Security by Design, agrees that this mandate is flawed, telling TechCrunch: “The policy accepts that vulnerabilities can still exist in even the best-protected consumer technologies with security researchers regularly identifying security flaws in products. In today&#8217;s world, we can only continue to patch these vulnerabilities once they are found, putting a plaster over the wound once damage may have already been done. Further initiatives are needed for the technology to block such wounds from happening at the foundational level.”</p>
<p>The third key area outlined in the bill, which details how long devices will receive security updates, is also under fire for fears that it could encourage manufacturers to discount prices once a device nears end-of-life, which could incentivize consumers to buy devices that will soon be without security support.</p>
<p>Some believe the U.K. government isn’t acting fast enough. The bill — which does not consider vehicles, smart meters, medical devices, and desktop or laptop computers that connect to the internet — has given IoT manufacturers 12 months to change their working practices, which means that for the next year, many will continue to churn out inexpensive devices that might not adhere to the most basic of security standards.</p>
<p>“Manufacturers will likely continue to regard speed to market as a priority over device security, believing that this is the primary consideration for maintaining profits,&#8221; Kim Bromley, a senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/09/digital-shadows-gets-14m-to-keep-growing-its-digital-risk-scanning-service/">Digital Shadows</a>, tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bromley also believes that the U.K. will struggle to enforce these regulations against manufacturers based in mainland China (PRC). “Some PRC-based manufacturers release products that are cheaper than other products on the market, and therefore users will continue to buy products that may contain security flaws, or at the very least, do not comply with UK legislation,” said Bromley. “The new requirements will also place huge burdens on UK resellers that may use PRC manufactured products on their own; keeping pace with the requirements and changing working practices could prove difficult.”</p>
<p>The solution, however, remains unclear, though cybersecurity experts seem to universally agree that the U.K. government needs to be flexible in its approach to IoT security, and ensure it doesn&#8217;t fall into the common trap of looking only at the past and the present, instead of the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both attackers and, sadly, unscrupulous manufacturers and vendors, are endlessly creative,&#8221; says Amanda Finch, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Information Security (CIISec). &#8220;There will inevitably be new avenues of attack that circumvent the demands of the bill, and new vulnerabilities created by lazy manufacturers. As such, this bill has to be seen as one step in an endless process of review and refinement, rather than an end in itself.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not for the first time, SoftBank is having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. Indeed, even while the Japanese conglomerate is known for its extremes &#8212; be it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-gains-coupang/softbank-reaps-33-billion-coupang-windfall-idUSKBN2B32QV">bold</a> bets, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-rajeev-misra-used-campaign-of-sabotage-to-hobble-internal-rivals-11582743294">internal</a> squabbles, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-turns-away-from-softbank-and-its-founder-masayoshi-son-11624021118">soured</a> business <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-adam-neumann-masa-son-cult-of-we-11626474657">relationships</a>, or its ability to repeatedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-reports-highest-ever-annual-profit-for-a-japanese-company-11620803131">bounce back</a> from the brink &#8212; some newer developments could prove particularly hard, if not impossible, to overcome.</p>
<p>The worst of these, seemingly, is the lawsuit filed yesterday by the Federal Trade Commission to block chipmaker Nvidia&#8217;s acquisition of Arm, the British company that licenses chip technology, out of stated concern that the deal would give Nvidia too much control over computing technology.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow’s technologies depend on preserving today’s competitive, cutting-edge chip markets,” Holly Vedova, the director of the agency&#8217;s competition bureau, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger">said in a related statement</a>. “This proposed deal would distort Arm’s incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia’s rivals.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242989" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The problem for SoftBank? A scuttled deal could means tens of billions of dollars to the outfit, which acquired the now 21-year-old Arm in July 2016 for $32 billion before selling it to Nvidia in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $40 billion. It&#8217;s even worse than it sounds. Nvidia&#8217;s share price has continued to rise so fast that, as Bloomberg noted earlier today, that $40 billion deal has since ballooned into a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/softbank-poised-to-lose-74-billion-payday-if-arm-deal-is-halted?sref=gni836kR">$74 billion deal</a>.</p>
<p>It might not be a complete disaster for SoftBank. The deal has expected to receive regulatory scrutiny from the moment it was announced, so SoftBank might already have factored in this very likely possibility. Nvidia also says it will contest the FTC lawsuit (though it seems unlikely to win against the agency). Besides, all things chip-related are much in demand at the moment.</p>
<p>Still, it isn&#8217;t clear what Arm would be worth to another buyer. Meanwhile, if SoftBank decides to take the outfit public instead, it could be worth closer to half what Nvidia paid for it, estimates Bloomberg, based on the average market-capitalization-to-sales ratio of 9.9 times that members of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index currently enjoy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, SoftBank is also in danger of losing a key lieutenant over compensation. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/softbank-poised-to-lose-74-billion-payday-if-arm-deal-is-halted?sref=gni836kR">New York Times story</a> published this afternoon, Marcelo Claure, who is SoftBank&#8217;s chief operating officer and is widely believed to be the right-hand man to SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, has been locked in a protracted battle with the company over his compensation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, according to four people who spoke with the Times, he&#8217;s apparently prepared to leave SoftBank if he doesn&#8217;t get what he wants, which is $2 billion in compensation over the next several years. SoftBank is apparently thinking more along tens of millions of dollars at most instead.</p>
<p>Asked for more information, a SoftBank spokesperson sent us the following statement: &#8220;Softbank and Marcelo Claure are actively engaged in discussions about his role at the company and his compensation. Marcelo is an important executive at Softbank who has helped with many important initiatives since joining us in 2017. SoftBank does not intend to comment further on this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be a major loss to SoftBank. Claure wears many hats for the company. He was WeWork&#8217;s interim CEO after it pushed out Adam Neumann for example, and helped recruit current CEO Sandeep Mathrani. Claure is also at the top of two other org charts: its diversity-focused SoftBank Opportunity Fund and its SoftBank Latin America Fund vehicles, which are responsible for most of the firm&#8217;s outsize bets these days. (We talked with Claure about SoftBank&#8217;s aggressive LatAm strategy at Disrupt in September; see below.)</p>
<p>Claure would also be among the highest profile in a very long string of departures from the firm. Earlier this month, Bloomberg noted that SoftBank&#8217;s &#8220;eccentric&#8221; approach to compensation &#8212; it pays far less than similar-size rivals &#8212; has helped precipitate the resignations of seven managing partners since March of last year, with its only senior managing partner, Deep Nishar, announcing last week that he is joining General Catalyst as a managing director.</p>
<p>SoftBank has recovered from worse, but it seems particularly vulnerable at the moment. Just last week, Son revealed that SoftBank Group has lost more than $50 billion owing to Beijing’s tech crackdown and its shares are down sharply. With these two newer and very public developments, it&#8217;s going to be that much harder to boost investor confidence in the company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Systemic racism is nothing new in America, and the effects of unconscious racial bias have long created inequity in the workplace. So why &#8212; when presented with the task of developing new “normal” hybrid workplaces &#8212; are we allowing the same systemic problems that boxed generations of Black and brown people out of the workforce to exist?</p>
<p>We must bravely confront this problem with whatever tools are available to us now while we still have a once-in-a-generation chance to shape the foundation of what is being built.</p>
<p>Statistics help tell the story of stark disparities in the economic status of Black and white families. The typical Black household earns only 57 cents on the dollar made by white families, and the median wealth of Black families is just $17,000 &#8212; compared with $171,000 for white families. Black families also suffer from lower annual incomes, making about $29,000 less a year, on average, than their white counterparts. Their children are three times as likely to grow up in poverty and stay poor throughout their lifetimes. There’s also a dismal wealth gap in homeownership: Only 42% of Black families own their homes, compared with 73% of white families.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242728" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I recently shared this data with lawmakers serving on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion. The hearing, “The Legacy of George Floyd: An Examination of Financial Services Commitments to Economic and Racial Justice,” specifically addressed the negative economic impact of systemic racism in the financial services industry. Everything from biased lending practices to an imbalance in the distribution of philanthropic dollars has massive economic ramifications.</p>
<p>Equity cannot be fully achieved by simply donating money to external partners, such as my organization, the National Urban League. While I’m the first to say the league and many of my colleagues in the field are doing great work, too many companies are relying on us alone to change the world.</p>
<p>Actions speak. Entrepreneurs need to help get their employees into proven training programs that show the true impact of their unconscious biases. Startups must look inward and ensure their organizations are diverse, inclusive and equitable places for both employees and their customers.</p>
<p>But this requires internal work. And in certain cases, external voices. We have already seen companies like Comcast NBCUniversal, Charter Communications and T-Mobile create external diversity and inclusion councils with independent leaders to advise and help drive common objectives forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) isn’t just the right and moral thing for entrepreneurs to do. It also makes economic sense. Companies that stress internal diversity are more profitable, as they can successfully appeal to more diverse markets. Ethnically diverse companies are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">36% more likely</a> to outperform companies with less diversity.</p>
<p>To be sure, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and profoundly altered many aspects of work life, including in-person diversity training and workforce development.</p>
<p>As more workplaces move to a hybrid model of remote and in-person work, this is the time to take DEI off the back burner and rethink inclusion programs to incorporate leading-edge technology to reach employees wherever they are.</p>
<p>Companies must start now. But there’s no need to start from scratch. The resources already exist, and there is a wealth of external partners that can help improve corporate culture and diversity metrics. With a deep and nuanced understanding of the issues at hand, civil rights organizations are uniquely poised to support corporate DEI management by providing strategic advisory services, executive coaching, DEI subject matter expertise, and DEI strategy development and planning. For instance, we have the lessons we’ve learned over our 111 years working to connect diverse communities to opportunities, and we integrate these lessons with new tech advancements to advise our partners.</p>
<p>Accordingly, groups like the National Urban League have successfully collaborated with public and private partners on the issues of diversity, inclusion, fair employment, equity and parity. Although these conversations can sometimes be difficult, companies who are intentional in addressing these issues must do so head-on.</p>
<p>Here are some ways founders can usher in a more inclusive startup culture in a hybrid work environment.</p>
<h2>VR training programs</h2>
<p>Virtual reality technology is one of the newest additions to the DEI training toolbox to facilitate having those sometimes difficult discussions. Virtual reality scenarios can be used to train a large group of people in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p>By donning a VR headset, individuals can participate in an immersive training experience where they can engage in a conversation about race and inherent bias without fear of judgment or reprisals.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.mothandflamevr.com/">Moth+Flame</a>, a Brooklyn-based virtual reality developer and production studio, has already developed successful DEI programs for the U.S. Air Force and Accenture, where users enter a simulated real-world environment to practice tough conversations using their own voice. This innovative technology offers a deep level of immersion that creates a long-lasting emotional impact for employees.</p>
<p>The beauty of VR is that it lends itself well to in-person situations and can also be used effectively with remote employees. In a hybrid workplace, VR ensures all employees walk away with a consistent training experience &#8212; regardless of their location.</p>
<h2>Professional and workforce development programs</h2>
<p>Programs can be developed for America’s startups to connect recruiting teams to historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions. These programs include supported and hosted online job boards, career fairs and workforce development initiatives.</p>
<p>But just getting diverse faces in the door isn’t enough — that’s only diversity. Founders need to invest in their employees of color by allowing them to participate in professional development programs to create the next generation of executives — that’s equity. This is even more critical with a dispersed workforce as a divide in the employee experience can become more pronounced when some groups work in the office and some remain remote. Workers can feel left out, lonely or just out of the loop. Professional development programs encourage employee engagement and signal the company is investing in their personal and professional growth despite where they are located — that’s inclusion.</p>
<h2>Supplier diversity</h2>
<p>The return to some level of in-office activities also comes with the return of relying on suppliers — like travel agents, catering vendors, event production companies and more. As companies look for new suppliers to build out their new hybrid work environments, they should be working now to create a framework for establishing a diverse supplier network, vetting current vendors and sourcing new vendors.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, many companies consistently list difficulty in locating diverse suppliers as the chief impediment to furthering such diversity. To remedy the problem, <a href="https://bidconnectusa.com/">BidConnect USA</a> created a centralized business network platform that connects companies and government agencies with small businesses, aggregates online events and creates a tool to foster ethical practices and economic inclusion.</p>
<h2>Recognizing, assessing, measuring</h2>
<p>Without employees coming together in the same office day in and day out, it can be harder for staff to feel when progress is made toward positive company cultural change. That’s where numbers and accountability come into play.</p>
<p>Startups must transparently determine which metrics they want to incorporate to measure diversity within their organization. With equity being a higher priority than ever for employees, consumers, investors and activists, there have never been greater risks and costs for lagging or greater rewards and benefits for leading.</p>
<p><a href="https://mlt.org/">Management Leadership for Tomorrow</a>’s (MLT) Black Equity at Work Certification Program enables employers that embrace rigorous action to minimize downside and maximize upside by assuring major, sustained Black equity progress and providing valuable recognition.</p>
<p>The MLT program isn’t another pledge, index or disclosure push. It’s a unique, affordably priced improvement system that includes a meticulously developed scoring rubric that quantifies overall Black equity progress; planning resources and support that enable employers to chart their own path on their timeline; an array of valuable services that ensure and accelerate results; and a high degree of trust and guarantee of strict confidentiality. Socializing tangible data to measure progress toward diversity goes a long way toward shaping company culture.</p>
<p>Achieving full racial equity and inclusion won’t be easy. It requires the firm commitment of all sectors of our civil society. Government entities, startups, private and public companies, and nonprofits alike need to ask themselves uncomfortable questions, address inequities head-on, and resolve to change practices and policies so that all people have equal opportunities to live full and prosperous lives. With the right programs in the hands of dedicated employees, we might just get there a little faster.</p>
