										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic announced yesterday that its next augmented reality mobile game will be <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/pikminbloom/?hl=en">Pikmin Bloom</a>, a collaboration with Nintendo. The free game is available now for iOS and Android in Singapore and Australia, but will roll out globally in the coming days.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZeIQEZIPv8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Like Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom will encourage players to get outside and explore their neighborhoods. Only now, instead of catching Pidgey and Rattata, you&#8217;ll collect seedlings and create a squad of Pikmin. The more you walk, the more Pikmin you&#8217;ll collect. These plant-animal hybrid creatures come from Nintendo&#8217;s strategy and puzzle game franchise of the same name.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225271" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Pikmin Bloom marks the sixth installment in the Pikmin video game series. There are many different types of Pikmin to interact with, and as you walk alongside them, you&#8217;ll leave augmented reality trails of flowers behind you. According to in-game footage in the announcement video (seen above), it looks like you can customize your avatar as a Mii.</p>
<p>Another feature that borrows from Pokémon Go is Pikmin Bloom&#8217;s monthly Community Day events. In the former, players are lured outdoors with special bonuses and rare featured Pokémon once per month, encouraging people to get outside and befriend fellow players. Niantic hasn&#8217;t released details, but the company said that it will host monthly Community Day events for Pikmin as well to plant and play together.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Pokémon Go has a weekly pop-up on Monday mornings that shows you how far you&#8217;ve walked that week. But Pikmin seems more specifically geared toward encouraging movement, showing the routes you walked and the steps you took at the end of every day.</p>
<p>The last time the two companies released a game together, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/pokemon-go-and-the-april-fools-joke-that-made-billions/">shattered expectations</a> &#8212; so, no pressure to our floral friends. Even if Pokémon Go doesn&#8217;t feel as ubiquitous as it did in summer 2016, it&#8217;s making Niantic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/after-community-backlash-pokemon-go-reinstates-a-covid-safety-and-accessibility-feature/">more money than ever</a>, netting over $1 billion in 2020. But it doesn&#8217;t quite seem like there&#8217;s as much to do yet in Pikmin Bloom as there is in Pokémon Go or Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. So, this game might be geared toward a more casual crowd who just want to see some pretty pixels while they walk &#8212; no shiny-hunting and raid battle coordination here&#8230;at least not yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vistaprint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vistaprint</a>, has built a name for itself in providing printing and marketing services for consumers, sole traders and small businesses, is making a pair of acquisitions as it looks for better ways to square up to the opportunity to serve SMBs with digital services. The company is acquiring online graphic design editor <a href="https://crello.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crello</a>, and an online graphic design editor that competes against Canva, and its parent company, stock photo repository <a href="https://depositphotos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Despositphotos</a>, for a total price of $85 million.</p>
<p>Along with the acquisitions, Vistaprint is rebranding as just &#8220;Vista&#8221; and will be launching a new service powered by Crello called VistaCreate.</p>
<p>The moves come as part of a wider $250 million investment that Vista, which is currently based in Ireland and is part of publicly-traded Cimpress (and which has a number of other design brands under its umbrella), has been making into reviving and updating its platform and brand, which also included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/printing-giant-vistaprint-acquires-99designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying 99designs</a>, a marketplace to source designers and their work, a year ago. It also recently linked a partnership with Wix to enable tighter integrations between its services and Wix&#8217;s website building services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225203" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The plan is not to move away from print, but to augment it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our north star is to be a partner for SMBs in digital print and design,&#8221; said Florian Baumgartner, EVP and president, international, of Vista, in an interview this week. Vista does not disclose how many customers it has currently except to note that it is in the &#8220;millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crello, based out of Cyprus, appeared to be a bootstrapped company, but it had grown to a substantial size since being founded in 2017. The company also has &#8220;millions&#8221; of customers, and more specifically it added 3 million this year alone, spanning some 150 countries, and its users create more than 1 million projects each month.</p>
<p>Depositphotos does not disclose its user numbers but says that it holds some 220 million royalty-free photos and other graphics created by some 100,000 contributors. The company is based out of New York and had raised just under $6 million, with investors including TMT Investments in London.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Canva, now valued at $40 billion, is the big elephant in the room for companies like Vista longer term. The company has the capital, and the firepower, to build new products on a newer platform to address the needs of modern businesses. (Its latest frontier: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/canva-is-getting-into-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video</a>.)</p>
<p>That does not rule out more incumbent players creating a new playing field for themselves by consolidating disparate design services on to their own platforms, however.</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Vadim Nekhai, who had been the CEO of Despositphotos, is taking on a new role as VP of VistaCreate and believes there is life yet left in the incumbent.</p>
<p>“Over twenty years ago, VistaPrint invented online design and publishing tools for print marketing materials to empower small businesses to create attractive designs without having to learn complex software,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;VistaCreate brings the same simplicity to social media and other forms of digital design and Depositphotos brings a vast library of high-quality imagery, videos and music. We look forward to being part of the Vista team as we continue to innovate together to help small businesses look and feel professional both online and offline.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to correct that Vista is not Dutch, but Irish.</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Mergers and acquisitions activity is at an all-time high — global mergers and acquisitions have already broken 2020 levels with about $4.4 trillion worth of deals as of October 2021. So how can startups, especially early-stage startups, get in on the action?</p>
<p>The answer is a growth strategy that takes both inorganic and organic growth into account, never relying on one more than the other. In my role as a growth equity expert and venture capital investor for more than 20 years, I’ve seen companies leverage these different kinds of growth to their advantage — and their downfall.</p>
<p>Essentially, businesses can grow in two ways: Organic and inorganic. For our purposes, organic growth refers to internal efforts to increase revenue, like speeding up output, expanding product offerings, building infrastructure and customers, and hiring staff. Inorganic growth is driven by mergers with or acquisitions by other companies or joint ventures.</p>
<p>Organic growth tends to be slower, whereas inorganic growth often acts as a booster shot, propelling companies forward. Startups are currently harnessing both to drive innovation and market growth, but not all growth is created equal, and one is not mutually exclusive from the other.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Gone are the days (mostly) where a significant portion of acquisitions failed, but that mindset still clouds our perception of deals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Inorganic growth has traditionally been a strategy to accelerate the development of businesses in slower-growth industries, like media companies. For more software-focused firms, the new technology or customers acquired via a merger or acquisition helps it leapfrog its competitors. It is essential for founders and CEOs to understand exactly when inorganic growth makes sense in the current glut of M&amp;A activity, and how to take a thoughtful, balanced approach to growing your business sustainably.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biotech startup <a href="https://www.immunai.com/">Immunai</a> has been on a roll when it comes to funding. The company that set out to create an atlas of the human immune system </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/immunai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had raised about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/immunai-raises-60m-as-it-expands-from-improving-immune-therapies-to-discovering-new-ones-too/">$80 million by February 2021</a>. On Wednesday, the company announced another significantly larger round: a $215 million series B. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immunai has been building a massive dataset of clinical immunological information. It combines genetic information, along with other data like epigenetic changes or proteomics (the study of proteins), to map out how the immune system functions. Then machine learning is applied to identify what targets might be useful for drugmakers, what drugs might cause toxic reactions, and ultimately predict how a patient might respond to a potential treatment. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/immunai-gets-series-a-funding-for-genomics-database-advancements/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immunai claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this dataset, called the Annotated Multi-omic Immune Cell Atlas, AMICA, is the largest in the world.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224911" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round, which was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies, with participation from Talos VC, 8VC, Alexandria Venture Investments, Piedmont, ICON, and others, brings the company’s total funding to $295 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noam Solomon, Immunai’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch this massive jump in funding comes down to a major change in the type of insights AMICA has yielded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform is currently being used to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1074-2">develop and refine</a> cell therapies for neuroblastoma in conjunction with the Baylor College of Medicine. Solomon also says the company is working to publish a paper showing it can identify specific gene targets that tell whether a patient will respond to certain therapies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Solomon says, the company has been able to move from simply showing correlative data to causative data. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Probably a year ago we were showing strong correlative data – that certain insights we have can explain relationships between certain genes and cells,” he says. “Today we have more causal inference results. We are able to show that things we are doing with our functional genomic platform are actually causing certain results.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be clear: Immunai <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/nfx-backed-pepper-bio-emerges-from-stealth-with-tools-to-hone-in-on-complex-diseases/">is far from the only company</a> looking to harness cell-level data, and put it into action. There are plenty of companies, large and small, playing in the same space. Immunai stands apart, per Solomon, for two reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First is the sheer </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">size</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the dataset Immunai is building. Immunai has been collaborating with over 30 companies and academic institutions (Memorial Sloan Kettering, Harvard, Stanford, and the Baylor College of Medicine, to name a few). But the company has also diversified the types of biological data it&#8217;s collecting, analyzing and managing through two major acquisitions this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Immunai acquired </span><a href="https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=271957"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropprint Genomics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company working on methods to perform single-cell sequencing at scale for an undisclosed amount. Solomon adds Dropprint had made “interesting progress on autoimmunity.&#8221; Over  he summer, Immunai </span><a href="https://www.immunai.com/press/gen-nebion-news"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nebion, a Swiss company that had spent 13 years building gene expression datasets. They also had about 70 external partnerships with hospitals and institutions, notes Solomon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both acquisitions “really accelerated the size of the database,&#8221; says Solomon. However, M&amp;A strategy remains to acquire complementary technologies. Immunai’s data acquisition strategy, going forward, is still largely built on creating more partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second reason Solomon believes Immunai stands out comes down to its handling of all this information. Solomon calls Immunai an engineering-first company, because he’s just as interested in building the infrastructure to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">support </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the dataset as it is about the data itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also why, he notes, about 50 percent of the company’s 120-person workforce is coming from pure tech or engineering backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there are very few companies in the space that are trying to do more than create a small dataset and apply sophisticated machine learning tools,” he says. “Our approach is the opposite. We believe we need to build a robust database that we will be able to feed and grow, with the data engineering tools to make sure that our algorithms can run on 100,000 samples.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round will be used to bring in more employees and to keep enriching the immunological dataset (and backend infrastructure that can support it) at the company’s disposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a business perspective, it also means the company is less dependent on up-front payments with future partners. The new financing shifts the company’s focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have a reliance on stronger upfront payments. We care much more about success-based payments,” Solomon said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tokyo space startup <a href="https://gitai.tech/en/">Gitai Japan</a> successfully conducted a technology demonstration of its autonomous robotic arm inside the International Space Station last week, a key milestone as the company prepares to provide robotics as a service in space.</p>
<p>The S1 robotic arm performed two tasks: operating cables and switches, and assembling structures and panels. These tasks – common crew activities – can be used in a general-purpose way for a range of in-space activities. The successful demo raised what NASA calls the “technology readiness level” of the Gitai robot to TRL 7. There are 9 TRLs in total, and hitting all of them will be critical for Gitai commercializing its robots.</p>
<p>The demonstration was performed inside space company Nanoracks’ Bishop Airlock, the world’s first (and only) commercial airlock to be attached to the exterior of the station. Nanoracks – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">which announced plans last week to launch a fully private commercial space station with Voyage Space and Lockheed Martin</a> – also furnished on-orbit operations, data downlink and the launch opportunity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225207" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gitai’s robotic arm was sent to orbit aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, part of the launch company’s 23<sup>rd</sup> Commercial Resupply Services Mission at the end of August. The Japanese startup is developing robots for a range of general purposes in space, including on-orbit servicing of spacecraft, construction, or manufacturing tasks. The next step for the company is to test the Gitai robot outside the ISS.</p>
<p>“The success of this investigation proves that the GITAI robot can be a solution for space agencies and commercial space companies looking for versatile, dexterous, relatively safe (less exposure to life threatening risks for humans), and inexpensive labor force,” NASA said in a tech demo update. “Providing this option furthers the goals of commercialization of space.”</p>
<p>Gitai doesn’t want to just build robotic arms, however. The company’s long-term vision sees robots as key tools for building space colonies, on the surface of the moon or even Mars. This robotic workforce could be the answer to accelerating human presence in off-world environments. Earlier this year, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/space-startup-gitai-raises-17-1m-to-help-build-the-robotic-workforce-of-commercial-space/">closed a $17.1 million Series B</a> funding round, to hire and accelerate the development of a separate satellite servicing tech demo set to take place in 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ro.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ro</a>, one of the most valuable privately owned health tech startups, isn’t subtle about its mission to deliver vertically integrated, affordable healthcare with consumers in mind.</p>
<p>And while a patient-centric healthcare system is undoubtedly overdue, Ro is first dealing with a massive challenge: its own inability to monetize meaningfully outside of Roman, its erectile dysfunction vertical. Stagnating ARR, and Ro’s need to grow into its recently-landed<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2021/03/22/digital-health-startup-ro-raised-500-million-at-5-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $5 billion valuation,</a> has created an environment for employees that paints a picture of a company struggling to find new avenues of growth and integrations of acquisitions.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to ten current and former Ro employees on the condition of anonymity, due to fear of retaliation or of impact on future employment, about the work environment at Ro. These employees detailed a low-morale work environment, due in part to the way that leadership sets frantic strategy and refuses basic feedback. They say tensions have led to employee churn across all teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224492" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to LinkedIn, there have been several departures across all departments over the past few months, including high-profile positions like head of data, head of partnerships and head of product management. Eight people out of Ro’s 11-person customer service operations team have quit due to culture, the majority leaving after only being at the company for five months, employees say.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">After contacting Ro for comment, TechCrunch obtained a company-wide e-mail that Ro sent to staff about this article, saying that it “aims to paint Ro in a negative light.” The email prompted </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">more staff to reach out to TechCrunch, also on condition of anonymity, to confirm their experience of Ro’s troubling environment.</span></p>
<p>“Every time I’m stressed out about work, I come back to the same realization: we’re selling dick pills, we’re not curing cancer, we’re not becoming a patient’s first call,” a current employee told TechCrunch. “[Erectile dysfunction] is where we make all our money.”</p>
<h2><strong>‘Everything was going towards Roman’ </strong></h2>
<p>Ro started out by selling erectile dysfunction medication to men. Founder Zachariah Reitano, who goes by Z, launched the company after firsthand dealing with the broken and stigmatized ED patient experience. Four years later, Reitano, along with co-founders Saman Rahmanian and Robert Schutz, have grown the company&#8217;s ambitions rapidly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the years, Ro has launched a number of different services, including Rory, a digital health clinic for women; Zero, a smoking cessation treatment service; Ro Pharmacy, which offers low prices on generic medications; and more nascent products like Ro Skincare and a health guide to beat WebMD.</p>
<p>Investors have taken notice. The health tech unicorn has raised nearly $900 million in venture capital to date, attracting top-tier venture capital firms, including Dragoneer Investment Group, SignalFire, FirstMark, General Catalyst and Initialized Capital. Ro’s most recent round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/ro-raises-500m-to-grow-its-remote-and-in-home-primary-care-platform/">a $500 million Series D</a>, triggered an acquisition spree: In less than a year, the company has acquired Workpath, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/ro-buys-kit-a-17-month-old-startup-that-offers-at-home-health-testing/">Kit</a> and, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Modern Fertility.</a> It’s even <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-roman-health-m-a/telehealth-company-ro-explores-deal-to-go-public-sources-idUSKBN29W30R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploring a potential IPO</a>.</p>
<p>While Ro has expanded its product lineup and wooed ready investors, several former and current employees paint a different picture. Roman, Ro’s erectile dysfunction vertical, is the core of Ro’s business, they say, which puts the company in an uncomfortable spot where it is overly reliant on Viagra, an out-of-patent generic drug that is facing race-to-the-bottom competition from other providers. The company’s overall ARR has flattened at a time when much of health tech has skyrocketed in the wake of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Ro denied this, saying that ARR is currently greater at $300 million and has not stagnated, but didn’t give a time frame or further details. Employees, meanwhile, say they were told that the sputtering ARR growth was because of Ro’s investment in acquisitions and hiring, not lack of success — <a href="https://www.hingehealth.com/hinge-health-raises-series-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even as other health tech companies</a> touted growing revenue. Hims &amp; Hers, Ro’s closest competitor, said in its Q2 earnings that revenue climbed <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005825/en/Hims-Hers-Health-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">69% year over year.</a></p>
<p>Ro has not yet been able to successfully make meaningful money beyond its erectile dysfunction drug, which accounts for a significant — some say up to half — of Ro’s revenue. No other Ro product has ever come close to that initial success. Ro confirmed that Roman constitutes half of its revenue, but said that non-Roman has grown more than 130% year over year, without specifics.</p>
<p>“If you look at all of the marketing spend, everything was going towards Roman,” said a former employee. Ro denies this, claiming that over 20% of its marketing spend year to date was dedicated to non-Roman brands. Put differently, it confirmed that close to 80% of marketing spend was dedicated to Roman.</p>
<p>This tension trickled down to how Ro prioritized new business verticals, which employees say it knew it needed but simultaneously didn’t put money behind.</p>
<p>“I noticed this pattern of leaders being very hyper focused, very hyper vigilant on a launch, getting a team together, and then not hearing about that launch later,” the employee continued. “But I also took it as, Ro was in telehealth and there are a lot of barriers and hoops that need to happen in order for a launch to be successful.”</p>
<h2><strong>‘We want to jack the valuation of this company up ASAP so we can IPO soon’</strong></h2>
<p>As Ro has tried to expand beyond its one-hit wonder, a former employee says the resulting “identity crisis” has created a culture of launch fast, fail fast for new product lines, which hurts consumers and employee morale.</p>
<p>“Everything we launched [in 2020] was a complete failure,” a former employee said. “As they started to get these funding rounds, you would burn yourself out for a month, you launch it, and it would do nothing because there’s a fancy article and complete failure.”</p>
<p>One employee said that Ro’s at-home COVID-19 tests, which had a landing page and still has an active waiting list, never officially launched, thanks to pushback from Ro’s medical team. Business Insider wrote <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/digital-health-startup-ro-future-relies-on-testing-2021-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about the early efforts.</a> Ro confirmed that no tests have been sold, because they are yet to be approved by the FDA.</p>
<p>Employees say that other projects that have struggled are Ro Pharmacy, a mail order pharmacy for generic medications. Ro has been vocal about a recent push into operating its own pharmacies. In a previous interview, Reitano told TechCrunch, that the company will have 10 pharmacies by the end of 2021 and 15 by the end of 2022. Internally, the growth metrics for Ro’s pharmacy efforts have stopped being reported to the entire staff.</p>
<p>Another vertical that has struggled is Ro Skincare, <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/ro-dips-skincare-new-prescription-dermatology-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a prescription dermatology line</a> that was launched in May 2020 but has seen little adoption. Ro’s weight management service, Plenity, hasn’t been shut down, but similarly is struggling to get customers to stick to the product.</p>
<p>Ro denies these struggles, claiming that all three verticals will do “tens of millions of dollars in revenue in 2021” and none have been sunsetted. The company added that Plenity is growing 1,500% year over year, but it’s unclear what metrics or benchmarks are being used since <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/north-america/ro-launch-new-weight-management-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that product’s 2019 launch.</a></p>
<p>A current employee says that Zero, Ro’s smoking cessation product, has been shut down for two years and has no employees staffed on the project. Ro denied this, saying that Zero is still available on <a href="http://quitwithzero.com/">QuitWithZero.com</a> and through Roman and Rory.</p>
<p>Over the past year, rapid acquisitions have only added to the growing chaos.</p>
<p>“Each acquisition felt like it came out of nowhere,” a recently resigned employee interviewed by TechCrunch, said. “We’ve never really integrated with any of our companies that we’ve acquired; so what are we doing this for? The focus [of the company] would shift a lot because of these acquisitions, and, leaders would say ‘this is a growth company, that’s what happens.’”</p>
<p>Some employees started to feel like the deals were just a smokescreen, done for publicity as long-time products within Ro’s suite of services were struggling. Leadership felt focused on marketing the products before they were even integrated into the platform. “Packaging is packaging, are we actually delivering something people want?” the employee continued.</p>
<p>Another employee told TechCrunch that Workpath, which was acquired in December 2020 for its home-based care services, was used for Ro’s in-home vaccination service and then tossed aside.</p>
<p>Some interviewees say that Modern Fertility, a reproductive health company, felt like an acquisition “for optics” than for actual change, given the fact that Rory, Ro’s vertical for women’s healthcare, has been given little to no investment. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">The acquisition was controversial </a>to begin with, as some noted the pattern of women-focused healthcare companies getting acquired by a male-led company &#8212; <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/25/ro-modern-fertility-womens-health-tech/">instead of the opposite. </a></p>
<p>Another former employee says that Rory always struggled; “because, quite frankly, no one has ever put any time and effort into it because it is not selling dick pills.” Until recently, Rory was led by Rachel Blank. She recently left to start <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/allara-pcos-ro-rachel-blank/">her own company in women’s hormonal health</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Ro previously claimed</a> that Rory was growing 300% year over year before the Modern Fertility acquisition. A current employee says that last year Roman was routinely getting 2,000 new members a day, while Rory often got around four.</p>
<p>“If you look at what happened to all of Ro’s brands, why would you want to be acquired by Ro?” a former employee said. “That’s why I worry about the people on Modern Fertility, because they’ve built such a wonderful product and team and they’re now being folded into this weird culture of unrealistic expectations.”</p>
<p>Modern Fertility co-founder Carly Leahy responded to a request for comment by saying “The Ro team has been incredibly welcoming to Modern Fertility and we continue to be energized by what we can do for women’s health together.” She also said that there are no planned departures from Modern Fertility’s executive team.</p>
<p>Employees felt differently. Acquisitions felt like Ro’s leadership was resorting to external reliance on production innovation, rather than investing in newer or pre-existing teams.</p>
<p>“What changed was the focus moved from growing a business to clearly ‘we want to jack the valuation of this company up ASAP so we can IPO soon,’” a former employee said. “It no longer mattered what individual employees were doing or who was there; it just mattered that we set this strategy.”</p>
<h2><strong>The ‘Amazon of healthcare’</strong></h2>
<p>One employee said that they knew it was time to leave Ro when the co-founders began to circulate a new focus for the company: become the ‘Amazon of healthcare.’ The multinational e-commerce giant is one of the biggest tech companies in the world, but has also long been accused of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruthless</a> <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/09/my-wife-was-dying-of-brain-cancer-my-boss-at-amazon-told-me-to-perform-or-quit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment</a> of its workers in pursuit of profit.</p>
<p>The comparison is more than a theoretical hope: Senior leadership bought a book written by two former Amazon executives, “Working Backwards,” with the intent of replicating Amazon’s culture and leadership strategies.</p>
<p>Several employees detailed incidents of micro-management that didn’t allow employees to express their opinions, ranging from questioning the efficacy of a new product line to being told to never ask to move their seat. One employee said they weren’t allowed to meet with other managers without asking their own for approval. It wasn’t uncommon for employees to be told they weren&#8217;t “Ro-first” if they disagreed with leadership’s vision on a certain sub-brand, they said.</p>
<p>The failures amid integrations and other business verticals weren’t addressed, which many employees say caused they and their co-workers to burn out.</p>
<p>“I think that was the part that was really frustrating for employees,” a former employee told TechCrunch. “I knew if I complained in a Culture Amp [employee satisfaction] survey, my department was going to get a ‘talking to’ &#8212; not about how to fix this problem, but more how to make sure there’s not going to be a negative story about this in the press.&#8221;</p>
<p>To illustrate its culture, a Ro spokesperson pointed to “extremely high engagement scores” from an internal<a href="https://www.cultureamp.com/"> Culture Amp</a> survey last fall. They also noted the following: Ro was recognized as one of Inc.&#8217;s Best Workplaces in 2020 and 2021, Forbes&#8217; list of America&#8217;s Best Startup Employers, as well as on Fortune&#8217;s Best Workplaces in Healthcare, Best Workplaces in New York, Best Workplaces for Millennials and Best Medium Sized Workplaces lists for 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re proud of the culture, team and the company we have built and the impact we’re having on the lives of our patients,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement. “We are incredibly excited for what&#8217;s ahead, including our recent investments in fertility, mental health and in-home care, which will allow us to help more people with more of their healthcare needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>While employees say this has created a culture of mass departures and low morale, Ro chalked it up to the “great resignation” happening across industries. The company said that its voluntary turnover is 8% year to date, meaning fewer than 30 employees have left since the beginning of the year &#8212; significantly less than macro-trends. An analysis using LinkedIn, and corroboration by former and current employees, suggests that dozens more have left the company. Furthermore, a current employee cast doubt on the percentage, saying that there is a sense within the company that more are leaving. Last week, HR sent managers an email about &#8220;the great resignation&#8221; across the country and urged leaders to be more supportive of their direct reports.</p>
<p>“There’s just a feeling of every time you turn around, someone is saying ‘Monday is my last day,’” they said. “It’s like we hire one person, and two other people leave.”</p>
<p>Reitano was not made available for further comment. In an email to Ro staff about this article, Reitano wrote that “We want the bar for Ro to be extremely high” and that “Ro isn’t for everyone.” He also urged employees to submit a ticket to the People team if they have feedback or need additional resources.</p>
<h2><strong>Performance matters</strong></h2>
<p>Of the employees who have recently left, many explained how conflicted it felt to leave a company that had a great mission but fell short in execution.</p>
<p>“Everyone there comes for the right intention, for wanting to save the world and wanting to improve access to healthcare,” a former employee told TechCrunch. “And then you realize, once you’re there, that it’s really just about making sure that you’re first to market with a cheap drug that can be sent to people. It feels icky.”</p>
<p>One employee, who left a few years ago, worked at the company before it became a well-known unicorn. The micromanagement and “paranoid secretiveness” from leadership eventually made them leave. “I always thought it wasn’t Ro. That I was the issue. That maybe I’m being impatient or don’t know how stuff works here or I was not fitting in,” they said.</p>
<p>Ro isn’t claiming to invent breakthrough technology &#8212; most of its business is making it easier for consumers to access generic drugs and services &#8212; and thus some of its aggressive focus on marketing feels warranted. Ultimately, however, Ro’s issue is its inability to replicate the success of Roman across other verticals, taking a toll on the employees that are working on its staff.</p>
<p>“The first year that I was there, I was like the happiest person on earth,” a recently resigned employee said. “The piece that needs to be recalibrated is what is the end vision? What do you mean when you say a vertically integrated, patient-centered health system? And are the actions moving you toward that? And that’s ultimately why I left, because I didn’t feel like what was being said externally was actually happening internally.”</p>

And <a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/apple-pre-installed-app-ratings">some didn&#8217;t fare well</a>, as it turned out &#8212; like Mail, News, and Podcasts, for example, which started off under 3 stars. Now, Apple has opened up a few more first-party apps to the App Store for ratings and reviews, including the Phone app, Messages, Photos, Safari, and others.</p>
<p>The change was first spotted by developer <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/">Kosta Eleftheriou</a>, who has been a prominent figure in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">pushing</a> for App Store reforms, particularly on the matter of App Store <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">scammers</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple just added more of their built-in apps on the App Store, which you can now rate &amp; review: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/x3PoRpu80k">https://t.co/x3PoRpu80k</a> <a href="https://t.co/HylTXYOcRp">pic.twitter.com/HylTXYOcRp</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224916" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1453229435969277960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Citing <a href="https://appfigures.com/">Appfigures</a> data, Eleftheriou noted a number of Apple apps have now become available to rate and review with iOS 15.1. This includes several default apps, like Clock, Phone, Messages, Camera, Photos, Apple Health, and Safari. It also includes Apple Watch-enabled apps like Workout, World Clock, Find Devices, and Heart Rate. (Users on iOS 14.x may be able to see the apps, but won&#8217;t be able to rate and review them, he noted.)</p>
<p>This change could allow Apple to independently update its default apps outside of iOS updates as it does now. This is a tactic Google follows with many of its core Android features and functions, which have their own <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/cluster?clp=igM4ChkKEzU3MDAzMTM2MTg3ODYxNzc3MDUQCBgDEhkKEzU3MDAzMTM2MTg3ODYxNzc3MDUQCBgDGAA%3D:S:ANO1ljLC8CY&amp;gsr=CjuKAzgKGQoTNTcwMDMxMzYxODc4NjE3NzcwNRAIGAMSGQoTNTcwMDMxMzYxODc4NjE3NzcwNRAIGAMYAA%3D%3D:S:ANO1ljKF24s">Play Store listings</a>.</p>
<p>Appfigures confirmed to us the apps appear to have been added as separate listings on October 25th, independently of the latest iOS update. As many consumers are likely unaware of the apps&#8217; listings at this time, they have few reviews. For instance, the Phone app only has 6 ratings so far, they pointed out.  Messages has just a handful of ratings, as well, but they&#8217;re positive, giving the app 4.7 stars. (See below)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Oddly, Safari &#8212; which has 4 ratings, so far&#8211; has an age rating of only 4+ for its web browser, while its rivals like Chrome and Firefox are rated 17+, as are other web browsers.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how well these apps hold up as more people discover they can rate and review Apple&#8217;s default apps. Hopefully, by opening themselves up to consumer feedback, Apple will be motivated to make the changes users want to see in these built-in apps, and get alerted earlier to possible bugs as they arise.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>After trying to find an H-1B job to immigrate to the United States for several years, I took a senior software engineer position with a company in Canada. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My dream is to immigrate to Silicon Valley to start my own venture. Any advice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Eager Entrepreneur</strong></p>
<p>Dear Eager,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience. In honor of National Immigrants Day, I paid homage in my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/094-celebrating-national-immigrants-day-october-28th/">podcast</a> to the immigrants who come to the United States to pursue their dreams and help shape so many of the things I appreciate about our country. Research consistently shows that immigrants &#8212; particularly immigrant entrepreneurs like you, through your fortitude, grit and determination &#8212; create ventures that lead to innovation, job creation and economic growth in the United States.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://data.newamericaneconomy.org/en/fortune500-2021/#exploratory_tool">2020 report by the New American Economy</a>, 44% of Fortune 500 companies, which includes both public and private entities, were founded by immigrants or their children. Together, those companies generated $6.2 trillion in revenue in the fiscal year 2020, which is greater than the GDP of many countries, including Japan, Germany and the U.K.</p>
<p>Although U.S. immigration policy does not make it easy for people to come to the United States to live the life of their dreams, it’s still possible. As you may know, most U.S. work visas and statuses require an employer, which could be your own startup.</p>
<p>As always, I recommend that you consult an immigration attorney who can help you structure a personalized immigration strategy based on your specific goals surrounding your vision and ideal timeline. Below are some options to consider with your immigration counsel.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>L-1 visa for intracompany transferees</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/021-intracompany-transfers-l-1-visas-and-eb-1c-green-cards-for-multinational-managers-executives-and-people-with-specialized-knowledge/">L-1 visa</a> is for individuals who are transferring to the U.S. from a company abroad. If you continue to work for your current employer in Canada for at least one year and your employer is willing to sponsor you, your employer could transfer you to its office or operation in the United States, or you can set up an office for your employer either on an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/l-1a-visa-intracompany-transferee-executives/">L-1A visa</a> for intracompany managers and executives or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/l-1b-visa-intracompany-transferee-specialized-knowledge/">L-1B visa</a> for intracompany specialized knowledge workers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Webflow has raised more than $200 million and become a household name in the world of web design, creation and hosting. What makes Webflow special is that it has been a pioneer in the no-code space, allowing everyday, non-engineer folks to build websites without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this has caught the attention of investors and consumers alike. That includes CapitalG&#8217;s Laela Sturdy, who joined the Webflow board during the company&#8217;s massive Series B fundraise.</p>
<p>So, it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely <em>thrilled</em> to have Webflow co-founder and CEO Vlad Magdalin and CapitalG partner Laela Sturdy join us on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-capitalg-and-webflow?ref=80f041f2a9f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wednesday, November 3rd, at 12pm PT / 3pm ET for an upcoming episode of TechCrunch Live (REGISTER FOR FREE)</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224377" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a> is a weekly event series at TechCrunch that is focused on helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by sitting down with founders and the investors who finance them to hear how they came together on the deal and how they work together moving forward. Sometimes, we even get to walk through the company&#8217;s old pitch deck to learn what truly sang.</p>
<p>About halfway through the episode, we move to the TCL Pitch-off, where folks in the audience can volunteer to hop on our virtual stage and pitch their startup to our expert guests, who offer their live feedback.</p>
<p>Considering the immense success that Webflow has had both fundraising and growing its customer base, and remembering how sought-after a firm CapitalG is, this episode is sure to delight, entertain and inform.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see you there!  <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-capitalg-and-webflow?ref=80f041f2a9f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register here for free!</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced a preview of <a href="https://developer.android.com/12L">Android 12L</a>, which may sound like a new version of Android, but Google calls it &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">a special feature drop that makes Android 12 even better on large screens.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea here is to provide users on tablets, foldables and Chrome OS laptops &#8212; anything with a screen above 600 dp &#8212; with an improved user interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developer preview of <a href="https://developer.android.com/12L">Android 12L</a> is now available for developers who want to give it a try, as well as a new Android 12L emulator and support for it in Android Studio. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But 12L is also for phones, Google says, confusing no one. Since you won&#8217;t really see most of the new features there, though, the focus right now is on other devices, with beta enrollments for Pixel devices launching later in the preview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Google calls it a &#8216;feature drop&#8217; and &#8216;feature update&#8217; in its announcement today, we&#8217;re not looking at a full fork of Android for these devices the way Apple split up iOS and iPadOS. Instead, it&#8217;s an update for large-screen devices that introduces additional multitasking tools and an optimized user interface. By default, Android 12L should also make apps look better on these devices, too. </span></p>

<p>Specifically, this means Google refined how <span style="font-weight: 400;">notifications, quick settings, lock screen, overview and the home screen look on large screens. System apps on Android 12L have also been optimized, too. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s probably most interesting here is the new multitasking features, with a new taskbar that is a bit reminiscent of iPadOS. Android already supported split-screen mode on tablets, but Google notes that it&#8217;s now more discoverable. You simply drag and drop an icon from the taskbar onto the screen to invoke it. This also means every app on Android is now enabled to support split-screen mode (something that developer previously had to opt-in to).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2225069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Google plans to release 12L early next year, &#8220;in time for the next wave of Android 12 tablets and foldable.&#8221; We should probably expect to hear a lot about Android tablets and foldable at MWC then.</p>
<p>In addition to Android 12L, Google also today announced new features in OS and Play for developers to better support these devices. These include updates to its <a href="https://m3.material.io/foundations/adaptive-design/foldables/compositions">Material Design guidance</a> for large-screen devices, but also updates to Jetpack Compose to make it easier to build for these machines and to ensure that apps can more easily adapt to various screen orientations and sizes. Android Studio is also getting a resizable emulator to help developers test their apps on a wider variety of screen sizes and a new visual linting tool to surface UI warnings and suggestions when the layout has issues.</p>
<p>As for Google Play, the company will now check apps against its <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screens-app-quality&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1635357399454000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jQo0QmGf9Oo99MstS3xmf">large screen app quality guidelines</a> and its search rankings will take the results of this into account. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">For apps that are not optimized for large screens, we’ll start warning large screen users with a notice on the app’s Play Store listing page,&#8221; Google says. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company saw 900% growth over the past 12 months and will be using the new funding to support that growth and new innovation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.daring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daring Foods</a> closed on $65 million in Series C funding Wednesday as the plant-based chicken startup launches its products into 3,000 Walmart stores nationally.</p>
<p>Daring offers four plant-based chicken products, including Original, Lemon &amp; Herb, Cajun and Breaded, that looks, cooks and tastes like its chicken counterpart.</p>
<p>CEO Ross Mackay told TechCrunch that the goal of the company is to provide a product that can be “a true one-to-one substitute for chicken” that is also healthy. Daring’s product contains just five ingredients compared to some of its competitors that have a blend of 30 to 40 ingredients, and it also is high in protein and lower in calories than traditional chicken, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Daring Foods will offer healthy, tasty plant-based chicken&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/daring-foods/embed/#?secret=5eiqBfYdH8" data-secret="5eiqBfYdH8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Eighty percent of people changing to a plant-based diet do it for health reasons,” Mackay added. “They want to be able to trust the ingredient profile, and at Daring, we can say absolutely it is healthy.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch last visited with Mackay in 2019, about a year after the company was founded and it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/daring-foods/">received a $10 million investment</a> from Rastelli Foods Group. Back then, the company was young, with just one product and fewer than 10 employees.</p>
<p>Today, the company’s new funding, led by Founders Fund, is the third investment into the company during the past 12 months, Mackay told TechCrunch. Joining Founders Fund is existing investor D1 Capital Group and new athlete and celebrity investors including Naomi Osaka, Cameron Newton, Steve Aoki and Chase Coleman.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following this latest round, the company has now raised over $120 million. Its Series A, led by Maveron, was raised last September, and its B round, led by D1 Capital, was announced in May.</p>
<p>Daring Foods’ products can be found in Whole Foods, Sprouts and Kroger, with Wegmans and Albertsons coming soon, Mackay said. With the addition of Walmart, its distribution has doubled to 6,000, including online markets like Gopuff and Imperfect Foods, and is also being served in some restaurants across the country.</p>
<p>The company saw 900% growth over the past 12 months and will be using the new funding to support that growth and new innovation. In addition, the company grew to 60 employees. Mackay says Daring remains focused on plant-based chicken and has plans for new product launches, some in the coming months and others in the next year.</p>
<p>Daring’s growth is in line with what is going on in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/plant-based-foods-market-to-hit-162-billion-in-next-decade-projects-bloomberg-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global plant-based foods</a> market, which is poised to be a $162 billion market by 2030.</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is a trend, but the future of food, and we are excited to lead in chicken,” Mackay said. “More brands can step into the category, and the innovation going on in the space is super exciting. Capital plowing into the industry is showing the growth trajectory, and at the end of the day, the consumers win.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://delta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Air Lines</a>, in partnership with TSA PreCheck, today announced an expansion of how it uses biometrics to let passengers drop their bags, go through security and board their plane by simply showing their face. For now, the newest part of this, the PreCheck bag-drop experience, is a pilot that&#8217;s only available in Atlanta and for Delta&#8217;s SkyMiles frequent flier program members who are also registered for TSA pre-check.</p>
<p>The project builds and expands upon the work <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-launches-first-domestic-digital-identity-test-us-providing-touchless-curb-gate-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the airline has done</a> at its Detroit hub and for its international flights out of Atlanta. But now it includes a facial recognition-powered bag-drop experience, too.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, where Delta and the TSA are running this pilot, members of Delta&#8217;s SkyMiles frequent flier program who are also TSA pre-check members now get their own self-service PreCheck bag-drop area. There, passengers who opt in to the program (which they have to do every time they check in to a flight on the Delta app) simply walk up to the new bag-drop machines, scan their face, which will validate who they are through the TSA&#8217;s database, and the machine will print out their baggage label for them. Once they attach the label, they set the bag on the belt and the new automated bag-drop machines weigh the bag and use cameras to check its size.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224260" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Forbes noted that this only works for regular roller bags, suitcases and duffle bags. It&#8217;s essentially the bag-drop area for frequent fliers who know what they are doing.</p>

<p><span class="">Currently, about a quarter of Atlanta-based Delta fliers are already qualified to drop off their bags this way. Since the experience is linked to a SkyMiles account, this may also incentivize a few people to sign up for Delta&#8217;s frequent flier program, too, which then gives it new ways to market to those fliers as well.</span></p>
<p>In trying out the experience firsthand, the promise of a 30-second bag drop seemed quite achievable. The facial recognition, with the mask briefly removed, takes a few seconds. Attaching the luggage tag probably took longer than anything else.</p>
<p>For now, Delta set up a small space for this with only four machines, but Forbes noted that if capacity becomes an issue, the airline already has plans for a second bag-drop area elsewhere in the airport.</p>
<p>The new bag-drop machines also feature affordances for the visually impaired and, in case there&#8217;s any confusion about who you are, a boarding pass scanner.</p>
<p>From bag drop, it&#8217;s off to the PreCheck line, where there&#8217;s another facial scan and then the boarding gate, for yet another one. If all goes well, you never need to get out a boarding pass or ID (but you should bring an ID anyway, of course).</p>

<p>By default, the use of biometrics raises some privacy questions. Delta stresses that it only takes the image to send it to the TSA to validate your identity. And to be fair, if you opt in to PreCheck or Global Entry, the TSA already knows what you look like and when you travel. Forbes also noted that Delta itself doesn&#8217;t touch any of the biometric data but leaves that up to its partners who provide the technology for it. The security of their technology has been validated by the government, but we all know that there is no system that is guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve now crossed the U.S. border a number of times this year, mostly using Global Entry, which at this point fully relies on facial recognition, too. It felt a bit odd the first time, but since Homeland Security already has all of my information, it became a non-issue and simply got me on my way to my connection faster. Using the Delta system from curbside to boarding felt quite similar (and not having to touch anything is a nice bonus in the age of corona).</p>
<p>Still, not everybody is going to be willing to make these tradeoffs. For them, nothing really changes. All of this is opt-in, after all.</p>
<p>For now, this is a somewhat exclusive partnership between Delta and the TSA, at least for the current pilot program. Other airlines are surely already working on something similar (United is a likely next adopter, despite its partnership with CLEAR). I would expect Delta to expand on this throughout its various customer touchpoints in the airport and others to follow suit soon.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robnsngh/">Robin Singh</a> is co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.doxel.ai/">Doxel</a>, a software startup that provides computer-vision-powered predictive analytics solutions for the construction industry.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and President Joe Biden’s larger domestic policy package garnered national interest because of the bipartisan struggles and brief periods of unity for the United States.</p>
<p>Now, in the passed legislation, there is $100 million <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/infrastructure-technology-funding/604766/">earmarked</a> over five years to “accelerate the deployment of digital construction technologies such as 3D modeling software and digital project management platforms,” thanks to the <a href="https://infrastructurecoalition.org/">Coalition for Smarter Infrastructure Investments</a>.</p>
<p>“President Biden believes we must produce, here at home, the technologies and goods that meet today’s challenges and seize tomorrow’s opportunities,” the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">said</a> in a fact sheet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Yet while the sweeping package &#8212; which aims to boost the economy, reduce carbon emissions and narrow economic inequality &#8212; gets off the ground, we in the private sector know infrastructure on this level will need robust changes that incorporate emerging technologies during design and construction, or much of the construction will only hamper our major cities and hubs.</p>
<p>Recent technological advances truly do have the ability to aid an industry that has been beaten down by the pandemic and then global supply chain shortages. New York City alone lost an <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/18/74k-nyc-construction-jobs-lost-during-pandemic/">estimated</a> $9.8 billion in construction activity and 74,000 jobs because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, over 73 cargo ships could not dock at major ports within Los Angeles and Long Beach because of a backup in offloading goods. The uptick in some material prices and these delays lead to shortages, causing new tensions in supply-chain business relationships, making it more important than ever to complete major infrastructure projects on time.</p>
<p>The infrastructure bill would add $488 billion to the U.S. GDP by 2027 with just the additional $153.7 billion slated for new highway, bridge and public transit investment, <a href="https://www.artba.org/2021/09/22/infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-iija-would-provide-major-u-s-economic-boost-new-analysis-reveals/">according to ARTBA</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The full bipartisan bill contains $550 billion in new spending; the $1.2 trillion figure comes from including additional funding normally allocated each year for highways and other infrastructure projects. The new spending <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/10/senate-infrastructure-bill-what-is-in-it/">includes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>$110 billion for roads and bridges.</li>
<li>$66 billion for railroads.</li>
<li>$65 billion for the power grid.</li>
<li>$65 billion for broadband.</li>
<li>$55 billion for water infrastructure.</li>
<li>$47 billion for cybersecurity and climate change.</li>
<li>$39 billion for public transit.</li>
<li>$25 billion for airports.</li>
<li>$21 billion for the environment.</li>
<li>$17 billion for ports.</li>
<li>$11 billion for safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>What the Smarter Infrastructure Coalition and I know from our respective fields is that within that list, there is north of $500 billion that is about to be dedicated to infrastructure projects that still use outdated methods, hurting return on investment and eventually the next generation of taxpayers who will foot this bill.</p>
<p>With this kind of spending and need for accountability, it’s time to harness the power of algorithms and call on AI for greater accountability. Machine learning tools can examine huge volumes of data for patterns. Varying sizes of construction companies will be looking for solutions to manage applications, mobile devices and a range of other collaborative tools to ensure projects land on time and on budget.</p>
<p>We’ve all seen the success that firms like Uber, Amazon and Airbnb have built on their ability to analyze vast amounts of data. It may have taken longer for a hands-on industry like ours to adapt, but now AI is realizing massive savings in construction by reducing the cost of equipment and manpower while also helping to spot delays and recommend improvements with accuracy and scale previously not possible.</p>
<p>Piping insulation might sound like a small thing, but there are a million “small things” that make up these projects and need tech enablement to save taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>In an example from my work with Doxel, a multibillion-dollar project from a global oil and gas company saved millions and avoided a three-week delay because computer vision was able to immediately prioritize corrective action when piping systems had not been properly installed.</p>
<p>Essentially, when digital surveying and our algorithms caught the fact that insulation had not been installed according to the plan, we saved that company money by opening the plant on time, avoiding sending home thousands of workers at that plant.</p>
<p>Even before the infrastructure bill was announced, there was a global uptick in appetite for major infrastructure projects because they provide jobs and then positive ongoing economic impact for the regions where they are implemented. Boots on the ground waned, however, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/economy/construction-worker-shortage/index.html">and are reaching new lows</a> &#8212; perhaps because of stigma attached to the work, or maybe because of vocational fads and new adult education learning patterns.</p>
<p>What is abundantly clear is that tech-enabled surveillance and daily project reporting are simply imperative for the infrastructure bill’s success to stimulate our GDP. Construction is a power player on the world stage, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-55293920110303">representing</a> 13% of global GDP, but construction has seen a meager productivity growth (1% annually), largely because of fragmented solutions and lack of tech adoption, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/rise-of-the-platform-era-the-next-chapter-in-construction-technology">according to McKinsey</a>.</p>
<p>According to the same report’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/infrastructure-productivity">Infrastructure Productivity Guidelines</a>, streamlining delivery (e.g., investing heavily in the early stages of project planning and design) can save up to $400 billion annually and accelerate timelines of large construction projects.</p>
<p>We currently have the ability to precision-track job-site progress with the use of cameras and lidar devices, in addition to the ability to connect progress to budget and schedule to predict delays and cost overruns when job-site conditions stray from the plan. We can augment worker presence by freeing up time previously spent on job-site walks, in addition to providing critical progress reports with contextualized insights weekly — and much more.</p>
<p>After 2022, a boom in U.S. construction is inevitable and will play a significant role in reviving a battered global economy. Let’s not be afraid to use technology, when properly managed and deployed, to empower the limited workers we will have available to us to be more productive and avoid the costly pitfalls from the schedule delays that so many huge infrastructure projects in the U.S. have been dogged by in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Abacus.ai">Abacus.ai</a> wants to build an AI platform that simplifies machine learning model creation, while still leaving room for power users. Today the company announced a $50 million Series C. At the same time, it announced that the platform was expanding to include computer vision use cases.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the round with participation from Coatue, Index Ventures and Alkeon Capital. With today&#8217;s investment, the company says that it has raised over $90 million in under 30 months. The most recent funding prior to this was the company&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/abacus-ai-raises-another-22m-and-launches-new-ai-modules/"> $22 million Series A</a> last November.</p>
<p>Abacus co-founder and CEO Bindu Reddy, whose background includes stints at Google and AWS, says the company is trying to create a complete AI platform. &#8220;We have this end-to-end AI/ML platform where the unique thing is we have these vertically integrated solutions, which are kind of specific to common enterprise AI use cases. So think of things like churn reduction or lead scoring or personalization,&#8221; Reddy told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224965" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>She says that this enables companies which lack dedicated data science team to build machine learning models with the help of the platform. &#8220;With Abacus, you have all the pieces and modules that a standard AI platform like SageMaker has, but it is customized for each of those use cases,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>With this approach, you choose a vertical, point to a data set, and Abacus builds the model for you. This is sometimes known as AutoML. For companies that have data science teams, and have already built a model, they can use that model instead of one provided by Abacus, giving a complete experience depending on the customer&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p>The approach puts Abacus in competition with the major cloud vendors and with startups like DataRobot, the Boston AutoML startup that has raised $1 billion, but she believes that Abacus has been able to simplify the model production process more than the cloud companies, and while she acknowledges that DataRobot is a competitor, but she says her company&#8217;s ability to offer those vertical solutions is a big differentiator.</p>
<p>One of those vertical solutions is computer vision, and as part of today&#8217;s news, the company also announced new computer vision use cases including image detection, classification and segmentation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Abacus, which was founded in 2019, currently has 45 employees. With the new capital, the plan is to double that number by year&#8217;s end. As they build up, she says it&#8217;s important to add women and build a diverse company, and Abacus has an internship for high school girls to show them that STEM is an exciting career proposition, something she says that she hopes to expand because the industry needs to attract more girls and women.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one of the things we need to do is to increase that pool dramatically because one of the problems we definitely have is women [going to places] where there&#8217;s 80-90% men and saying, &#8216;We don&#8217;t even want to do this. Why would I want to work with a bunch of dudes?&#8217; So we have to increase that pool. We need that balance. So we try very hard. We also reach out to women PhDs because we also have a research science department, and we want to make sure that we are also encouraging women researchers in the AI space,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform seems to be working in the market with 10,000 users on the platform, who have created over 30,000 models to-date. While Reddy didn&#8217;t want to discuss specific paying customer numbers, she did share that companies like 1-800-Flowers, Flex and Recorded Books are using models in production built on the Abacus platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is rolling out the ability for kids, teens and their parents to request to have pictures deleted from the company&#8217;s image search results.</p>
<p>The new privacy option was one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">many changes the company announced in August</a> in an effort to preemptively build in additional protections for users under the age of 18. Google&#8217;s other planned safeguards included making video uploads private by default, disabling and weed out some &#8220;overly commercial&#8221; YouTube kids content, including unboxing videos.</p>
<p>Anyone under the age of 18 or their parent or guardian can ask Google to remove an image from appearing in search results by <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10949130?hl=en">filling out this request form</a>. You&#8217;ll need to specify that you&#8217;d like Google to remove &#8220;Imagery of an individual currently under the age of 18&#8221; and provide some personal information, the image URLs and search queries that would surface the results.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224934" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe this change will help give young people more control over their digital footprint and where their images can be found on Search,&#8221; the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/giving-kids-and-teens-more-control-over-their-images-search/">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Google says that it will review all requests and follow up with additional verification questions where needed. The company will provide a notification when images in question are removed, so you won&#8217;t be left waiting.</p>
<p>In many countries, including the U.S., there is no national legal framework addressing the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; online. The EU&#8217;s sweeping privacy ruleset known as GDPR, widely regarded as the gold standard for strong privacy regulation, gives people recourse to request that some kinds of online identifying information be removed, including photos.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s new request tool is helpful and available globally, but stops short of the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/?cn-reloaded=1">requirements that GDPR enforces</a>. In Google&#8217;s case, to request that a photo be removed the person in question must be under the age of 18. GDPR goes further by requiring internet companies to remove images of an individual at their request if they were a minor at the time the image was uploaded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google announced the image removal option and a suite of other changes as the company and its peers in the tech industry come under increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. On Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">YouTube testified before the Senate Commerce Committee</a> about efforts it takes to protect young, vulnerable users on its video platform, touting the recently announces changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors CEO Mary Barra is “pretty confident” that the driver will be out of Cruise vehicles by 2022, as the company looks to enter early commercial operations for autonomous robotaxi and delivery services.</p>
<p>Her comments reiterate a timeline outlined earlier this month by Cruise CEO Dan Ammann at the automaker’s investor day. The guidance from Barra, made during an earnings call with investors Wednesday, comes as several autonomous vehicle companies prepare to launch commercial services or expand existing ones.</p>
<p>One key to Cruise’s success relative to other autonomous vehicle developers is its vertical integration with GM, one of the largest car manufacturers in North America.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“[Cruise’s] vertical integration with GM is the key differentiator,” she said. “That seamless integration of the technology, along with leveraging Ultium, as well as our manufacturing capability are a huge value.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Cruise received its &#8220;driverless deployment permit&#8221;</a> from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, a key approval to start accepting compensation for driverless rides. Only one more permit remains, from the California Public Utilities Commission, until the company can launch its commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“As we speak, Cruise is just one state-level approval away from full regulatory approval to charge customers for rides in San Francisco, and it is still the only company with a permit to provide full driverless ride-hail service in the city,” Barra said.</p>
<p>Her comments were made as part of the automotive giant’s second-quarter earnings call. GM announced revenues of $26.8 billion, a 25% fall from $35.5 billion in the same quarter in 2020. The decline was largely due to the ongoing shortage of semiconductors, which have halted production and decreased dealer inventory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM also reported a net income of $2.4 billion in the third quarter, down from a year-ago third-quarter earnings of $4.1 billion.</p>
<p>“The quarter was challenging due to continuing semiconductor pressures,” Barra said in a letter to shareholders.</p>
<p>However, despite the weak earnings, GM executives remained bullish on the year’s outlook overall, telling investors that full-year earnings would be at the high end of its adjusted guidance of $11.5 billion and $13.5 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dream of understanding, exploring and even settlin1g other worlds is alive and well at</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Sessions: Space 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On December 14-15, some of this planet’s foremost experts will be in the house to talk about lunar samples and why they’re critical to determining whether humans can live on other planets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunar samples, in the form of rocks, regolith or dust, offer greater insight to the origins not only of the moon itself, but also of our planet and the inner solar system.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, rock samples collected by China’s Chang’e-5 (the first expedition to do so in more than 40 years) proved that lava flowed on the moon’s surface a relatively mere 2 billion years ago — when multicellular life began to evolve on Earth.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223739" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These substances have also been researched in the creation of lunar energy-storage regolith bricks, which could enable lunar construction and potential eventual habitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extraterrestrial resource collection isn’t just for government agencies anymore. Instead, it will require collaboration among government, private and public entities. NASA hopes to return humans to the moon by 2024 and, as part of that effort, it’s accepting proposals from commercial companies to collect samples of rocks and substances from any lunar location. Compared to samples collected in the 1970s, today’s advanced analytical capabilities will provide deeper understanding and exciting possibilities</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/"> TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>, we’ll have a panel discussion with lunar expedition experts from iSpace, Masten Space Systems and Lockheed Martin Space to discuss recent lunar sample research and explore what the future of lunar sampling looks like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just one example of the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#56c4ffdf-04f9-4404-a33a-522de0e81ba5"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">stellar speakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we have on tap at TC Sessions: Space. We’re talking folks like Natalya Bailey, Accion Systems co-founder and CTO, who will talk about advancements in</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/learn-why-in-space-propulsion-systems-are-essential-for-a-sustainable-space-economy-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in-space satellite propulsion systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Plus, Chad Anderson (Space Capital), Jonathan Fentzke (Techstars), Tess Hatch (Bessemer Venture Partners) and Lisa Rich (Xplore) will have a lot to share about investing in space startups from the earliest stages and beyond.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[We can't help but read Rent the Runway's IPO pricing as not only good news for unicorns, but also for tech-enabled unicorns.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s early in the Wednesday trading session, meaning that we&#8217;re waiting on the first trades of Rent the Runway stock on the public markets.</p>
<p>But what we do know is that the company <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/rent-runway-ipo-goes-bigger-114955222.html">priced at $21 per share</a>, giving it a valuation of $1.33 billion using a simple share count and around $1.47 billion on a fully diluted basis. For a company last valued at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rent-the-runway-series-f--57b9ddfa">around $1 billion in 2019</a>, those figures may not sound too impressive. But I think that they are.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s earlier coverage of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">Rent the Runway IPO filing</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">pricing run</a> was, respectively, skeptical and pessimistic. And yet public investors not only had enough interest for the IPO to proceed but also for the clothing rental company to price at the top of its range.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about why that&#8217;s bullish for unicorns more broadly.</p>
<h2>Tech-enabled versus tech</h2>
<p>A software company is a tech company. And an e-commerce platform is a technology company. But a firm that merely employs e-commerce channels to sell its goods is not. It&#8217;s, instead, tech-<em>enabled</em>.</p>
<p>The difference is no small nuance. Tech companies can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">find themselves valued at 40x or 50x revenues</a> in today&#8217;s markets. Concerns that are merely tech-enabled, however, tend to trade at lower multiples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.gringo.com.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gringo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian startup that has built an app aimed at supporting drivers in a variety of ways, has raised $8 million in a new round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek led the financing, which also included participation from GFC and OneVC. Kaszek also led the company’s seed round in 2020. The latest investment brings its total raised to $10 million since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based Gringo’s self-proclaimed mission is to be “the Brazilian driver&#8217;s best friend.” What that means is that it has built an app &#8212; launched in early 2020 &#8212; to help drivers monitor and perform services related to their documents and vehicles. For example, users can use the app to monitor, manage and pay for documentation (such as their driver licenses and vehicle registration). They can also pay taxes and fines through the app, which today has about 2.5 million users (2 million of whom are in São Paulo).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224461" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started with documentation because we realized that it is the main pain point of Brazilian drivers,” said Rodrigo Colmonero, founder and CEO of Gringo. “Everything starts and ends with documentation. When a driver needs to buy or sell, or finance a vehicle or obtain contract insurance, for example, it is very painful for them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, he said, the startup’s goal is to become a “super app” for drivers. Today, the app offers real-time alerts on fines, annual taxes, points and license expiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of our competitors are focusing on selling products, while we are building a customer-focused company and as a consequence we are solving their pain points while monetizing,” Colmonero told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gringo must be doing something right. It has seen the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> number of drivers on its platform grow “10x” year over year, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colmonero. Its GMV grew 100x year over year, while revenue grew 150x year over year. (Of course we don’t know the base, but the multiples are impressive).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2224473" style="width: 219px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224473" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2224473 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?w=157" alt="" width="209" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg 1090w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=157,300 157w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=768,1470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=355,680 355w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=803,1536 803w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=1070,2048 1070w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224473" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gringo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to building out its app’s services, Gringo aims to also build community around the issues it addresses via WhatsApp and social networks. It shares content around auto-related topics such as notices of new legislation or anything “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">drivers need to know to have a practical routine in traffic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift to more digital everything has helped Gringo’s efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The driver and vehicle licenses became digital in Brazil,” noted Colmonero. “Drivers are becoming more digital and it is no longer necessary for them to solve their problems with brokers and physical locations.”</span></p>
<p>Gringo offers its services for free and is monetizing by charging<span class="s1"> a service fee for the issuance or renewal of digital vehicle registration. It also offers credit for the payment of fines and taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital mainly to expand into</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new services for drivers, toward hiring and to continue to expand within Brazil, and eventually into Latin America. In fact, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company is re-investing all of its profits in “growth into Brazil and later in Latin America,” according to Colmonero. Today, it has 100 employees, 5x more than a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek partner Santiago Fossatti said he was impressed by Gringo’s aim to help drivers manage “everything around car-related documentation,” including driver licenses, fines and annual registration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is uniquely positioned to become a trusted hub from which drivers manage every step of their journey as car owners,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p>He was also drawn to the fact that the founding team had solid experience in growing other companies previously.<span class="s1"> Colmonero co-founded an equity fund called NEO Future Fund and invested in several public companies. </span><span class="s1">Juliano Dutra was a partner at ifood and co-founded Rapiddo, a logistic startup sold to Ifood. And </span><span class="s1">Caique Carvalho co-founded tattoo marketplace My ink.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has dipped back into its $2 billion climate fund and invested in several startups, including one that is developing fast-charging technology for electric vehicles as part of the e-commerce giant&#8217;s broader effort to have net-zero carbon operations by 2040.</p>
<p>The company said Wednesday it has invested in CMC Machinery and Resilient Power. The company put additional capital into Infinium, a renewable fuels technology company it previously backed. Amazon didn&#8217;t disclose exact funding amounts, although separate announcements from the startups provide a bit of insight into the scale of the funding.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund has now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/amazons-first-five-climate-fund-investments-include-redwood-materials-rivian/">invested in 11 companies</a> to date, including previous investments in CarbonCure, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, TurnTide Technologies, BETA Technologies, Ion Energy, ZeroAvia, and Infinium.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224204" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Resilent Power, an Austin, Texas-based company, announced Wednesday it has closed a $5 million seed round, which Amazon participated in but did not lead. The seed round was led by Energy Transition Ventures, with investment from Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund and GS Futures, the corporate venture capital arm of GS Group from Korea.</p>
<p>The startup has developed a solid-state transformer that enables multi-megawatt medium voltage fast charging at one-tenth the installation time. It&#8217;s also able to handle solar generation, energy storage, vehicle-to-grid and microgrid tasks. Resilient says its system is capable of charging up to 24 vehicles at a time. It can also connect direct current or alternating current sources to a medium voltage line on the grid, which is a handy feature that helps avoid costly upgrades to the distribution grid.</p>
<p>This is the kind of system ideal for charging fleets of vehicle, which is where Amazon comes in. Amazon said its investment into Resilient will help the e-commerce company reach its broader decarbonization goals around transportation, including the ongoing incorporation of EVs into its delivery fleet, including deploying 100,000 custom EVs by 2030. Rivian, another Amazon-backed company, is producing the 100,000 electric vans for the company.</p>
<p>Other investments announced Wednesday include the Italian-based CMC Machinery, a company that designs and manufactures custom-sized boxes tailored to the dimensions of the items in each order. This &#8220;right-sizing&#8221; helps reduce or even eliminate the need for single-use plastic padding while still protecting the items during shipping, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon said it expects that by the end of 2022, CMC Machinery&#8217;s technology could reduce the cubic volume for each box by 24% on average. The technology is projected to reduce the use of approximately 1 billion plastic air pillows by the end of 2022, Amazon said.</p>
<p>Amazon also put more money into Sacramento-based Infinium, which has developed a technology that converts renewable power into &#8216;green&#8217; hydrogen, then uses the green hydrogen and waste carbon dioxide to produce ultra-low carbon fuels. Infinium said Wednesday it closed a $69 million round that was co-led by Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund and a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources LLC. The round also included investment from AP Ventures LLP, 8090 Partners, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Pavilion Capital.</p>
<p>Infinium said the capital will be used to complete the development of large-scale facilities that can each generate nearly 40 million gallons of electrofuels annually for the commercial transportation sector. The fuels Infinium plans to produce are a replacement for traditional jet fuel and diesel, and can be used in planes, ships and truck fleets without changes in infrastructure or engine design, according to the company.</p>
