										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen and Bosch have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore a joint venture dedicated to providing Europe with battery equipment solutions. The two companies aim to supply integrated battery production systems and on-site ramp-up and maintenance support for battery cell and system manufacturers, Volkswagen said.</p>
<p>The JV is expected to help VW reach its goal to build six cell factories by 2030, but it will also be available to serve other factories across Europe. The companies did not share how much they would invest in the venture.</p>
<p>As automakers set ever more ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years, they&#8217;re working on becoming more self-sustaining and less reliant on getting their battery supplies from abroad, which has become even more problematic with pandemic-related supply chain issues. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/">2021 saw a string of battery joint ventures between automakers and cell suppliers</a> keen to build battery cell production facilities close to home, but VW was already there with a <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-and-northvolt-form-joint-venture-for-battery-production-5316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 JV with Northvolt</a> and its first planned production facility in Saltzgitter, Germany.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259049" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Europe has the unique chance to become a global battery powerhouse in the years to come,&#8221; said Thomas Schmall, a VW board member responsible for the automaker&#8217;s battery plans, <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-and-bosch-want-to-industrialize-manufacturing-processes-for-battery-cells-7707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a statement</a>. &#8220;There is a strong and growing demand for all aspects of battery production, including the equipment of new gigafactories. Volkswagen and Bosch will explore opportunities to develop and shape this novel, multibillion-euro industry in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volkswagen is also joining the growing trend of automakers finding ways to diversify revenues by offering services to competitors. On Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/ford-and-adt-launch-joint-venture-new-product-to-prevent-theft-from-vehicles/">Ford and ADT formed a JV</a> to provide a vehicle monitoring system that can be attached to any car make or model to help prevent thefts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our decision to actively engage in the vertical integration of the battery-making value chain will tap considerable new profit pools,&#8221; added Schmall. &#8220;Setting out to establish a fully localized European supply chain for e-mobility made in Europe certainly marks a rare opportunity in business history.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eba250.com/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Battery Alliance</a> has said a third of global batteries need to be produced in Europe by the end of the decade to cut dependence on South Korean and Chinese market dominants, but so far battery cell plants capable of generating under 900 gigawatt hours of capacity in Europe are set to make up only 16% of global production by 2029.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla is planning to build a battery plant in Berlin with a capacity of 50 GWh next to its 300-hectare site to build Model Y vehicles, but both the plant and factory are still awaiting approval from regional authorities to begin production, despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/tesla-hosts-festival-at-berlin-gigafactory-to-announce-start-of-production-by-december/">CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s earlier promises that production would begin in November or December</a> last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37594789/vw-battery-tech-new-laboratory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volkswagen’s planned factory in Salzgitter</a> is expected to produce 40 GWh, but if the automaker succeeds in ramping up production and building a total of six factories, it should have a combined output of 240 GWh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a sign of the times that on the very same morning, the FTC and Justice Department <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2022/01/ftc-and-justice-department-seek-to-strengthen-enforcement-against-illegal-mergers">announced a thorough review of corporate merger policies</a> with an eye to preventing anti-competitive acquisitions — and a megacorp announced a $69 billion deal that would further consolidate an industry already dominated by a handful of players.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">the Microsoft-Activision deal</a> is necessarily anti-competitive, but they certainly will have their job cut out for them in proving that it isn&#8217;t. As a publisher, platform, hardware maker and service provider in gaming, Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard puts several of the world&#8217;s most popular gaming franchises firmly in its stable — and potentially out of arch-rival Sony&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s just how competition works these days. But what this FTC review presupposes is&#8230; maybe it shouldn&#8217;t?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258923" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What exactly the new rules are to be isn&#8217;t yet set, the announcement drew very obvious dotted lines around the areas the agencies are hoping to rein in without actually naming names. In fact (as is frequently but not always the process in recasting rules) public comment is called for on all matters, so the areas of focus are ostensibly notional, though one assumes they have a draft ready now. (In fact I suspect FTC Chair Lina Khan had it in her briefcase when she was confirmed.)</p>
<p>The review would seek to revisit the conditions under which a merger or acquisition would be viewed with suspicion, such as whether it will &#8220;tend to create a monopoly,&#8221; a somewhat loose turn of phrase technically in the guidelines now but not very well defined.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4d5KDeyvdT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan/">Amazon betrays its fear with petition to sideline FTC Chair and antitrust hawk Lina Khan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon betrays its fear with petition to sideline FTC Chair and antitrust hawk Lina Khan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan/embed/#?secret=4d5KDeyvdT" data-secret="4d5KDeyvdT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Also under consideration would be the way markets themselves are defined, which is key to establishing anticompetitive practices. For instance, what market is Facebook in, legally speaking? Communications, &#8220;social media&#8221; (however we define that), advertising, or what? Unless that sort of thing is pinned down, companies can slip between the cracks, arguing one day that they&#8217;re an advertiser and the next that they&#8217;re a communications provider, usually whichever suits their needs for escaping regulation. (Broadband providers have been drawing out a similar advantageous vacillation for decades.)</p>
<p>The FTC will also be looking at updating guidelines on &#8220;potential and nascent competitors,&#8221; the kind frequently snapped up for tens of billions of dollars when it looks like they can&#8217;t be contained any longer.</p>
<p>Monopsony power and how it relates to labor markets is also being looked at, which is where one company (or more than one in collusion) dominates the market for buying a particular service. Say if Uber for some reason employs 90 percent of all personal transportation drivers in a state, what opportunities for leverage and abuse does that offer, and how can those be counteracted?</p>
<p>The most explicit call-out, however, is certainly the final bullet on the list of items</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Unique characteristics of digital markets</strong>: The agencies seek information on how to account for key areas of the modern economy like digital markets in the guidelines, which often have characteristics like zero-price products, multi-sided markets, and data aggregation that the current guidelines do not address in detail.</p></blockquote>
<p>What exactly is the effect of things like Amazon Prime, which despite being unquestionably convenient in many ways is part of a complex market and system of markets, and as such may prove problematic from a competition standpoint? Without the ability to even ask and answer such questions, Amazon will fall through the aforementioned cracks and its policies may be blindly accepted as beneficial upon superficial inquiry.</p>
<p>Asking the general public whether they think a company amounts to a monopsony, or whether their acquisition of a competitor amounts is questionable, seems on the face of it a little unaccountable. But the public comment period does two things.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, it creates an opportunity for soliciting broad support from the public across the U.S., establishing the process as good politics. Some canny Representative may require a bit of convincing that their constituency cares about such things. Though as we saw with the net neutrality push, this is hardly sufficient to guarantee success.</p>
<p>Second, it allows for real input from interested parties — trade associations, activists, NGOs, and so on — who can put together serious comments that make substantive policy and research suggestions. Having a basket of non-partisan think tanks to sprinkle in as footnotes justifying various approaches is a bulwark against rules being considered &#8220;arbitrary or capricious&#8221; and being nullified or challenged.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2022/01/statement-chair-lina-m-khan-regarding-request-information-merger">A highly readable statement by Khan</a> summarizes the situation well and gives important context to the idea of updating rules — it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been doing all along, and it&#8217;s long past time we do it again. It&#8217;s hard to put it better than she does, with the directness that made her Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox paper so compelling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Major technological and economic changes, meanwhile, have led to shifts in how businesses compete and grow, creating new interconnections and dynamics across multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that decades of mergers have been a key driver of consolidation across industries, with this latest merger wave threatening to concentrate our markets further yet.</p>
<p>While the current merger boom has delivered massive fees for investment banks, evidence suggests that many Americans historically have lost out, with diminished opportunity, higher prices, lower wages, and lagging innovation. 7 A lack of competition also appears to have left segments of our economy more brittle, as consolidated supply and reduced investment in capacity can render us less resilient in the face of shocks.</p>
<p>Just as we must revise our theories and models to fit new facts and evidence, we must ensure our merger guidelines accurately reflect the realities of the modern economy. Matching our analysis to contemporary business strategy requires that our tools be dynamic and holistic rather than static and atomistic.</p></blockquote>
<p>The comments are open now and will remain so for 60 days. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FTC-2022-0003/document">Feel free to add your own</a>.</p>

<p>This is our <del>Monday</del> Tuesday show, our short ramp into the week where we talk about the larger picture to get our feet wet. We&#8217;re a day late due to an American holiday, and I can say later in the day with this thanks to my schedule. But, better late than never, here&#8217;s what we got into:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Yet another bad day for assets: Stocks around the world were broadly lower, with software shares taking yet another hit in the key US market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">Microsoft wants to buy Activision Blizzard</a> for nearly $69 billion dollars. It&#8217;s a lot of money for a gaming studio that was so recently covered in, well, scandal? And really, does Microsoft <em>need </em>to get any bigger? Come on. It has already consumed several gaming companies, and is worth north of $2 trillion. At what point will regulators, you know, regulate?</li>
<li>Clockwise raises $45 million! This is a very neat round from a very cool company, which <a href="https://twitter.com/aiishamalik1?lang=en">Aisha Malik</a> covered for TechCrunch earlier today. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/smart-calendar-tool-clockwise-raises-45m-to-use-ai-to-help-remote-teams-avoid-burnout/">Her post is here if you need more</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re back to our normal schedule starting tomorrow, now that the new year and holidays are behind us. To work!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/">Animoca Brands</a>, an eight-year-old, 600-person Hong Kong-based outfit that has managed to put its stamp on many of the world&#8217;s most popular NFT and metaverse brands, has raised roughly $360 million in fresh funding at a valuation of more than $5 billion, the company announced today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big leap from the $2.2 billion valuation the company was assigned in October when it raised a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/20/animoca-brands-raises-65m-at-2-2b-valuation-from-ubisoft-and-others/">$65 million</a> round. The number is even more notable considering that Animoca was valued at $1 billion in an <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/animoca-brands-completes-usd138888888-capital-raise-with-second-tranche-of-usd50000000">$138 million</a> round that closed as recently as July.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the firm, the capital raise involved the issue of 111,173,515 new shares of Animoca Brands, which investors bought from Animoca Brands at the equivalent of $3.24 per share in a &#8220;pretty standard equity-based raise.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting, given that Animoca &#8212; which previously traded on the Australian Securities Exchange and was <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/delisting-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delisted</a> in March of 2020 because “it didn’t like the fact that we were dealing with crypto,” Animoca founder Yat Siu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/a-peek-into-web3-power-player-animoca-brands/">recently told us</a> &#8212; now operates as an unlisted public company whose roughly 2,500 shareholders can sell their shares privately to other individuals. (You just have to know who owns some.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&#8220;Secondary placement of shares is occurring because there was high demand that could not be fulfilled in the primary placement,&#8221; added the spokesperson, &#8220;however secondary placement is not considered part of this capital raise and any sums exchanged via secondary sales do not count toward the company&#8217;s finances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty City Ventures &#8212; and earlier investor in Animoca &#8212; led the new round, along with a mix of other earlier and new investors, including 10T Holdings, C Ventures, Delta Fund, Gemini Frontier Fund, Gobi Partners Greater Bay Area, Kingsway, L2 Capital, Mirae Asset, Pacific Century Group, ParaFi Capital, Provident, Senator Investment Group, Sequoia China, Smile Group, Stable Asset Management, Soros Fund Management, Wildcat Capital Management, and Winklevoss Capital.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to appreciate Animoca&#8217;s appeal right now. As we noted in our recent piece on Animoca, the outfit controls what it describes as a &#8220;broad portfolio of game products, both centralized and decentralized, branded and original, with coverage across most primary platforms including mobile devices, game consoles, PC, web, and blockchain&#8221; with products, including games, ranging from hyper casual to hardcore, as well as collectibles, utility tokens, e-sports titles&#8221; and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Some of those products tie to subsidiaries of the company, which got its start by developing games for smartphones and tablets and dove headlong into blockchain gaming roughly four years ago. Others represents stakes that Animoca has taken in other companies, including Dapper Labs; Sky Mavis, the developer of global sensation “Axie Infinity;&#8221; and the NFT trading platform OpenSea.</p>
<p>According to Siu, those various holdings were worth around $16 billion as of late November, though their value remains theoretical for now given that Animoca has not tried exiting from those positions. “They would be really what you describe as balance sheet items; they basically just accrue to the value of the equity of Animoca Brands,” he explained.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Animoca is continuing to invest actively. Among the outfits that have announced Animoca&#8217;s involvement already this year are nCore Games, a Indian gaming firm that is preparing to enable users to &#8220;own&#8221; more of the assets they use to play and says it just raised $10 million in funding co-led by Animoca Brands and another high-profile investor in the crypto space, Galaxy Interactive.</p>
<p>Animoca also recently led a $9 million Series A round in CryptoSlam, a Kansas-based non-fungible token (NFT) industry data aggregator, and it led an $8 million Series A in Burnt Finance, a New York-based company developing an NFT auction protocol that&#8217;s built on the Solana blockchain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jibo may have breathed its last robotic breaths back in 2019, but researchers at MIT believe the social robot may have been onto something. Sure, the world wasn’t ready for a pricey social robot a few years back, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some positives to take away from the experience &#8212; namely, the value of imbuing smart home products with more humanlike attributes.</p>
<p>A team at MIT’s media lab recently <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/hey-alexa-are-you-trustworthy-0114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a paper</a> looking into the value of attaching simple human gestures to smart home interfaces. It’s worth mentioning up front here that former Jibo CEO Cynthia Breazeal, who currently works at Media Lab, was one of four co-authors of the study, which pitted the bygone home robot against a Google Nest and Amazon Echo.</p>
<p>According to the study, users are more likely to engage with both the device &#8212; and each other &#8212; more when it exhibits some form of social cues. That can mean something as simple as the face/screen of the device rotating to meet the speaker’s gaze.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259033" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Per MIT, “In the first experiment, participants interacted with a Jibo robot, Amazon Echo, and Google Home, with no modifications. Most found the Jibo to be far more outgoing, dependable, and sympathetic. Because the users perceived that Jibo had a more humanlike personality, they were more likely to interact with it, [research assistant Anastasia] Ostrowski explains.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1192682" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1192682" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1192682 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jibo.gif" alt="" width="400" height="225" /><p id="caption-attachment-1192682" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jibo</p></div></p>
<p>Future studies will likely include additional robots &#8212; Amazon’s Astro seems like a prime candidate, effectively serving as a rolling Echo with a built-in personality. Obviously, however, full robotic functionality comes at a much higher premium. The $1,500 robot is not going to replace the wildly successful Echo line any time soon.</p>
<p>There are those devices, like the Echo Show 10, which follow the user around the room, using object tracking. Though that technology doesn’t engender the same sort of warm feelings as a Wall-E-like robot. “Users found the modified Amazon Echo Spot to be no more engaging than the Amazon Echo Show, suggesting that repetitive movement without social embodiment may not be an effective way to increase user engagement,” the study notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Branding, too, was found to have an impact on how users perceived the devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s shareholders have urged a judge to find that CEO Elon Musk coerced the company&#8217;s board to acquire SolarCity in 2016, a transaction that a group of shareholders allege was a &#8220;bailout&#8221; of the failing solar company of which Musk was the top shareholder. During a Zoom hearing on Tuesday, the shareholders asked that Musk be ordered to return the stock he received from the deal and pay Tesla $13 billion.</p>
<p>The all-stock deal was valued at $2.6 billion at the time, but Tesla stock has gone up massively since then.</p>
<p>In July 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elon-musk-defends-teslas-2-6b-acquisition-of-solarcity-in-delaware-court/">Musk testified in a 10-day lawsuit over the acquisition</a>, with his lawyers saying the CEO recused himself from board discussions and negotiations relating to the acquisition of SolarCity, a purchase that was approved by 85% of shareholders at the time. The resounding question is whether or not Musk exerted undue influence over the transaction and whether he and other board members concealed information relating to the transaction from shareholders.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259009" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This case has always been about whether the acquisition of SolarCity was a rescue from financial distress, a bailout, orchestrated by Elon Musk,&#8221; said Randy Baron, an attorney for shareholders, at the hearing, <a href="http://reuters.com/business/telsa-investors-urge-judge-order-musk-repay-13-bln-solarcity-deal-2022-01-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-1">The lawsuit by union pension funds and asset managers said that SolarCity “had consistently failed to turn a profit, had mounting debt, and was burning through cash at an unsustainable rate,” noting that the company had accumulated over $3 billion in debt in its 10-year history, nearly half of which was due for repayment by 2017.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-1">Musk&#8217;s attorney&#8217;s argued back in July that the acquisition was part of the CEO&#8217;s long-term vision to transform Tesla into an energy company. The <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO has said</a> that combining SolarCity and Tesla was the key to his vision of combining Tesla&#8217;s battery storage product, Powerwall, with its solar roof panels.</p>
<div class="SpacingContainer__container___2kvuUN SpacingContainer__max-width___1aBoiA">At the hearing on Tuesday, Evan Chesler, one of Musk&#8217;s lawyers, alleged that the deal was not a bailout and that SolarCity&#8217;s finances were on par with many high-growth tech companies.</div>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-6">&#8220;They were building billions of dollars of long-term value,&#8221; said Chesler, according to Reuters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-8">Things got a bit spicy when shareholder attorney Lee Rudy asked Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware&#8217;s Court of Chancery to consider the contempt Musk held for the deposition and trial process, in which he repeatedly insulted shareholder attorneys.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-17">Slights said he expects to rule in about three months, around the same time he expects to retire. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/delaware-chancery-court-judge-joseph-slights-iii-set-retire-2022-01-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A related shareholder lawsuit challenging Musk&#8217;s giant pay package was transferred from Slights to another judge</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blink Charging, an electric vehicle charger manufacturer, will be deploying EV chargers at General Motors dealerships across the U.S. and Canada, according to the company. The startup will be teaming up with facility solutions provider ABM to supply its new IQ 200 Level 2 chargers to GM.</p>
<p>While Blink is by no means a small EV charging company, it has historically had a smaller market share compared to companies like Chargepoint, EVBox, Tesla and even Shell. Blink said it has around 30,000 EV chargers set up across 13 countries, so this deal with GM might help the company as it aims to scale even bigger and gain more brand recognition.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t GM&#8217;s first deal with Blink, though. Last April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/gm-partners-with-7-charging-networks-ahead-of-new-electric-vehicles/">GM unveiled a plan to integrate the public charge plugs of seven different charging companies &#8212;</a> including Blink, ChargePoint, EV Connect, EVgo, FLO, Greenlots and SemaConnect &#8212; into the GM mobile app so that customers could easily find a place to refuel. Now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-says-it-will-double-revenue-by-2030-take-ev-market-share-from-tesla/">as GM plans to scale up its EV production to the point of taking market share from Tesla</a>, it looks like it&#8217;s taking Blink with it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258964" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">After receiving its first order from GM in May 2021, Blink has already started shipping chargers to certain GM dealerships via ABM, which provides EV installations, and is at the ready with additional charging stations as needed over the next several months, according to the company. There are no target charging station amounts for this agreement, nor is there a date for widespread deployment, because the purchase and installation are on a dealer-by-dealer basis. So far, Blink has seen &#8220;nearly 1,000 orders from GM dealers totaling 1,505 EV chargers,&#8221; according to a spokesperson for the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The deal with GM does not involve an investment from the automaker, says Blink. GM dealers are purchasing Blink outright through their procurement partner, ABM, which gives GM dealers equipment purchase rates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blink&#8217;s IQ 200 chargers are designed for fleets and built with local load management that can allow for up to 20 chargers on a single shared circuit without overwhelming the power grid. The 80-amp chargers provide fast Level 2 charging on a 100-amp circuit and get up to 65 miles of charge per hour with an output of 19.2 kW. It can be deployed in a wall mount, pole mount or pedestal mount.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/ev-charging-companies-push-faster-at-home-charges-v2g-and-connectivity-at-ces/">At CES this year, Blink showed off its next gen MQ 200 Level 2 chargers</a>, which will be available by the end of the first quarter. Blink did not respond to a request for information as to whether GM would be getting these new chargers when they&#8217;re ready to go to market. The MQ 200s are faster and smarter, with software that connects Blink chargers to the cloud and to the new Blink Fleet Management Portal, which would be ideal for dealership operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat has faced increasing criticism in recent years as the opioid crisis plays out on social media, often with tragic results.</p>
<p>In October, an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html">NBC investigation</a> reported the stories of a number of young people aged 13 to 23 who died after purchasing fentanyl-laced pills on Snapchat. That month, Snapchat parent company Snap committed to improving its ability to detect illicit drug sales on the social network and began ushering users who search for drug-related content to an educational harm reduction portal.</p>
<p>Snapchat provided a glimpse at its progress Tuesday, noting that 88 percent of the drug-related content it finds is now identified proactively by automated systems, with community reporting accounting for the other 12 percent. Snap says this number is up by a third since its October update, indicating that more of this content is being detected up front before being identified by users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258868" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Since this fall, we have also seen another important indicator of progress: a decline in community-reported content related to drug sales,&#8221; Snap wrote in a <a href="https://snap.com/en-US/safety-and-impact/post/expanding-our-work-to-combat-the-fentanyl-epidemic">blog post</a>. &#8220;In September, over 23% of drug-related reports from Snapchatters contained content specifically related to sales, and as a result of proactive detection work, we have driven that down to 16% as of this month. This marks a decline of 31% in drug-related reports. We will keep working to get this number as low as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says that it also recently introduced a new safeguard that prevents 13 to 17 year-old users from showing up in its Quick Add user search results unless they have friends in common with the person searching. That precaution is meant to discourage minors from connecting with users they don&#8217;t know, in this case to deter online drug transactions.</p>
<p>Snapchat is also adding information from the CDC on the dangers of fentanyl into its &#8220;Heads Up&#8221; harm reduction portal and partnering with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA), a global nonprofit working to &#8220;prevent substance misuse through collaborative community efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company works with experts to identify new search terms that sellers use to get around its rules against selling illicit substances. Snapchat calls the work to keep its lexicon of drug sales jargon up to date &#8220;a constant, ongoing effort.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration published a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dea-warning-counterfeit-drugs/2021/09/27/448fcb18-1f27-11ec-b3d6-8cdebe60d3e2_story.html">warning</a> last month about the dangers of pills purchased online that contain fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/29/why-fentanyl-is-deadlier-than-heroin/">deadlier in much smaller doses</a> than heroin. Because fentanyl increasingly shows up in illicitly purchased drugs, including those purchased online, it can prove fatal to users who believed they were ingesting other substances.</p>
<p>In December, DEA Administrator Anne Milgram called Snapchat and other social media apps &#8220;haven[s] for drug traffickers&#8221; in a December <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-dea-administrator-anne-milgram-face-the-nation-12-19-2021/">interview with CBS</a>. &#8220;Because drug traffickers are harnessing social media because it is accessible, they&#8217;re able to access millions of Americans and it is anonymous and they&#8217;re able to sell these fake pills that are not what they say they are,&#8221; Milgram said.</p>
<p>While social media platforms dragged their feet about investing in proactive, aggressive content moderation, online drug sales took root. Companies have sealed up some of the more obvious ways to find illicit drugs online (a few years ago it was as simple as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/instagram-has-a-drug-problem-its-algorithms-make-it-worse/2018/09/25/c45bf730-bdbf-11e8-b7d2-0773aa1e33da_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_38">searching #painpills on Instagram</a>, for instance) but savvy sellers adapt their practices to get around new rules as they&#8217;re made.</p>
<p>The rise of fentanyl is a significant factor exacerbating the American opioid epidemic and the substance&#8217;s prevalence in online sales presents unique challenges. In an<a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/video-at-senate-hearing-on-protecting-kids-online-klobuchar-demands-answers-on-snapchat-s-role-in-death-of-young-minnesotans-calls-for-changes-to-avoid-future-tragedies"> October hearing on children&#8217;s online safety</a>, Snap called the issue the company&#8217;s &#8220;top priority,&#8221; but many lawmakers and families affected by online drug sales remain skeptical that social media companies are taking their role in the opioid crisis seriously.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-lepskaya/">Maria Lepskaya</a> is a senior associate at <a href="https://runacap.com/">Runa Capital</a>, leading investments in different branches of quantum technologies and advanced materials.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Market trends are the best indicators we have to judge the maturity of the quantum industry. While they don&#8217;t perfectly reflect technological progress, they showcase investors’ willingness to write checks for the industry.</p>
<p>In the next three to five years, quantum computers manufacturers are expected to <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/building-quantum-advantage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate revenue of $5 billion to $10 billion</a>, according to Boston Consulting Group. McKinsey expects the chemical and pharma industries to be the first potential users of quantum computing, enabling the accurate simulation of larger numbers of atoms and molecules, which is not possible today using classical supercomputers.</p>
<p>Although many VCs seem to be new to quantum technologies, some investors foresaw this movement several years ago and are now making their first quantum exits.</p>
<p>Take IonQ, a U.S.-based manufacturer of ion-trapped quantum computers, for instance. The company was founded in 2015, and it went public in 2021 through a SPAC at a $2 billion valuation. Berkeley-based Rigetti will also go public through a SPAC this year, raising $458 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. The company is developing a superconducting quantum computer, which already could scale up to 80 qubits.</p>
<p>IonQ and Rigetti&#8217;s IPOs set the valuation benchmarks for the whole industry, which impact the valuations of all quantum deals. More importantly, these IPOs show venture capitalists could make money from the quantum industry without significant commercialization of the technology.</p>
<p>Today, a quantum processor is a complicated device requiring a lab environment. This makes cloud access to quantum processors preferable, which was not possible during the emergence of classical computers. As a result, quantum hardware manufacturers develop their own cloud-based operating systems. Right now, it is hard to imagine someone would build a large quantum OS company as Microsoft did in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“Although technology maturity will still take many years, the future winners in the quantum computing market will be determined in the next two years. We are expecting a first consolidation phase led by the 10 leading full-stack quantum hardware players,&#8221; said Benno Broer, CEO at <a href="https://quandco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qu&amp;Co</a>. This is a path the quantum industry may follow, collecting pieces of the stack via acquisitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today marks the launch of the <a href="https://joinroll.com/">Roll</a> app, which aims to create an easy way for creators to make an extra buck while portraying a potentially more authentic version of themselves to their fans. Already, some creators will charge for access to their Instagram close friends story, a private Snapchat account, or a secret Discord server, where they post content that&#8217;s still on-brand and safe-for-work, but maybe not as polished and professional as what they post &#8220;on main.&#8221; Roll takes this creator tactic and streamlines it &#8212; instead of subscribing to a creator&#8217;s Patreon to get access to their secret Instagram, this entire transaction can be facilitated on Roll, which is available for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our punch line is essentially that we give fans access to their favorite creators&#8217; camera rolls,&#8221; said founder and CEO Erik Zamudio. &#8220;The way that it works is fans subscribe to see content from creators that they&#8217;re not going to be able to see anywhere else. I think it lets creators be the most authentic and real versions of themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be clear, Roll isn&#8217;t sharing access to these creators&#8217; literal camera roll &#8212; that would be a disaster waiting to happen. But the idea is that Roll gives creators a chance to make money while connecting with their fans in a more casual way. Even when posting on social media is your job, it&#8217;s not as though you upload everything in your camera roll &#8212; you might take a photo of the perfect (or not-so-perfect) omelet you made, a bad selfie, a screenshot of a meme you like, or something weird you saw on a walk. Those images may not make sense on your carefully-planned Instagram grid, but they could work on a platform like Roll. Plus, like a real camera roll, there&#8217;s no liking or commenting on Roll posts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258148" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Creators keep 80% of their earnings on Roll, where they can charge monthly subscriptions between $5 and $50. Zamudio says that most creators so far have chosen the $5 mark, but people making more specialized content might veer toward the higher end of the range &#8212; for example, a TikTok chef would charge more for videos with exclusive recipes than if they posted a few behind the scenes photos per month. Unlike a competitor like OnlyFans, Roll doesn&#8217;t allow adult content.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258302" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258302" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2258302" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?w=510" alt="Tana Mongeau with her Roll account open on her phone" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg 2268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258302" class="wp-caption-text">Tana Mongeau with her Roll account open on her phone</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, about twenty creators are on Roll, but the team will add ten to fifteen more stars each week until they&#8217;re ready to open their creator portal to the public. Roll&#8217;s current roster includes musician Dillon Francis, &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; actor Noah Schnapp, social media personalities like Tana Mongeau, S<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ommer Ray and Stassie Karanikolaou, and YouTuber David Dobrik.</span></p>
<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t Dobrik&#8217;s first time being involved with a photo-based social startup. He co-founded David&#8217;s Disposable, the app that became Dispo. Zamudio and three others on Roll&#8217;s staff also helped build David&#8217;s Disposable, but Zamudio left in mid-2020, shortly before the app rebranded to Dispo. He declined to say why he and his colleagues left.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/style/dispo-david-dobrik-disposable-camera-app.html">much-hyped</a> Dispo app launched in March 2021, but just one week later, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">Insider reported</a> on sexual assault allegations regarding a member of Vlog Squad, Dobrik&#8217;s YouTube prank ensemble. The alleged assault occurred while filming a video for Dobrik&#8217;s channel about group sex. Seth Francois, a former Vlog Squad member who is Black, posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmflQbdyULA">YouTube video</a> outlining the racism he experienced in David&#8217;s videos &#8212; he also said he <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/seth-david-dobrik-prank-sexual-assault">experienced</a> sexual assault on Dobrik&#8217;s set. Shortly after the Insider article was published, Dobrik stepped down from the board of Dispo.</p>
<p>Amid these many controversies, early investors in Dispo like Spark Capital, Seven Seven Six and Unshackled committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">donating any potential profits</a> from their investment in the app to organizations working with survivors of sexual assault. But even though Dobrik <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sponsors-drop-youtuber-david-dobrik-after-his-former-collaborator-accused-n1261719">lost</a> a variety of brand deals, his YouTube subscriber count only dropped from 18.8 million to 18.3 million, and he still posts three videos per week, which rake in around 6 to 10 million views each. And now, Dobrik&#8217;s dabbling in consumer tech again. But while <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dobrik was a co-founder of Dispo, Zamudio says that the controversial YouTuber is just a creator who uses the Roll app (and also appears in their promotional content). </span></p>
<p class="p1">“[David] was not the first large creator that committed to Roll,&#8221; Zamudio told TechCrunch. &#8220;That’s definitely something that I don’t want to get misconstrued, is that this isn&#8217;t like… ‘David left Dispo and now David’s doing his own other thing,’ because it’s definitely not like that. David’s not one of the founding team members.”</p>
<p>He later elaborated via email: &#8220;At the end of the day, David is a creative and smart individual and we’re happy to have him involved alongside our other amazing creators. We really look at all of our roster on an equal playing field and value all of their input. I’m sure ties will be made to Dispo since David has had involvement in both, but as we discussed, David is a creator (not founder or team member) on Roll.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dispo and Roll have a similar DNA in that they both encourage more authentic posting &#8212; on Dispo, you can only see the photos you take the following morning, mimicking the nature of a disposable camera. But while Dispo is a social network, Roll is a creator monetization platform.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After David&#8217;s Disposable blew up the way that it did, it pushed us way further into that creator economy world,&#8221; Zamudio told TechCrunch. &#8220;And as we got kind of closer to a lot of creators and just started hearing about the type of stuff they were going through, we kept hearing this one kind of problem keep coming up, and basically it was that they wanted to be able to get into the paywall space.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, Roll has raised a $500,000 angel investor round, led by Dan Beldy of Airwing Ventures.</p>
<p><em>Update, 1/18/21, 2:30 PM EST: The article&#8217;s original headline said that Roll was created by ex-Dispo founding members. While his Linkedin says he is a founding member at Dispo, Zamudio clarified to TechCrunch that he worked directly on the David&#8217;s Disposable app and not on Dispo. The headline has been changed to reflect this.</em></p>

<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>The administration says the site went live one day early as part of its beta phase, <a href="https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1483492527084875780" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">according to</a> <em>CNN</em> chief White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins. Officials are hoping to troubleshoot the site and ensure the official launch goes smoothly on Wednesday. Sure enough, at the time of writing, some people were having trouble loading the site, so you might not be able to place an order right away.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The COVIDtests.gov site provides some more information about the tests. You should see results within 30 minutes and can be taken anywhere. It provides guidance on when to take a test, as well as directions on what to do based on the results. The site also has resources about testing sites and insurance reimbursement for at-home tests.</p>
<p>The Biden administration said it was buying a billion rapid, at-home COVID-19 tests to distribute to Americans. Half of those are expected to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/order-covid-19-test-free-government-204832596.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">available for order this week</a>. The White House said its goal was to make sure everyone has a test available when they need one, especially given that tests are in high demand and are often difficult to find in stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people don’t realize it, but many of the devices and apps you use every day are built on top of open source software, maintained by one or two developers that aren’t paid for their time, who patch bugs and improve their code to give back to the community or as a passion project.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take <a href="https://curl.se/">cURL</a>, for example, a library that makes it simple for software to access data in another system, such as in an API. The library is used in practically every modern connected device, from the iPhone to cars, smart fridges and TVs—and </span><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-internet-relies-on-people-working-for-free-a79104a68bcc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet it’s essentially been maintained by a single developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Daniel Steinberg, for free for almost three decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite many open source projects being included in for-profit software and devices, generally without compensation outside of a simple acknowledgment, the system mostly works reliably. Some open source developers are able to successfully support their work through programs like </span><a href="https://github.com/sponsors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub Sponsors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy Me A Coffee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, maintenance contracts with companies, or taking a job at a company that pays them to maintain their library—but this is far from the norm.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258658" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This system’s inequity is often revealed when there’s a widespread security breach, </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as the Log4shell vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that emerged in the Log4j Java library in December 2021, triggering a slew of critical security vulnerability bulletins that affected some of the largest companies in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developers of the affected library were </span><a href="https://twitter.com/yazicivo/status/1469349956880408583"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forced to work around the clock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to mitigate the problems, without compensation or much acknowledgement that their work had been used for free in the first place. cURL’s </span><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-internet-relies-on-people-working-for-free-a79104a68bcc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer experienced similar behavior</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with companies depending on his projects demanding he fly out to help them when they faced trouble with their code, despite not paying him for his services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, it shouldn’t be a surprise that some open source developers are beginning to realize they wield outsized power, despite the lack of compensation they receive for their work, because their projects are used by some of the largest, most profitable companies in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early January, for example, Marak Squires, the developer of two popular NPM packages, ‘colors’ and ‘faker,’ </span><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intentionally introduced changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their code that broke their functionality for anyone using them, </span><a href="https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/commit/074a0f8ed0c31c35d13d28632bd8a049ff136fb6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outputting “LIBERTY LIBERTY LIBERTY”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> followed by gibberish and an infinite loop when used. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Squires didn’t comment on the reason for making the changes, he had </span><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210704022108/https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/issues/1046"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on GitHub that “I am no longer going to support Fortune 500s ( and other smaller sized companies ) with my free work.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squires’ changes broke other popular projects, including </span><a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/18323"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon’s Cloud Development Kit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as his libraries were installed almost 20 million times per week on npm, with thousands of projects directly depending on them. Within a few hours, NPM had rolled back the rogue release and GitHub suspended the developer’s account in response. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While NPM’s response was to be expected after <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-npm-library-hijacked-to-install-password-stealers-miners/">previous incidents</a> in which malicious code was added to libraries and was ultimately rolled back to limit damage, GitHub’s was a new one: the code hosting platform took down Squires’ entire account, even though he was the owner of the code and was his rights to change it as he pleased. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t the first time a developer has pulled their code in protest, either. The developer of ‘left-pad’ </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pulled his code from NPM in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, breaking tens of thousands of websites that depended on it following a fight with the Kik messenger over the naming of another open source project he owned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s astonishing is that despite the occasional high-profile libraries protesting the way the industry works, these types of incidents aren’t all that common: open source developers continue to work for free, maintaining their projects as best they can, even though multi-million dollar products being created off of the back of their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the White House has acknowledged the importance of open source to the technology industry after a meeting with the industry following the Log4J incidents, </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/13/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-software-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying in January 2022 that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “open source software brings unique value, and has unique security challenges, because of its breadth of use and the number of volunteers responsible for its ongoing security maintenance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, despite this declaration, massively popular open source software is woefully underfunded—at least until it gains the spotlight. Before the </span><a href="https://heartbleed.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heartbleed vulnerability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> put the wider internet at risk, the affected open-source project, OpenSSL, </span><a href="http://veridicalsystems.com/blog/of-money-responsibility-and-pride/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received just $2,000 per year in donations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which grew to $9,000 after the issues came to light. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team behind OpenSSL, </span><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/is-your-networking-device-affected-by-heartbleed"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is used by practically every modern networking device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, wrote at the time that “[t]here should be at least a half dozen full time OpenSSL team members, not just one, able to concentrate on the care and feeding of OpenSSL.” Instead, the project team continues to find contracting work to cover the cost of maintaining the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers could change their open source license, turn their work into products, or hustle for more sponsors, but </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/01/07/open-source-has-a-funding-problem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for every project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Until the industry figures out a better way to fund all of this free work—which nobody seems forthcoming about—we should expect more open source developers to perform acts of disobedience, intentionally breaking their work to shine the light on what they’re contributing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This just isn’t sustainable in the long run—but it isn’t clear how we’re going to get out of this mess, as the use of open source balloons in every piece of software and connected device produced today, but continues to depend on a few open source developers not having a terrible day and deciding to break everything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a library like cURL, which is used by millions of devices, is included in everything from your washing machine to your car, but its creator gets tired of supporting it and decides to send a message to the world, then what? We’ve been lucky in the past that the damage could be rolled back, but we might not be so lucky in the future. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even though the only thing the robot can do right now is pull weeds, <a href="https://www.aigen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aigen</a> is adamant it isn&#8217;t building a weed-whacking robot. It claims to be on a mission to terraform the earth, and says it has a path toward making agriculture carbon negative. It must have made a compelling argument, because it just announced a $4 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.nea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEA</a>, with participation from <a href="https://agfunder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AgFunder</a>, <a href="https://www.globalfounderscapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Founders Capital</a> and <a href="https://regen.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReGen Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>The company is building solar-powered, autonomous robots that can zoom around in fields, using computer vision to tell friend from foe and plant from weed. In its first incarnation, the robot &#8212; in a fine &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hot dog / not hot dog</a>&#8221; impersonation &#8212; simply bumbles about, covering up to three acres of farmland per day.</p>
<p>&#8220;My relatives are farmers in Minnesota, and I&#8217;ve been talking with them for quite some time. They&#8217;re really experiencing some trouble with traditional agriculture approaches. Even the diehard people that love chemicals, that love tilling the earth and other practices that have been releasing carbon in the atmosphere for thousands of years are starting to realize, hey, maybe we should be open to other ways to do this,&#8221; reflects Richard Wurden, CEO at Aigen. He is particularly passionate about throwing agriculture&#8217;s carbon output in reverse. &#8220;Right now, agriculture is about 16% of carbon emissions. In the future, it has the potential to go negative, by reducing diesel emissions, soil compaction, chemical usage and reducing tilling.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258249" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The basic premise the startup makes is that overall, photosynthesis is carbon negative: Plants take CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air and turn that into sugars &#8211; &#8211; carbohydrates, to be exact. In effect, the plants are taking carbon out of the air and sticking it back into the earth. Aigen argues that by changing technology and the ways agriculture is done, carbon neutrality &#8212; or even negativity &#8212; is within reach. The weed-picking robot is merely the first step along the company&#8217;s path, the founders claim &#8212; create something that has real value now, in order to expand the platform and fulfill more and more of its mission further down the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are collecting data through images. There&#8217;s multiple cameras on the robot, and we are using an AI onboard that we&#8217;ve pre-trained to identify plants and various objects. Once we know what we are looking at, we either remove or propagate the plants with two robot arms underneath the robot,&#8221; explains Kenny Lee, the company&#8217;s COO, making an argument for the company&#8217;s smaller, lighter robots. &#8220;Heavy machinery compresses the soil, which means that the roots grow sideways, instead of down. That&#8217;s a problem, because you can&#8217;t put the carbon the plants capture deep into the ground. By using fewer tractors and large commercial devices, you can change how agriculture works.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aigen’s technology leverages best-in-class AI and robotics to provide an elegant solution to several of humanity’s biggest problems,&#8221; said Andrew Schoen, partner at NEA,&#8221; Their product unlocks nature’s superpower to sequester substantial amounts of atmospheric carbon at planetary scale.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supply chain issues continue to have a major impact on smartphone manufacturers per <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-smartphone-market-Q4-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released figures</a> from analyst firm Canalys &#8212; global shipments grew only 1% year over year in the final quarter of 2021. The numbers come on the tail of<a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-smartphone-sales-q3-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Q3 reports</a>, which saw an overall drop of 6%, citing similar issues over component supply.</p>
<p>The firm also factors in a resurgence of COVID-19, courtesy of the omicron variant, which has sent a number of locals into shutdown reminiscent of the pandemic’s early days roughly two years ago. Canalys notes that this impact is greatest among the smaller manufacturers in the market, who have had the greatest issues finding new suppliers.</p>
<p>“Component manufacturers are eking out additional production, but it will take years for major foundries to significantly increase chip capacity,” the firm’s Mobility VP Nicole Peng said in a statement tied to the new figures. “Smartphone brands are already innovating to make the most of their circumstances, tweaking device specs in response to available materials, approaching emerging chipmakers to secure new sources for ICs, focusing product lines on the best-selling models and staggering new product releases.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258805" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Larger companies remain less impacted overall by shortages and bottlenecks. The quarter also saw Apple return to the overall top spot in the global market, after three quarters away. The company’s rise is attributed to the success of the iPhone 13 and an extremely solid performance in Mainland China &#8212; the world’s largest smartphone market.</p>
<p>Apple’s overall marketshare ticked up from 12% to 23% of the market since last quarter. The previous drop owed in part, to the company’s trouble meeting demand in a number of regions in recent quarters.</p>
<p>“Apple’s supply chain is starting to recover, but it was still forced to cut production in Q4 amid shortages of key components and could not make enough iPhones to meet demand,” says analyst Sanyam Chaurasia. “In prioritized markets, it maintained adequate delivery times, but in some markets its customers had to wait to get their hands on the latest iPhones.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung, meanwhile, dropped to second, from 23% to 20% of the total market. Chinese manufacturers Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo rounded out the top five for Q4.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automaker Ford and ADT, a company that provides home and business security and alarm monitoring services, have launched a joint venture called Canopy that aims to address vulnerabilities in current vehicle security offerings.</p>
<p>Canopy will initially offer an aftermarket accessory that can be mounted onto a vehicle to monitor its surroundings and alert drivers of issues like theft or vandalism.</p>
<p>While built-in vehicle alarm systems help deter some thefts, they&#8217;re by no means foolproof. <a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-auto-theft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2020, the FBI estimated that $7.4 billion was lost to motor vehicle theft</a>, which includes both the theft of vehicles themselves and their contents. Canopy&#8217;s product, which has been operating in pilots over the past 10 months with trucking companies in the U.S. and cargo vans in the U.K., aims to combine Ford&#8217;s vehicle camera systems expertise with ADT&#8217;s monitoring service to help commercial and retail customers avoid vehicle theft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258584" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Canopy is ADT&#8217;s first foray into automotive security, and is a product of FordX, the automaker&#8217;s new venture incubator that collaborates with other companies to quickly build, acquire and pilot new transportation technologies. In 2018, FordX worked on Jelly, a dockless e-scooter sharing company, which was the basis for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/ford-buys-electric-scooter-startup-spin/">Ford&#8217;s acquisition of Spin</a>. Canopy appears to be the next step in Ford&#8217;s strategy to expand its portfolio of scalable mobility solutions outside of its traditional business lines.</p>
<p>Canopy&#8217;s self-sticking accessory works with any vehicle make or model and is expected to be sold online and at various brick-and-mortar stores by early 2023. It relies on a stack of sensors, including camera, radar and acoustic sensors, to collect data about the vehicle&#8217;s surroundings. An operating system independent from the car&#8217;s own then processes the data, and shares back to cloud servers via LTE or Wi-Fi. Any possible thefts will be reported to the vehicle owner via a mobile app or to one of ADT&#8217;s 5,000 monitoring agents, according to Leah Page, VP of mobile security and strategic projects at ADT.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you think about the element ADT brings to the product, it&#8217;s really about helping to bring in AI solutions,&#8221; Page told TechCrunch. &#8220;So that&#8217;s knowing the difference between a bird going by and somebody breaching the cargo bed of your truck to steal something. Once that event happens it does come into ADT and then our monitoring agents know how to react. That can be anything from just alerting the owner or an emergency contact all the way through to alerting the police, depending on the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the line, Canopy intends to release another monitoring system that integrates into any car&#8217;s hardware and relies on that vehicle&#8217;s cameras and sensors to perform the same safety features. Ford will be Canopy&#8217;s first integration, but the aim is to make all of Canopy&#8217;s tech available to any automaker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In order to make this offer really meaningful to customers, we had to do it in a way that was multi-make and would enable us to address the security concerns for the vehicles that are already out on the road today,&#8221; Christian Moran, director of FordX and interim CEO of Canopy, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at one solution that can run across a myriad of trucks and vans, which are our target vehicles to start in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canopy initially set out with a focus on commercial customers, thinking of both large fleets carrying priceless cargo and small business owners who have thousands of dollars worth of tools and equipment in the beds of their trucks and are often the victims of theft. That&#8217;s still going to be the first target for rollout beginning early next year. Throughout the pilots, however, use cases for the average consumer started to come up, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got tremendous feedback from people who put bikes or kayaks in the back of their truck or van while going out on the trail, and those items are very expensive so they want them to be protected,&#8221; said Moran. &#8220;In addition, although this was not one of our original features, we heard from a number of pilot participants that one of their favorite features was actually livestreaming around their vehicle when it was dark out at night. So imagine walking into a dark, empty parking lot and you can use the app to see around your vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of the pilots, Canopy ended up turning over evidence to vehicle owners of two different theft attempts, said Moran, adding that customers could use Canopy&#8217;s footage to work with police and insurance companies.</p>
<p>Together, Ford and ADT have invested a total of $105 million in the joint venture, with Ford chipping in $63 million and ADT $42 million. The money will be used to hire across the product, engineering and go-to-market teams in the U.K. and the U.S., as well as setting up the supply chain and logistics for the aftermarket product so it can scale over the next few years.</p>

This makes &#8220;future of work&#8221; a hot topic among investors, but that means different things to different people.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of what kind of opportunities &#8220;future of work&#8221; encompasses from an investor perspective, The Exchange called on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericboustouller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Boustouller</a>, who joined French multi-stage VC firm <a href="https://c4v.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C4 Ventures</a> last fall.</p>
<p>An industry veteran whose former roles include presiding over Microsoft in Western Europe and being CEO of Solocal, Boustouller also has a track record as an angel investor, with a sweet spot for B2B SaaS.</p>

It is the last that we discussed at length with him. What follows is a selection of topics from our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Future of work&#8217; is not entirely new</h2>
<p><strong>Eric Boustouller: </strong>Some 15 years ago, at Microsoft, we were talking about &#8220;the new world of work.&#8221; It has now become &#8220;the future of work.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may remember how a few years ago, then-CEO Steve Ballmer was calling out the so-called &#8220;consumerization of IT.&#8221; What was it all about? It was just that at the time, it became clear, and it&#8217;s even more obvious now, that people at work and consumers want the same tools at home and in the office. That was a disruption: It was no longer the IT department that was driving the show anymore, but the users themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last August, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/twitter-report-misinformation/">introduced</a> a new feature in select markets, including the U.S., that invited users to report misinformation they encountered on its platform &#8212; including things like election-related or COVID-19 misinformation, for example. Now the company is rolling out the feature to more markets as its test expands. In addition to the U.S., Australia and South Korea, where the feature had already gone live, Twitter is rolling out the reporting option to users in Brazil, Spain and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The company also offered an update on the feature&#8217;s traction, noting that the company has received more than <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1483094056347443202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.7 million</a> user-submitted reports since its debut. For context, Twitter has around 211 million monetizable active daily users, as of its most <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Final-Q3'21-Shareholder-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent earnings</a>, 37 million of which are U.S.-based and 174 million based in international markets.</p>
<div>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1483094056347443202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoel Roth</a>, Twitter&#8217;s head of site integrity, the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of content the company takes action on for misinformation is identified proactively through automation (which accounts for 50%+ of enforcements) or proactive monitoring. User-submitted reports via the new feature, however, are used by Twitter to identify patterns of misinformation &#8212; an area where Twitter has seen the most success so far from the feature, Roth says. This is particularly true in areas like non-text-based misinformation like media and URLs that link to content hosted off Twitter&#8217;s platform.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But he also noted that when Twitter reviewed a subset of individual reported tweets, only around 10% were considered &#8220;actionable&#8221; compared with 20-30% in other policy areas, as many tweets analyzed didn&#8217;t contain misinformation at all.</div>
<div></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we&#39;re expanding this test feature to folks tweeting from Brazil, Spain, or the Philippines.

<p>Stay tuned for more to come. <a href="https://t.co/wB3P66Dl1Q">https://t.co/wB3P66Dl1Q</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In markets where the feature is available, users can report misinformation by clicking the three-dot menu in the upper-right of a tweet, then choosing the &#8220;report tweet&#8221; option. From there, they&#8217;ll be able to click the option &#8220;it&#8217;s misleading.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Twitter already offered a way to report violating content on its platform before the addition of the new flagging option, its existing reporting flow didn&#8217;t offer a clear way to report tweets containing misinformation. Instead, users would have to pick from options like &#8220;it&#8217;s suspicious or spam&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s abusive or harmful,&#8221; among others, before further narrowing down how the specific tweet was in violation of Twitter&#8217;s rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ability to flag tweets as misinformation allows users to more quickly and directly flag content that may not fit into existing rules, as well. But the reports themselves are tied into Twitter&#8217;s existing enforcement flow, where a combination of human review and moderation is used to determine if a punitive action should take place. Twitter had also said the reported tweets would be sorted for review based on priority &#8212; meaning tweets from accounts with a large following or those showing higher levels of engagement would be reviewed first.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out at a time when social networks are being pressured to clean up the misinformation they&#8217;ve allowed to spread across their platforms, or risk regulation that will enforce such cleanups and perhaps even enact penalties for not doing so.</p>
<p>The flagging option is not the only way Twitter is working to fight misinformation. The company also runs an experiment called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/twitter-starts-rolling-out-birdwatch-fact-checks-inside-tweets/">Birdwatch</a>, which aims to crowdsource fact-checking by allowing Twitter users to annotate misleading tweets with factual information. This service is still in pilot testing and being updated based on user feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two of the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce players <a href="https://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-com-and-shopify-ink-strategic-partnership-to-simplify-cross-border-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are joining joined hands</a>. Major Chinese online retailer JD.com has formed a strategic partnership with Ottawa-based Shopify to help global brands tap China&#8217;s enormous appetite for imported goods, as well as help Chinese merchants sell overseas.</p>
<p>The news is turning heads in China&#8217;s cross-border e-commerce community. The first part of the deal will put the JD-Shopify alliance in direct competition with Alibaba. The JD nemesis has a sprawling import business, which counted 35,000 international brands<a href="https://www.alizila.com/chinas-gen-z-lead-demand-for-imports-on-alibabas-tmall-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> as of late</a>. Last year, more than 6,000 brands entered China via Alibaba.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alibaba acquires NetEase Kaola in deal worth $2 billion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/alibaba-acquires-netease-kaola-in-deal-worth-2-billion/embed/#?secret=hUibYAIIAt" data-secret="hUibYAIIAt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>JD has been importing goods into China for years, but the existing brand onboarding process can take as long as a year. JD, often described as the Amazon of China for its heavy investment in logistics, will create a fast track for Shopify-powered brands to start selling to JD&#8217;s 500 million active buyers in as soon as four weeks. The platform will use tools like automated translation and price conversation to get sellers ready and will be flying goods via its fleet of cargo flights between the U.S. and China to start with.</p>
<p>JD doesn&#8217;t only intend to help brands market and sell in China. The company has also rolled out a neat supplier sourcing service for Shopify store owners called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhYJwnVDnc&amp;ab_channel=JDWorldwideApps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JD Sourcing</a>. Sellers will submit a product request via JD Sourcing, and once JD confirms the product is available in its inventory, the Chinese e-commerce company will get it to one of its overseas warehouses, ready to be listed on Shopify stores and sent to consumers via drop-shipping.</p>
<p>The other part of the deal, which is to bring Chinese goods overseas via Shopify&#8217;s direct-to-consumer solution, competes in a very crowded space. Amazon has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building itself up as a gateway for Chinese exporters</a>, employing an army of staff in the country to scour and manage merchants. While Amazon&#8217;s recent crackdown on fake reviews has sent shockwaves through China&#8217;s e-commerce industry, the Seattle-based titan remains a highly attractive channel for exporters, thanks to its market dominance.</p>
<p>To cope with stricter platform policies, many Amazon sellers are increasingly investing in product design and branding. Others choose to take up acquisition offers from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/markai-china-amazon-aggregator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand aggregators, also called Amazon roll-ups</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The JD-Shopify collaboration could offer a new alternative for Chinese exporters. Shopify has long been an option for those that want to amplify their brands, but autonomy comes with more work, requiring sellers to be more hands-on with marketing and logistics fulfillment.</p>
<p>Through the Shopify partnership, JD promises to &#8220;simplify access and compliance for Chinese brands and merchants looking to reach consumers in Western markets&#8221; and support them to &#8220;set up their DTC channels through Shopify.&#8221; Cross-border shipping will be taken care of by JD.</p>
<p>The two e-commerce giants appear to complement each other nicely &#8212; Shopify brings the range of products and JD offers its extensive global warehousing and shipping infrastructure. It&#8217;s an alliance worth watching.</p>
