										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://datacy.com/">Datacy</a>, a startup with its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/datacy-1/about/">headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware</a>, announced that it has closed $2.4 million in new funding to continue building its consumer-friendly data collection and monetization service.</p>
<p>The company is effectively an argument that the preceding sentence is possible. Datacy is a tool that allows individuals to collect their browsing data, manage it, have it anonymized and aggregated with others and then sold. The end-user gets 85% of the resulting revenue, while Datacy takes 15%.</p>
<p>Its model has found financial backing, with its new capital coming from Trend Forward Capital, Truesight Ventures, Redhawk VC, the Female Founders Alliance and others. The startup raised the funds using a convertible note that was capped at $9.5 million, though TechCrunch is not certain whether or not there were other terms associated with the fundraising mechanism.</p>
<p>Regardless, Datacy&#8217;s model fits into the modestly more privacy-forward stance that the technology world has taken in recent years; Apple is not the only company looking to make hay off of what some consider to be rising consumer interest in keeping their activities, and data, to themselves. But what Datacy wants to do is merge the consumer privacy impulse with profit.</p>
<p>According to company co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/indiloparoma?lang=en">Paroma Indilo</a>, her startup is not a cookie blocker. She told TechCrunch that if someone wants to block data collection, there are good tools for the task in the market already. What Datacy wants to do, she said, is evolve from its current status as a control platform to the way that data is shared and exchanged, built atop user consent. With monetization, we&#8217;d add.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a better vision for the future than the hellscape adtech and data-vendor market that we&#8217;ve become accustomed to.</p>
<p>Today the startup has live beta users, allowing it to learn and collect initial data. The company is waiting to make the business side of its operation open to all until it has 50,000 users; Indilo told TechCrunch that individual data is not worth much, but in aggregate it can be worth quite a lot. So to see the startup wait to scale up its sales operations until it has a larger user base is reasonable.</p>
<p>It may not be too long until Datacy reaches that 50,000 user mark. From a current base of 10,000, and what Indilo described as 30% monthly growth via word of mouth, it could hit that mark in a half-year or so.</p>
<p>Datacy is one of those early-stage bets that has a lot of potential, but also a notable helping of risk. If it can attract the masses it needs to prove out the economics of its model, its payments to its user base could make growth a self-fulfilling destiny. But if its ability to garner more users slows, it could fail to reach sufficient scale for its model to work whatsoever.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a good use of venture capital, in other words. We&#8217;ll check back in with Datacy in a few months to see how close it is to its 50,000 user goal. And how its bet that consumers want their data back is playing out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://databricks.com">Databricks</a> launched its fifth open source project today, a new tool called <a href="https://delta.io/sharing">Delta Sharing</a> designed to be a vendor neutral way to share data with any cloud infrastructure or SaaS product, so long as you have the appropriate connector. It&#8217;s part of the broader Databricks open source <a href="https://delta.io/">Delta Lake project</a>.</p>
<p>As CEO Ali Ghodsi points out, data is exploding and moving data from Point A to Point B is an increasingly difficult problem to solve with proprietary tooling. &#8220;The number one barrier for organizations to succeed with data is sharing data, sharing it between different views, sharing it across organizations &#8212; that&#8217;s the number one issue we&#8217;ve seen in organizations,&#8221; Ghodsi explained.</p>
<p>Delta Sharing is an open source protocol designed to solve that problem. &#8220;This is the industry&#8217;s first ever open protocol, an open standard for sharing a data set securely. [&#8230;] They can standardize on Databricks or something else. For instance, they might have standardized on using AWS Data Exchange, Power BI or Tableau &#8212; and they can then access that data securely.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The tool is designed to work with multiple cloud infrastructure and SaaS services and out of the gate there are multiple partners involved including the Big Three cloud infrastructure vendors Amazon, Microsoft and Google, as well as data visualization and management vendors like Qlik, Starburst, Collibra and Alation and data providers like Nasdaq, S&amp;P and Foursquare</p>
<p>Ghodsi said the key to making this work is the open nature of the project. By doing that and donating it to The Linux Foundation, he is trying to ensure that it can work across different environments. Another big aspect of this is the partnerships and the companies involved. When you can get big name companies involved in a project like this, it&#8217;s more likely to succeed because it works across this broad set of popular services. In fact, there are a number of connectors available today, but Databricks expects that number to increase over time as contributors build more connectors to other services.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why one Databricks investor thinks the company may be undervalued&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/why-one-databricks-investor-thinks-the-company-may-be-undervalued/embed/#?secret=lpI2pPBI7L" data-secret="lpI2pPBI7L" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Databricks operates on a consumption pricing model much like Snowflake, meaning the more data you move through its software, the more money it&#8217;s going to make, but the Delta Sharing tool means you can share with anyone, not just another Databricks customer. Ghodsi says that the open source nature of Delta Sharing means his company can still win, while giving customers more flexibility to move data between services.</p>
<p>The infrastructure vendors also love this model because the cloud data lake tools move massive amounts of data through their services and they make money too, which probably explains why they are all on board with this.</p>
<p>One of the big fears of modern cloud customers is being tied to a single vendor as they often were in the 1990s and early 2000s when most companies bought a stack of services from a single vendor like Microsoft, IBM or Oracle. On one hand, you had the veritable single throat to choke, but you were beholden to the vendor because the cost of moving to another one was prohibitively high. Companies don&#8217;t want to be locked in like that again and open source tooling is one way to prevent that.</p>
<p>Databricks was founded in 2013 and has raised almost $2 billion since. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">latest round was in February</a> for $1 billion at a $28 billion valuation, an astonishing number for a private company. Snowflake, a primary competitor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/snowflakes-ipo-could-value-it-as-high-as-24b-salesforce-and-berkshire-to-invest/">went public last September</a>. As of today, it has a market cap of over $66 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another day, another mobility SPAC deal. This time, it’s <a href="https://tritiumcharging.com/">Tritium</a>, a Brisbane-based developer and producer of direct current fast EV chargers that is taking the SPAC path to the public market in a deal valuing the company at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Tritium said Wednesday it will be heading to the Nasdaq via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp. II, or DCRN. The transaction is expected to generate gross proceeds of up to $403 million. Tritium will be listed under the ticker “DCFC.” This particular SPAC deal is unusual in that it does not include private investment in public equity, or PIPE — a fundraising round that typically occurs at the time of the merger and injects more capital into the company.</p>
<p>Founded in 2001, Tritium manufactures charger hardware and software for direct current fast chargers. Its products can recharge an EV battery, adding 20 miles in a minute or 100 miles in five minutes, DPAC II chairman Robert Tichio said during an investors call Wednesday. DC chargers are more costly than alternating current (AC) chargers but they send power to the vehicle much more quickly. Generally, AC chargers are installed at home, where a driver can plug in their vehicle overnight, while DC chargers are more frequently found at public charging stations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Drivers will want the experience of public charging to be as close as possible to their current experience at the gas pump – just a few minutes to get enough range to get on with your day,” Hunter said.</p>
<p>Tritium’s largest market is Europe, which composes around 70% of the company’s revenue, followed by North America at 20% and Asia at 10%, Tritium CEO Jane Hunter told investors Wednesday. The company will use the capital from the transaction to expand its manufacturing capacity and grow sales.</p>
<p>Demand for public EV charging stations is expected to mushroom over the next two decades alongside the growing market share of EVs. According to analysts Grandview Research, the EV charging infrastructure market was valued at $2 billion in 2020. It is expected to grow by nearly 39% through 2028. President Joe Biden said building out a national EV charging network was a key priority under his proposed $2 trillion infrastructure plan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rock picking is probably not the first thing you think about when you think agricultural robotics. Understandably so. There are a number of companies out there looking to automate aspects like fruit and vegetable picking, weeding and field tending, but rocks are still a major issue for many farmers. They’re big, they’re heavy and they can really mess up a piece of machinery.</p>
<p>“This is something I’ve personally dealt with my entire life,” TerraClear CEO Brent Frei said in a press release. “There are more than 400 million arable acres worldwide that have been waiting for a cost-effective and productive solution to this problem. Repetitive tasks like this are optimal targets for automation, and the technologies we are bringing to the field dramatically reduce the labor and time needed to prep fields for planting.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1ELdkR1Bbo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TerraClear has built an automated robotic solution, capable of picking up to 400 rocks per hour and picking and moving ones weighing up to 300 pounds. Back in 2019, the Bellevue, Washington-based company announced a $6 million raise to expand its offering, and today it has announced a $25 million Series A.</p>
<p>Madrona Venture Group returns to lead the round, which brings its total funding up to $38 million. The funding will go toward scaling up the company’s production and sales for next year, as well as growing headcount. TerraClear’s Rock Picker robot is now up for preorder. The system works with mapping and third-party drone systems, using AI to identify large rocks, which the robot can then be deployed to clear out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain industries were hit harder by the COVID-19 pandemic than others, especially in its early days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses, including retailers and restaurants, were negatively impacted by lockdowns and the resulting closures. They had to adapt quickly to survive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they didn’t use much technology before, they were suddenly being forced to, as so many things shifted to digital last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For companies like <a href="http://www.spoton.com">SpotOn</a>, it was a pivotal moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, which provides software and payments for restaurants and SMBs, had to step up to help the businesses it serves. Not only for their sake, but its own.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really took a hard look at what was happening to our clients. And we realized we needed to pivot, just to be able to support them,” co-CEO and co-founder Matt Hyman recalls. “We had to make a decision because our revenues also were taking a big hit, just like our clients were. Rather than lay off staff or require salary deductions, we stayed true to our core values and just kept plugging away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that “plugging away” has paid off. Today, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpotOn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced it has achieved unicorn status with a $125 million Series D funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers DST Global, 01 Advisors, Dragoneer Investment Group and Franklin Templeton also participated in the financing, in addition to new investor Mubadala Investment Company. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How COVID-19 accelerated DoorDash&#8217;s business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/embed/#?secret=twfojPMWgT" data-secret="twfojPMWgT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, the round triples the company’s valuation to $1.875 billion compared to its $625 million valuation at the time of its Series C raise last September. It also marks San Francisco-based SpotOn’s third funding event since March 2020, and brings the startup’s total funding to $328 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its efforts have also led to impressive growth for the company, which has seen its revenue triple since February 2020, according to Hyman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, SpotOn is taking on the likes of Square in the payments space. But the company says its offering extends beyond traditional payment processing and point-of-sale (POS) software. Its platform aims to give SMBs the ability to run their businesses “from building a brand to taking payments and everything in-between.” SpotOn’s goal is to be a “one-stop shop” by incorporating tools that include things such as custom website development, scheduling software, marketing, appointment scheduling, review management, analytics and digital loyalty.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2157462 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpotOn-restaurant-product-suite-e1621985760112.jpg" alt="" width="2042" height="947" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpotOn-restaurant-product-suite-e1621985760112.jpg 2042w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpotOn-restaurant-product-suite-e1621985760112.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpotOn-restaurant-product-suite-e1621985760112.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpotOn-restaurant-product-suite-e1621985760112.jpg?resize=768,356 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpotOn-restaurant-product-suite-e1621985760112.jpg?resize=680,315 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpotOn-restaurant-product-suite-e1621985760112.jpg?resize=1536,712 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpotOn-restaurant-product-suite-e1621985760112.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2042px) 100vw, 2042px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic hit, SpotOn ramped up and rolled out 400 “new product innovations,” Hyman said. It also did things like waive $1.5 million in fees (it’s a SaaS business, so for several months it waived its monthly fee, for example, for its integrated restaurant management system). It also acquired a company, SeatNinja, so that it could expand its offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because a lot of these businesses had to go digital literally overnight, we built a free website for them all,” Hyman said. SpotOn also did things like offer commission-free online ordering for restaurants and helped retail merchants update their websites for e-commerce. “Obviously these businesses were resilient,” Hyman said. “But such efforts also created a lot of loyalty.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, more than 30,000 businesses use SpotOn’s platform, according to Hyman, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 8,000 of those signing on this year. The company expects that number to triple by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, its customers are split about 60% retail and 40% restaurants, but the restaurant side of its business is growing rapidly, according to Hyman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for that, the company believes, is while restaurants initially rushed to add online ordering for delivery or curbside pickup, they soon realized they “wanted a more affordable and more integrated solution.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes SpotOn so appealing to its customers, Hyman said, is the fact that it offers an integrated platform so that businesses that use it can save “thousands of dollars” in payments and software fees to multiple, “à la carte” vendors. But it also can integrate with other platforms if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to growing its customer base and revenue, SpotOn has also boosted its headcount to about 1,250 employees (from 850 in March of 2020). Those employees are spread across its offices in San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit, Denver, Mexico City, Mexico and Krakow, Poland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpotOn is not currently profitable, which Hyman says is “by choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We could be cash flow positive technically whenever we choose to be. Right now we&#8217;re just so focused on product innovation and talent to exceed the needs of our clients,” he said. “We chose the capital plan so that we could really just double down on what&#8217;s working so well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">further accelerating product development and expanding its market presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re doubling down on our single integrated restaurant management system,” Hyman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise marks the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first time that a16z has put money in the startup, although General Partner David George told TechCrunch he was familiar with co-founders Matt Hyman and Zach Hyman through mutual friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George estimates that about 80% of restaurants and SMBs use legacy solutions “that are clunky and outdated, and not very customer friendly.” The COVID-19 pandemic has led to more of these businesses seeking digital options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think we’re in the very early days in the transition [to digital], and the opportunity is massive,” he told TechCrunch. “We believe we’re at the tipping point of a big tech replacement cycle for restaurant and small business software, and at the very early stages of this transition to modern cloud-native solutions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George was also effusive in his praise for how SpotOn has executed over the past 14 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are companies that build great products, and companies that can build great sales teams. And there are companies that offer really great customer service,” he said. “It’s rare that you find two of those and extremely rare to find all three of those as we have in SpotOn.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">Edtech has realized</a> it needs to build for the TikTok generation. It’s part of the reason we’re seeing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/what-the-masterclass-effect-means-for-edtech/">a rise in supplemental, aspirational companie</a>s such as Outschool and Masterclass, which both lean on snappy editing, engaging content, and most of all, on demand learning.</p>
<p>But a nut that is yet to be cracked is how to add measurable outcomes to the mix. As with every edtech startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">a common tension exists</a>: the platform has to be hard enough to teach consumers something, but fun (or easy) enough for them to actually use it.</p>
<p>The latest startup to throw its hat into the ring of frictionless learning is <a href="https://hiemile.com/">Emile Learning</a>, which offers on-demand high school classes, accredited or not, with high-quality production. The startup just closed a $3 million seed round led by Kleiner Perkins, which has also backed the likes of Duolingo and Coursera.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other investors include the Softbank Opportunity Fund, Uber Alum Syndicate, Owl Ventures, John Thornton, the former president of Goldman Sachs, Steven Galanis, founder of Cameo, and Ankur Nagpal, founder of Teachable. With the round, Emile’s total capital raised to date is $5.3 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020, Emile is built by a trio of Latino founders: CEO Felix Ruano, a McKinsey and Harvard alum, COO Michael Vilardo, an Uber and Nike alum and CTO Jon Quiros, a Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CSU Pomona alum.</p>
<p>“We want to create the go-to platform where a student, anywhere in the world, can access content in the most frictionless way possible,” Ruano said. “Not just for fun, not just logging into Youtube on the weekends, but instead a full end-to-end course and receiving high school credit for it.”</p>
<p>And given the fact that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/">“Zoom University”</a> has struggled with accountability and engagement, the founder is optimistic that its a good time for Emile to launch more broadly.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tired of &#8216;Zoom University&#8217;? So is edtech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/embed/#?secret=9qvHeMZ8kV" data-secret="9qvHeMZ8kV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company serves up virtual, high-quality production high school classes, ranging from AP language and AP biology to personal finance and acting. Emile began as a way to help students prepare for AP exams &#8211; since a good score can help a student get college credit once they enter undergrad and save them thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Now, less than a year since founding, it added on an accredited set of classes that can be used in high school, too. Students can get high school credit via a WASC accredited transcript, in addition to college credit via AP classes.</p>
<p>Vilardo explained how APs were a wedge to get them into the minds of high schoolers, but thinks the bigger opportunity will be for-credit within the schools themselves.</p>
<p>“The students may come for AP piece, but they&#8217;re gonna have a chance with low risk, high potential to engage in some of these experiential style courses, and maybe they end up deciding early in high school if they love finance or they love coding,” he said.</p>
<p>To create its content, Emile company sources top high school and college teachers across the United States, flys them to Los Angeles and shoots content there. Right now there are over 20 classes on the platform, with the goal of getting to 30 classes by September.</p>
<p>Over 50,000 students have used its platform to date, the company claims.</p>
<h2>&#8216;99% of investors still have no idea&#8217;</h2>
<p>Emile charges students an annual fee to use its platform, a sum that can range between $100 to $200. While this is more economically accessible than private tutoring, the team isn’t set on this as Emile&#8217;s only monetization strategy.</p>
<p>“The way this becomes a billion-dollar company is the government-funded system,” he said. The COO estimates that around $600 billion flows into high school education in the United States every year from the government. The COVID-19 relief fund, which has recently begun hitting high schools, is part of this wave &#8211; and Emile could be recipient of those dollars if it is successful.</p>

<p>Ruano explained how, even with a bigger spotlight on edtech in the wake of the pandemic, “99% of investors still have no idea” about the importance of optionality in high school coursework.</p>
<p>“On average, they’ve gone through the best learning experiences their entire lives,” he said. “The idea that there is a legacy edtech market around for-credit classes is a completely new concept to them.” The key here was finding investors who came from diverse learning backgrounds to understand the importance of Emile’s pitch.</p>
<p>There’s been a number of high-school focused startups that have raised in the past year, including <a href="https://www.ggeedu.com/">Galileo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/fiveable-hours-acquisition/">Fiveable</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/with-2-7m-in-fresh-funding-sora-hopes-to-bring-virtual-high-school-to-the-mainstream/"> Sora Schools</a>. Kleiner Perkins, the lead check in Emile’s seed round, took two days from pitch to check.</p>
<p>It will be key to see how these companies don’t repeat the history of AltSchool, a San Francisco-based edtech company that opened up physical schools to replace traditional grade schools. While investors flocked to the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/22/altschool-wants-to-change-how-kids-learn-but-fears-that-its-failing-students-are-surfacing/">families and educators ultimately got frustrated </a>at the pressure that scaling put on AltSchool students and outcomes. Unlike Emile, AltSchool was selling personalized education to younger kids &#8211; not high schoolers.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the past has given any startup that aims to replace traditional schooling a clear message: go slow, and don’t break too many things when it comes to education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kodiak Robotics, the U.S.-based self-driving truck startup, is partnering with South Korean conglomerate SK to explore the possibility of deploying its autonomous vehicle technology in Asia.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of the partnership is to sell and distribute Kodiak&#8217;s self-driving technology in the region. Kodiak will examine how it can use SK&#8217;s products, components and technology for its autonomous system, including artificial intelligence microprocessors and advanced emergency braking systems. Both companies have also agreed to work together to provide fleet management services for customers in Asia.</p>
<p>Kodiak co-founder and CEO Don Burnette couched the initial agreement as a first step towards a commercial enterprise in Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is really just the first handful of steps to explore the possibility,&#8221; Burnette said. &#8220;What would it would look like to bring Kodiak&#8217;s AV technologies to Asian markets? What would be required? Who would be the partners? What are the regulatory forces that we have to contend with?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kodiak, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. and has operations in Texas, would be squaring off against at least two other self-driving companies — Plus and TuSimple — that already have a presence in the region. Both Plus and TuSimple announced mergers in the past six months with special purpose acquisition companies, an increasingly popular path for startup to go public.</p>
<p>While the partnership is at its earliest stage, it does connect Kodiak with a company that has a vast reach in South Korea as well as other countries in the region. The partnership is with SK Inc., a holding company of SK Group that has more than 120 operating companies, including ones connected to the logistics industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership with Kodiak will help accelerate the commercialization of self-driving trucks in Asia,&#8221; said Jungho Shin, executive vice president of SK Inc. &#8220;Kodiak&#8217;s industry-leading technology and SK&#8217;s unrivaled reach in Korea and across Asia make this a natural partnership. We look forward to working with Kodiak to make autonomous trucking a reality around the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burnette told TechCrunch the partnership agreement was reached after SK conducted an extensive technical review.</p>
<p>&#8220;They recognize the importance of AV technology broadly, they recognize the safety benefits, the economic benefits, and they want to play a role,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is Kodiak&#8217;s first international expansion. But it might not be the last. Burnette said the company has been interested in certain international markets since it launched in 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had conversations about the Australian market,&#8221; Burnette noted. &#8220;I think Australia is another great market with future potential for this AV technology, particularly the long-haul highway, out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere kind of driving. There&#8217;s South American markets. Brazil is a big one that&#8217;s interesting to us, and, of course, Europe.</p>
<p>This partnership with SK Inc. follows an announcement with the U.S. Air Force for a contract to bring autonomous transportation to the U.S. Department of Defense&#8217;s Dover Air Force base in Delaware.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today announced it&#8217;s adding a new feature to help connect online shoppers to product drops through its app. Drops, which are a newer e-commerce trend, help sellers create buzz for forthcoming products in the days and weeks leading up to their availability. The products themselves are often only available in limited supplies or for a short period of time, increasing demand.</p>
<p>On Instagram, drops will now have their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_n/shopping_home?destination=drops">own destination</a> inside the app at the top of the Shop tab, where consumers can discover, browse and shop all the latest product launches as well as view upcoming launches. Shoppers can also sign up to receive reminders about products they&#8217;re interested in from here, and look through products and collections from other drops that recently took place on Instagram.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157687" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157687" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2157687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9477.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9477.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9477.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9477.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9477.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9477.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9477.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9477.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9477.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157687" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of Drops on Instagram</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like other online shopping offered through Instagram, consumers can make their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_n/shopping_home?destination=drops">Drops</a> purchases directly in the Instagram app itself via Checkout on Instagram, not by visiting third-party websites. This model will eventually allow Instagram to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/223030991929920?id=533228987210412">collect fees</a> on purchases &#8212; something that&#8217;s become a more important part of Facebook and Instagram&#8217;s overall business model in the wake of Apple&#8217;s privacy crackdown on iOS apps that <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/facebook-could-take-a-multibillion-revenue-hit-from-apples-idfa-changes/">impacts</a> Facebook&#8217;s ad revenues.</p>
<p>However, Instagram has temporarily waived its selling fees to both help businesses who are recovering from the last year of Covid. The move will also help it to gain ground in online shopping against new competitors, including TikTok.</p>
<p>Brands on Instagram had already been running drops before today, following Instagram&#8217;s release of a product reminders feature <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/new-testing-product-launches-for-instagram-shopping">back in 2019</a> that allowed consumers to get notified when an item they were interested in became available for purchase. To date, brands across fashion, beauty, streetwear and others have leveraged the feature, the company says, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hillhouse">Hill House Home</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dragunbeauty">Dragun Beauty</a>, adidas, and others.</p>
<p>The new Drops location simply organizes the product launches in one place to make it easier to browse and shop. Instagram tells us it&#8217;s curating the featured drops in this section. To be considered, brands need to use the product launch feature which is available to businesses on Checkout with Instagram.</p>
<p>At launch, some of the drops available include today&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/officialnocta/">Drake x NOCTA ‘Cardinal Stock’ collection</a> and upcoming drops like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wrenandglory">Wren + Glory</a> hand-painted summer collection and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ctilburymakeup">Charlotte Tilbury</a> Exclusive Pillow Talk Lips &amp; Dreams Lashes Kit. This week, there are five total drops available. This number will vary from week to week as Instagram continues to test the new feature, the company tells us.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157689" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157689" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2157689" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9478.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9478.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9478.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9478.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9478.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9478.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9478.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9478.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9478.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157689" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of Drops on Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>On an individual brand&#8217;s page inside Drops, consumers can view info like when the product became available, pricing, and other item details. They can also bookmark the item to add it to a wishlist or share the drop with a friend through Instagram&#8217;s direct messaging feature. From the top of the Drops page, users can return to their Cart or Wishlist at any time to complete the checkout &#8212; assuming they aren&#8217;t too late, of course.</p>
<p>In addition, the brand&#8217;s Live shopping can be scheduled to align with their product drop. When the brand goes live for a drop, there&#8217;s an on-screen countdown and confetti animation when the product becomes available.</p>
<p>The new feature is currently only available in the Instagram app in the U.S., and only on mobile devices (iOS and Android), not the web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston-based payment processor Flywire <a href="https://ir.flywire.com/news-releases/news-release-details/flywire-announces-pricing-initial-public-offering">announced</a> its IPO pricing last night. The company sold 10.44 million shares at $24 per share, the upper limit of its $22 to $24 per share price range. At that share count and price, Flywire&#8217;s gross IPO proceeds stood at $250.6 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/82076/Payment-processor-Flywire-prices-IPO-at-$24-the-high-end-of-the-range">Renaissance Capital pegs</a> the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation at $2.8 billion. Using a simple share count, the company is worth $2.4 billion at its IPO price.</p>

<p>The Flywire IPO is neat from a financial perspective and notable in that it&#8217;s a Boston exit as opposed to yet another New York or San Francisco-based flotation. It&#8217;s nice to see some other cities put points on the board.</p>
<p>But more than that, this IPO is a useful measuring stick for keeping tabs on the IPO market as a whole. This year and the last are shaping up to be key exit periods for startups and unicorns of all shapes and sizes; many a venture capital fund return rests on these public debuts.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> dug into <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny&#8217;s</a> latest mega-project: A long, fascinating, and deeply-reported series into the world of disaster tech. It&#8217;s all about the market, startups, and their backers, so it was perfect fare for our Wednesday episode, in which we dive deep into a single topic.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">The most disastrous sales cycle in the world</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/02/data-was-the-new-oil-until-the-oil-caught-fire/">Data was the new oil, until the oil caught fire</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 3<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/08/when-the-earth-is-gone-at-least-the-internet-will-still-be-working/">: When the Earth is gone, at least the internet will still be working</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 4: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/the-human-focused-startups-of-the-hellfire/">The human-focused startups of the hellfire</a></strong></p>
<p>We were super curious why Danny had picked disaster tech to niche into, as we hadn&#8217;t heard that much about it, frankly. But past the fact that it&#8217;s a world where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">sales cycles can last as long as House Congressional tenures</a>, there was quite a lot to get into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer: </strong>Dorothy wants to to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/dorothy-is-a-startup-that-offers-faster-cash-post-disaster/">provide bridge loans to folks who get rekt by a hurricane</a>. As government, and insurance money can take ages to arrive, the startup could be onto something. and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/">Perimeter wants</a> to take data, and help folks actually know where to go when there is am emergency.</li>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> Danny&#8217;s deep dive into the world of data in the disaster space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/02/data-was-the-new-oil-until-the-oil-caught-fire/">came with a provocative headline</a>, but the market backs him up. In this space we took a look at Cornea, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/cornea-eyes-in-on-fighting-wildfires-using-better-data/">just raised $15 million to help firefighters better understand conflagrations</a>, and Gridware <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/gridware-is-building-early-detection-sensors-for-power-grid-failures-and-wildfires/">raised $5.3 million to install boxes on power lines</a>. Very smart boxes, we should add.</li>
<li><strong>Mental health: </strong>We end with a riff on how companies are preparing humans to better handle disaster before and after it strikes. <a href="https://www.altoneuroscience.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alto Neuroscience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a stealthy startup founded by</span><a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/amit-etkin"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Amit Etkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is looking to solve PTSD with brain-wave data, while </span><a href="https://www.neuroflow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NeuroFlow</span></a> uses polling, and savvy collabs with practitioners to monitor emerging symptoms. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychedelic therapeutics also might have some opportunity to shine thanks to </span><a href="https://osmind.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osmind.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The series was fun to mine through, and expect Danny&#8217;s byline to be all over the topic in the coming weeks. Talk soon, unless &#8211; actually especially, if &#8211; all of hell breaks loose!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.treet.co/">Treet</a>, a company rethinking the resale retail market, announced the close of a $2.8 million seed round today. The financing comes from Bling Capital, Matchstick Ventures, Techstars, BAM Ventures, BBG Ventures, Green Meadow, Interlace Ventures, V1.VC, and Alante Capital.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that selling old clothes is the most sustainable, and most financially beneficial way to dispose of them, the process can be super tedious for both sellers and buyers.</p>
<p>Treet&#8217;s approach to simplifying its market and lowering consumer friction is to go through brands. Essentially, Treet helps brands set up their own resale sites where buyers and sellers can list and find items. Because Treet is tied in with the brand itself, sellers can easily list their items based on SKU and buyers can trust that the items they&#8217;re browsing are the real deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For brands, they get the chance to own their secondhand market and potentially gain new customers. The company says that 30 percent of buyers on Treet haven&#8217;t purchased directly from the brand before.</p>
<p>Involving brands benefits Treet in a big way, too. Brands are best positioned to know who has their items, and can send emails and messaging encouraging resale through Treet. They also have the distribution to put potential customers on to the resale site.</p>
<p>Treet gives sellers two options to redeem their funds. If they choose cash, a ten percent cut goes to the brand and a ten percent cut goes to Treet. If they choose to redeem via brand credit, only Treet takes 10 percent.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s customer list currently includes Boyish, Coclico, Altar, and époque évolution, with Goodfair and Birdy Grey launching soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest challenge is brands being hesitant about getting into resale,&#8221; said cofounder and CEO Jake Disraeli. &#8220;For a brand, promoting a used item with lesser margins is kind of a scary thought. We&#8217;re starting to prove out that they can expand their potential customer base and give brands the chance to participate alongside their customers who are reselling items on third-party platforms anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clothing and fashion startup market has been active in recent quarters. The Real Real <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/luxury-consignment-e-tailer-the-realreal-to-enter-the-unicorn-club-with-new-funding/">went public back in 2019</a>, Poshmark <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/unpacking-poshmarks-ipo-filing/">went public last year</a>, while fellow resale company ThreadUp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/unraveling-thredups-ipo-filing-slow-growth-but-a-shifting-business-model/">held an IPO this year</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-fashion-portal-lyst-raises-85m-in-a-pre-ipo-round-reportedly-at-a-500m-valuation/">UK-based Lyst raised $85 million the other week</a>. Treet&#8217;s funding fits neatly into the theme.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Insurtech is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic/">picking up steam in a big way</a>, but startup <a href="https://parametrixinsurance.com/">Parametrix</a> thinks there is still plenty of room left to innovate. The company, which today announced the close of a $17.5 million funding round, offers insurance policies for companies who rely on third-party cloud providers, ecommerce services, payment gateways and CRM systems.</p>
<p>In essence, downtime from one of these services can cost a company millions in revenue, but it&#8217;s completely out of their control. A fact of life, one might say, until Parametrix.</p>
<p>Parametrix approaches this problem in two key ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The first is that the company has developed a system that continuously monitors third-party IT services all over the world, giving the startup a direct view into service interruptions down to the millisecond. This system is also aware of the interdependent nature of many of these services and incorporates that into the precision monitoring.</p>
<p>The second differentiator is its pricing model, which uses millions of data points to help customers estimate the financial risk involved with downtime and lets them customize the payout per hour of downtime. The model spits out a premium based on that payout rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all felt the pain of downtime,&#8221; said co-founder and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/netarozy?originalSubdomain=il">Neta Rozy</a>. &#8220;When any part of the infrastructure goes down, the companies go down as well. Normally, when you have a pain caused by technology, you try to fix it with technology. Downtime is inevitable. It doesn&#8217;t matter how great your infrastructure is or how redundant your platform is and there are almost always direct financial losses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The combination of the pricing model and monitoring system means that this product that looks very different from the insurance policies we&#8217;re used to in another key way. Parametrix is named for the parametric model it uses. Essentially, if the insurer event happens, the customer gets compensation immediately, with no claim process and no proof of loss.</p>
<p>Parametrix is not a carrier itself, but rather partners with incumbent insurance carriers to payout customers. As you can imagine, when it rains it pours for something like downtime insurance, where infrastructure downtime could affect many policy holders at once.</p>
<p>The Parametrix team is 30 people, and gender diversity is split down the middle across the entire team, including upper management and the founding team.</p>
<p>FirstMark Capital and F2 Venture Capital led this new $17.5 million funding round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We don&#8217;t hear as much these days about &#8220;Zoom fatigue&#8221; as we did in the first months after the Covid-19 pandemic kicked off last year, but what&#8217;s less clear is whether people became more tolerant to the medium, or if they&#8217;d found ways of coping with it better, or if they were hopeful that tools for coping would soon be around the corner.</p>
<p>Today, a startup that has come up with a solution to handling all that video is announcing some funding to grow, on the understanding that whatever people are doing with video today, there will be a lot more video to handle in the future, and they will need more than just a good internet connection, microphone and video camera to deal with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://rewatch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rewatch</a>, which has built a set of tools for organizations to create a &#8220;system of record&#8221; for their internal video archives &#8212; not just a place to &#8220;rewatch&#8221; all of their older live video calls, but to search and organise information arising from those calls &#8212; has closed a $20 million round of funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Along with this, Rewatch from today is opening up its platform from invite-only to general availability.</p>
<p>This latest round is a Series A and is being led by Andreessen Horowitz, with Semil Shah at Haystack and Kent Goldman at Upside Partners, as well as a number of individuals, also participating.</p>
<p>It comes on the heels of Rewatch announcing a $2 million seed round only in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/rewatch-seed/">January of this year</a>. But it&#8217;s had some buzz in the intervening months: customers that have started using Rewatch include GitHub (where co-founders Connor Sears and Scott Goldman previously worked together), Brex, Envoy, and The Athletic.</p>
<p>The issue that Rewatch is tackling is the fact that a lot more of our work communications are happening over video. But while video calling has been hailed as a great boost to productivity &#8212; you can work wherever you are now, as long as you have a video connection &#8212; in fact, it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Yes, we are talking to each other a lot, but we are also losing information from those calls because they&#8217;re not being tracked as well as they could be. And, by spending all of our time talking, many of us are working on other things less, or are confined into more rigid times when we can.</p>
<p>Rewatch has built a system that plugs into Zoom and Google Meet, two of the most-used video tools in the workplace, and automatically imports all of your office&#8217;s or team&#8217;s video chats into a system. This lets you browse libraries of video-based conversations or meetings to watch them on-demand, on your time. It also provides transcripts and search tools for finding information in those calls.</p>
<p>You can turn off the automatic imports, or further customize how meetings are filed or accessibility. Sears said that Rewatch can be used for any video created on any platform, for now those require manually importing the videos into the Rewatch system.</p>
<p>Sears also said that over time it will also be adding in ways to automatically turn items from meetings into, say, work tickets to follow them up.</p>
<p>While there are a number of transcription services available on tap these days, as well as any number of cloud-based storage providers where you can keep video archives, what is notable about Rewatch&#8217;s is that it&#8217;s identified the pain point of managing and indexing those archives and keeping them in a single place for many to use.</p>
<p>In this way, Rewatch is highlighting and addressing what I think of as the crux of the productivity paradox.</p>
<p>Essentially, it is this: the tech industry has given us a lot of tools to help us work better, but actually, the work required to use those tools can outweigh the utility of the tools themselves.</p>
<p>(And I have to admit, this is one of the reasons why I&#8217;ve grown to dislike Slack. Yes, we all get to communicate on it, and it&#8217;s great to have something to connect all of us, but it just takes up so much damn time to read through everything and figure out what&#8217;s useful and what is just watercooler chat.)</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We go to where companies already are, and we automate, pull in video so that you don’t have to think about it,&#8221; Sears said. &#8220;The effort around a lot of this takes a lot of diligence to make sure people are recording and transcribing and distributing and removing. We are making this seamless and effortless.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">It sometimes feels like we are on the cusp, technologically, of leaning on tools by way of AI and other innovations that might finally cross that chasm and give us <em>actual</em> productivity out of our productivity apps.</p>
<p class="p1">In another example of how this is playing out, Dooly, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/dooly-raises-80m-more-for-its-ai-tools-to-help-salespeople-manage-their-busywork/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised funding last week</a>, is looking to do the same in the world of sales software (automatically populating various sales software with data from your phone, video and text chats, and other sources).</p>
<p>Similarly, we&#8217;re starting to see an interesting wave of companies emerge that are looking for better ways to manage and tap into all that video content that we now have swimming around us.</p>
<p>AnyClip, which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/anyclip-snaps-up-47m-for-its-video-search-and-analytics-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding yesterday</a>, is also applying better analytics and search to internal company video libraries, but also has its sights on a wider opportunity: organizing any video trove. That points, too, to the bigger opportunity for Rewatch.</p>
<p>For now, though, enterprises and businesses are an opportunity enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;As investors we get excited about founders first and foremost, and Connor and Scott immediately impressed us with their experience, clear articulation of the problem, and their vision for how Rewatch could be the end-all solution for video and knowledge management in an organization,&#8221; noted <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/05/26/investing-in-rewatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Ulevitch</a>, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in a blog post. &#8220;They both worked at GitHub in senior roles from the early days, as a Senior Director of Product Design and a Principal Engineer, respectively, and have first-hand experience scaling a product. Since founding Rewatch in early 2020, they have very quickly built a great product, sold it to large-scale customers, and hired top-tier talent, demonstrating rapid founder and company velocity that is key to building an enduring company.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The big media consolidation continues &#8212; day after rumors swirled around Amazon’s acquisition of MGM, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210526005648/en/Amazon-and-MGM-have-signed-an-agreement-for-Amazon-to-acquire-MGM/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-SixzGpg-aPrNklZ4nvkcE4TY94BwQxjampCy0ugQmZbnkvYMqDDYxFrLs-oQ2BHQ0lNV9vE3ogUB8lg9me5DJ5HOIe_ZSOSL3m4JhK3aYyB9HNxCGXiDSWsXl5s-JshAwUr0fO6FA4Gx3o4ssEAaW4=">the online massive retailer confirmed today</a> that it will be acquiring the nearly 100-year-old studio for a cool $8.45 billion.</p>
<p>The deal is another big step toward bolster Amazon’s fight in the streaming wars, with some 4,000 films. The list includes the James Bond and Rocky series and classics ranging from Fargo to Robocop to Silence of the Lambs. Also included are more than 17,000 TV shows. Once the deal closes, the short term impact will be unfettered access for Amazon&#8217;s Prime Video platform, giving the service a leg up against rivals like Netflix, Hulu and HBO Max.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen with the launch of studio streaming platforms like Disney+, the deal will also likely result in that content being pulled from competing services, once existing contracts end. “The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team,” Amazon Studios/Prime Video SVP Mike Hopkins said in a release. “It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon also says it will be making efforts to preserve older films. The press material includes all of the standard language you would expect about marrying the old with the new. Here&#8217;s MGM Board Chairman, Kevin Ulrich, “I am very proud that MGM’s Lion, which has long evoked the Golden Age of Hollywood, will continue its storied history, and the idea born from the creation of United Artists lives on in a way the founders originally intended, driven by the talent and their vision. The opportunity to align MGM’s storied history with Amazon is an inspiring combination.”</p>
<p>Amazon has, of course, already been making an aggressive push into original content through its own production studio and distribution. On the film side, it has produced notable titles like Manchester By the Sea, which nabbed a screenwriting Oscar and its list of shows includes Transparent. The company is also embarking on a massive (and massively expensive) series based on Lord of Rings.</p>
<p>While Amazon has thrived with massive coffers, MGM&#8217;s had a more difficult 21st century. In 2010, the studio filed for a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703506904575592200573445526">prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy </a>after switching hands several times. The studio was reorganized and its creditors took control.</p>
<p>The deal is just the latest in a flurry of media consolidation, including Disney/Fox, Viacom/CBS and AT&amp;T/Time Warner. As <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ever with these massive deals, the acquisition is pending all sorts of regulator scrutiny.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook this week <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/giving-people-more-control/">will begin to</a> publicly roll out the option to hide Likes on posts across both Facebook and Instagram, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/">earlier tests</a> beginning in 2019. The project, which puts the decision about Likes in the hands of the company&#8217;s global user base, had been in development for years, but was deprioritized due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the response work required on Facebook&#8217;s part, the company says.</p>
<p>Originally, the idea to hide Like counts on Facebook&#8217;s social networks was focused on depressurizing the experience for users. Often, users faced anxiety and embarrassment around their posts if they didn&#8217;t receive enough Likes to be considered &#8220;popular.&#8221; This problem was particularly difficult for younger users who highly value what peers think of them &#8212; so much so that they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teens-curate-their-instagram-accounts-2016-5">would take down posts</a> that didn&#8217;t receive enough Likes.</p>
<p>Like-chasing on Instagram, especially, also helped create an environment where people posted to gain clout and notoriety, which can be a less authentic experience. On Facebook, gaining Likes or other forms of engagement could also be associated with posting polarizing content that required a reaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result of this pressure to perform, some users grew hungry for a &#8220;Like-free&#8221; safer space, where they could engage with friends or the wider public without trying to earn these popularity points. That, in turn, gave rise to a new crop of social networking and photo-sharing apps such as <a href="https://www.minutiae-app.org/">Minutiae</a>, <a href="https://vero.co/">Vero</a>, <a href="https://www.dayflashapp.com/">Dayflash</a>, <a href="http://hipstamatic.com/oggl/">Oggl</a> and, now, newcomers like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/"> Dispo</a> and newly viral <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/what-is-poparazzi-app">Poparazzi</a>.</p>

<p>Though Facebook and Instagram could have chosen to remove Likes entirely and take its social networks in a new direction, the company soon found that the metric was too deeply integrated into the product experience to be fully removed. One key issue was how the influencer community today trades on Likes as a form of currency that allows them to exchange their online popularity for brand deals and job opportunities. Removing Likes, then, is not necessarily an option for these users.</p>
<p>Instagram realized that if it made a decision for its users, it would anger one side or the other &#8212; even if the move in either direction didn&#8217;t really impact other core metrics, like app usage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157105" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157105" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2157105" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="432" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png 1700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=1536,976 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157105" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;How many likes [users] got, or other people got &#8212; it turned out that it didn&#8217;t actually change nearly as much about the experience, in terms of how people felt or how much they use experience, as we thought it would. But it did end up being pretty polarizing,&#8221; admitted Instagram head, Adam Mosseri. &#8220;Some people really liked it and some people really didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For those who liked it, it was mostly what we had hoped &#8212; which is that it depressurized the experience. And, for those who didn&#8217;t, they used Likes to get a sense for what was trending or was relevant on Instagram and on Facebook. And they were just super annoyed that we took it away,&#8221; he added. This latter group sometimes included smaller creators still working on establishing a presence across social media, though larger influencers were sometimes in favor of Like removals. (Mosseri name-checked Katy Perry as being pro Like removals, in fact.)</p>

<p>Ultimately, the company decided to split the difference. Instead of making a hard choice about the future of its online communities, it&#8217;s rolling out the &#8220;no Likes&#8221; option as a user-controlled setting on both platforms.</p>
<p>On Instagram, both content consumers and content producers can turn on or off Like and View counts on posts &#8212; which means you can choose to not see these metrics when scrolling your own Feed and you can choose whether to allow Likes to be viewed by others when you&#8217;re posting. These are configured as two different settings, which provides for more flexibility and control.</p>

<p>On Facebook, meanwhile, users access the new setting from the &#8220;Settings &amp; Privacy&#8221; area under News Feed Settings (or News Feed Preferences on desktop). From here, you&#8217;ll find an option to &#8220;Hide number of reactions&#8221; to turn this setting off for both your own posts and for posts from others in News Feed, groups and Pages.</p>
<p>The feature will be made available to both public and private profiles, Facebook tells us, and will include posts you&#8217;ve published previously.</p>

<p>Instagram<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/"> last month restarted its tests on this feature</a> in order to work out any final bugs before making the new settings live for global users, and said a Facebook test would come soon. But it&#8217;s now forging ahead with making the feature available publicly. When asked why such a short test, Instagram told TechCrunch it had been testing various iterations on this experience since 2019, so it felt it had enough data to proceed with a global launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Mosseri also pushed back at the idea that a decision on Likes would have majorly impacted the network. While removal of Likes on Instagram had some impact on user behavior, he said, it was not enough to be concerning. In some groups, users posted more &#8212; signaling that they felt less pressure to perform, perhaps. But others engaged less, Mosseri said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157367" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157367" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2157367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Often people say, &#8216;oh, this has a bunch of Likes. I&#8217;m gonna go check it out,&#8217; &#8221; the exec explained. &#8220;Then they read the comments, or go deeper, or swipe to the carousel. There&#8217;s been some small effects &#8212; some positive, some negative &#8212; but they&#8217;ve all been small,&#8221; he noted. Instagram also believes users may toggle on and off the feature at various times, based on how they&#8217;re feeling.</p>
<p>In addition, Mosseri pointed out, &#8220;there&#8217;s no rigorous research that suggests Likes are bad for people&#8217;s well-being&#8221; &#8212; a statement that pushes back over the growing concerns that a gamified social media space is bad for users&#8217; mental health. Instead, he argued that Instagram is still a small part of people&#8217;s day, so how Likes function doesn&#8217;t affect people&#8217;s overall well-being.</p>
<p>&#8220;As big as we are, we have to be careful not to overestimate our influence,&#8221; Mosseri said.</p>
<p>He also dismissed some of the current research pointing to negative impacts of social media use as being overly reliant on methodologies that ask users to self-report their use, rather than measure it directly.</p>
<p>In other words, this is not a company that feels motivated to remove Likes entirely due to the negative mental health outcomes attributed to its popularity metrics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning that another factor that could have come into play here is Instagram&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/facebook-instagram-for-kids-state-attorneys-general-letter/">plan to make a version of its app available to children under the age of 13,</a> as competitor TikTok did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">following its FTC settlement</a>. In that case, hiding Likes by default &#8212; or perhaps adding a parental control option &#8212; would necessitate such a setting. Instagram tells TechCrunch that, while it&#8217;s too soon to know what it would do with a kids app, it will &#8220;definitely explore&#8221; a no Likes by default option.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram both told TechCrunch the feature will roll out starting on Wednesday but will reach global users over time. On Instagram, that may take a matter of days.</p>
<p>Facebook, meanwhile, says a small percentage of users will have the feature Wednesday &#8212; notified through an alert on News Feed &#8212; but it will reach Facebook&#8217;s global audience &#8220;over the next few weeks.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lightrun.com/">Lightrun</a>, a startup that helps developers debug their live production code, today announced that it has raised a $23 million Series A round led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>. <a href="https://glilotcapital.com/">Glilot Capital Partners</a>, which led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/lightrun-raises-4m-for-its-continuous-debugging-and-observability-platform/">$4 million seed round</a>, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>What makes Lightrun stand out in a sea of monitoring startups is its focus on developers (more so than IT teams) and its ability to help developers debug their production code right from their IDEs. With a few keystrokes, they can also instrument the code for monitoring, but the key here is that Lightrun offers what the company calls an &#8220;ops-free&#8221; process that puts the developers in control. This &#8220;shift-left&#8221; approach moves the application monitoring process away from ops-centric tools like Splunk and New Relic and instead puts them right into the workspaces with which developers are already familiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;The observability market has been very oriented towards IT operators. When an IT operator gets that dreaded page that a service is down, they see health metrics on running instances on servers and have a variety of failover methods and ways to restore service health,&#8221; Lightrun co-founder and CEO Ilan Peleg explained. &#8220;And they do this all natively on the same interfaces that they use every day for systems management. But when a developer gets that dreaded notification that there is a bug, it’s like the early stages of a crime scene investigation that has no suspects and usually only minor clues.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yLL1A4Q-Hn0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Currently, the service only supports Java and the IntelliJ development environment, but the team plans to expand its language and platform coverage by adding support for Python and Node.js, as well as additional IDEs.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a number of observability solutions joining the market, but found Lightrun’s shift-left approach to be truly unique,” said Teddie Wardi, managing director, Insight Partners, who led the round and will join the board of directors. “The main point of shifting observability to the left in the software development lifecycle is incorporating observability into the day-to-day developer workflow. Lightrun makes observability more ops-free, real-time and ergonomic to the development process than any other platform, and we believe they are in a position to capture a large international market of development teams at enterprises that prioritize rapid feature development and frequent shipping.”</p>
<p>The company recently launched a free community edition of its service and introduced a set of new integrations with services like Datadog, IntelliJ IDEA, Logz.io, Prometheus, Slack and StatsD. Some of Lightrun&#8217;s current customers include Taboola, Sisense and Tufin.</p>
<p>The company doubled its employee count over the course of the last year. It will continue to use the new funding to expand its developer community and hire across functions. The company also plans to expand its U.S. presence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another sizable raise for a pet (cats and dogs) tracking company this morning. Austria-based Tractive has announced a $35 million Series A, led by Guidepost Growth Equity. The round is the company’s first since 2013, when its GPS-based tracker first hit the market.</p>
<p>Along with the funding round, the company is also announcing its official push into the U.S. market &#8212; though Tractive has had some presence here through a “soft launch” of an LTE tracker over the summer. That product apparently made the States its fastest growing market, in spite of a lack of official presence.</p>
<p>The funding will go toward its expansion into the U.S./North American market, along with additional scaling and headcount. For the latter, the company is already naming a new EVP of North America and a VP of marketing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Tractive is like a seatbelt for your dog or cat. It provides coverage when and where they need it,” said co-founder and CEO Michael Hurnaus in a release. “We designed Tractive to deliver the best possible experience, with up-to-the-second information, so that all pet parents can care for their dogs and cats the way they want and deserve &#8212; whether that means monitoring activity levels to reduce the risk of obesity or tracking a dog or cat that slipped out of the yard.”</p>
<p>Also new is the arrival of an upgraded tracker from the company, primarily focused on improved battery life. The big change is the use of Wi-Fi to reduce battery strain when a pet is in the home. The company says it&#8217;s able to bump up battery life up to 5x. The tracker is available for $50 in the U.S., plus a monthly subscription fee.</p>
<p>In February, smart pet collar maker Fi announced a $30 million Series B.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Imagine if Google Docs was end-to-end encrypted so that not even Google could access your documents. That&#8217;s <a href="https://skiff.org/">Skiff</a>, in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Skiff is a document editor with a similar look and feel to Google Docs, allowing you to write, edit and collaborate in real-time with colleagues with privacy baked in. Because the document editor is built on a foundation of end-to-end encryption, Skiff doesn&#8217;t have access to anyone&#8217;s documents — only users, and those who are invited to collaborate, do.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an idea that has already attracted the attention of investors. Skiff&#8217;s co-founders Andrew Milich (CEO) and Jason Ginsberg (CTO) announced today that the startup has raised $3.7 million in seed funding from venture firm Sequoia Capital, just over a year since Skiff was founded in March 2020. Alphabet chairman John Hennessy, former Yahoo chief executive Jerry Yang, and Eventbrite co-founders Julia and Kevin Hartz also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Milich and Ginsberg told TechCrunch that the company will use the seed funding to grow the team and build out the platform.</p>
<p>Skiff isn&#8217;t that much different from WhatsApp or Signal, which are also end-to-end encrypted, underneath its document editor. &#8220;Instead of using it to send messages to a bunch of people, we&#8217;re using it to send little pieces of documents and then piecing those together into a collaborative workspace,&#8221; said Milich.</p>
<p>But the co-founders acknowledged that putting your sensitive documents in the cloud requires users to put a lot of trust into the startup, particularly one that hasn&#8217;t been around for long. That&#8217;s why Skiff <a href="https://www.skiff.org/security">published a whitepaper</a> with technical details of how its technology works, and has <a href="https://www.skiff.org/updates/skiff-is-open-sourcing">begun to open source</a> parts of its code, allowing anyone to see how the platform works. Milich said Skiff has also gone through at least one comprehensive security audit, and the company counts advisors from the Signal Foundation to Trail of Bits.</p>
<p>It seems to be working. In the months since Skiff soft-launched through an invite-only program, thousands of users — including journalists, research scientists and human rights lawyers — use Skiff every day, with another 8,000 users on a waitlist.</p>
<p>&#8220;The group of users that we&#8217;re most excited about are just regular people that care about privacy,&#8221; said Ginsberg. &#8220;There are just so many privacy communities and people that are advocates for these types of products that really care about how they&#8217;re built and have sort of lost trust in big companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re using us because they&#8217;re really excited about the vision and the future of end-to-end encryption,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.obierisk.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed an insurtech platform for landlords, has raised $10.7 million in a Series A funding round led by Battery Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomvest Ventures, Funders Club, MetaProp and Second Century Ventures also participated in the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this sounds like a niche offering, that’s because it is. Obie’s software specifically targets small-to-medium size apartment landlords who own single-family rentals and/or larger apartment buildings.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago-based Obie &#8212; which also went through the Y Combinator program &#8212; says its platform stands out because it offers instant quotes (by instant, they mean in about three to five minutes). The company also claims to save policyholders up to 25-30% compared to other insurance premiums. Over the past year, Obie has secured insurance for over $3 billion worth of property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obie co-founders (and brothers) Aaron and Ryan Letzeiser have taken their respective backgrounds in insurance and real estate private equity to build out the Obie platform. They are operating under the premise that despite being the largest class of real estate investors in the U.S, this group of landlords “is significantly underserved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generally SMB landlords have been ignored in the market, and there&#8217;s 11 million of them,” Aaron said. “And we beat target premiums, on average, by 31.7%.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand appears to be there. According to the pair, Obie saw its premiums climb to about $1 million in its first 12 months of being in business. Over the last 12 months, that number has climbed to about $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with its funding announcement, Obie also announced today the extension of its property and casualty insurance to all 50 states.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157275" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157275" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2157275 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157275" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Obie</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does it work? Landlords and investors answer a series of questions on Obie’s site. The platform extracts a few data points from client responses, which its technology then combines with public and private data points such as the proximity of the landlord to the property. (This can be an indicator of how quickly a landlord can conduct proactive and preventative maintenance and general attentiveness to tenant issues.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Obie runs its analysis, the platform uses a “proprietary” algorithm to match an application to carriers based on what they describe as “risk-appetite” profiles. For example, some carriers don’t want to cover properties built before a certain year. The platform then provides the landlords and property owners with a quote. If they’re OK with the quote, landlords can be “immediately underwritten,” according to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, said Ryan, the brothers want to make Obie “the easiest way for landlords to get the insurance that they need.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to expand upon its product and “really try to own the entire vertical.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Historically, we&#8217;ve been an agency-based business but we are in the process of putting together our own product that is slated to roll out right at the end of the second quarter,” said Aaron. “Very similar to Lemonade and Hippo, and we’re doing it with a large insurer that’s backing us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Obie believes it has validated its brokerage model in the market and is now planning to use the data it’s been able to gather to become its own carrier. The company expects the rollout to take time, so until it gets approval in all 50 states, it will partner with other carriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal at the end of the day is to go from agency to eventually carrier,” said Ryan. “This is a tried and true path. Next has done it. Hippo has done it. Lemonade has done it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brothers believe their backgrounds allow them “to speak the same language” to their clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have lived the pain points of our clients so we can understand how the price of the premium of coverage experience plays into the overall business strategy,” Aaron said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Battery Ventures’ Michael Brown, who has taken a seat on Obie’s board, agrees the embedded nature of the startup’s offering gives them a competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Allowing their end customers to buy property and general liability insurance right from the vertical software that is servicing their business is really interesting and a great distribution channel for Obie,” Brown told TechCrunch. “Landlords can go direct or through their channel partners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown says Battery &#8212; as long-term investors in the insurance sector &#8212; was also attracted to the fact that Obie is focused on commercial lines rather than personal because the firm believes “they are larger markets, less competitive and can probably drive higher value just given the overall size of the premiums involved.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.uptycs.com/">Uptycs</a>, a Boston-area startup that uses data to help understand and prevent security attacks, announced a $50 million Series C today, 11 months after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/uptycs-lands-30m-series-b-to-keep-building-security-analytics-platform/">a $30 million Series B</a>. Norwest Venture Partners led the round with participation from Sapphire Ventures and ServiceNow Ventures.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Ganesh Pai says that he was still well capitalized from last year&#8217;s investment, and wasn&#8217;t actually looking to raise funds, but the investors came looking for him and he saw a way to speed up some aspects of the company&#8217;s roadmap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one of those things where the round came in primarily as a function of execution and success to date, and we decided to capitalize on that because we know the partners and raised the capital so that we could use it meaningfully for a couple of different things, primarily sales and marketing acceleration,&#8221; Pai said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that part of the reason for the company&#8217;s success over the last year was that the pandemic generated more customer interest as people moved to work from home, the SolarWinds hack happened and companies were moving to the cloud faster. &#8220;We provided a solution which was telemetric powered and very insightful when it came to solving their security problems and that&#8217;s what led to triple digit growth over the last year,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight/embed/#?secret=xjgDPnj5j2" data-secret="xjgDPnj5j2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Pai says that the company has not been sitting still in terms of the platform. While last year, he described it primarily as a forensic security data solution, helping customers figure out what happened after a security issue has happened, he says that the company has begun expanding on that vision to include all four main areas of security including being proactive, reactive, predictive and protective.</p>
<p>The company started primarily in being reactive by figuring what happened in the past, but has begun to expand into these other areas over the last year, and the plan is to continue to build out that functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">the context of SolarWinds</a>, what everyone is trying to figure out is how soon into the supply chain can you figure out what could be potentially wrong by looking at indications of behavior or indications of compromise, and our ability to ingest telemetry from a diverse set of sources, not as a bolt on solution, but something which is built from the ground up, resonated really well,&#8221; Pai explained.</p>
<p>The company had 65 employees when we spoke last year for the Series B. Today, Pai says that number is approaching 140 and he is adding new people every week with a goal to get to around 200 people by the end of the year. He says as the company grows, he keeps diversity top of mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we grow and as we raise capital diversity has been something which has been a high priority and very critical for us,&#8221; he said. In fact, he reports that more than 50% of his employees come from under-represented groups whether it&#8217;s Latinx, Black or Asian heritage.</p>
<p>Pai says that one of the reasons he has been able to build a diverse workforce is his commitment to a remote workplace, which means he can hire from anywhere, something he will continue to do even after the pandemic ends.</p>
