Around 142 million households worldwide watched the Korean-language show about debt-ridden individuals playing a deadly game for a cash prize worth tens of millions of dollars. That makes it the most-viewed new show in Netflix history, the publication said.</p>
<p><em>Squid Game</em> captured the &#8220;cultural zeitgeist&#8221; and claimed the number 1 spot in the streaming giant&#8217;s rankings in 94 countries, including the US, Netflix has revealed. Since there&#8217;s a huge demand for all things <em>Squid Game</em>, Netflix has also announced that consumer products based on the show are now on their way to retail.</p>
<p>A few days ago, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-documents-reveal-how-netflix-considers-a-show-successful-081058871.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">obtained</a> documents detailing the company&#8217;s scores for &#8220;impact value&#8221; and &#8220;efficiency.&#8221; Netflix has been pretty secretive on the metrics that make a title successful or not, and the documents showed how it measures series&#8217; and movies&#8217; success. <em>Squid Game</em> was a standout, generating $891.1 million in impact value, which is around 41.7 times — that&#8217;s its efficiency score — its budget of $21.4 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220816" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Thanks in part to <em>Squid Game&#8217;s</em> massive viewership, Netflix said it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-19/netflix-tops-third-quarter-subscriber-views-sees-upbeat-fourth?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">posted</a> its best subscriber growth of the year. &#8220;As the quarter continued, we saw an acceleration in our growth,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said on the call.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building usable models to run AI algorithms requires not just adequate data to train systems, but also the right hardware subsequently to run them. But because the theoretical and practical are often not the same thing, there is often a gap between what data scientists may hope to do and what they practically do. Today, a startup called <a href="https://deci.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deci</a> that has built a deep learning platform to help bridge that gap &#8212; by building models that can work with the data and hardware that are available to use &#8212; is announcing some funding after finding strong traction for its products with Fortune 500 tech companies running mass-market, AI-based products based on video and other computer vision-based services.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-based startup has picked up a Series A of $21 million, money that it will be using to continue expanding its product and customer base. Insight Partners is leading the round, with previous backers Square Peg, Emerge and Jibe Ventures, alongside some new backers: Samsung Next, Vintage Investment Partners, and Fort Ross Ventures. Square Peg and Emerge led Deci&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/deci-raises-9-1m-to-use-ai-to-optimize-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seed round of $9.1 million a year ago</a>. It also works very closely with others who are not strategic or financial investors (but may well be down the line?). Intel collaborated with it on<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deci-collaborates-with-intel-to-achieve-11-8x-accelerated-inference-speed-at-mlperf-301182412.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> MLPerf</a>, where Deci&#8217;s technology accelerates the inference speed of the ResNet-50 neural network when run on Intel CPUs.</p>
<p>Up to now, Deci has been focusing its attention on models for computer vision-based products, where its platform &#8212; built on its own proprietary AutoNAC (Automated Neural Architecture Construction) technology &#8212; is able to build, and continuously update, models quickly for services that might have otherwise taken longer, and a lot of trail and error, to devise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220792" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One key client, for example, is one of the world&#8217;s biggest and well-known videoconferencing platforms (unfortunately, name undisclosed) that is using Deci to build AI modeling so that users can blur their backgrounds in video calls. Here, all of the computing needed to execute that blurring is happening at &#8220;the edge&#8221;, on users&#8217; own CPU-based devices (that is, not typically optimized for AI workloads).</p>
<p>Yonatan Geifman, the CEO who co-founded Deci with Ran El-Yaniv and Jonathan Elial (a trio of AI specialists), said that the plan is now to start expanding from computer vision applications to another challenge, building better NLP (natural language) models, which you might need to run any kind of service with a voice interface, from personal assistants on phones or smart speakers through to audio-based search or any kind of customer service interface, for example.</p>
<p>Although Deci has picked up a lot of business by helping companies address the challenge of running AI services in a landscape of devices that are not necessarily optimized for AI, it has also found a lot of interest from organizations to use Deci to build better models for their own internal computing, even when they theoretically have the GPUs and compute power on hand to run anything. This taps into an interesting power balance that has long existed in enterprise IT and is very much getting played out in AI today, where enterprises will try to do more with the assets they have to hand, while at the same time they are regularly getting pushed to invest more in newer and more expensive and powerful equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a race to larger models all the time,&#8221; Geifman said in an interview, citing the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/using-deepspeed-and-megatron-to-train-megatron-turing-nlg-530b-the-worlds-largest-and-most-powerful-generative-language-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new language model</a> announced earlier this month by Nvidia and Microsoft as one example of that evolution. &#8220;So the hardware is just not enough. In one sense, maybe that race and drive to invest in new hardware is being pushed by the hardware makers themselves, but the models <em>are</em> getting larger. There is a gap, between the algorithm and the supply of the hardware. So, we need to have some convergence based on what hardware we have. Deci is bridging or even closing that gap.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With adequate training data being another perennial problem in AI, Deci is also working to give a boost on the data side of the equation. Geifman said that Deci essentially builds synthetic data sets to supplement data when more is needed to build the models. In all cases, the product works within organizations&#8217; developer environments, data stays where it is and does not go to Deci or anywhere else in the process of building the models.</p>
<p>Alongside that Deci is also using AutoNAC to build more products. The most recent of these is DeciNets, which Deci describes as &#8220;a family of computer vision models&#8221; that essentially skip some of the work of building models from the ground up and therefore using less compute power to run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deci is at the forefront of AI and deep learning acceleration, with highly differentiated technology that lets customers optimize blazingly fast deep learning models for inference tuned to any hardware platform,” said Lonne Jaffe, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “We are delighted to be part of Deci’s ScaleUp journey and look forward to supporting the company’s rapid growth.” Jaffe is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook &#8212; or whatever name the tech giant picks for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/facebook-reportedly-plans-to-change-its-name-to-focus-on-the-metaverse/">reportedly looming rebrand of its data-mining empire</a> as it seeks to teleport its business into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">metaverse</a> to escape the unending cavalcade of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">toxic publicity</a> its execs generate &#8212; has a new &#8216;bad behavior&#8217; badge to sport: It&#8217;s just been fined nearly $70 million (£50.5M) by a UK watchdog for deliberately withholding information related to ongoing antitrust oversight of its acquisition of Giphy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first time the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog has found a company to have breached this type of order &#8212; by &#8220;consciously refusing to report all the required information&#8221;, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-fines-facebook-over-enforcement-order-breach">as it puts it</a>.</p>
<p>So that looks like an epic win for Facebook&#8217;s current PR strategy of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiA4MPr2NjzAhURCewKHRg_CpEQFnoECAUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fzuck%2Fposts%2F10113955029116581&amp;usg=AOvVaw0B23erwEIkDBpEVBjP3FsE">not giving two f***s</a> what anyone else thinks of it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tech giant has also of course recently acquired an expensive taste in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/21/meet-facebooks-latest-fake/">self-configured &#8216;accountability apparatus&#8217;</a> (aka the self-styled &#8216;Facebook Oversight Board&#8217;) &#8212; which may have caused it some confusion over its legal requirements to comply with actual oversight bodies that exist within democratic societies.</p>
<p>But that might be a too generous an interpretation of what Facebook is doing here.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eNHOTq6hk7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">UK&#8217;s antitrust watchdog takes a closer look at Facebook-Giphy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK&#8217;s antitrust watchdog takes a closer look at Facebook-Giphy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/embed/#?secret=eNHOTq6hk7" data-secret="eNHOTq6hk7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The back story is that the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been scrutinizing Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of the animated GIF repository for well <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-facebooks-400m-acquisition-of-giphy/">over a year</a> now. But back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">April</a>, a new, in-depth phase of the probe was announced &#8212; after the regulator found concrete reasons to be concerned that Facebook owning Giphy would further reduce competition in the (already Facebook-dominated) digital advertising market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement at the time a faceless Facebook spokesperson claimed the tech giant would &#8220;continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation&#8221;. However it turns out even that Facebook claim was fake.</p>
<p>Per the CMA, Facebook has failed to follow the standard oversight process &#8212; failing to provide the regulator with required information related to an initial enforcement order (IEO) placed on it by the watchdog, despite repeated requests for it to do so.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s actions are such that they have led the CMA to conclude that non-compliance was deliberate. Hence the meaty penalty for what the CMA describes as a &#8220;major&#8221; breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time a company has been found by the CMA to have breached an IEO by consciously refusing to report all the required information,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Given the multiple warnings it gave Facebook, the CMA considers that Facebook’s failure to comply was deliberate. As a result, the CMA has issued a fine of £50 million for this major breach, which fundamentally undermined its ability to prevent, monitor and put right any issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tech giant was also criticised last year by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-welcomes-tribunal-judgment-in-facebook-and-giphy-case">Competition Appeal Tribunal</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-welcomes-court-judgment-in-facebook-and-giphy-case">Court of Appeal</a> over its lack of cooperation with the CMA &#8212; with judges calling it out over what they suggested “might be regarded as a high-risk strategy” in relation to not complying with the IEO and not keeping the CMA updated as the order required.</p>
<p>An IEO is intended to place a freeze on any further integration and ensure companies can continue to compete against each other in situations where an acquisition that&#8217;s under antitrust scrutiny has already been completed, as is the case with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">Facebook-Giphy buy</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has been under a CMA IEO order since June 2020 in relation to its purchase of Giphy. But the watchdog said today that the tech giant &#8220;significantly limited&#8221; the scope of required updates related to its compliance with the order.</p>
<p>The concern driving what looks like an unprecedented penalty from the CMA appears to be both Facebook&#8217;s conscious flouting of standard compliance requirements, and the risk of it doing that to conceal what it&#8217;s doing with Giphy &#8212; in order to carry out activity that could, for example, make it harder for the watchdog to order a full unwinding of the acquisition &#8212; which is one of a number of <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6114d3e18fa8f53dc274c716/Facebook_GIPHY_Remedies_Notice_PV_120821.pdf">possible remedies it laid out this summer</a>. (And which Facebook <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-fights-british-watchdog-retain-gif-maker-giphy-2021-09-08/">quickly denounced</a> in a highly critical public response that also questioned the authority of the CMA to regulate the purchase at all.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another tidbit here too: The CMA has also issued a separate fine &#8212; stinging Facebook a further £500,000 for changing its Chief Compliance Officer on two separate occasions without first seeking consent from the regulator.</p>
<p>Commenting on the action in a statement, Joel Bamford, senior director of mergers at the CMA, said: &#8220;We warned Facebook that its refusal to provide us with important information was a breach of the order but, even after losing its appeal in two separate courts, Facebook continued to disregard its legal obligations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This should serve as a warning to any company that thinks it is above the law,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Explaining the IEO requirement Bamford also said: &#8220;Initial enforcement orders are a key part of the UK’s voluntary merger control regime. Companies are not required to seek CMA approval before they complete an acquisition but, if they decide to go ahead with a merger, we can stop the companies from integrating further if we think consumers might be affected and an investigation is needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook was contacted for a response to the CMA penalties &#8212; and in statement it criticized the action as &#8220;unfair&#8221;, claiming it had sought to take a &#8220;best effort compliance approach&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly disagree with the CMA’s unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. We will review the CMA’s decision and consider our options,” said Facebook&#8217;s unnamed spokesperson.</p>
<p>The company also provided some &#8220;background&#8221; information that it said this was not for direct quoting or for attribution &#8212; so we won&#8217;t be publishing it.</p>
<p>Instead, here&#8217;s a GIF:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hash.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a payment infrastructure fintech, announced today that it has raised $40 million in a Series C funding round co-led by QED Investors and Kaszek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise comes just six months after the Brazilian startup raised $15 million in Series B financing led by Alexandria, Virginia-based QED, and brings its total raised to nearly $59 million since its 2017 inception. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor Scale-Up Ventures also put money in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hash offers “end-to-end” payment infrastructure for non-financial B2B companies looking to offer banking services &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from point-of-sale (POS) software and mobile applications to dashboards and payments. Its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> white-label software builds customized payment services, focusing on B2B companies with large customer chains and partners.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220391" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineer João Miranda, founder and CEO of Hash, said that since the company&#8217;s last raise, it has grown its number of transactions by “6x” while doubling its client base to 16. Over the past year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hash has seen 10x growth in POS transactions, and Miranda anticipates it will top $275 million in total payment volume by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s self-proclaimed mission is to “decentralize” financial services, with an emphasis on SMEs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We provide financial infrastructure for B2B companies to embed payments solutions into their own custom ecosystems,” he said. “By doing this, those companies are offering better, and more competitive, solutions for SMBs inside their ecosystem.”</span></p>
<p>Hash&#8217;s 16 direct customers use its infrastructure to provide financial services to their own customers, which are SMEs. Currently, more than 16,000 SMEs are using its software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hash, according to Miranda, aims to offer a “complete” payment services infrastructure with the goal of helping provide businesses with a new source of revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand that each sector, each ecosystem in the market, has its own specificities and necessities,” he told TechCrunch. “That’s why we use proprietary technology, capable of adapting to different market verticals.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220589" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220589" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2220589 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/João-Miranda_Fundador-e-CEO-da-Hash-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Hash" width="680" height="485" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/João-Miranda_Fundador-e-CEO-da-Hash-1.jpg 5400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/João-Miranda_Fundador-e-CEO-da-Hash-1.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/João-Miranda_Fundador-e-CEO-da-Hash-1.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/João-Miranda_Fundador-e-CEO-da-Hash-1.jpg?resize=768,547 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/João-Miranda_Fundador-e-CEO-da-Hash-1.jpg?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/João-Miranda_Fundador-e-CEO-da-Hash-1.jpg?resize=1536,1095 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/João-Miranda_Fundador-e-CEO-da-Hash-1.jpg?resize=2048,1460 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/João-Miranda_Fundador-e-CEO-da-Hash-1.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220589" class="wp-caption-text">Hash CEO and founder João Miranda/Paulo Vitale©All Rights reserved</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to grow “even further” in the markets it’s already in, either geographically or by segment. Today, Hash operates only in Brazil. Its goal is to expand throughout the &#8220;entire national territory, which is huge and has great growth potential,&#8221; Miranda said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the line, it wants to enable more financial services on top of its payments volume, such as credit, loans and card issuance infrastructure. Hash also plans, as most startups that have raised funding, to do more hiring. It’s already grown its headcount to nearly 170 compared to 74 a year ago. Its goal is to have 190 employees by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santiago Fossatti, a partner at Kaszek, believes that Hash is “capable of solving several pains” in the industry while still “adding real value” to the business of its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hash is on its way to play an important role in the payments industry and become a reference in Latin America,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling the market opportunity “massive,” QED Investors partner Mike Packer believes that the main difference between Hash and others in the space is its “ability to combine the best technology with a unique perspective of how to integrate payments into their partners’ business models.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bulletproof.ai/">Resistant AI</a>, which uses artificial intelligence to help financial services companies combat fraud and financial crime &#8212; selling tools to protect credit risk scoring models, payment systems, customer onboarding and more &#8212; has closed $16.6 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>GV (formerly Google Ventures) led the round, with participation from existing investors Index Ventures (led by partner Jan Hammer), Credo Ventures (led by Ondrej Bartos and Vladislav Jez) and Seedcamp, plus several unnamed angel investors specializing in financial technology and security.</p>
<p>The 2019-founded, Prague-based startup says the funding will be used to meet rising demand from global financial institutions, including by building out its product, engineering, and sales operations teams beyond its existing footprint &#8212; which also includes offices in London and New York.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219303" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has 30 customers signed up at this stage to use its dedicated anti-fraud security products &#8212; which include machine learning detection of fraudulent documents and AI for spotting problematic patterns of transactions.</p>
<p>Collectively its customers, which include banks, insurance companies and fintechs &#8212; it can&#8217;t name the biggest but names the likes of KBC, Payoneer, Habito and Twisto &#8212; are processing tens of millions of transactions per month, it also said, adding that in its home market of the Czech Republic it&#8217;s now working with banks that have a combined 50% marketshare.</p>
<p>To give a taster of the problem it&#8217;s tackling, the startup says that assessment of customer data it&#8217;s acquired and reviewed indicates: 17% of bank statement that are used for lending applications, &#8216;Know Your Customer&#8217; regulations and other purposes are tampered with; 11% of UK payslips submitted as part of digital loan applications are altered or forged; 15% of company registration certificates submitted worldwide when opening a bank account are fakes; and 9% of utility bills submitted as a proof of address worldwide are forged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to create an intelligent shield for autonomous financial systems, to protect them against these ever-evolving, ever-smarter attacks,&#8221; adds CEO Martin Rehak in a statement. &#8220;That’s the only way we can avoid epidemic fraud, mountains of manual reviews and four-factor authentication on every single online service.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In another supporting statement, Tom Hulme, general partner at GV, said: &#8220;Resistant AI&#8217;s founding team has unique expertise in applying AI and machine learning to detect complex and evasive behavior. Early customer traction demonstrates an ability to uncover unknown threats, and reliably categorize and reduce false alerts with transparent, explainable and verifiable detection models.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’ve heard of Neo-banks. Meet the Neo-lender. One of the newest is London-based <a href="https://proportunity.co/">Proportunity</a>. It’s now raised a $150m mixed debt and equity funding round ($7 million equity financing and $143 million in debt), on top of its $10m debt round in 2020.</p>
<p>The round was led by VentureFriends, Kibo Ventures, and existing investors Anthemis, Entrepreneur First as well as new UK proptech investors Amro Partners.  The startup plans to use this funding to grow its team, as well as increase its maximum loan size from £90,000 up to £150,000 per home.</p>
<p>Some 85% of renters in the UK want to own their own home, but can’t because of high deposit requirements and rapidly rising house prices.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219740" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Proportunity says it provides home buyers with a home purchase equity loan, similar to the UK government’s &#8216;Help to Buy’ scheme, but available for any home not just new builds. It allows them to afford homes with only a 5% deposit, reducing the amount they need in savings. The Proportunity equity loan of up to £150,000 or 25% of the house price, sits on top of the maximum mortgage they get from a mainstream lender. The equity loan, in addition to the mortgage of up to 4.5x income, means they can effectively borrow up to six times their income.</p>
<p>The company says it can do this through its machine learning that helps identify fair valued homes in high potential growth areas, de-risking lending, and removing the need for a large deposit.</p>
<p>Vadim Toader, CEO and co-founder said: “In the UK there is a £100-200k gap between what buyers want and what they can afford, mainly caused by lenders restricting what they will lend to a maximum of 4.5x income and high deposit requirements. Combine this with growing house prices and the need for an extra bedroom in the new ‘work from home’ environment and it’s easy to see that buyers are facing a losing battle.”</p>
<p>VentureFriends partner, George Dimopoulos said: “In Proportunity we saw a product that can positively impact the lives of thousands of FHBs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Proportunity has three main competitors: Generation Home &#8211; a new spin on guarantor mortgages, which largely helps structure financial help from family/friends. Wayhome (a.k.a Unmortgage) offers a private version of shared ownership which combines renting with a mortgage desposit.</p>

I just got off a call for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/how-startups-are-turning-data-into-software-gold/">this panel that I am particularly excited about</a>, for example. The trick will be cutting down my question list until it fits into the 30 minutes available.</p>

<p>In other TechCrunch news, we have a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1/">huge dive into Automattic</a>, the company behind WordPress that also owns Tumblr, which our former parent company (Verizon Media) used to own before our parent company’s parent company (Verizon) sold us and we became Yahoo.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google drops new hardware, software: </strong>On the heels of Apple’s event yesterday, Google got in on the hardware action today. If you want smartphone news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/google-revamps-its-smartphone-line-with-the-pixel-6/">we have your back</a>. If you want notes on Pixel Pass, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/google-introduces-pixel-pass-an-all-in-one-subscription-combining-phones-and-premium-services/">we got it</a>. Want more on the newly released Android 12? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/android-12-launched/">Here you go</a>. Hell, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/googles-pixel-6-camera-smartens-up-snapshots-with-ai-tools/">there’s even an AI angle</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/china-venture-capital-q3-2021/"><strong>Chinese venture capital posts epic quarter:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In light of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/chinas-regulatory-crackdown-is-good-news-for-startups-aligned-with-ccp-goals/">regulatory tumult as the Chinese government makes strident changes</a> to its technology landscape, economy and culture, you would have been forgiven for expecting venture investors to slow their roll when it came to startups in the country. But, no, that’s precisely and exactly <em>not</em> what happened. So we dug in.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/stalkerware-security-phone-data-thousands/"><strong>A massive ‘stalkerware’ leak puts the phone data of thousands at risk:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The latest from our own <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker">Zack Whittaker</a> isn’t <em>good</em> news, but it is very important news all the same. Per our cybersecurity expert, all sorts of personal information can “be pulled from a person’s phone because of a security issue in widely used consumer-grade spyware.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>What is a startup? Recently there was fresh debate on this evergreen topic on Twitter. Perhaps we should just say that any company that has <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1450208056520892423">raised $50 million is no longer a startup</a>? It’s something else? Something between a startup and a unicorn?</p>
<p>I bring all that up because I have no idea what to call Instacart. Not really. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/instacart-acquires-caper-ai-a-smart-cart-and-instant-checkout-startup-for-350m-as-it-moves-deeper-into-physical-retail-tech/">just dropped $350 million to buy a different startup</a> — part of a deeper move into the technology powering physical retail — but perhaps both companies were not startups? Something to ponder. (Feel free to respond to this email with what you consider the “no longer a startup” line, if you want. I will see it.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">OK, but surely companies that raise $1 billion rounds are not startups?</a> </strong>That would make Gorillas <em>not </em>a startup. Yes, the Berlin-based on-demand grocery delivery and dark store operator just raised nearly a flat-billion in a single round, valuing the company at just over $2 billion. Given the somewhat modest valuation figure next to the raise amount, we have questions, but the investment is still net-bullish for the current boom in grocery delivery startup activity that we’ve seen.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/bluepallet-raises-5m-to-take-its-chemical-industry-marketplace-global/"><strong>BluePallet proves that there are infinite spaces for tech startups to build:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a>, BluePallet is an “online marketplace connecting manufacturers with the chemical industry,” and just raised $5 million. Think about all the other industries that could use better links to manufacturers. I mean, there’s at least another few dozen vertical SaaS plays there, right?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/electric-it-infrastructure-90-million-series-d-funding/"><strong>ITaaS:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are familiar with Justworks’ HR efforts, you will understand Electric. It’s Justworks for IT. Justworks, in case you are not familiar, does HR stuff for other companies. Electric does that for IT, and it just raised $90 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/figma-continues-expansion-beyond-design-with-updates-to-figjam-white-board-tool/"><strong>Figma cuts price of its whiteboard tool:</strong></a> Figma is best known for its design software, but the company has also built a whiteboard tool called FigJam. It competes with Mural, we reckon. Regardless, Figma wants more folks to use it, so it’s cutting the price. Given that we tend to see software prices move the <em>other</em> direction, this stood out to us. <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanrcrook">Jordan Crook</a>, who covered the news item, connected it to a larger product expansion narrative forming at Figma.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/mage-aims-to-be-the-stripe-for-ai-raises-6-3m-for-developer-tools-to-build-ai-into-apps/"><strong>AIaaS:</strong></a> A startup called Mage wants to offer AI tooling that product teams can use, without having to go beg for help from scarce data science resources. And the company just landed $6.3 million for its efforts. Mage fits into the software theme we’ve been tracking for some time of tech products working to help non-developers be able to do more on their own.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/wonolo-raises-140m-for-its-staffing-platform-used-by-1m-laborers-and-front-line-workers/"><strong>Wonolo proves that building for regulars can be big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>While it’s in vogue to build software tooling for rarified fields, everyone needs a little help. Wonolo is proof that you can build for non-engineers, say, and still do well. The company, which focuses on helping hourly workers book jobs, just raised nine figures.</li>
<li>And because their team asked nicely, <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlyPage_">Carly Page</a> covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/soc-prime-lands-11m-series-a-to-become-spotify-for-cyber-threats/">the recent SOC Prime round for us</a>. The Boston-based startup working in the threat detection market just raised $11 million.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How our startup boosted productivity with ‘get s*** done’ day</h2>
<p>One day every other week, Travelpayouts&#8217; “employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved,” writes Travelpayouts head Ivan Baidin.</p>
<p>Getting S*** Done Day allowed the team to address “sidelined” projects that may have seemed like small potatoes: rebuilding lifecycle emails, improving analytics and optimizing working hours.</p>
<p>Completing each of these “eternally postponed” tasks created incremental gains, says Baidin. “That is something we value a lot.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The former head of the Facebook app, who reported directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Fidji Simo, defended the social network at the start of an interview at the <a href="https://www.wsjtechlive.com/">WSJ Tech Live</a> event this afternoon. The exec was there to discuss her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/instacart-hires-facebook-executive-as-new-ceo-ahead-of-expected-ipo/">new role as Instacart CEO</a> and her vision for the future of food delivery, but was asked to comment on the recent Facebook whistleblower&#8217;s testimony and the attention it has since raised.</p>
<p>Simo said she understood the scrutiny given Facebook&#8217;s impact on people&#8217;s lives. But she&#8217;s also worried that Facebook will never be able to do enough to appease its critics at this point, despite the complexity of the issues Facebook is grappling with as one of the world&#8217;s largest social networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are spending billions of dollars in keeping people safe. They are doing the most in-depth research of any company I know to understand their impact,&#8221; she argued, still very much on Facebook&#8217;s side, despite her recent departure. &#8220;And I think my worry is that people want &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; answers to this question, but really these questions require a lot of nuance,&#8221; she added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220593" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">whistleblower, Frances Haugen, suggested</a> that Facebook&#8217;s decision to prioritize user engagement through its algorithms was ultimately putting profits over people, Simo cautioned the choices weren&#8217;t quite as binary as have been described to date. She explained that making changes based on the research Facebook had invested in wasn&#8217;t just a matter of turning a dial and &#8220;all of a sudden, magically problems disappear &#8212; because Facebook is fundamentally a reflection of humanity,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175265" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175265" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2175265" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="399" height="224" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg 1953w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175265" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instacart</p></div></p>
<p>Instead, Simo said that the real issues at Facebook were around how every change Facebook makes can have significant societal applications at this point. It has to work to determine how it can improve upon the potentially problematic areas of its business without incidentally affecting other things along the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we discuss trade-offs, it&#8217;s usually trade-offs between two types of societal impacts,&#8221; she noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As an example, Simo used what would seem like a fairly straightforward adjustment to make: determine which posts make Facebook users angry then show people less of those.</p>
<p>As Haugen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">had testified</a>, Facebook&#8217;s algorithms have been designed to reward engagement. That means posts with &#8220;likes&#8221; and other interactions spread more widely and are distributed higher up in people&#8217;s News Feeds. But she also said engagement doesn&#8217;t just come from likes and positive reactions. Engagement-based algorithms will ultimately prioritize clickbait and posts that make people angry. This, in turn, can help to boost the spread of posts eliciting stronger reactions, like misinformation or even toxic and violent content.</p>
<p>Simo, however, said it&#8217;s not as simple as it sounds to just dial down the anger across Facebook, as doing so would lead to another type of societal impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;You start digging in and you realize that the biggest societal movements were created out of anger,&#8221; she said. That led the company to question how it could make a change that could impact people&#8217;s activism.</p>
<p>(This isn&#8217;t quite how that situation unfolded, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline">to a report by the WSJ</a>. Instead, when the algorithm was tweaked to prioritize personal posts over professionally produced content, publishers and political parties adjusted their posts toward outrage and sensationalism. And Zuckerberg resisted some of the proposed fixes to this problem, the report said.)</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just a random example,&#8221; Simo said of the &#8220;anger&#8221; problem. &#8220;But literally, on every issue, there is always a trade-off that is another type of societal impact. And I can tell you for having been in these rooms for many, many years, it&#8217;s really never about like, &#8216;oh, are we doing the right thing for society, versus the right thing for Facebook and for profits&#8217;&#8230;the debate was really between some kinds of societal impact and another kind &#8212; which is a very hard debate to have as a private company.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, she added, was why Facebook wanted regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not surprising that Facebook has been calling for regulation in this space for a very long time because they never want to be in a position of being the ones deciding which implications, which ramifications, which trade-offs they need to make between one type of societal impact and another type of societal impact. The governments are better positioned to do that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Given the increasing amount of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">evidence</a> coming out that Facebook itself understood, through its own internal research, that there were areas of its business that negatively impact society, Simo didn&#8217;t chalk up her departure from the social network to anything that was going on with Facebook itself.</p>
<p>Instead, she said she just wasn&#8217;t learning as much after 10 years with the company, and Instacart presented her with a great opportunity where she could learn &#8220;a different set of things,&#8221; she said.</p>

One of those people is Navrina Singh, a former product manager for Qualcomm, then Microsoft, who saw firsthand at Microsoft how a Twitter bot it developed in 2016 as an experiment in &#8220;conversational understanding,&#8221; was, to quote The Verge, &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist">taught to be a racist asshole in less than a day</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s mishap is but one of a long string of examples of AI gone wrong. In 2019, an algorithm sold by the health services company Optum to predict which patients will benefit from extra medical care was found by researchers to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/">badly misjudge</a> the health needs of the sickest Black patients. Credit-scoring AI systems have repeatedly been found to be <a href="https://www.tfir.io/new-study-suggests-sexist-ai-contributes-to-the-17-billion-gender-credit-gap/">sexist</a>.</p>
<p>While many larger companies have assembled teams to tackle the ethical problems arising from the massive troves of data they collect, then used to train their machine learning models, progress on this front has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/technology/artificial-intelligence-google-bias.html">hardly been smooth</a>. In the meantime, smaller AI-powered companies that can&#8217;t afford teams of individuals are largely winging it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Enter Singh&#8217;s company, <a href="https://www.credo.ai/">Credo AI</a>, a SaaS outfit that&#8217;s today taking the wraps off $5.5 million in funding that it raised from Decibel, Village Global and AI Fund.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s promise is pretty straightforward as she explains it, even as it&#8217;s managing the complex. Singh and her current team of 15 employees have developed a risk framework that gives companies a window into their own governance. It&#8217;s not so much that the startup&#8217;s tech is revolutionary (is our understanding) but rather that Credo AI addresses what is often a lack of accountability within organizations by giving them a control panel with the tools to manage all manner of data they are collecting, as well as suggest controls they might not be using, like IEEE standards they can integrate to provide stronger guardrails for their machine learning models.</p>
<p>&#8220;What many companies haven&#8217;t really figured out is that there is a lack of common language and alignment on what &#8216;good&#8217; looks like in AI governance, so organizations are really looking for help with that standardization,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Credo AI&#8217;s software is not a one-size-fits all offering, Singh notes. Different organizations see different impacts from their models, and even within so-called industry verticals, individual companies often have different objectives. &#8220;Fairness is not defined within different sectors,&#8221; says Singh, who points as an example to financial services, where much is getting redefined on an ongoing basis by federal banking agencies. &#8220;What is fairness for fraud mean? What is fairness for credit underwriting?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rather than wait for answers, says Singh, Credo AI works with companies to align on what their own values are, then it offers them the tools to manage accordingly, including to add additional metrics when they choose, and different stakeholders. &#8220;We want to enable your data science team to collaborate with your compliance team, your executive to collaborate with your machine-earning person, your product manager to collaborate with your risk manager,&#8221; says Singh.</p>
<p>Credo AI want to help companies avoid those face-palm moments &#8212; or worse.</p>
<p>Certainly, it&#8217;s a big market opportunity. According to data published earlier this year by the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide revenue for the AI market, including software, hardware and services, was expected to grow 16.4% year over year in 2021, to $327.5 billion. By 2024, said IDC, the market is expected to break the $500 billion mark.</p>
<p>As companies spend more on AI, they&#8217;ll presumably need more help to make sure it&#8217;s performing the way they expect and not causing harm. Indeed, if Singh has her way, working with Credo AI will one day serve as a kind of stamp that companies use to advertise their focus on ethical AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do our jobs right,&#8221; says Singh, &#8220;I want anyone who&#8217;s building good AI to be associated with Credo AI. That is certainly our aspiration.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Without a good technical foundation, you may end up accumulating a lot of technical debt.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having a great idea isn’t enough when you’re starting a startup. You have to execute well on that idea by making the right decisions at the right time. In particular, you have to pick the right tech stack for your product. Without a good technical foundation, you can end up accumulating a lot of technical debt.</p>
<p>So to help founders understand what a good tech stack should look like, we invited two experts on this topic, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/preeti-somal">Preeti Somal</a>, the EVP of Engineering at <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com">HashiCorp</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jill-wetzler">Jill Wetzler</a>, the VP of Engineering at <a href="https://pilot.com">Pilot</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> to discuss everything from evaluating vendors to making sure you can rely on an open source product.</p>
<h2>Making sure your team can ship quickly</h2>
<p>Some development environments are more familiar than others. For instance, if you choose to work with a popular framework, it’ll be easier to find engineers to join your team, and the learning curve will be easier for your existing developers.</p>
<p>Your tech stack isn’t limited to the language your team is using. Choosing a good CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) framework can help you release updates more frequently. Using test suites is also a key element of a good development pipeline.</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked at how we were thinking about developer productivity and our environment. What are the things that can help our team move really fast and ship really fast? Because I think that is the name of the game when you&#8217;re talking about a startup. It just comes down to how you can get your code out the door as quickly as possible,&#8221; Wetzler said.</p>
<p>Wetzler knows what she&#8217;s talking about on this front as she experienced the <i>opposite</i> of that in a previous job when she was working for Twitter. &#8220;Twitter was making some decisions that I think were based on some people&#8217;s personal preferences at the time. We started to fork our own versions of git and our build system as well. It just became a mess that had to be untangled over a number of years. And so you really do pay for those decisions down the line,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The ability to reuse your code across different platforms can also help you manage multiple projects more easily. That can be important if you’re in charge of the roadmap and you want to have some visibility when you’re planning the next quarter.</p>
<p>“We had done a really good job of making some investments in our back-end productivity. But when it came to front end, we were really missing a lot of the key infrastructure pieces that helped us build a front end really quickly,” Wetzler said. She worked on fixing that when she joined Pilot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA and Boeing provided an update on the beleaguered Starliner capsule Tuesday, confirming that the earliest the spacecraft will fly will be sometime during the first half of next year. Starliner was grounded in August, after an issue with the oxidizer valves was discovered roughly four and a half hours before launch.</p>
<p>The launch was part of an uncrewed test flight, dubbed Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2), the second for Starliner. Since the issue was discovered, Boeing has still been unable to identify the root cause of why 13 of the 24 valves in the propulsion system remained stuck in the closed position during routine pre-mission activities.</p>
<p>Two valves have been removed from the spacecraft and sent to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, where they will be disassembled and examined for further investigation, Michelle Parker, Boeing’s chief engineer of space and launch, said during a media briefing Tuesday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Launchpad hiccups indefinitely delay Boeing&#8217;s troubled Starliner orbital test&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/launchpad-hiccups-indefinitely-delay-boeings-troubled-starliner-orbital-test/embed/#?secret=M6F0cERslV" data-secret="M6F0cERslV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing and SpaceX each contracts for six round-trip crewed missions to the International Space Station under its Commercial Crew Program (CCP). The agency is going through both contracts to potentially add even more flights to each company’s roster, particularly in light of the likely extension of the operational life of the ISS past 2024, Steve Stich, NASA’s manager of CCP, said in the media briefing. The eventual schedule could see each company ferrying astronauts to and from the station once a year.</p>
<p>NASA maintains “every confidence that Boeing will be flying crew soon,” Stich said. “We’ll get this problem solved and then we’ll have two space transportation systems like we want, with Boeing and SpaceX both flying [ … ] I have no reason to believe Boeing won’t be successful.”</p>
<p>Even once Boeing gets Starliner back to the launch pad, Boeing’s CCP program manager John Vollmer estimated it would be around six months between a successful OFT-2 and a crewed mission. He added that the cost of the valve investigation and launch delay will be borne by Boeing, not NASA.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the second launch attempt for Starliner, after OFT-1 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-fails-to-enter-planned-target-orbit-for-space-station-docking/">failed to enter the target orbit</a> in a 2019 launch due to a software issue. SpaceX, the other contractor selected under NASA’s CCP, has flown three crewed missions with its Crew Dragon capsule and will conduct a fourth on Halloween.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside today&#8217;s release of the new Pixel 6 smartphones, Google has again upgraded one of the device&#8217;s most basic &#8212; but often overlooked &#8212; functions: the ability to make phone calls. In previous years, Google Assistant learned to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/googles-pixels-get-a-feature-drop-with-call-screen-and-camera-enhancements/">screen your calls</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/09/google-duplex-is-coming-to-pixel-phones-next-month/">make your reservations by phone</a> via a technology called Duplex. Last year, it learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/a-new-google-assistant-feature-hold-for-me-waits-on-hold-so-you-dont-have-to/">how to wait on hold for you</a>, too. Today, Google is <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/phone-app-updates/">expanding</a> some of these existing features and adding new ones &#8212; including a tool that shows you the best time to call a business and a new Duplex-powered feature for navigating businesses&#8217; phone trees.</p>
<p>With the Phone app on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, a new feature called &#8220;Wait Times&#8221; will display the projected time it will take to get through to a person when dialing a toll-free number. You&#8217;ll be able to see this information before you place the call not only for the present time, but also for the rest of the week. This information may allow you to make a better decision about when to place the call.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220563" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220563" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220563" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Wait-Times.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220540" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, in order to show this information, Google is leveraging its ability to collect data from its users. Similar to how Google Maps will show you when a business is the most crowded using anonymized data from Maps users, &#8220;Wait Times&#8221; are inferred from call length data when calls are placed through its phone app. This data is not linked to individual users, Google says.</p>
<p>Another new addition is the &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; feature, which will help you get through complicated phone trees when you dial a business. Instead of listening and trying to remember the many options presented (e.g., &#8220;Press 1 for hours and locations&#8221;), Google Assistant will translate the automated messages for you. This allows you to read back through the options to see which number you&#8217;ll want to tap to get the information you need &#8212; or to reach a live agent, as is often the case.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220562" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220562" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2220562 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Direct-My-Call.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220562" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In the past, users frustrated with difficult customer service calls may have turned to third-party apps and websites like <a href="https://gethuman.com/">GetHuman</a>, to figure out how to reach a real person more quickly. But these websites aren&#8217;t always up to date. &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; offers an alternative. You could multitask or even set your phone down while the various options are read aloud &#8212; something that&#8217;s tedious to have to listen to in real time. When you return to the phone, you&#8217;ll be able to read the options available and choose the one you need. (The feature could also help those who are hard of hearing, but who don&#8217;t yet require a <a href="http://www.abouttty.com/">TTY</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like the the earlier reservation-setting feature, &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; is also powered by Google Duplex technology.</p>
<p>Duplex is sometimes confused with the reservation scheduling feature itself, which was one of the first big use cases for the technology when it debuted. But <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Duplex itself</a> doesn&#8217;t just enable natural-sounding conversations for making your appointments. It can be used for understanding, too. In the case of &#8220;Direct My Call,&#8221; for example, Duplex uses advanced speech recognition and language understanding models to help determine when the business wants you to do something &#8212; like press a number, say a word (like &#8220;representative&#8221;) or enter your account number, among other things.</p>
<p>In addition to &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; and &#8220;Wait Times,&#8221; which are launching with the Pixel devices, for the time being, Google is also expanding access to &#8220;Hold for Me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since launching last year in the U.S., the feature has saved users over 1.5 million minutes per month. In the coming months, it will begin to roll out to Pixel users in Australia, Canada and Japan, as well, says Google.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Google&#8217;s existing call screening functions are also getting an upgrade.</p>
<p>Before, Google&#8217;s own caller ID coverage would help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/googles-pixels-get-a-feature-drop-with-call-screen-and-camera-enhancements/">users to identify spam and other calls</a> from unknown numbers. Now, it will allow users to contribute data about their incoming business calls, too. That means you&#8217;ll be able to share what type of business had called you (e.g., bill collectors, finance, utilities, etc.) so that others who receive the same call in the future will know what to expect. This data is shared without any personal identifiers, notes Google. The company believes this will help double the number of businesses with caller ID information going forward.</p>
<p>In addition, call screening will expand to more markets. In the U.S., Canada and Japan, it&#8217;s now screening 37 million calls per month. Starting today, it will roll out to Pixel users in the U.K., France, Germany, Australia, Ireland, Italy and Spain, too.</p>
<p>Typically, Google releases new features to its latest Pixel phones first, before rolling them out over time to more Pixel devices or Android more broadly. That means &#8220;Wait Times&#8221; and &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; will likely be exclusive to Pixel 6 phones for some time, initially.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The private phone data of hundreds of thousands of people are at risk. Call records, text messages, photos, browsing history, precise geolocations and call recordings can all be pulled from a person&#8217;s phone because of a security issue in widely used consumer-grade spyware.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s about as much as we can tell you. TechCrunch repeatedly emailed the developer, whose identity is well hidden, through all known and non-public email addresses, but lines of inquiry to disclose the issue went cold. We sent emails with open trackers to tell if they had been read, but no luck there either.</p>
<p>Efforts were made to contact the spyware developer because the security and privacy of thousands of people are at risk until the issue is fixed. We can&#8217;t name the spyware or its developer since it would make it easier for bad actors to access the insecure data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219331" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch discovered the security issue as part of a wider investigation into consumer-grade spyware. These apps, often marketed as child tracking or monitoring software, can go by another name — &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; — for their ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/android-malware-system-update/">track and monitor people</a> without their consent. These spyware apps silently and continually siphon the contents of a person&#8217;s phone, allowing its operator to track a person&#8217;s whereabouts and who they communicate with. Many will have no idea that their phones are compromised, since these apps are designed to disappear from home screens to avoid detection or deletion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am disappointed but not even slightly surprised,&#8221; said Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who led the effort to launch the Coalition Against Stalkerware, in a call with TechCrunch. &#8220;I think that we could reasonably characterize this kind of behavior as negligent. Not only do we have a company, which is making a product which enables abuse, but they&#8217;re doing such a poor job of securing the information that&#8217;s exfiltrated that they are opening the targets of this abuse to even further abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch also contacted Codero, the web company that provides hosting for the developer&#8217;s spyware infrastructure, but Codero did not respond to several requests for comment. Codero is no stranger to hosting stalkerware; the web host &#8220;took action&#8221; against stalkerware maker Mobiispy in 2019 after it was found <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7xnybe/hosting-provider-takes-down-spyware-mobiispy">spilling thousands of photos and phone recordings</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s no surprise the web host which hosts one stalkerware company would host other stalkerware companies, and they would if they were previously unresponsive, that they would be unresponsive this time around,&#8221; said Galperin.</p>
<p>The proliferation of this easy-to-obtain spyware prompted an industrywide effort to crack down on these apps. Antivirus makers have worked to improve their ability to detect stalkerware, and Google has also banned spyware makers from promoting their products as a way to spy on a spouse&#8217;s phone, though some developers are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/google-pulls-stalkerware-ads-that-promoted-phone-spying-apps/">using new tactics</a> to evade Google&#8217;s ads ban.</p>
<p>Mobile spyware is no stranger to security issues. In the past few years, over a dozen stalkerware makers are known to have been hacked, left data exposed or otherwise compromised the data of people&#8217;s phones — including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/mobile-spyware-maker-leaks-2-million-records/">mSpy</a>, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7x77ex/hacker-strikes-stalkerware-companies-stealing-alleged-texts-and-gps-locations-of-customers">Mobistealth</a>, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/aemeae/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers">Flexispy</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywk8gy/spyware-family-orbit-children-photos-data-breach">Family Orbit</a>. Another stalkerware, KidsGuard, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">had a security lapse</a> that exposed thousands of people&#8217;s phone data, and most recently <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezj8/stalkerware-leaking-phone-screenshots-pctattletale">pcTattleTale</a>, which promotes itself as able to spy on a spouse&#8217;s device, was leaking screenshots by way of easily guessable web addresses.</p>
<p>Federal regulators are starting to take notice. In September, the Federal Trade Commission banned SpyFone, a stalkerware app that also exposed the phone data of more than 2,000 people, and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">ordered to notify victims that their phones had been hacked</a>. It&#8217;s the second action taken by the FTC against a spyware maker; the first was Retina-X, after the company was hacked several times and eventually <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/neqgn8/retina-x-spyware-shuts-down-apps">shut down</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since 2015, <a href="http://plaid.com">Plaid</a> has helped developers connect users to banking information using an SDK (software development kit) called Plaid Link. As Plaid describes it in its <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/link/">SDK documentation</a>, &#8220;The Plaid Link SDK is a quick and secure way to link bank accounts to Plaid in your &#8230; app.&#8221; Up until recently, the catch was that each time developers updated their application, they had to manually apply their changes across all of their platforms, whether Android, iOS or web.</p>
<p>Last year, the company decided there had to be a better, more user-friendly way and began releasing an overhauled version of the SDK to parts of its user base, beginning in February, that enabled developers to update once and apply it across the various supported application development platforms.</p>
<p>It took a go-slow approach because even though the changes were designed to improve the developer experience, they were significant enough that they wanted to be sure they weren&#8217;t breaking anything before they rolled them out to the entire user base. This kind of rolling release is common among developers, especially when they&#8217;ve made substantial changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220239" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Even as this SDK overhaul was going on, the company faced other challenges. In January 2020, Plaid announced it had been purchased<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/"> by Visa for $5.3 billion</a>, but the deal ran into insurmountable regulatory issues and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">was finally scuttled</a> at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Today, as the company is shooting for 100% distribution of the updated Plaid Link, we spoke to Will Kiefer, principal engineer and architectural lead at the company, to discuss why his team went about overhauling the SDK and what startups can learn from Plaid&#8217;s journey.</p>
<h2>Creating a simpler workflow</h2>
<p>Kiefer says that the goal was to simplify developer interactions to make it easier for them to take advantage of updates to the SDK itself while simplifying updates for applications based on Plaid Link. That involved taking SDKs built for each environment &#8212; iOS, Android or the web &#8212; and combining them into a single portal.</p>
<p>This would not only help the developer users &#8212; it would also make life easier for Plaid, which would no longer have to update three separate tool sets. &#8220;The problem was that we had these three SDKs, and they had all the logic in them for these [three] user flows. So anytime we wanted to edit it, adjust it or create something new we had to, like our customers, go and update that [across all three SDKs],&#8221; Kiefer explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company wanted to change that both for themselves and their users. The net effect of that was taking any burden off of the user and following a given workflow that would go into effect whenever it was needed. If you were an iOS developer, it would take you on that workflow automatically without having to explicitly bring up the iOS SDK, making sure it was up-to-date and then updating the application connecting to Plaid Link.</p>
<p>As Kiefer said, moving these operations to the back end in this fashion wasn&#8217;t particularly unusual. It&#8217;s something that Facebook, YouTube and Instagram have been doing for some time, but the difference here was that it was applying a novel data structure, which was connected to a graph database on the back end that would drive the correct workflow.</p>
<p>And because it was shifted in this way, Plaid could update the SDK without having the user download a new SDK to take advantage of each change, greatly simplifying the user experience and shifting it to what he calls &#8220;user flow as a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our SDK for all these customers is just this little portal into our user flow as a service, so they don&#8217;t have to update it [manually.] They can be on their own schedule and can do their own thing and we can continually revise the experience without forcing everybody to update [the SDK] every time.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Kiefer offered an example: Say you have a payment app like Venmo and Plaid improves the search functionality in the SDK. Previously, you would have to download the SDK, then update it and recompile your program to get access to the new search feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say we figure out a way to make search better &#8230; when someone&#8217;s connecting their account, we can just launch that change on our back end, and you use Venmo in the morning &#8230; and now you have a better search experience. So there really is no involvement from a user or developer, and the SDK is just a little portal that [suddenly] connects to our [improved] search [tool],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Beyond the purely practical benefits of this new approach for Plaid and the developer users, there is also a data angle here because Plaid can see what&#8217;s happening in these user experience flows across all its customers. &#8220;We have all the data we need to know that a particular customer is not converting well or maybe they didn&#8217;t integrate our SDK correctly or maybe there&#8217;s some improvement we could make for this particular customer [based on this data].&#8221;</p>
<p>Plaid took this one step further by adding alerts based on the customer or the products they are using. &#8220;We have all these alerts now, and we can slice and dice the data of what&#8217;s happening in these flows all on our end, and be more proactive around doing fixes for the customers or finding things that are wrong earlier without customers having to tell us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>One of the advantages to all of this, and a lesson that other startups could take from this experience, is that even though they released it slowly, this revamped platform approach essentially gives the company a way to roll out other services in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next wave of the suite of products we&#8217;re going to be launching in 2022 are essentially all built on this. So the platform [has been] done, even if we&#8217;re slowly approaching 100%, and that means that all the new features that our teams are developing are built fully on this [new platform],&#8221; Kiefer said.</p>

<p>In light of today’s chat, I’d thought it’d be useful to explain why we ran <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/how-our-startup-boosted-productivity-with-get-s-done-day/">this guest post by Travelpayouts head Ivan Baidin</a> touting the productivity gains created by introducing a GSSD program, aka “Getting S*** Done Day.”</p>
<p>One day every other week, Travelpayouts “employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved,” writes Baidin.</p>
<p>Getting S*** Done Day has allowed the team to address “sidelined” projects that may have seemed like small potatoes: rebuilding lifecycle emails, improving analytics and optimizing working hours.</p>
<p>Completing each of these “eternally postponed” tasks created incremental gains, says Baidin. “That is something we value a lot.”</p>
<p>This article contains strategic, actionable advice for implementing a GSDD program alongside the lessons the team learned as they identified problems with the experiment. It’s a classic TechCrunch+ “how-to.”</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading!</p>

<p>Our latest long-form look at a notable tech company examines Automattic, “the leading commercial complement to the open source WordPress publishing platform.”</p>
<p>At 16 years old, the company is growing into a major media player: Its purchase of Tumblr expanded its reach into social media, and WooCommerce, its open-source e-commerce plugin for WordPress users, integrates with POS systems in the real world.</p>
<p>Broken into four parts, this series examines Automattic from multiple angles:</p>
<p>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-origin/">How doing everything wrong turned Automattic into a multibillion dollar media powerhouse</a> (origin story)</p>
<p>Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-developers/">There’s nothing Automattic about balancing commercial growth with an open source developer community</a> (open source development)</p>

<p>With budgets that go into the millions, video games are no small business. And the fast-growing mobile gaming sector is shaping up to be an even more lucrative market.</p>
<p>That’s especially true in the massive mobile game market in China, but the country’s strict regulatory requirements have given pause to international game developers looking to enter.</p>
<p>But there’s a lot to learn from how Chinese publishers have navigated the regulatory environment, writes Jeff Sue, GM of Americas at mobile ad platform Mintegral.</p>
<p>Sue dives deep into the Chinese mobile gaming sector in a TechCrunch+ guest post, outlining how global publishers can successfully advertise and capture market share in China by pursuing local partnerships, focusing on smaller, emerging Chinese cities and studying emerging social media trends.</p>

<p>So far, 2021 seems like a golden era for raising startup funding, but deep tech startups still face challenges, as few VCs have the patience or risk appetite to experiment — or wait for their investment to show returns.</p>
<p>However, deep tech startups have one source of capital that can also impart a fair amount of prestige, according to CoCoPie co-founder and CTO, Xipeng Shen: Federal grants.</p>
<p>“Being selected out of thousands of U.S. applicants signals that your innovation has strong technical and commercial merit and the potential for broad U.S. economic impact,” he writes.</p>
<p>In a detailed post, Shen outlines the process they followed for acceptance into the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program, noting that his company is using the funding tactically “to convert our technology into a minimum viable product.”</p>

<p>Latin America is very quickly becoming a hotbed for fintech startups, and VCs, savvy or not, are rushing to invest.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of factors driving this growth, but one important focus of tech seems to be at the heart of the innovation here: APIs built around open banking.</p>
<p>In a traditionally restrictive banking environment, startups like Nubank and Rebaja Tus Cuentas are revolutionizing banking and financial services, and their efforts can be compounded by the use of open banking APIs, according to Ximena Aleman, co-founder and chief business development officer at Prometeo.</p>
<p>“An open API ecosystem, in which third-party service providers access consumer data from financial institutions, means financial services will be optimized to lower costs and time spent on transactions and improve user experience,” she writes in a TechCrunch+ guest post.</p>

<p>E-bikes just exploded in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and no U.S. company in the sector has raised a bigger funding round than Rad Power Bikes’ $150 million raise this year.</p>
<p>Pockets full of cash, the direct-to-consumer company is looking to expand its international presence and scale aggressively while keeping its focus on the one thing that has helped it grow so far: “Being user-friendly,” says founder Mike Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>In a free-wheeling interview with Rebecca Bellan, Radenbaugh talked about the e-bike revolution, diversifying the supply chain, and if the boom in e-bike sales will last.</p>

<p>The entire startup ecosystem gets downright jittery when China brings any new regulation into force — their livelihoods depend on it, after all.</p>
<p>But it seems there’s no slowing the thrust of VC investment in China. As Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim found out this morning, the third quarter of 2021 has by far been the best ever for Chinese startups.</p>
<p>“Will future regulatory activity by the Chinese government manage to impact startup investing in the future? We do not know. But investors are laying bets like they do, which is worth noting.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Buried deep in President Joe Biden’s 2021 tax plan are new amendments to the United States’ <a href="https://www.sba.gov/blog/qualified-small-business-stock-what-it-how-use-it">Qualified Small Business Stock</a> (QSBS) program, which, if passed, will directly impact early-stage startup employees, founders and investors.</p>
<p>Lawmakers say the proposed changes to QSBS are designed to raise taxes on America’s millionaires and billionaires. But the net they’re casting is so wide that it will undoubtedly catch rank-and-file startup employees, who can easily (and temporarily) find themselves pushed into the country’s top tax bracket if they exercise stock options or sell their shares.</p>
<p>Congress should immediately reconsider these changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220183" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We fear that these unintended consequences could choke innovation and harm a small group of people while raising what will amount to a rounding error’s worth of new tax revenue for the federal government.</p>
<p>If you’ve exercised stock options in an early-stage startup at any point in the last five years, the proposed QSBS change may affect you when you decide to sell your shares in an exit. You might even be holding QSBS-qualifying stock without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Lawmakers want to reduce the QSBS gain exclusion rates to 50% for people who report more than $400,000 in adjusted gross income in a single year, and trusts and estates holding QSBS shares.</p>
<p>The QSBS exemption was initially enacted in 1993 as a tax incentive for small business owners, their investors and early employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most technology startups begin life as QSBS-qualifying companies, and there can be significant tax benefits to founders, early-stage investors and early employees if they earn or exercise stock options during a startup’s earliest years.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine an engineer who joins a seed-stage software startup and is granted 200,000 stock options at $1 per share. The engineer exercises their stock options early, while the company has raised less than $50 million in venture capital.</p>
<p>Six years later, the startup gets acquired, and the engineer’s 200,000 shares are now worth $10 million.</p>
<p>Under current tax law, the engineer would be able to avoid paying an estimated $2.3 million in federal capital gains taxes under the QSBS exemption — $1.96 million in long-term capital gains (20%), and $372,400 in Net Investment Income Tax (3.8%).</p>
<p>Under the proposed changes to the tax code, the engineer would only be able to exclude federal capital gains taxes on half of their profits using the QSBS exemption.</p>
<p>The remaining $5 million would face taxes of nearly $1.6 million — $1.25 million in long-term capital gains (25% under the current proposal), $190,000 in Net Investment Income Tax (3.8%) and $150,000 of a newly proposed high-income surcharge tax.</p>
<p>Congress says they’re targeting America’s wealthiest people by rolling back the QSBS exemption.</p>
<p>In practice, the QSBS exemption has been popular with startup founders, investors and startup employees — people who take significant financial risks to fuel the startup ecosystem. QSBS was originally designed to reward those of us who drive the country’s innovation engine.</p>
<p>Effectively chopping this tax exemption in half will needlessly choke the innovation ecosystem, while raising an estimated average of<a href="https://www.qsbsexpert.com/joint-committee-on-taxation-estimates-revenue-gained-by-slashed-qsbs-exclusion/"> $570 million</a> per year in new tax revenue over the next decade, according to an analysis of federal data by QSBS Expert. That’s an inconsequential amount compared to the nation’s $3.5 trillion infrastructure plan.</p>
<p>The result will be a slight uptick in new federal revenue, taken from a relatively small group of people working in the innovation economy, and not worth the potential damage to startups. The QSBS exemption must be protected.</p>
<p><em>(Note: QSBS only applies to a specific set of small businesses and startups and requires people to earn or exercise their stock options while the company is still relatively small, and hold onto their shares for at least five years before selling them. Work with a CPA to find out if your shares qualify.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/introducing-arcadia">announced</a> on Tuesday that it’s launching a global creative studio to help brands develop augmented reality (AR) advertising and experiences. The new studio is called <a href="https://www.arcadiacreativestudio.com/">Arcadia</a> and aims to help companies develop experiences that can be used across web platforms and app-based AR environments.</p>
<p>The studio will partner with brands and creators to engage with Snapchat’s millennial and Gen Z audience. Arcadia has already partnered with numerous companies, including Verizon, WWE, Shake Shack and P&amp;G Beauty.</p>
<p>Arcadia will function as a division of Snap and have the creative freedom to operate independently and help brands create AR experiences, not just for Snapchat but for other social media platforms as well. Snap outlines that Arcadia will serve brands and creators in various ways that align with their goals. For instance, Arcadia can take on all of a brand’s AR production or simply offer AR strategy expertise to clients in the form of workshops and trend reporting.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220417" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Arcadia delivers a compelling solution for brands and agencies who understand the immediate value of developing world-class AR experiences, rooted in craft, technology and customer experience,” said Jeff Miller, the global head of creative strategy at Snap, in a statement. “With the launch of Arcadia, Snap Inc. is further investing in an AR ecosystem, backed by partners, creators and tools, that drives full-funnel results for businesses across the globe.”</p>
<p>Snap has been leveraging AR capabilities across Snapchat in several different ways over the past few years. Its first popular foray into the technology gave users the ability to add filters, such as dog ears, on top of their photos and videos. The company later expanded this by letting users add their animated Bitmoji characters to their videos.</p>
<p>More recently, Snap announced several updates to its developer tools and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">AR-focused Lens Studio</a>, many of which are focused on bringing shopping deeper into the Snapchat experience. The company also announced a new generation of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar/">AR-capable Spectacles</a> in May. The fourth generation of the glasses will operate 30 minutes at a time, feature dual 3D waveguide displays and a 26.3-degree diagonal field of view.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s plenty of frustration in the world of startups over when a digital asset does and does not constitute a security in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Where many see regulatory murkiness, the five-year-old, New York-based investing platform <a href="https://republic.co/">Republic </a>sees opportunity. Indeed, while many outfits grapple with whether to distance themselves from certain digital assets, Republic &#8212; whose CEO, Kendrick Nguyen, started his career in securities litigation with Goodwin Procter &#8212; has focused from the start on establishing itself as a go-to brand for what Nguyen calls &#8220;compliant tokenization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the company is hinting at big ambitions to expand on what it has already built to create, potentially, a compliance-focused marketplace for digital securities &#8212; emphasis on &#8220;securities&#8221; &#8212;  to be bought and resold.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219742" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Nguyen told us during a call late last week, &#8220;Within the United States, none of these major exchanges deal with digital security tokens,&#8221; meaning tokens that derive their value from an external, tradable asset like real estate, versus utility tokens that offer a right to use a product or service.</p>
<p>For example, it&#8217;s because the SEC has made it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/technology/ripple-cryptocurrency-sec-lawsuit.html">very plain</a> that it sees XRP, the cryptocurrency developed by Ripple Labs, as a security, that exchanges like Coinbase don&#8217;t list it for sale.</p>
<p>Nguyen said Republic would be willing to &#8220;partner right now&#8221; with an exchange &#8220;that is capable, that delivers good customer service, and that can facilitate secondary active trading of securities and digital securities&#8221; in the U.S. But it doesn&#8217;t exist, he maintains, so &#8220;if in another year, we do not see a solution out there, Republic will look to invest or build directly through an affiliate, a secondary exchange for digital securities.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be among the most ambitious in a growing list of products that Republic oversees and that have attracted more than one million users &#8212; along with some serious financing backing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just today, the company is announcing a $150 million Series B round led by Valor Equity Partners, which follows a $36 million Series A round that the company announced in March from Galaxy Interactive, Motley Fool Ventures, HOF Capital, Tribe Capital and CoinFund. (Those earlier investors just re-upped, by the way, and were joined by new backers Pillar VC, Brevan Howard, GoldenTree and Atreides.)</p>
<p>Altogether, says Nguyen, Republic, which employs 200 people, had raised more than $50 million in equity financing ahead of this newest round, and more than $20 million in a token sale.</p>
<p>The outfit is certainly busy putting it all to work. Republic already comprises several different business arms, including a popular retail investment platform that invites people to invest with as little as $10; a private capital division with almost $1 billion in assets under management that funnels accredited investors into startups; and a blockchain consultancy arm that provides technical, financing, distribution and tokenization services.</p>
<p>Republic also right now has two affiliated closed-end investment funds deploying capital into startups and crypto projects, along with a digital investment arm operating as Republic Realm that focuses exclusively on metaverses and NFTs.</p>
<p>Asked how Republic manages it all, Nguyen says &#8220;not to think of it as different platforms&#8221; but a company that can cater to everyone, no matter their interests or bank account balance. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a multimillionaire coming to Republic and it&#8217;s not worth your time to make a $100 investment but you want to deploy $100,000, we have those opportunities to present to you. If you&#8217;re 20 years old, and you want to invest $20 in a video game or in real estate or in a female founder, we have those opportunities, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is to cater to the &#8220;entire population,&#8221; he says, and he insists that Republic can pull it off owing to the technical capabilities it has built up &#8212; along with one guiding principle. That&#8217;s Republic&#8217;s firm belief that &#8220;most tokens, including in the DeFi and NFT space, are securities.&#8221; As a result, he says, &#8220;everything that Republic does, everything we touch, we treat them as securities by and large and fit them under the existing framework of U.S securities law.&#8221;</p>
<p>If other investment platforms want to push back on the SEC, that&#8217;s certainly their prerogative. As for Republic, Nguyen says, &#8220;We&#8217;re not looking for new rules and regulations to do what we do. What we do is based on existing law, on firm legal foundation.&#8221;</p>
