										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monzo founder Tom Blomfield is departing the U.K. challenger bank entirely at the end of the month, staff were informed earlier today.</p>
<p>Blomfield held the role of CEO until May last year when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/monzo-co-founder-tom-blomfield-moves-from-uk-ceo-role-to-president/">he assumed the newly created title of president</a> and resigned from the Monzo board. However, having been given the time and space to consider his long-term future at the bank he helped create 6 years ago, and with a refreshed executive team now in place, he says it is time to &#8220;hand over the baton&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a brief but candid telephone interview, Blomfield also revealed that, as well as being unhappy during the last couple of years as CEO when the company scaled well beyond a &#8220;scrappy startup,&#8221; the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns exasperated pressures placed on his own mental well-being. “I’m very happy to talk about what’s gone on with me, because I don’t think people do it enough,” he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I stopped enjoying my role probably about two years ago… as we grew from a scrappy startup that was iterating and building stuff people really love, into a really important U.K. bank. I’m not saying that one is better than the other, just that the things I enjoy in life is working with small groups of passionate people to start and grow stuff from scratch, and create something customers love. And I think that’s a really valuable skill but also taking on a bank that’s three, four, five million customers and turning it into a ten or twenty million customer bank and getting to profitability and IPOing it, I think those are huge exciting challenges, just honestly not ones that I found that I was interested in or particularly good at”.</p>
<p>In early 2019 after realising he was “doing too much and not enjoying it,” Blomfield began talking to Monzo investor Eileen Burbidge of Passion Capital, and Monzo Chair Gary Hoffman, about changing roles and how he needed more help. Then, he says, “Covid just exasperated things,” a period when Monzo also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/monzo-lay-offs/">had to cut staff</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/monzo-to-shutter-las-vegas/">shutter its Las Vegas office</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/monzo-confirms-60m-down-round/">raise bridge funding</a> in a highly publicised down round.</p>
<p>“I think [for] a lot of people in the world &#8212; and you and I have spoken about this &#8212; going through a pandemic, going through lockdown and the isolation involved in that has an impact on people’s mental health,” says Blomfield. “I don’t think I was any different, so I was really struggling. I had a really, really supportive exec team around me and a really supportive set of investors on board and I was really grateful that when I put my hand up and said, ‘I need help,’ they were super receptive to that”.</p>
<p>Blomfield also comes clean about his role as president, a title that was intended as a way to provide the time and space for him to get well and figure out if he would return to longer-term to Monzo or depart entirely. Contrary to rumours, Blomfield says he wasn’t pushed out by investors. Instead, the Monzo board actually put pressure on him to remain as CEO longer than he wanted or perhaps should have (a version of events corroborated by my own sources). “When I took that president role, it was not certain one way or another what would happen,” Blomfield says, apologising in case I felt I was misled when I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/monzo-co-founder-tom-blomfield-moves-from-uk-ceo-role-to-president/">reported</a> the news.</p>
<p>(The truth is, within weeks of running that news piece, I knew it was far from certain Blomfield would ever return, with multiple sources, including people close to and worried about Blomfield, confiding in me how burned out the Monzo founder was. As weeks turned into months and following additional sourcing, I had enough information to write a follow up story much earlier but chose to wait until a formal decision was taken).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Blomfield describes his resignation as a Monzo employee as &#8220;bitter-sweet,&#8221; and is keen to praise what the Monzo team has already achieved, including since his much reduced involvement. &#8220;I think the team has done phenomenally well over the last year or so in really difficult circumstances,&#8221; he says. In particular, he cites Monzo&#8217;s new CEO TS Anil as doing a &#8220;phenomenal&#8221; job, while describing Sujata Bhatia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/monzo-coo/">who joined as COO last year</a>, as &#8220;an absolute machine, a real operator&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="i6UbG8hfWc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/monzo-coo/">Monzo recruits former Amex exec Sujata Bhatia as its new COO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Monzo recruits former Amex exec Sujata Bhatia as its new COO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/monzo-coo/embed/#?secret=i6UbG8hfWc" data-secret="i6UbG8hfWc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To that end, Monzo now has almost 5 million customers, up from 1.3 million in 2019. Monzo’s total weekly revenue is now 30% higher than pre-pandemic, helped no doubt by over 100,000 paid subscribers across Monzo Plus and Premium in the last five months (sources tell me the company surpassed £2 million in weekly revenue in December for the first time in its history). Albeit at a lower valuation, the challenger bank also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/monzo-the-u-k-challenger-bank-picks-up-additional-60m-in-funding/">raised £125 million from new and existing investors</a> during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Blomfield also says that Anil and Bhatia and other members of the Monzo executive team have specific skills related to scaling and managing a bank approaching 5 million customers that he simply doesn&#8217;t. And even if he did, he has learned the hard way that there are aspects of running a large company that not everyone enjoys.</p>
<p>“Going from a CEO where you’re front and centre dealing with all of the different pressures every day to a much lighter role is a huge huge weight off my shoulders and has given me the time and space to recover,” he adds. “I’m now feeling pretty great. I’m enjoying life again”.</p>
<p>As for what&#8217;s next for Blomfield, he says he wants to &#8220;chill out&#8221; for a bit and perhaps take a holiday. He&#8217;s also finishing his vaccination training so that he can volunteer to help deliver the U.K.&#8217;s national COVID-19 vaccination rollout. A recent tweet by Blomfield about a side project also led to speculation that he has begun a new venture. Not true, says Blomfield, telling me it was a 5 day project designed to get back into coding and play with a robotic 2D printer. And while he&#8217;s very much left Monzo, he says he&#8217;ll continue cheering the company on from the outside.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_167">speech</a> to the European Parliament today marking the inauguration of US president Joe Biden, the president of the European Commission has called for Europe and the US to join forces on regulating tech giants, warning of the risks of &#8220;unfiltered&#8221; hate speech and disinformation being weaponized to attack and undermine democracies.</p>
<p>Ursula von der Leyen pointed to the shock storming of the US capital earlier this month by supporters of outgoing president Donald Trump as an example of how wild claims being spread and amplified online can have tangible real-world consequences, including for democratic institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a few days ago, several hundred [Trump supporters] stormed the Capitol in Washington, the heart of American democracy. The television images of that event shocked us all. That is what happens when words incite action,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That is what happens when hate speech and fake news spread like wildfire through digital media. They become a danger to democracy.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe seizes on social media&#8217;s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/embed/#?secret=DWZ8tov8eU" data-secret="DWZ8tov8eU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>European institutions are also being targeted with &#8220;hate and contempt for our democracy spreading unfiltered through social media to millions of people&#8221;, she warned, pointing to similarly disturbing attacks that have taken place in the region in recent years. Such as an attempt by right-wing extremists in Germany to storm the Reichstag building last summer and the 2016 murder of UK politician, Jo Cox, by a fascist extremist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, the storming of the [US] Capitol was different. But in Europe, too, there are people who feel disadvantaged and are very angry,&#8221; she said, suggesting feelings of exclusion and injustice can make <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">people vulnerable to believing the &#8220;rampant&#8221; conspiracy theories that platforms have allowed to circulate freely online, and which she characterized as &#8220;often a confused mixture of completely absurd fantasies&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We must make sure that messages of hate and fake news can no longer be spread unchecked,&#8221; she added, reiterating the case for regulating social media by pressing the case for imposing &#8220;democratic limits on the untrammelled and uncontrolled political power of the Internet giants&#8221;.</p>
<p>The European Commission has already set out its blueprint for overhauling the region&#8217;s digital rulebook when it unveiled the draft Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act last month. Although it won&#8217;t be including hard legal limits on disinformation in the package &#8212; preferring to continue with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">a voluntary, but beefed up code of conduct</a> for content that falls into a grey area where it may be harmful but isn&#8217;t actually illegal.</p>
<p>von der Leyen said the aim for the regulations is to ensure &#8220;if something is illegal offline it must also be illegal online&#8221;. The Commission has also said the tech policy package is about forcing platforms to take more responsibility for the content they spread and monetize.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not yet clear how the proposed laws will ultimately tackle the tricky issue of how assessments are made to remove (or reinstate) speech; and whether platforms will continue to make those judgements (under a regulator&#8217;s guidance and watchful eye), or whether they end up entirely independent of platform control.</p>
<p>What the Commission has suggested is closer to the former but the proposal has to go through the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process &#8212; so such details are likely to be debated and could be amended prior to adoption into law.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/embed/#?secret=k0Wqq2IZIv" data-secret="k0Wqq2IZIv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We want the platforms to be transparent about how their algorithms work. We cannot accept a situation where decisions that have a wide-ranging impact on our democracy are being made by computer programs without any human supervision,&#8221; von der Leyen went on. &#8220;And we want it laid down clearly that internet companies take responsibility for the content they disseminate.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> reiterated the concern expressed in recent days about the unilateral actions taken by tech giants to close down Trump&#8217;s megaphone &#8212; echoing comments by political leaders across Europe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/">earlier this month</a> who dubbed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">display of raw platform power</a>, from companies like Twitter, as &#8216;problematic&#8217;; and said it must result in regulatory consequences for tech giants.  </span></p>
<p>&#8220;No matter how right it may have been for Twitter to switch off Donald Trump&#8217;s account five minutes after midnight, such serious interference with freedom of expression should be based on laws and not on company rules,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;It should be based on decisions of politicians and parliaments and not of Silicon Valley managers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the speech, the EU president also expressed hope that the Biden administration will be inclined to arc toward Europe&#8217;s agenda on digital regulation &#8212; as part of the anticipated post-Trump reboot of EU-US relations.</p>
<p>The Commission recently adopted a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/europe-will-push-to-work-with-the-us-on-tech-governance-post-trump/">transatlantic agenda</a> in which it laid out a number of policy areas it hopes for joint-working with the US &#8212; with tech governance key among the areas of hoped for policy cooperation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6kaaKGu7DP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/europe-will-push-to-work-with-the-us-on-tech-governance-post-trump/">Europe will push to work with the US on tech governance, post-Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe will push to work with the US on tech governance, post-Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/europe-will-push-to-work-with-the-us-on-tech-governance-post-trump/embed/#?secret=6kaaKGu7DP" data-secret="6kaaKGu7DP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>von der Leyen reiterated the idea that a joint Trade and Technology Council could be &#8220;a first step&#8221; toward the EU and US fashioning a &#8220;digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in this digital field that Europe has so much to offer the new government in Washington,&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;The path we have taken in Europe can be an example for approaches at international level. As has long been the case with the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together we could create a digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide: From data protection and privacy to the security of technical infrastructure. A body of rules based on our values: human rights and pluralism, inclusion and protection of privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s evidently a keen appetite in the EU to reset US relations post-Trump, it remains to be seen how much of a policy reboot the Biden administration will usher in vis-a-vis big tech.</p>
<p>He has not been as vocal a critic of platform giants as other Democratic challengers for the presidency. And the Obama administration, which he of course served in, had very cosy ties to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Concerns have also been raised <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/biden-big-tech-antitrust-renata-hesse/?utm_campaign=theintercept&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">in recent days</a> about Biden&#8217;s potential picks for a key appointment at the justice office &#8212; in light of antitrust probes of big tech vs the prospective appointees&#8217; deep links to tech giants and/or promotion of historical mergers. So it hardly looks like a model for a full and clean reset.</p>
<p>While the tricky issue of pro-privacy reform of US surveillance laws &#8212; which EU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">commissioners have warned</a> will be needed to resolve the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">legal uncertainty clouding data transfers from the region to the US</a> (and which tech giants themselves have largely avoided in their own lobbying) &#8212; seems likely to need legislation from Congress, rather than being a change that could be driven solely by the Biden administration.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The chances of the incoming president being inclined to champion such a relatively wonky tech-policy issue when he has so much else in his &#8216;needs urgent attention&#8217; in-tray also seem relatively slim. But even slender odds can look promising after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/eu-us-privacy-shield-remains-precariously-placed/">the Trump era</a>.  </span></p>

		Jim Messina is a political and corporate advisor and CEO of <a href="https://themessinagroup.com/">The Messina Group</a>. He previously served as the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and as the campaign manager for Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">After serving as Obama-Biden campaign manager and White House Deputy Chief of Staff and now living in San Francisco and working with the tech sector, I am hopeful about the Biden-Harris administration&#8217;s ability to put in place smart policies and regulatory stability to further unleash the industry’s vast potential &#8212; not to mention the effect their calm and measured leadership could have on our greater economy.</p>
<p>However, with new leadership comes new perspectives on many of the most critical issues facing Silicon Valley. While the bonds between the innovation economy and the Obama-Biden Administration resulted in national prosperity, the tech sector is now intertwined in nearly every facet of American life.</p>
<p>The resulting tension means the new Administration will take its role as regulator seriously and investors and businesses alike should not overlook how quickly President Biden will move on policy – especially as it relates to the future of work and getting the U.S. economy back on track.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There’s no question the gig companies had a banner year in 2020. Even with ride-hailing usage down dramatically, the strength of meal, grocery and just about everything else delivered combined with the victory in California of Proposition 22 has driven up market caps and positioned many startups for going public. Yet, while the West Coast may be feeling emboldened, the Beltway has another trajectory in mind.</p>
<p>Congress has been working on gig worker classification legislation named the PRO Act for months. The bill closely mirrors the maligned California Assembly Bill 5 that Proposition 22 mostly reversed. It’s broadly supported by labor and could see some traction this year. Labor is already working hard to line up support from the various Congressional coalitions, and at the same time gig economy companies are gearing up to fight it with their unlimited resources.</p>
<p>The question is – what will President Biden do? Long ago he voiced his support for AB 5 and laid out plans to solve worker misclassification during the campaign, but he’s also hiring and appointing staff to the Administration deeply experienced in tech. President Biden has been governing longer than most startup founders have been alive, he’s a master at understanding forces in Washington and how to reach a compromise. He knows that what’s rarely discussed during legislative debate is how the law will actually be implemented.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We shouldn’t be surprised if the Biden Administration convenes the Department of Labor and the industry to determine how companies actually enact worker protections.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite most bills being thousands of pages, they’re rarely prescriptive. Those details are left up to agencies. President Biden has oversight of the Department of Labor, which, if the PRO Act is passed, will be responsible for its implementation.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t be surprised if the Biden Administration convenes the Department of Labor and the industry to determine how companies actually enact worker protections. President Biden’s nominee for Labor Secretary, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, while a staunch supporter of labor, is also well regarded by the business sector as someone they can work with and reach a compromise.</p>
<p>We just have to look to the states to understand why this outcome is so plausible. The gig companies already have Proposition 22 type campaigns underway in six states and are running legislation in a half dozen more. By the end of 2021 there will be law on the books codifying worker protections in nearly a third of the country, modeled on Proposition 22.</p>
<p>This kind of momentum is hard to ignore and labor knows it. Although labor is aligned in its support of the PRO Act, the alignment becomes blurry when considering state action. For example, many northeastern states have had a thriving black car and taxi industry for decades.</p>
<p>This means Labor&#8217;s position on gig laws in New York and New Jersey are quite different than places like Washington State or Illinois where gig workers are still relatively new and the ink is drying on regulations supported by Uber and Lyft just a few years ago. Labor is aligned as much as they can be and enough to support the PRO Act, but there isn’t a national movement and that leaves room for compromise.</p>
<p>This is all good news for the tech sector. It’s a fantasy to think that regulation wouldn’t eventually come to protect the very workers who power the gig economy. And that’s a good thing – tech has a moral responsibility to do right by its workers. However, those regulations shouldn’t and won’t be imposed on tech. Rather it will take weeks and months of campaigns and bills winding their way through the states and Congress, culminating with negotiations and compromises.</p>
<p>Or maybe even years of renewed regulatory processes. All of which will be overseen by a new President who has witnessed first-hand over his career how innovation can help the nation grow and recover.</p>
<p>After four years of Trump’s stubborn denialism, magic thinking and economic harm, Biden will promote policy rigor, public spiritedness and private sector ingenuity to work together for innovative solutions. It will be hard work and I promise you it won’t be pretty, but we should expect the dawn of a new era of U.S. tech-driven dynamism.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This morning, as America itself resets, let's take a moment to understand last year just a little bit better as we get into this new one.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fourth quarter of 2020 was as busy as you imagined, with super late-stage startups reaching new valuation thresholds at a record pace, and total venture capital funding in the United States recording its second-best result of all time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s according to data <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-capital-q4-2020/">released recently</a> by CB Insights, which complements <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">our look back at 2020&#8217;s venture capital year in America</a> from yesterday.</p>
<p>At the time, we noted that American startups raised an average of $428 million each day last year, a sum that helps illustrate how rapid the private markets moved during the odd period.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But a peek at aggregate results for the world&#8217;s largest VC market provides only part of the picture. We need to narrow our lens and peer more deeply into standout categories to understand <em>how</em> the U.S. venture capital market managed to post its biggest year ever in terms of dollars invested, despite seeing deal volume slip for a second consecutive year.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>This morning, we&#8217;re scraping data together to better understand.</p>
<p>First, we want to how unicorns performed in Q4 2020. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/as-2020-ends-new-unicorn-formation-continues-to-impress/">column noted in late December</a> that it felt like unicorn creation was rapid in the quarter; how did that hold up?</p>
<p>And then we&#8217;ll take a look dig into PitchBook data concerning the fintech sector, a huge recipient of venture capital time, attention and money.</p>
<p>Fintech&#8217;s 2020 is a good perspective to view both the year and its wild final quarter. So this morning, as America itself resets, let&#8217;s take a moment to understand last year just a little bit better as we get into this new one.</p>
<h2>Unicorns</h2>
<p>One of the most curious things about the unicorn era is the rising bet it represents. I&#8217;ve <a href="https://mattermark.com/the-ipo-traffic-jam/">written about this before</a> so I will be brief: Nearly every quarter, the number of unicorns — private companies worth $1 billion or more — goes up.</p>
<p>The private market is able to create more unicorns than it has been historically able to exit them.</p>
<p>Some of these companies exit, sometimes in group fashion. But, quarter after quarter, the number of unexited unicorns rises. This means that the <em>bet</em> on expected future liquidity from venture capitalists and other private investors keeps ratcheting higher.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers at<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/lab-grown-plant-tissue-0120"> MIT have developed a new method for growing plant tissues in a lab</a> &#8212; sort of like how companies and researchers are approaching lab-grown meat. The process would be able to produce wood and fibre in a lab environment, and researchers have already demonstrated how it works in concept by growing simple structures using cells harvested from zinnia leaves.</p>
<p>This work is still in its very early stages, but the potential applications of lab-grown plant material are significant, and include possibilities in both agriculture and in construction materials. While traditional agricultural is much less ecologically damaging when compared to animal farming, it can still have a significant impact and cost, and it takes a lot of resources to maintain. Not to mention that even small environmental changes can have a significant effect on crop yield.</p>
<p>Forestry, meanwhile, has much more obvious negative environmental impacts. If the work of these researchers can eventually be used to create a way to produce lab-grown wood for use in construction and fabrication in a way that&#8217;s scalable and efficient, then there&#8217;s tremendous potential in terms of reducing the impact on forestry globally. Eventually, the team even theorizes you could coax the growth of plant-based materials into specific target shapes, so you could also do some of the manufacturing in the lab, by growing a wood table directly for instance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s still a long way to go from what the researchers have achieved. They&#8217;ve only grown materials on a very small scale, and will look to figure out ways to grow plant-based materials with different final properties as one challenge. They&#8217;ll also need to overcome significant barriers when it comes to scaling efficiencies, but they are working on solutions that could address some of these difficulties.</p>
<p>Lab-grown meat is still in its infancy, and lab-grown plant material is even more nascent. But it has tremendous potential, even if it takes a long time to get there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hellofyllo.com">Fyllo</a> has acquired <a href="https://www.dataowl.com">DataOwl</a>, a company offering marketing and loyalty tools for cannabis retailers.</p>
<p>Fyllo said it already works with 320 cannabis retailers across 25 states (plus Puerto Rico and Jamaica). According to Chief Marketing Officer Conrad Lisco, this acquisition allows the company to offer the industry&#8217;s &#8220;first end-to-end marketing solution,&#8221; combining consumer data, digital advertising, regulatory compliance (thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/fyllo-acquires-cannregs/">Fyllo&#8217;s acquisition of CannaRegs</a> last year) and, through DataOwl, CRM and loyalty tied into a business&#8217; point-of-sale system.</p>
<p>As an example, founder and CEO Chad Bronstein (previously the chief revenue officer at digital marketing company Amobee) said that retailers will be able to use the Fyllo platform to send promotional texts to regular customers while, crucially, ensuring those campaigns are fully in compliance with state and local regulations. He added that eventually, the platform could be used beyond cannabis, in other regulated industries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Beauty, gambling, etc. — the same things need to happen in every regulated industry, they would all benefit from loyalty and compliance automation,&#8221; Bronstein said.</p>
<p>In addition, he argued that mainstream brands are increasingly interested in using data around cannabis and CBD consumers, as borne out in <a href="https://go.hellofyllo.com/forrester-opportunity-snapshot-cannabis-cbd-consumer-data">a Forrester study commissioned by Fyllo</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A00AqbQqDG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/fyllo-acquires-cannregs/">Cannabis marketing company Fyllo acquires CannaRegs for $10M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cannabis marketing company Fyllo acquires CannaRegs for $10M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/fyllo-acquires-cannregs/embed/#?secret=A00AqbQqDG" data-secret="A00AqbQqDG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lisco said this acquisition comes at a crucial time for the cannabis industry, with dispensaries classified as <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pot-shops-are-considered-essential-businesses-in-most-states-where-its-legal-but-the-rules-are-shifting-2020-04-08">essential businesses in many states</a>, as well as <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/2020_marijuana_legalization_and_marijuana-related_ballot_measures">continuing momentum behind marijuana legalization</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2020, cannabis came of age,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We would say it went from illicit to essential in 10 months &#8230; 2021 is really about watching endemic [marijuana] brands try to scale, so that they can capitalize on the explosive growth. They&#8217;ve historically been excluded from the kinds of integrated marketing capabilities that other non-endemic [mainstream] brands get to use when they go to market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bronstein said Fyllo aims to bring those capabilities to marijuana brands, first by bringing its compliance capabilities into the DataOwl product. The company also aims to create a national cannabis loyalty platform, allowing a marijuana retailer in one state to easily expand its marketing capabilities into other states in a compliant fashion.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. DataOwl co-founders Dan Hirsch and Vartan Arabyan are joining Fyllo, as is the rest of their team, bringing the company&#8217;s total headcount to 110.</p>
<p>“By integrating with Fyllo, DataOwl’s solutions will reach the widest possible audience via the industry’s most innovative marketing platform,&#8221; Hirsch said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched its seventeenth batch of Starlink satellites during its first mission of 2021, using a Falcon 9 rocket that was flying for the eighth time, and that landed again, recording a record for its reusability program. This puts the total Starlink constellation size at almost 1,000, as the company has expanded its beta access program for the service to the U.K. and Canada, with a first deployment in the latter country serving a rural First Nations community in a remote part of the province of Ontario.</p>
<p>The launch took off from Florida at 8:02 AM EST (5:02 AM PST), with delivery of the satellites following as planned at around an hour after lift-off. The booster on this launch flew seven times previously, as mentioned &#8212; including just in December when it was used to deliver a SiriusXM satellite to orbit to support that company&#8217;s satellite radio network.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s launch was also notable because it included a landing attempt in so-called &#8220;envelope expansion&#8221; conditions, which means that the winds in the landing zone where SpaceX&#8217;s drone recovery ship was stationed at sea actually exceeded the company&#8217;s previously defined safety window for making a landing attempt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result of today&#8217;s success, SpaceX will likely now have higher tolerances for wind speeds in order to attempt recovery, which should translate to fewer cancellations of launches based on weather conditions in the landing zone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lengthy antitrust investigation into PC games geo-blocking in the European Union by distribution platform Valve and five games publishers has led to fines totalling €7.8 million (~$9.4 million) after the Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_170">confirmed today</a> that the bloc&#8217;s rules had been breached.</p>
<p>The geo-blocking practices investigated since before 2017 concerned around 100 PC video games of different genres, including sports, simulation and action games.</p>
<p>In addition to Valve &#8212; which has been fined just over €1.6 million &#8212; the five sanctioned games publishers are: Bandai Namco (fined €340,000), Capcom (€396,000), Focus Home (€2.8 million), Koch Media (€977,000) and ZeniMax (€1.6 million).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission said the fines were reduced by between 10% and 15% owing to cooperation from the companies, with the exception of Valve, which it said chose not to cooperate (a &#8220;prohibition Decision&#8221; rather than a fine reduction was applied in its case).</p>
<p>Valve has been contacted for comment. <strong>Update:</strong> A company spokesman said: &#8220;During the seven year investigation <span class="il">Valve</span> has cooperated fully, providing all requested evidence and information to the Commission. We disagree with these findings, and plan to appeal the decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>An in-depth antitrust investigation was announced publicly by the Commission in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/europe-opens-antitrust-geo-blocking-probe-into-valve-others/">February 2017</a>, with a formal statement of objections issued just over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/eu-goes-after-valve-for-geo-blocking-steam-activation-codes/">two years later</a> &#8212; when it accused the companies of &#8220;entering into bilateral agreements to prevent consumers from purchasing and using PC video games acquired elsewhere than in their country of residence&#8221; in contravention of EU rules.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JvHGT3Bpna"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/eu-goes-after-valve-for-geo-blocking-steam-activation-codes/">EU goes after Valve for &#8216;geo-blocking&#8217; Steam activation codes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU goes after Valve for &#8216;geo-blocking&#8217; Steam activation codes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/eu-goes-after-valve-for-geo-blocking-steam-activation-codes/embed/#?secret=JvHGT3Bpna" data-secret="JvHGT3Bpna" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The mechanisms used by the companies to prevent certain cross-border sales of certain PC games were geo-blocked Steam activation keys and bilateral licensing and distribution agreements to restrict certain cross-border sales.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers has now found that these business practices partitioned certain European markets according to national borders &#8212; denying regional consumers the benefits of the EU&#8217;s Digital Single Market to shop around for the best offer.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up competition policy for the bloc, said: “Today&#8217;s sanctions against the &#8216;geo-blocking&#8217; practices of Valve and five PC video game publishers serve as a reminder that under EU competition law, companies are prohibited from contractually restricting cross-border sales. Such practices deprive European consumers of the benefits of the EU Digital Single Market and of the opportunity to shop around for the most suitable offer in the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Commission&#8217;s investigation, geo-blocking of Steam activation keys prevented activation of certain of the five games&#8217; publishers titles outside of Czechia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>
<p>It said agreements between the companies to geo-block activation keys had lasted between one and five years and were found to have been implemented at various times between September 2010 and October 2015.</p>
<p>While four of the games publishers (not Capcom) were found to have entered into licensing and distribution agreements with various PC games distributors (not Valve) in the European Economic Area (EEA) which contained clauses which restricted cross-border sales of the affected titles within the EEA, including the aforementioned Central and Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>The Commission said these agreements lasted generally longer (&#8220;between three and 11 years&#8221;), and were implemented at different times between March 2007 and November 2018.</p>
<p>Since the investigation started, EU lawmakers have passed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/at-last-an-end-to-geoblocking-in-europe-nope-not-by-a-long-chalk/">regulation against unjustified geo-blocking</a>. Although the legislation only applies to PC video games distributed on CDs or DVDs, not to downloads. So games are only partially covered.</p>
<p>A Commission review of how the geo-blocking regulation is operating, published <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-publishes-its-short-term-review-geo-blocking-regulation">last November</a>, discussed a possible extension of its scope in a range of areas, including for games. However it did not make a strong case for that change. (It also found d<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">emand for cross-border access to games, and software generally, relatively low versus </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">other content services.)</span></p>
<p>But while games distributed via digital downloads look set to remain outside the scope of the EU&#8217;s unjustified geo-blocking regulation, the fines against Valve et al. show that geo-blocking can still be a legal minefield as contractual agreements to restrict cross-border sales run counter to the bloc&#8217;s antitrust rules.</p>
<p>The specific breaches are of <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E101">Article 101</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area which prohibit agreements between companies that prevent, restrict or distort competition within the EU&#8217;s Single Market, per the Commission.</span></p>

<p><em>This report was updated with comment from Valve. We also made a correction after initially stating that the EU&#8217;s investigation had taken four years, starting in 2017. That was the date the Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_201">announced</a> it was launching an in-depth investigation.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab has launched its 18th mission, and the first of 2021, as of 8:26 PM NZT (2:30 AM EST). The &#8220;Another One Leaves The Crust&#8221; mission took off from Rocket Lab&#8217;s Launch Complex 1 on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand, and flew a single communications microsatellite on behalf of client OHB Group, a satellite manufacturer based in Europe with facilities in Germany, Sweden and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab&#8217;s launches often feature payloads from more than one customer on the same Electron launch vehicle, but this dedicated payload launch is an example of how the flexibility of its smaller rocket can serve customers even for single small satellite missions. The rocket successfully delivered its payload as intended shortly following take-off.</p>
<p>While Rocket Lab has been developing and testing a booster stage recovery process to help it re-use part of its launch vehicles on subsequent flights, this particular mission did not include a recovery attempt. The company has had significant success with that development process however, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/rocket-lab-makes-its-first-booster-recovery-after-successful-launch/">recovered its first booster last year</a>. Sometime this year, it&#8217;s expected to attempt a recovery that includes a mid-air catch of the returning first stage via helicopter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hipeople.io/">HiPeople</a>, an HR tech startup based in Berlin that wants to automate the reference checking process, has raised $3 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/mattias-ljungman-leaving-atomico/">Mattias Ljungman’s Moonfire</a>, with participation from Capnamic Ventures and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/cherry-ventures-iii/">Cherry Ventures</a>. It follows a $1.1 million pre-seed in late 2019. Notably, the seed round was closed fully remote, without any in-person meetings. “Just like the hiring processes of HiPeople&#8217;s clients,” founders Jakob Gillmann and Sebastian Schüller told me in an email.</p>
<p>HiPeople says the investment will be used to support growth so that more recruiters can hire remotely using automated reference checks. Longer term, the company is developing a candidate analytics platform to provide rich data and insights on each candidate and enable what it frames as &#8220;data-driven&#8221; hiring.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Abstractly-speaking HiPeople is in the talent insights business,” say Gillmann and Schüller. “Its mission is to enable better hiring by automatically collecting and analyzing talent data, and providing rich insights. HiPeople currently solves this by automating candidate reference checks from request, to collection, and analysis. This allows companies to extend the information they have on a candidate without additional manual work”.</p>
<p>The idea behind the software-as-a-service is that HiPeople’s approach creates a seamless user experience for the recruiter, and “verified, in-depth reference checks they can trust”. As a result, the startup claims that its users on average collect 2x the amount of references on a candidate, in 50% of the time. “Traditionally, reference checks are underutilized due to the highly manual process, and often only exclusively used for executive hiring. HiPeople dusts off reference checks, and enables rich talent insights by rethinking how they are done,” says HiPeople’s founders.</p>
<p>HiPeople’s customers span fast-growing startups to tech scale-ups and more established upper mid-market companies. For example, process mining company Celonis, which doubled its workforce in the last 12 months to 1,200 employees globally, uses HiPeople to improve hiring quality for roles in San Francisco, Munich and Tokyo. “By programmatically conducting reference checks the company hires talent based on verified insights on topics like areas of improvement, skills, teamwork style, or work values,” explains HiPeople.</p>
<p>Adds Moonfire’s Mattias Ljungman: “Workflow automation of repetitive processes, and insights on the candidate that go beyond the limitations of the CV, are a clear pain for anybody in recruiting. The Covid-influenced reality of remote work, hence remote hiring practices, has increased the complexity of finding the right talent. HiPeople created a way to enable anybody who is hiring to make better decisions, whilst improving processes and increasing hiring velocity”.</p>
<p>Gillmann and Schüller tell me that in Europe, HiPeople mainly competes with the existing infrastructure and processes recruiters use to manually conduct references checks. In the U.S., companies like Xref or Crosschq are more direct competitors in terms of automating reference checks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alibaba&#8217;s billionaire founder resurfaced as he spoke to 100 rural teachers through a video call, three months after his last public appearance in October, sending the e-commerce firm&#8217;s shares up more than 8% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A recording of the call was first posted on a <a href="https://tm.zjol.com.cn/interface/getNews?id=271099&amp;doc_type=9">news portal</a> backed by the government of Zhejiang, the eastern province where Alibaba is headquartered, and the video was verified by an Alibaba spokesperson.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/jack-ma-missing/">Speculations swirled around Ma&#8217;s whereabouts</a> after media reported in December that he skipped the taping of a TV program he created. Ma, known for his love for the limelight, has seen his e-commerce empire Alibaba and fintech giant Ant Group increasingly in the crosshairs of the Chinese authorities in recent months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ma last appeared publicly at a conference where he castigated China&#8217;s financial regulatory system in front of a room of high-ranked officials. His controversial remark, according to reports, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">prompted the Chinese regulator to abruptly halt</a> Ant&#8217;s initial public offering, which would have been the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/ant-group-could-raise-as-much-as-34-5b-in-ipo-in-what-would-be-worlds-largest-ipo/">biggest public share sale of all time</a>.</p>
<p>Ant has since been working on corporate restructuring and regulatory compliance under the directions of the government. Alibaba, China&#8217;s largest e-commerce platform, also came under scrutiny as market regulators opened an investigation into its alleged monopolistic practices.</p>
<p>Some argue that the recent clampdown on Jack Ma&#8217;s internet empire signals Beijing&#8217;s growing unease with the country&#8217;s super-rich and private-sector power brokers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Alibaba and its archrival, Tencent, control more personal data and are more intimately involved in everyday life in China than Google, Facebook and other American tech titans are in the United States. And just like their American counterparts, the Chinese giants sometimes bully smaller competitors and kill innovation,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/technology/china-jack-ma-alibaba.html">wrote</a> Li Yuan for the New York Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don’t have to be a member of the Communist Party to see reasons to rein them in.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 50-second clip, Ma is seen talking directly into the camera against what appears to be decorative paintings depicting a water town typical of Zhejiang. An art history book is shown amid a stack of books, alongside a vase of fresh flowers and a ceramic figurine of a stout, reclining man who looks relaxed and content.</p>
<p>Ma addressed the 100 teachers receiving the Jack Ma Rural Teachers Award, which was set up by the Jack Ma Foundation to identify outstanding rural teachers every year. It&#8217;s unclear where Ma was speaking from, but the video briefly shows him visiting a rural boarding school in Zhejiang on January 10. The award ceremony was moved online this year due to the pandemic, Ma told the award recipients.</p>
<p>When Ma announced his retirement plan, he pledged to return to his teaching roots and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/jack-ma-officially-retires-as-alibabas-chairman/">devote more time to education philanthropy</a>, though the founder still holds considerable sway over Alibaba by keeping a seat in the powerful <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/governance_9">Alibaba Partnership</a>. The legendary billionaire began his career as an English teacher in Hangzhou, and on Weibo, China&#8217;s Twitter equivalent, he nicknames himself the &#8220;ambassador for rural teachers.&#8221;</p>

Previous investors Nauta Capital, Encomenda and Bankinter also participated in the round.</p>
<p>We last chatted to Landbot back in 2018 when it raised a $2.2 million seed and had 900+ customers. It&#8217;s grown that to ~2,200 paying customers, with some 50,000 individuals now using its tool (across both free and paid accounts).</p>
<p>Since its seed it&#8217;s also increased recurrent revenues 10x &#8212; and is expecting growth to keep stepping up, fuelled by the new financing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Landbot gets $2.2M for its on-message &#8216;anti-AI&#8217; chatbot&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/19/landbot-gets-2-2m-for-its-on-message-anti-ai-chatbot/embed/#?secret=NeK63HwaSg" data-secret="NeK63HwaSg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It says the coronavirus pandemic has supercharged demand for conversational landing pages as all sorts of businesses look for ways to automate higher volumes of digitally inbound customer comms, without needing to make major investments in in-house IT.</p>
<p>Landbot&#8217;s customers range from SMEs to specific teams and products within larger organisations, with the startup name-checking the likes of Nestlé, MediaMarkt, Coca-Cola, Cepsa, PcComponentes and Prudential among its customer roster.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing strong traction from industries like eCommerce, Financial Services and Marketing Agencies,&#8221; CEO &amp; co-founder Jiaqi Pan tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The ecommerce segment is one we have seen the most growth in since COVID-19, where we increased 2x the number of customers <span aria-invalid="grammar">from ecommerce</span> industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to double Landbot&#8217;s team during 2021 (currently it employs 40 people) &#8212; with hiring planned across sales, marketing and engineering.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched its &#8220;no code&#8221; flavor of chatbot builder back in 2017, previously relocated HQ from Valencia to Barcelona to help with recruitment.</p>
<p>Since Landbot&#8217;s launch, the burgeoning &#8220;no code/low code&#8221; movement has become a fully fledged trend driven by demand for productivity &#8212; and lead-boosting digital services outstripping most businesses&#8217; supply of expert in-house techies able to build stuff.</p>
<p>Hence the rise of service-builder tools that make customizable tech capabilities accessible to non-technical staff.</p>
<p>The pandemic has merely poured more fuel on this fire &#8212; and low-friction tools like Landbot are clearly reaping the rewards.</p>

<p>Interestingly, as well as competing with other conversational chatbot builders, like San Francisco-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/manychat">ManyChat</a>, Landbot says it&#8217;s seeing traction from customers who are seeking to replace web forms with more engaging chat interfaces.</p>
<p>Its drag-and-drop chatbot builder tool supports information workers to design what Landbot bills as &#8220;an immersive web page experience filled with gifs and visual elements to capture the attention of the end-user&#8221; &#8212; so you can understand the appeal for SMEs to be able to replace their boring old static forms with an experience any smartphone user is familiar with from using messaging apps like WhatsApp.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of the main competitor in the no-code space, we have some overlap with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/manychat-series-a/">ManyChat</a> as the most direct competitor for Chatbot. On the other hand, as we have a lot of customers using us to replace their forms we are competing also against form builders like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/">Typeform</a>,&#8221; says Pan, the latter another Barcelona-based startup which similarly bills itself as a platform for &#8220;conversational&#8221; and &#8220;interactive&#8221; data collection.</p>
<p>Landbot notes it recently acquired India-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/morph-ai">Morph.AI</a>, a chat-based marketing automation tool, which it&#8217;s using to help convert social, website and ad traffic into leads &#8212; also with the aim of further expanding into presence in the Asian market.</p>
<p>To date, 90% of its customers are international, with 60% coming from the U.S., U.K. and Germany.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Juan Revuelta, general partner of Swanlaab, said: “The beauty of Landbot is in the drag and drop solution of the product. The simplicity is critical to making this product accessible to everyone across many different types of business. If you’re a small company you don’t have the luxury of time or money to solve issues in customer service or run lavish marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Landbot helps all businesses to have truly frictionless conversations with customers and exchange the data they need to make smarter decisions and scale. The team has had a remarkable 2020, and we’re excited to support them in helping more businesses this year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anthony Levandowski, the former Google engineer and serial entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/anthony-levandowski-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison-as-new-4b-lawsuit-against-uber-is-filed/">who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison</a> on one count of stealing trade secrets, has received a pardon from President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The full pardon, which was one of 73 issued late Tuesday evening, means Levandowski will avoid a prison cell. The president also commuted 70 sentences. Levandowski received his sentence in August 2020. However, Judge Alsup, who presided over the case, said he didn&#8217;t need to report to prison until the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic had passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My family and I are grateful for the opportunity to move forward, and thankful to the President and others who supported and advocated on my behalf,&#8221; Levandowski told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Anthony Levandowski sentenced to 18 months in prison as new $4B lawsuit against Uber is filed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/anthony-levandowski-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison-as-new-4b-lawsuit-against-uber-is-filed/embed/#?secret=IIyaJsUjuf" data-secret="IIyaJsUjuf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Levandowski&#8217;s pardon was supported by technology founders and investors, including Founders Fund&#8217;s co-founder Peter Thiel and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey; trial lawyers Miles Ehrlich and Amy Craig; and businessman and investor Michael Ovitz. Other people connected to Thiel organizations also supported Levandowski, including Trae Stephens, partner at Founders Fund and Blake Masters, who is COO at Thiel Capital and president of The Thiel Foundation.</p>
<p>Here is the full description, which includes people who supported the pardon, that was <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-012021/">posted by the White House</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anthony Levandowski &#8212; President Trump granted a full pardon to Anthony Levandowski. This pardon is strongly supported by James Ramsey, Peter Thiel, Miles Ehrlich, Amy Craig, Michael Ovitz, Palmer Luckey, Ryan Petersen, Ken Goldberg, Mike Jensen, Nate Schimmel, Trae Stephens, Blake Masters, and James Proud, among others. Mr. Levandowski is an American entrepreneur who led Google&#8217;s efforts to create self-driving technology. Mr. Levandowski pled guilty to a single criminal count arising from civil litigation. Notably, his sentencing judge called him a &#8220;brilliant, groundbreaking engineer that our country needs.&#8221; Mr. Levandowski has paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good.</p></blockquote>
<p>Levandowski has been a polarizing figure in the autonomous vehicle industry. He is by all accounts — even among some of his harshest critics — a brilliant engineer. His bravado and risk-taking, combined with a likable, even affable personality, won him followers and rivals.</p>
<p>He has been vilified as a thieving tech bro, unceremoniously ejected from Uber, and forced into bankruptcy by a $179 million award against him. He has also been heralded as a star engineer who was an early pioneer of autonomous vehicles. Levandowski was one of the founding members in 2009 of the Google self-driving project, which was internally called Project Chauffeur. He was rewarded handsomely  — about $127 million by Google — for his work on Project Chauffeur, according to the court documents.</p>
<p>The criminal case that led to Levandowski’s sentencing in August is part of a multi-year legal saga that has entangled Levandowksi, Uber and Waymo, the former Google self-driving project that is now a business under Alphabet.</p>
<p>In 2016, Levandowski left Google and started Otto with three other Google veterans:<a href="https://crunchbase.com/person/lior-ron"> Lior Ron,</a> Claire Delaunay and Don Burnette. Uber acquired Otto less than eight months later. Two months after the acquisition, Google made two arbitration demands against Levandowski and Ron. Uber wasn’t a party to either arbitration. However, under the indemnification agreement between Uber and Levandowski, the company was compelled to defend him.</p>
<p>While the arbitrations played out, Waymo separately filed a lawsuit against Uber in February 2017 for trade secret theft and patent infringement. Waymo alleged in the suit, which went to trial but ended in a settlement in 2018, that Levandowski stole trade secrets, which were then used by Uber.</p>
<p>Under the settlement, Uber agreed to not incorporate Waymo’s confidential information into their hardware and software. Uber also agreed to pay a financial settlement that included 0.34% of Uber equity, per its Series G-1 round $72 billion valuation. That calculated at the time to about $244.8 million in Uber equity.</p>
<p>While Levandowski wasn&#8217;t a defendant in the Waymo v Uber suit, he would soon face a bigger obstacle.</p>
<p>In August 2019, the U.S. District Attorney charged Levandowski alone with 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets while working at Google. Levandowski and the U.S. District Attorney<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/anthony-levandowski-pleads-guilty-to-one-count-of-trade-secrets-theft-under-plea-deal/"> reached a plea deal</a> in March 2020. Under that agreement, Levandowski admitted to downloading thousands of files related to Project Chauffeur. Specifically, he pleaded guilty to count 33 of the indictment, which is related to taking what was known as the Chauffeur Weekly Update, a spreadsheet that contained a variety of details including quarterly goals and weekly metrics as well as summaries of 15 technical challenges faced by the program and notes related to previous challenges that had been overcome.</p>

<p>The U.S. District Attorney’s office had recommended a 27-month sentence. Levandowski had sought a fine, 12 months home confinement and 200 hours of community service. Alsup ultimately determined that home confinement would &#8220;[give] a green light to every future brilliant engineer to steal trade secrets. Prison time is the answer to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, Alsup sentenced Lewandowski to 18 months, but delayed his prison time until the pandemic was under control. Levandowski also agreed to pay $756,499.22 in restitution to Waymo and a fine of $95,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/">Wattpad</a>, the 14-year-old, Toronto-based, venture-backed storytelling platform with reach into a number of verticals, is being acquired by Naver, the South Korean conglomerate, in a $600 million cash-and-stock deal.</p>
<p>Naver plans to incorporate at least part of the business into another of its holdings, the publishing platform <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Webtoon</a>, which Naver launched in 2004, brought to the U.S. in 2014, and that features thousands of comic strips created by its users. It also has a huge audience. According to Naver, Webtoon was averaging more than <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2020&amp;no=927016">67 million monthly users</a> as of last August.</p>
<p>On its face, the deal appears to make sense. According to Korea&#8217;s Pulse News, some of the region&#8217;s webtoons are finding a broader geographic audience and <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2020&amp;no=927016">crossing over into film</a>. (Below is a trailer for one popular series called &#8220;The Secret of Angel.&#8221;)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Similarly, Wattpad, which originally launched as an e-reading app, has evolved into a highly popular platform where users publish their original work and more than 90 million people visit monthly to read them. (Indeed, according to a story published last week in The Verge, Wattpad has published more than a billion stories over the years,  and it claims its users spend a collective <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22215052/wattpad-authors-fanfiction-netflix-hulu-streaming-movies-romcom-teen-drama">22 billion minutes per month</a> reading these.)</p>
<p>Like Webtoon, Wattpad has been more focused on streaming media, given the many platforms now needing fresh content, from Netflix to Apple to farther-flung outfits, like GoJek&#8217;s GoPlay, launched by the Indonesian ride-hailing giant in 2019. (In addition to <a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/2019/1/23/wattpad-launches-wattpad-books-a-new-publishing-division-to-bring-diverse-data-backed-stories-to-book-lovers-everywhere">Wattpad Studios</a>, Wattpad also launched a book <a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/2019/1/23/wattpad-launches-wattpad-books-a-new-publishing-division-to-bring-diverse-data-backed-stories-to-book-lovers-everywhere">publishing division</a> in 2019.)</p>

<p>CEO Jun Koo Kim of Webtoon said in a press release about the new tie-up that it represents a &#8220;big step towards us becoming a leading global multimedia entertainment company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CEO Seong-Sook Han of Naver &#8212; a search engine giant whose properties include the popular Tokyo-based messaging app Line &#8212; said in a separate release that Wattpad co-founders Allen Lau and Ivan Yuen will continue post-acquisition to lead the company they have built.</p>
<p>As for whether the acquisition is a win for Wattpad&#8217;s investors, it appears to be a moderate one. (It&#8217;s hard to discern much without knowing the terms under which each outfit invested.)</p>
<p>Wattpaid had raised $117.8 million from investors in Asia, the United States and Canada over the years and closed its most recent round with $51 million from Tencent Holdings, BDC, Globe Telecom’s Kickstart Ventures, Peterson Group, Canso and Raine Ventures.</p>
<p>That last deal, announced in 2018, assigned the company a post-money valuation of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/"> $398 million according to PitchBook</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve always assumed that if trade shows were to go extinct, it would be a gradual process &#8212; a slow fade into cultural irrelevance, like bookstores and record stores (both things I miss dearly). Technology has, for many intents and purposes, dramatically reduced their relative value to our society.</p>
<p>While it’s undoubtedly true that Spotify and the Kindle Store are lacking in much of the appeal and all of the charm of their real-world counterparts, we’re happy to sacrifice all that and more at the alter of convenience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A rampaging pandemic has effectively given us a year without in-person trade shows. That means, among other things, we’ve had a much more immediate control variable in this question about trade shows. Last year’s CES managed to get in just under the wire. The next major consumer electronics show &#8212; Mobile World Congress &#8212; was eventually canceled after much hand-wringing.</p>

<p>The CTA (the governing body behind CES) appeared to have been planning a scaled-back in-person version of the show this year, following a similar move by the team behind the Berlin-based IFA over the summer. By July, however, it was clear that such a plan was untenable. To put it bluntly, the United States didn’t have its shit together when it comes to keeping this virus in check (I’d be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we just hit 400,000 deaths on the day I’m writing this).</p>
<p>CES 2021 was far from the first tech show to go all virtual over this past year. The size and scope of the event, on the other hand, are relatively unique here. Per the CTA, the 2020 show drew north of 170,000 attendees. The majority of the tech events I’ve attended virtually in the past year have been put on by a single company. CES is obviously a different beast entirely.</p>
<p>The CTA’s (nee CEA) role in the industry certainly afforded it a fair bit of goodwill up front. The show, after all, dates back to the late-60s. It has ebbed and flowed over the years (taking hits from external forces like the 2008 financial crisis), but it has remained a constant. Those of us who’ve been doing this for a while tend to face the show with equal parts anticipation and dread. But the companies always come out.</p>

<p>Per the CTA’s numbers, nearly 2,000 companies launched products at the 2021 event. The figure pales in comparison to the 4,419 companies exhibiting last year, but that’s to be expected. In addition to the uncertain nature of the event, it’s been a remarkably crappy year for plenty of companies. I certainly had my questions and doubts going in &#8212; chief among them was the value of an event like this for a startup? Without an in-person element, wasn’t this just yet another chance to get lost in the noise?</p>
<p>I heard similar feedback from startups on the side, though ultimately nearly 700 chose to exhibit at the show. I know because I ended up going through all of them for the purposes of our coverage. It brought back a kind of visceral memory of the year I challenged myself to walk every square inch of the show, and ended up being challenging for entirely different reasons.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this was the element I missed the most. For me, CES’s biggest appeal has been the element of discovery. Eureka Park, the jam-packed startup portion of the show at the Sands Expo, is easily the best part. The vast majority of exhibitors are not for us, but I still get a charge stumbling on something new and innovative I’ve not seen before. The blogger instinct that lives dormant inside kicks in and I can’t wait to get back in front of my laptop to tell the world.</p>
<p>There was no Eureka Park this year &#8212; not even a virtual version. There’s just no good way to approximate a show floor online &#8212; at least none that I’m aware of. A couple of existing contacts offered to send me stuff in the mail to look out. Sensel, for instance, has a new version of its trackpad (which it announced today will be integrated into Lenovo’s latest ThinkPad). But for obvious reasons, it’s just not possible to get all 700 startups to send review units to my one-bedroom in Queens.</p>
<p>More than anything, the virtual event highlighted the technology limitations of an event at this scale. Press conferences are simple enough (though I found frustration in the various different platforms the CTA employed). More often than not, these felt like lengthy commercials for the exhibiting company. The in-person versions are, as well, of course, but we tend to be blinded by the spectacle. For my own purposes, there just wasn’t a lot that that couldn’t have been accomplished more efficiently with a press release.</p>
<p>The nature of news releases was far more nebulous this year. More companies seemingly took liberties by dumping their news well ahead of the show. Other companies offered their own sort of counter programming. One of the biggest advantages to these events when it comes to my own peace of mind is how they regulate the news flow. I know going into the year that there’s going to be one hair-pullingly difficult week at the beginning of the year where a ton of news is announced.</p>
<p>With CES less of a center of gravity this year, I anticipated seeing a less segmented news flow. I’ve commented to colleagues over the last couple of years that there’s “no more slow season” when it comes to hardware news, and this will likely only increase that sentiment. Obviously there’s upside in having things more evenly spread out, but I’ve got the feeling we’re moving toward something more akin to a series of small CES-like events throughout the year, and the thought makes my blood turn cold.</p>

<p>It’s been clear in recent years that companies would rather break out from the noise of CES in favor of their own events, following in Apple’s footsteps. Virtual events are a perfect opportunity to adopt that approach. Apple, meanwhile, moved from one event to a series of one smaller event every month toward the end of the year. When you’re not asking people to fly across the country or world to attend an event, the bar for what qualifies as news lowers considerably. Perhaps instead of having thousands of companies vying for our attention at one event, we’re moving toward a model in which there are instead thousands of events. The mind boggles.</p>
<p>I have some hyper-specific grievances about the CTA’s format, but I’ll save them for the post-event survey that I may or may not get around to filling out. I still found value in the virtual event. It was an excuse to talk to a bunch of startups I wasn’t familiar with. Ultimately, however, I think the event served as a testament to the fact that as much as we bemoan all of the headaches and head colds that come with an event like CES, there’s still a lot of value to be had in the in-person event.</p>
<p>There’s little doubt that the CTA and the rest of these sorts of organizations are champing at the bit to return to in-person events, even as a bumpy vaccine rollout leaves a big question mark around the expected timeline. There’s a very good chance that we’ll view 2020/2021 as the beginning of the end for the in-person trade show. But given the sorts of limitations we’ve seen in the past year, I’m not ready to declare them fully dead any time soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The decentralized tech community is aiming to find support for technologies that go beyond cryptocurrency support.</p>
<p>In a blog post today the team at Brave <a href="https://brave.com/ipfs-support/">announced</a> that they have worked with Protocol Labs to integrate native support for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) inside their browser. The peer-to-peer file-sharing standard launched in 2015 and has been gathering support among open-source advocates who laud the protocol&#8217;s ability to stop companies and government bodies from taking down content across the web, as well as the more functional performance improvements, offline file-viewing capabilities and underlying reliability.</p>
<p>IPFS shares plenty of similarities with BitTorrent and allows files to be hosted by a multitude of users distributed across networks. With the update, Brave users will be able to access content from web addresses starting with <em>ipfs://</em> and will be able to host an IPFS node themselves. The company says that adding support for IPFS will help improve &#8220;the overall resilience of the Internet.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why The Internet Needs IPFS Before It&#8217;s Too Late&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/04/why-the-internet-needs-ipfs-before-its-too-late/embed/#?secret=I8YcqmtsFz" data-secret="I8YcqmtsFz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Brave is a likely home for the IPFS protocol given the company&#8217;s affinity for all things decentralized. The startup founded by Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich says it now has 24 million monthly active users. Some of Brave&#8217;s most unique features have involved blockchain or peer-to-peer tech. In 2018, Brave announced a beta of Tor Tabs bringing the decentralized Onion protocol into the mix.</p>
<p>Last year, Opera <a href="https://press.opera.com/2020/03/30/opera-introduces-major-updates-to-its-blockchain-browser-on-android/">announced</a> that it was bringing limited support for IPFS to its Android application.</p>
<p>Decentralization tech is finding more mainstream interest as tech companies have slowly warmed up to the opportunities in cryptocurrency. Last week, TechCrunch looked into how Twitter was looking to help build out a decentralized network for social media platforms.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether this is a technology that more mainstream browsers will opt to support natively, given the clear potential for abuse that exists in allowing users to work around file takedowns and the fact that it is a pretty niche technology for the time being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After two days locked up in an Italian prison, American Max Craddock was finally able to make his case to a judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a weapon of war,&#8221; his lawyer <a href="https://www.lanuovasardegna.it/olbia/cronaca/2018/06/26/news/negli-stati-uniti-e-solo-un-gioco-1.17006714">told the investigating magistrate</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a toy they sell to children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craddock had been arrested in the Sardinian port city of Olbia in June 2018 after trying to board a private party bus with a collectible flamethrower from Elon Musk&#8217;s latest startup, <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/">The Boring Company</a>. Craddock had painted his flamethrower black, and written on it the name of a floating music festival in the Bahamas he had attended the previous year while starring in reality TV show <a href="https://www.bravotv.com/unanchored/season-1/ep-1">Unanchored</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alarmed by the sight of what he thought was a gun, the bus driver refused to drive off, and then called the police.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were very chill at first,&#8221; Craddock told TechCrunch in a recent phone interview. &#8220;But as the night went on, it kept getting worse. I spent the first night in jail in Olbia and then they took me to prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Craddock managed to get a lawyer, she told him the judge would probably just let him go with a warning. Instead, the magistrate ordered him back to his cell. That was when Craddock, pictured below, learned possession of a flamethrower in Italy can carry a 10-year prison sentence.</p>

<p>A few months later, author John Richardson was sitting down to work at his home in London when there was a loud knock at the door. He opened it and five police officers barged in wearing tasers and tactical gear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a couple of them also had handguns,&#8221; Richardson told TechCrunch. &#8220;But I&#8217;m slightly hazy on that because my legs went wobbly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police officers sat Richardson down on his sofa and informed him that they had a warrant to search the premises. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;what&#8217;s going on here?&#8217; &#8221; Richardson recalled. &#8220;Then something clicked and I said, &#8216;Is this about the flamethrower?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>The raid was indeed about his flamethrower.</p>
<p>Craddock and Richardson are not the only Boring Company customers to have fallen foul of law enforcement.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 flamethrower purchasers abroad have had their devices confiscated by customs officers or local police, with many facing fines and weapons charges. In the U.S., the flamethrowers have been implicated in at least one local and one federal criminal investigation. There have also been at least three occasions in which the Boring Company devices have been featured in weapons hauls seized from suspected drug dealers.</p>
<p>The upshot: What Musk and his army of fans thought was just another of his money-spinning larks is having real-world consequences for people and countries not in on the joke.</p>
<p>The Boring Company did not respond to detailed questions from TechCrunch for this story.</p>
<h2>The spark of an idea</h2>
<p>Inspired by Los Angeles traffic, Musk launched The Boring Company in December 2016. The startup&#8217;s mission was to solve urban traffic jams by moving cars through tiny tunnels. But re-engineering sewer tunneling technology to build a revolutionary subterranean transportation network doesn&#8217;t come cheap. In an effort to drum up awareness and funds, Musk announced in December 2017 a limited run of novelty flamethrowers designed and branded by The Boring Company.</p>
<p>It was a scheme that had produced results earlier that year. Musk raised $1 million just weeks after launching sales of a $20 Boring Company hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie,&#8221; Musk told Joe Rogan during an <a href="https://sonix.ai/resources/full-transcript-joe-rogan-experience-elon-musk/">infamous podcast</a> in 2018. &#8220;They have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs, and, like, the kids love that one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The device uses a standard propane gas canister and is functionally similar to propane torches for melting ice, killing weeds or applying roofing materials. But with its rifle-style stock, pistol grip and sci-fi styling, the Boring Company&#8217;s flamethrower had a very different aesthetic &#8212; more post-apocalyptic party accessory than everyday yard maintenance.</p>
<p>Musk did his best to hype sales, tweeting to his Twitter followers, which numbered about 22 million at the time: &#8220;Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty &#8216;match&#8217; to ignite!&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1005549006573846528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>He also threw a launch party in Los Angeles, where Craddock was one of the first 1,000 customers to collect a flamethrower, just before his European trip. &#8220;I removed the gas canister, put the flamethrower in my carry-on, and had no trouble on the flights,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s influence and the appeal of the product provided a winning combination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no intention of going around setting fire to stuff,&#8221; said Richardson. &#8220;I just thought it looked pretty cool, and was something I could potentially flip for a lot more money down the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Boring Company would make 20,000 flamethrowers and sell them at $500 each, netting the young company $10 million.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Not&#8217; a Flamethrower</h2>
<p>The 20,000 flamethrowers quickly sold out, with orders flooding in from around the world. As the shipping date neared, however, The Boring Company realized its scorching new product could also be a legal hot potato.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are told that various countries would ban shipping of it, that they would ban flamethrowers,&#8221; Musk told Rogan in 2018. &#8220;So, to solve this problem for all of the customs agencies, we labelled it, <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/not-a-flamethrower">&#8216;Not a Flamethrower.&#8217; &#8220;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Did it work? Was it effective?&#8221; asked Rogan. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I think so. Yes,&#8221; Musk replied.</p>
<p>The correct answer was no.</p>

<p>In London, the flamethrower came to the attention of Operation Viper, a rapid response team dedicated to tackling gun crime. Working with customs officials, Viper tracked Musk&#8217;s flamethrowers en route to the nation&#8217;s capital. &#8220;There has been a debate as to whether these are firearms,&#8221; one of the Viper officers wrote in an email to Richardson. &#8220;Similar flamethrowers have been seized right across London.&#8221; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoringCompany/comments/9jqx36/i_was_arrested_in_the_uk_for_ordering_a/">One Londoner</a> had his laptop and several cellphones confiscated along with the flamethrower.</p>
<p>Flamethrower raids were also happening around the U.K. and across Europe. A YouTube vlogger in Manchester was <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/police-obtain-search-warrant-for-syndicates-home-for-elon-musk-flamethrower-218232/">targeted by police</a> after featuring the Boring Company&#8217;s gadget in one of his videos, while up to <a href="https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/not-a-flamethrower-von-elon-musk-spielzeug-oder-waffenimitat-ld.1507777">1,000 purchasers in Switzerland</a> had devices confiscated and were issued fines. One took his case to court, saying the flamethrower was little different from a school Bunsen burner. He lost.</p>
<h2>Not just a European problem</h2>
<p>Without the immediacy of a Customs check, the backlash to Musk&#8217;s flamethrowers in the United States took longer to arrive. But in June 2019, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate introduced a bill that would criminalize owning and using Musk&#8217;s flamethrower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elon Musk&#8217;s Boring Company released a new flamethrower&#8230; without any concern to the training of the purchasers or their reasons for buying,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s1637">reads S1637</a>. &#8220;This bill establishes that owning and using a flamethrower is a criminal act, unless it is used for agricultural, construction or historical collection purposes. These dangerous devices should not be sold to civilians, and use needs to be restricted to trained professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not every police force believes that new laws are necessary &#8212; finding that existing ones are enough. In June 2020, police in Springfield, Massachusetts <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/06/08/springfield-flamethrower-brandon-mcgee-elon-musk-the-boring-company/">stopped a car</a> for a missing inspection sticker. One of the officers noticed what he thought was a rifle hidden beneath a seat &#8212; actually a Boring Company flamethrower. Its owner, passenger Brandon McGee, was charged with carrying a dangerous weapon and an &#8220;infernal machine&#8221; (a device for endangering life or property using fire).</p>
<p>The same month, FBI agents executing a search warrant against a Pennsylvania man, Brandon Althof Long, stumbled across his Boring Company flamethrower propped against a wall. Long had been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to riot and cause civil disorder, and conspiracy to use fire to commit a felony, during riots in Ohio protesting police brutality.</p>
<p>The agents seized the flamethrower out of concern for their safety, which a U.S. district judge later ruled lawful. &#8220;Other individuals could be located inside the house and the flamethrower could have been used to endanger officers as they retreated from Long&#8217;s home,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>Novel items like flamethrowers are rarely specified in law, says <a href="https://www.law.uw.edu/directory/faculty/calo-ryan">Ryan Calo</a>, a law professor and co-founder of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington. &#8220;Some items &#8211; like guns or spring knives &#8211; are weapons &#8216;per se,&#8217; meaning that they are always weapons. But most statutes have an &#8216;or other deadly weapon&#8217; clause as well, meaning that anything that is capable of causing serious bodily harm, even a rock, can be a weapon in the right circumstances,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The problem is, what circumstances? A flame-spouting weed-killer might not attract the interest of police, whereas a similar device styled like an assault rifle is more likely to be considered threatening. &#8220;And if you use the item during the commission of another crime, this can lead to a distinct offense of using a deadly weapon to commit a felony,&#8221; said Calo.</p>
<p>For all Musk&#8217;s portrayal of the Not a Flamethrower as just an entertaining toy, police forces &#8212; and criminals &#8212; in North America are increasingly treating them as dangerous weapons. In rural Wisconsin, a two-year narcotics investigation led police to arrest two men in July 2020 with a hoard of drugs, cash and weapons. Among the cocaine, pistols and assault rifles prominently displayed in the traditional seizure photo was a Boring Company flamethrower. Similar seizures were displayed by <a href="https://www.thewhig.com/news/local-news/police-seize-rifles-flamethrower-from-houses-in-deseronto-tyendinaga">police in Canada</a> in December and again <a href="https://www.guelphtoday.com/police/flamethrower-drugs-among-items-seized-as-guelph-police-raid-two-homes-3244115">this month</a>.</p>

<p>No company has complete control over what customers do with its products. However, this isn&#8217;t the first time a product connected to Musk has been misused.</p>
<p>Tesla, the electric automaker led by Musk, has been criticized for naming its advanced driver assistant system Autopilot and for calling the $10,000 add-on option Full Self-Driving (FSD), even though the driver must remain engaged at all times and is legally liable. A German court has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/elon-musk-rails-against-german-court-decision-on-tesla-autopilot-terminology/">banned the company</a> from using the terms &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; or &#8220;full potential for autonomous driving&#8221; on its website or in other marketing materials.</p>

<p>Safety advocates have argued that using terms like Autopilot and FSD misrepresents the capabilities of the system. The name, along with the lack of an in-cabin camera that monitors the driver, has led owners to push well beyond the bounds of the system.</p>
<p>Videos showing Tesla owners misusing Autopilot and FSD abound on YouTube. Some have had run-ins with law enforcement. One Canadian man was charged for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54197344">sleeping in his Tesla</a> as it drove down the highway.</p>
<h2>Eternal flame</h2>

<p>John Richardson eventually got his Not a Flamethrower back from the Metropolitan police. He now intends to keep it out of the public eye, at least until it&#8217;s worth selling. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy to sit on it for however long,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And if there is a zombie apocalypse, at least I&#8217;ve got one.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, Craddock remains the only person that TechCrunch can identify as having been incarcerated solely for possessing a Not a Flamethrower. &#8220;It was a hair-raising experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m in the middle of nowhere in Sardinia, on 24-hour lockdown with an older guy giving off Mafia vibes.&#8221;</p>
<p>After nearly a week in prison, Craddock was abruptly handed his belongings (flamethrower aside) and set free. &#8220;My lawyer asked the judge, &#8216;Do you really want to be the guy on international news keeping an American in jail over this toy?&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that was the key to getting me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craddock took the first plane home. He says he now regrets taking the flamethrower abroad, and carrying it in public: &#8220;I would have preferred not to have spent that week in an Italian prison, but now I&#8217;ve got a hell of a story.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also has another flamethrower.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I got back, I built myself a new one,&#8221; said Craddock. &#8220;You can follow YouTube videos with links to all the things you need. It&#8217;s pretty simple.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.podchaser.com/">Podchaser</a>, a startup building what it calls &#8220;IMDB for podcasts,&#8221; recently announced that it has raised $4 million in a funding round led by Greycroft.</p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s a site where — similar to <a href="https://www.imdb.com">the Amazon-owned Internet Movie Database</a> — users can look up who&#8217;s appeared in which podcasts, rate and review those podcasts and add them to lists. In fact, CEO Bradley Davis told me that the startup&#8217;s &#8220;vibrant, exciting community of podcast nerds&#8221; have already created 8.5 million podcast credits in the database.</p>
<p>Davis said this is something he simply wanted to exist and was, in fact, convinced that it had to exist already. When he realized that it didn&#8217;t, he posted on Reddit asking whether anyone was willing to build the company with him — which is how he connected with his eventual co-founder and CTO Ben Slinger in Australia. (Podchaser is a fully distributed company, with Davis currently based in Oklahoma City.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, Davis doesn&#8217;t think podcast nerds are the only ones taking advantage of the listings. Instead, he suggested that it&#8217;s useful for anyone looking to learn more about podcasts and discover new ones, with Podchaser&#8217;s monthly active users quintupling over the past year.</p>
<p>For example, he said that one of the most popular pages is politician <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/creators/pete-buttigieg-107ZztJDdR">Pete Buttigieg&#8217;s profile</a>, where visitors don&#8217;t just learn about Buttigieg&#8217;s own podcast but see others on which he&#8217;s appeared. (You can also use Podchaser to learn more about TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/equity-508514">Equity</a>, <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/techcrunch-mixtape-592290">Mixtape</a> and <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/original-content-547492">Original Content</a> podcasts, though those profiles could stand to be filled out a bit more.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uhZrdLVRDq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/chartable-seed-funding/">Podcast analytics and attribution startup Chartable raises $2.25M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Podcast analytics and attribution startup Chartable raises $2.25M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/chartable-seed-funding/embed/#?secret=uhZrdLVRDq" data-secret="uhZrdLVRDq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There has been endless discussion about how to fix podcast discovery, and while Davis isn&#8217;t claiming that Podchaser will solve it wholesale, he thinks it can be part of the solution — not just through its own database, but through the broader <a href="https://podcasttaxonomy.com">Podcast Taxonomy</a> project that it&#8217;s organizing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if we are successful at standardizing a lot of the terminology, and if we do an analysis of all podcasts, of how popular they are, that [will help many listeners] to cull and find the good stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Podchaser plans to add new features that will further encourage user contributions, like a gamification system and a discussion system.</p>
<p>While the consumer site is free, the startup recently launched a paid product called <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/pro">Podchaser Pro</a>, which provides reach and demographic data across 1.8 million podcasts. It also monetizes by providing podcast players with access to its credits through an API.</p>
<p>Davis said the startup was &#8220;lucky&#8221; that it decided to build a database that&#8217;s &#8220;agnostic&#8221; from any specific podcast player.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we had a lot of latitude to work with those platforms, we integrate with many of those platforms and you’re going to see a lot of our credits showing up [in podcast players],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Greycroft, Advancit Capital, LightShed Ventures, Powerhouse Capital, High Alpha, Hyde Park Venture Partners and Poplar Ventures also participated in the round, as did TrendKite founder A.J. Bruno, Ad Results Media CEO Marshall Williams and Shamrock Capital Partner Mike LaSalle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even in the face of a pandemic, the podcast market continues to grow at a breakneck pace,&#8221; said Greycroft co-founder and chairman Alan Patricof in a statement. &#8220;The demand from consumers and brands is insatiable. Podchaser’s data and discovery tools are crucial to taking podcasting to new heights.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.adthena.com">Adthena</a> is expanding its partnership with market research company Kantar by acquiring Kantar&#8217;s paid search business.</p>
<p>The two companies <a href="https://www.research-live.com/article/news/kantar_and_adthena_launch_search_intelligence_partnership/id/5078462">announced an agreement earlier this month</a>, through which Adthena data will be integrated into Kantar&#8217;s ad intelligence product. Now, through this new acquisition, Adthena said Kantar search clients will get access to the Adthena product suite.</p>
<p>Kantar moved into the paid search business in 2012 by <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121221005332/en/Kantar-Media-Acquires-AdGooroo">acquiring AdGooroo</a> (not surprisingly, it eventually rebranded the offering).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As search continues to become the barometer by which all advertising efforts are measured, the importance of having access to the best intelligence possible cannot be overstated,” said Adthena CEO Ian O’Rourke in a statement. “And this acquisition of Kantar’s paid search assets, in combination with our Kantar partnership, will enable us to break new ground for brands and agencies while also helping us to continue upon our growth trajectory.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/adthena-united-states/">O&#8217;Rourke previously told me</a> that Adthena stands out thanks to its &#8220;whole market view,&#8221; using artificial intelligence to create visualizations of all the keywords in paid and organic search used to find a business and their competitors.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but Adthena confirmed that some Kantar team members will be joining the company.</p>
