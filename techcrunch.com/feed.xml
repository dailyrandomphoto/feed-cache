										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you watch funding announcements as we do, you may have noticed something this year. There are a lot of mega-rounds coming together, and Tiger Global is involved in a notable number of them, often as the round&#8217;s co-lead.</p>
<p>Just this week alone, half a dozen companies have announced rounds that the New York-based investing giant has led, co-led, or written follow-on checks into, including HighRadius, a company whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/highradius-raises-300m-triples-valuation-to-3-1b-for-ai-powered-fintech-software/">$300 million Series C</a> round it co-led with D1 Capital; Cityblock Health, whose <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2021/03/29/cityblock-health-gets-192-million-funding-boost-to-turbocharge-care-for-low-income-patients/?sh=77e51e11436a">$192 million in extended Series C</a> funding Tiger Global led; and 6sense, which received a follow-on check from Tiger Global as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/6sense-raises-125m-at-a-2-1b-valuation-for-its-id-graph-an-ai-based-predictive-sales-and-marketing-platform/">$125 million Series D</a> round. The firm is also reportedly reportedly in talks to co-lead a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7e45b9a6-1f94-4229-b985-09958503b410">$300 million round</a> in a five-year-old, AI chipmaker called Groq.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering where all that money is coming from, wonder no longer. Though Tiger Global sent a letter to its investors back in January, saying was raising $3.75 billion for its thirteenth venture fund (titled XIV, apparently for superstitious reasons), a new <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1854273/000185427321000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> shows that new fund just closed with almost twice that amount: $6.65 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of billions, even in this market, and especially for Tiger Global, which closed its 12th fund with $3.75 billion in capital commitments only last year.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the firm to learn more, but as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tiger-global-is-raising-a-new-3-75-billion-venture-fund-one-year-after-closing-its-last/">we noted back in January</a>, when we caught wind of its fundraising plans, Tiger Global seemingly had a strong case to present potential limited partners.</p>
<p>Among its most recent reasons to celebrate, portfolio company Stripe is now valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/">$95 billion</a>, following closing a $600 million round earlier this month. Tiger Global also owned 10% of the gaming company Roblox ahead of direct listing that it staged earlier this month to become a publicly traded outfit. The company&#8217;s market cap is currently <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/roblox-ipo-trading-begins-online-gaming-value-29-billion-rblx/">$38 billion</a>.</p>
<p>In 2020, numerous of its portfolio companies also either went public or were acquired, including Yatsen Holding, the nearly five-year-old parent company of China-based cosmetics giant Perfect Diary; the cloud-based data warehousing outfit Snowflake; and Root insurance, a nearly six-year-old, Columbus, Ohio-based insurance company.</p>
<p>As for M&amp;A, Tiger Global saw at least three of its companies swallowed by bigger tech companies last year, including Postmates’s all-stock sale to Uber for $2.65 billion; Credit Karma’s $7 billion sale in cash and stock to Intuit; and the sale of Kustomer, which focused on customer service platforms and chatbots, for $1 billion to Facebook.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, whose roots are in hedge fund management, launched its private equity business in 2003, spearheaded by Chase Coleman, who’d previously worked for hedge-fund pioneer Julian Robertson at Tiger Management; and Scott Shleifer, who joined the firm in 2002 after spending three years with the Blackstone Group. Lee Fixel, who would become a key contributor in the business, joined in 2006.</p>
<p>Shleifer focused on China, Fixel focused on India and the rest of the firm’s support team (it now has 22 investing professionals on staff) helped find deals in Brazil and Russia before beginning to focus more aggressively on opportunities in the U.S.</p>
<p>Every investing decision was eventually made by each of the three. Fixel left in 2019 to launch his own investment firm, Addition. Now Shleifer and Coleman are the firm’s sole decision-makers.</p>
<p>Tiger Global’s investors include a mix of sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments, pensions and its own employees, who are collectively believed to be the firm’s biggest investors at this point.</p>
<p>Some of Tiger Global’s biggest wins to date have included a $200 million bet on the e-commerce giant JD.com that produced a $5 billion for the firm. According to the WSJ, it also cleared more than $1 billion on the Chinese online-services platform Meituan, which went public in 2018.</p>
<p>The firm also reaped a massive windfall through its investment in the connected fitness company Peloton, 20% of which the firm owned at the time of Peloton’s 2019 IPO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first season of &#8220;The Mandalorian&#8221; last year wasn&#8217;t just a great show, it was the result of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/how-the-mandalorian-and-ilm-invisibly-reinvented-film-and-tv-production/">an entirely new paradigm in film and TV production</a>. Stagecraft, the enormous LED-wall volume ILM used to shoot that season has since been expanded and updated to be better, faster and easier to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-gX4N5rDYeQ">In a behind-the-scenes video</a>, directors and others from the production weigh in on how the system makes everything easier, and enumerate the improvements for the 2.0 version.</p>
<p>The most recognizable piece of Stagecraft is &#8220;the volume,&#8221; an enormous space inside a two stories and a roof of high-resolution LED-based displays. With physical sets placed in the center, the feeling of being in a larger space is real — and if you shoot it right, you can&#8217;t tell a virtual background from a real one.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jFfRO7fMyv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/how-the-mandalorian-and-ilm-invisibly-reinvented-film-and-tv-production/">How &#8216;The Mandalorian&#8217; and ILM invisibly reinvented film and TV production</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How &#8216;The Mandalorian&#8217; and ILM invisibly reinvented film and TV production&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/how-the-mandalorian-and-ilm-invisibly-reinvented-film-and-tv-production/embed/#?secret=jFfRO7fMyv" data-secret="jFfRO7fMyv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Fundamentally this is huge, allowing &#8220;on location&#8221; shoots to combine with intricate sets (and regardless of weather or travel schedules), but far more gracefully than the soundstages or portable green screens that actors have stood in front of for decades. Not only that but it pulls together many disparate parts of the production process into one shared process.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wonderful about this system is now everyone is on the same page,&#8221; said Robert Rodriguez, who directed several episodes of the show (as well as numerous films), in the ILM video. &#8220;It inspires the actors, it inspires the filmmaker to now see what they&#8217;re shooting. You know, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re painting with the lights on finally.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while it would be difficult to call Stagecraft anything but a rousing success, it&#8217;s still very much a work in progress. As an end-to-end system it must integrate with dozens of renderers, color suites, cameras, pre- and post-production software, and of course the LED walls themselves, which are always improving.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133310" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stagecraft-producers.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133310" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2133310" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stagecraft-producers.jpg" alt="Producers look at a bank of screens with images from the set of The Mandalorian on them." width="1024" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stagecraft-producers.jpg 1570w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stagecraft-producers.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stagecraft-producers.jpg?resize=300,126 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stagecraft-producers.jpg?resize=768,323 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stagecraft-producers.jpg?resize=680,286 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stagecraft-producers.jpg?resize=1536,646 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stagecraft-producers.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2133310" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ILM</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;By the second season, ILM developed some software that was specific to this technology and to what the hardware was capable of,&#8221; said Jon Favreau, executive producer of the show and indefatigable patron of new technology in cinema.</p>
<p>There were lots of specific requests from various members of the team, plus the usual bug squashing and performance improvements, leading to an improved workflow. Plus the volume itself has gotten bigger and better.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also has forced us into having a more efficient workflow that draws pre-production, post-production, production, all into one continuous pipeline,&#8221; Favreau said. Not only is it more natural and better looking than ordinary location or green screen techniques, it&#8217;s faster — they&#8217;re working through 30%-50% more script pages per day, which any producer will tell you is unbelievable.</p>
<p>I plan to dig deeper into the technical improvements and pipelines that ILM, Disney, Unreal and other companies have put together to make this all possible. In the meantime you can watch the behind the scenes video below:</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When you think of the core members of the C-suite, you probably think of the usual characters: CEO, CFO, COO and maybe a CMO. Each of these roles is fairly well defined: The CEO controls strategy and ultimately answers to the board; the CFO manages budgets; the CMO gets people to buy more, more often; the COO keeps everything running smoothly. Regardless of the role, all share the same objective: maximize shareholder value.</p>
<p>But the information age is shaking up the C-suite’s composition. The cyber market is exploding in an attempt to secure the modern enterprise: <a href="https://ventureinside.com/how-the-shared-responsibility-model-complicates-cloud-security-cb8a7b307195">multicloud environments</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/">data generated and stored faster than anyone can keep up with</a> and <a href="https://ventureinside.com/securing-the-everything-as-a-service-world-eaf5c327c004">SaaS applications powering virtually every function across the org</a>, in addition to new types of security postures that coincide with that trend. Whatever the driver, though, this all adds up to the fact that cyber strategy and company strategy are inextricably linked. Consequently, chief information security officers (CISOs) in the C-Suite will be just as common and influential as CFOs in maximizing shareholder value.</p>

			As investors seek outsized returns, they need to be more engaged with the CISO beyond the traditional security topics.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the early ’90s. A bank heist. A hacker. St. Petersburg and New York City. Offshore bank accounts. Though it sounds like the synopsis of the latest psychological thriller, this is the context for the appointment of the first CISO in 1994.</p>
<p>A hacker in Russia stole $10 million from Citi clients’ accounts by typing away at a keyboard in a dimly lit apartment across the Atlantic. <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/backstory-of-the-worlds-first-chief-information-security-officer/">Steve Katz</a>, a security executive, was poached from JP Morgan to join Citi as part of the C-suite to respond to the crisis. His title? CISO.</p>
<p>After he joined, he was told two critical things: First, he would have a blank check to set up a security program to prevent this from happening again, and second, Citi would publicize the hack one month after he started. Katz flew over 200,000 miles during the next few months, visiting corporate treasurers and heads of finance to reassure them their funds were secure. While the impetus for the first CISO was a literal bank heist, the $10 million stolen pales in comparison to what CISOs are responsible for protecting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As hot as the blockchain space appears to be these days, it&#8217;s still far from simple to get a decentralized application reliably up and running. The NFT boom and rising cryptocurrency prices have brought more attention to applications running on the blockchain, but the dominant cloud service platforms aren&#8217;t quite ready to make a full-commit to the needs of these budding developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quiknode.io/">QuikNode</a>, which recently raised funding from Y Combinator and is in the process of wrapping its seed funding, has been building out a Web3 cloud platform for blockchain developers that can help them create and scale applications. The startup seems to be further along than most of its fellow YC batch mates, founded back in 2017.</p>
<p>At the moment, running a decentralized app can involve a lot of base infrastructure headaches that take developer attention away from their actual products. The initial setup can require days worth of downloads to sync to these networks for the first time while maintenance costs can also be high, the startup says. QuikNode allows app developers to rent access to nodes that let them operate on the blockchain network of their choice, enabling them to sidestep maintaining and monitoring their own node.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside node management and maintenance, QuikNode&#8217;s product integrates developer tools and analytics to simplify running a decentralized app. The challenge for QuikNode will likely be maintaining an edge here in the shadow of cloud giants if the decentralized app market grows to a sizable (and consistent) presence on the web. QuikNode is itself a customer of these large cloud companies, opting to focus on software rather than building up physical data centers, nevertheless they&#8217;re still directly competing with these big players.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I think we have about two years on Amazon, we’re on their radar,&#8221; CEO <span class="qu" tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" translate="no"><span class="gD" data-hovercard-id="dima@quiknode.io" data-hovercard-owner-id="129">Dmitry Shklovsky tells TechCrunch.</span></span></p>
<p>For the time being, QuikNode&#8217;s small size gives it a distinct pricing advantage compared to nascent programs from other cloud providers. Plans start at just $9 for users launching the most basic applications, with structured plans increasing depending on the amount of &#8220;method calls&#8221; being performed. Renting a dedicated node is $300 per month. From there, the startup offers several chain-specific add-ons with options like Archive mode that give applications access to all historical value states inside smart contracts on the network or Trace mode, which lets developers request nodes to reexecute transactions.</p>
<p>The team currently operates over 1,000 nodes and has around 400 customers. As QuikNode aims to scale their customer base, <span class="qu" tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" translate="no"><span class="gD" data-hovercard-id="dima@quiknode.io" data-hovercard-owner-id="129">Shklovsky says that one of the best paths to customer acquisition have been guides educating decentralized app developers on how to connect to the most popular networks. </span></span></p>
<p>Currently, the largely Miami-based team supports networks on six chains including Ethereum, Bitcoin, xDai, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Optimism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. consumers spent an average of $138 on iPhone apps last year, an increase of 38% year over year, largely driven by the pandemic impacts, according to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/revenue-per-iphone-2020">new data</a> from app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Throughout 2020, consumers turned to iPhone apps for work, school, entertainment, shopping and more, driving per-user spending to a new record and the greatest annual growth since 2016, when it had then popped by 42% year over year.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower tells TechCrunch it expects the trend of increased consumer spend to continue in 2021, when it projects consumer spend per active iPhone in the U.S. to reach an average of $180. This will again be tied, at least in part, to the lift caused by the pandemic &#8212; and, particularly, the lift in pandemic-fueled spending on mobile games.</p>

<p>Last year&#8217;s increased spending on iPhone apps in the U.S. mirrored global trends, which saw consumers spend a <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2020">record $111 billion</a> on both iOS and Android apps, per Sensor Tower, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">and $143 billion,</a> per App Annie, whose analysis had also included some third-party Android app stores in China.</p>
<p>In terms of where U.S. iPhone consumer spending was focused in 2020, the largest category was, of course, gaming.</p>
<p>In the U.S., per-device spending on mobile games grew 43% year over year from $53.80 in 2019 to $76.80 in 2020. That&#8217;s more than 20 points higher than the 22% growth seen between 2018 and 2019, when in-game spending grew from $44 to $53.80.</p>
<p>U.S. users spent the most money on puzzle games, like Candy Crush Saga and Gardenscapes, which may have helped to take people&#8217;s minds off the pandemic and its related stresses. That category averaged $15.50 per active iPhone, followed by casino games, which averaged $13.10, and was driven by physical casinos closures. Strategy games also saw a <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/us-mobile-strategy-2-point-8-billion-revenue">surge</a> in spending in 2020, growing to an average of $12.30 per iPhone user spending.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133247" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133247" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2133247" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/us-iphone-category-revenue-per-device-2020.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="475" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/us-iphone-category-revenue-per-device-2020.png 1522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/us-iphone-category-revenue-per-device-2020.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/us-iphone-category-revenue-per-device-2020.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/us-iphone-category-revenue-per-device-2020.png?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/us-iphone-category-revenue-per-device-2020.png?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/us-iphone-category-revenue-per-device-2020.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133247" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Another big category for in-app spending was Entertainment. With theaters and concerts shut down, consumers turned to streaming apps in larger numbers. Disney+ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/disneys-officially-launches-its-streaming-crown-jewel-disney/">launched in late 2019</a>, just months ahead of the pandemic lockdowns and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/hbo-max-launches-today-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">HBO Max soon followed</a> in May 2020.</p>
<p>Average per-device spending in this category was second-highest, at $10.20, up 26% from the $8.10 spent in 2019. For comparison, per-device spending had only grown by 1% between 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>Other categories in the top five by per-device spending included Photo &amp; Video (up 56% to $9.80), Social Networking (up 41% to $7.90) and Lifestyle (up 14% to $6.50).</p>
<p>These increases were tied to apps like TikTok, YouTube, and Twitch. Twitch saw 680% year-over-year revenue growth in 2020 on U.S. iPhones, specifically. TikTok, meanwhile, saw 140% growth. In the Lifestyle category, dating apps were driving growth as consumers looked to connect with others virtually during lockdowns, while bars and clubs were closed.</p>
<p>Overall, what made 2020 unique was not necessarily what apps people where using, but how often they were being used and how much was being spent.</p>
<p>App Annie had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">earlier pointed out</a> that the pandemic accelerated mobile adoption by two to three years&#8217; time. And Sensor Tower today tells us that the industry didn&#8217;t see the same sort of &#8220;seasonality&#8221; around spending in certain types of apps, and particularly games, last year &#8212; even though, pre-pandemic, there are typically slower parts of the year for spending. That was not the case in 2020, when any time was a good time to spend on apps.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a persistent fallacy swirling around that any startup growing pain or scaling problem can be solved with business development. That’s frankly not true.</p>
<p>Business development is rarely, if ever, <em>the</em> solution to succeeding in a crowded industry, differentiating an offering or delivering a truly exceptional customer experience. But standing up an effective BD operation that brings in sustainable revenue and helps validate product-market fit can be the difference between survival and failure for a startup.</p>

		<blockquote>
			Business development is rarely, if ever, the solution to succeeding in a crowded industry, differentiating an offering or delivering a truly exceptional customer experience.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I’ve had the opportunity to lead business development functions at three companies experiencing three very different stages of growth: <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/27/visa-announces-acquisition-of-trialpay-to-expand-its-offers-platform/">TrialPay</a>.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>, I served as vice president of business development and corporate development for seven years. The business development team I was brought in to lead was a core business unit with accountability to the COO, CEO and board. During my tenure, I was involved in securing around 200 partnerships with companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Samsung, as well as with scores of organizations ranging from early-stage startups to corporate giants.</p>
<p>Yelp was on its way to becoming a go-to source of information and customer value before I arrived. But partnerships like the one I secured with Apple made Yelp into a global market leader.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a>, I took on business development as central to my role as a company founder. While it may seem like an early phase to go all-in on BD, the partnerships with music and media companies that I orchestrated in the earliest days were essential to the company’s very survival. Stitcher is an example of a company where early BD investment made sense because of the dual importance of brand name involvement in concept validation and rising above podcast market congestion.</p>
<p>At TrialPay, an e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/27/visa-announces-acquisition-of-trialpay-to-expand-its-offers-platform/">acquired</a> by Visa in 2015, there was already an established founding team and business model to involve customers in the marketing and payment of offerings by the time I showed up. In fact, I was brought in to run business development because the company was approaching an inflection point: There was pressure internally from investors and externally from customers to expand TrialPay’s network of merchants in order to diversify commercial offerings more rapidly.</p>
<p>The need for business development was directly tied to consumer demand and the company’s own position between growth funding rounds.</p>
<h2>When to go all-in on BD — and when to avoid it</h2>
<p>There are certain market conditions that make it smart for companies to invest in BD as a growth engine and others that signal it’s best to place money, talent and time elsewhere.</p>
<p>You should invest in business development early when your startup’s early success depends on it. For example, at Stitcher, we wanted — and perhaps needed — early buy-in from large media companies who created the podcast content we were going to feature. We didn’t want to get in the same murky legal territory early music startups had gotten into, like Napster.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>This is your chance to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">put your city on the Techcrunch Map</a>!</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-great-techcrunch-survey-of-europes-vcs-be-featured-in-our-survey/">huge survey of investors</a> (see also below) we’ve done over the last six or more months, largely in capital cities.</p>
<p>These formed part of a broader series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys">surveys we’re doing regularly for ExtraCrunch</a>, our subscription service that unpacks key issues for startups and investors.</p>
<p>In the first wave of surveys (as you can see below) the cities we wrote about were largely capitals.</p>
<p>This time, we will be surveying founders and investors in Europe’s other cities to capture how European hubs are growing, from the perspective of the people on the ground.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how your city’s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and generally how your city will evolve.</p>
<p>We leave submissions mostly unedited, and generally looking for at least one or two paragraphs in answers to the questions.</p>
<p><strong>So if you are tech startup founder or investor in one of these cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out our survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Austria</strong>: Graz, Linz<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.soda.io">Soda</a>, a data monitoring platform that is going to help you discover issues with your data processing setup. This way, you can react as quickly as possible and make sure that you keep the full data picture.</p>
<p>If you’re building a digital-first company, you and your customers are likely generating a ton of data. And you may even be leveraging that data to adjust your product itself — think about hotel pricing, finding the right restaurant on a food delivery website, applying for a loan with a fintech company, etc. Those are data-heavy products.</p>
<p>“Companies build a data platform — as they call it — in one of the big three clouds [Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure]. They land their data in there and they make it available for analytics and more,” Soda co-founder and CEO Maarten Masschelein told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can then tap into those data lakes or data warehouses to display analytics, visualize your data, monitor your services, etc. But what happens if there’s an issue in your data workflows?</p>
<p>It might take you a while to realize that there’s some missing data, or that you’re miscounting some stuff. For instance, Facebook miscalculated average video view times <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/facebook-miscalculation-significantly-inflated-average-video-view-times-for-years/">for several years</a>. When you spot that issue, an important part of your business might be affected.</p>
<p>Soda wants to catch data issues as quickly as possible by monitoring your data automatically and at scale. “We sit further upstream, closer to the source of data,” Masschelein said.</p>
<p>When you set up Soda with your data platform, you instantly get some alerts. Soda tells you if there’s something off. For example, if your application generated only 6,000 records today while you usually generate 24,000 records in 24 hours, chances are there’s something wrong. Or if you usually get a new entry every minute and there hasn’t been an entry in 15 minutes, your data might not be fresh.</p>
<p>“But that only covers a small part of what is considered data issues. There’s more logic that you want to test and validate,” Masschelein said.</p>
<p>Soda lets you create rules to test and validate your data. Basically, think about test suite in software development. When you build a new version of your app, your code needs to pass several tests to make sure that nothing critical is going to break with the new version.</p>
<p>With Soda, you can check data immediately and get the result. If the test doesn’t pass, you can programmatically react — for instance, you can stop a process and quarantine data.</p>
<p>Today, the startup is also launching Soda Cloud. It’s a collaboration web application that gives you visibility in your data flows across the organization. This way, nontechnical people can easily browse metadata to see whether everything seems to be flowing correctly.</p>
<p>Basically, Soda customers use Soda SQL, a command-line tool that helps someone scan data, along with Soda Cloud, a web application to view Soda SQL results.</p>
<p>Beyond those products, Soda’s vision is that data is becoming an entire category in software products. Development teams now have a ton of dev tools available to automate testing, integration, deployment, versioning, etc. But there’s a lot of potential for tools specifically designed for data teams.</p>
<p>Soda has recently raised a $13.5 million Series A round (€11.5 million) led by Singular, a new Paris-based VC fund that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/singular-is-a-new-paris-based-vc-firm-with-265-million/">I covered earlier this week</a>. Soda’s seed investors Point Nine Capital, Hummingbird Ventures, DCF and various business angels also participated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For obvious reasons, food delivery was among the categories that soared during a year of COVID-19 related lockdowns. The question remains how these changes will impact both grocery and restaurant delivery long term, but at the very least, it seems certain that the categories have hit an inflection point.</p>
<p>This could also be the moment that delivery robotics finally come into their own, as more services look beyond human messengers to plan for future pandemics and other potential issues.</p>
<p>It’s a moment <strong>Starship Technologies</strong> has been planning for since 2014. With around $100 million of funding under its belt, the company has already been testing its delivery robots in a number of different real-world markets. In January, it added another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/starship-technologies-raises-17m-to-roll-out-more-delivery-bots/">$17 million in funding</a> to continue impressive growth that includes a five-fold increase in its fleet size since the beginning of the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s co-founder and CEO/CTO Ahti Heinla will join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=starships&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=starships&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> to discuss Starship’s role in the push for last-mile robotic delivery. It’s been a long road for the startup, and there’s still a ways to go, in dealing with everything from technology to regulatory red tape. We’ll discuss these challenges and whether the on-going pandemic will be the push these technologies need to become a more mainstream reality.</p>
<p>By late summer 2021, Starship Technologies plans to expand to 100 universities — leaping from the 15 campuses it operated from at the beginning of this year. Not only that, but Starship Technology is growing in just about every meaningful way for startups, including delivery locations, number of deliveries, fleet size and workforce, which now is about 400 strong.</p>
<p>We can’t wait to hear from Ahti and more mobility-industry leaders at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=investorpanel01&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=post02_investorpanel&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> on June 9. Make sure to grab your Early Bird pass before May 6 to save 35% on tickets and join the fun!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Exchange doubts many folks expected the IPO climate to get so chilly without warning. But we could be in for a quarter's pause. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">The Exchange just yesterday discussed</a> a downward revision in the impending Compass IPO and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">disappointing Deliveroo flotation</a> as signals that market demand for high-growth, unprofitable tech shares could be slipping. Recent news underscores the possibly chilling conditions. This morning, Kaltura, a technology company that provides video streaming software and services, delayed its IPO. <a href="https://www.jioforme.com/kalturas-nasdaq-ipo-has-been-postponed-due-to-low-demand/302064/">JioForMe reports</a> that the postponement comes after Kaltura&#8217;s &#8220;valuation demand was lower than expected.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>TechCrunch noted yesterday that Kaltura had not released a second, higher IPO price range. The fact stood out given how hot the public markets had proven in recent months for new tech offerings. Kaltura&#8217;s S-1 filing detailed accelerating revenue growth, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/kaltura-files-to-go-public-on-the-back-of-accelerating-revenue-growth-rising-losses/">at the time we thought</a> would be more than enough to fetch the company an attractive initial public valuation.</p>
<p>It appears that Kaltura was also surprised that it was not trending toward a higher IPO price.</p>

In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intermedia-delays-initial-public-offering-301260126.html">release</a>, CEO Michael Gold said the decision is due &#8220;to challenging current conditions in the market for initial public offerings, especially for technology companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Challenging current conditions? For IPOs? For <em>tech</em> IPOs? That&#8217;s new.</p>
<h2>Uh-oh</h2>
<p>Axios reporter Dan Primack <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/1377616122653073412?s=21">noted this morning</a> that SPAC formation appears to be slowing. Mix that into the delays and yesterday&#8217;s anemic-to-awful IPO news, and the market could be seeing a somewhat rapid retrenchment toward more historical valuations and demand levels for unprofitable equities.</p>
<p>Thinking out loud: We should expect SPAC formation and deal volume to fall the fastest of all the signals we&#8217;re tracking, including IPO pricing, the pace of S-1 filings and first-day trading performance. Why? Because it&#8217;s the most exotic of the various data points we&#8217;ve observed on the way <em>up </em>during the tech boom. Therefore, it should also be the thing most vulnerable to rising financial gravity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.holler.io">Holler</a>, described by founder and CEO Travis Montaque as &#8220;a conversational media company,&#8221; just announced that it&#8217;s raised $36 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>You may not know what conversational media is, but there&#8217;s a decent chance you&#8217;ve used Holler&#8217;s technology. For example, if you&#8217;ve added a sticker or a GIF to your Venmo payments, Holler actually manages the app&#8217;s search and suggestion experience around that media. (You may notice a little &#8220;powered by Holler&#8221; identifier at the bottom of the window.)</p>
<p>Montaque told me the company started out initially as a news and video content app before focusing on messaging in 2016. Messaging, he argued, is &#8220;the most important experience for people online,&#8221; since &#8220;it&#8217;s where we communicate with the people who are closest to us.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He continued, &#8220;It seemed bizarre that we haven&#8217;t seen much innovation in the text messaging experience since the first text message was sent in 1992.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Holler works with partners like PayPal-owned Venmo and The Meet Group to bring more compelling content into the messaging side of their apps — or as Montaque put it, the startup aims to &#8220;enrich conversations everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133157" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133157" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2133157" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0289-1.jpg?w=314" alt="Holler/Venmo screenshot" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0289-1.jpg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0289-1.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0289-1.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0289-1.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0289-1.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0289-1.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0289-1.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0289-1.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133157" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Holler</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s both an art and a science to this, he said. The art involves creating and curating the best stickers and GIFs, while the science takes the form of Holler&#8217;s Suggestion AI technology, which will recommend the right content based on the user&#8217;s conversations and contexts — the stickers and GIFs you want to send in a dating app are probably different from what you&#8217;d in a work-related chat. Montaque said that this context-focused approach allows the company to provide smart recommendations in a way that also respects user privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that the future is context, not identity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because I don’t really need to know about Anthony, I just need to know someone is in need of lunch. If I know you&#8217;re in the mood for Mexican food, I don’t need to know every aspect of the last 10 times you went to a Mexican restaurant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holler monetizes this content by partnering with brands like HBO Max, Ikea and Starbucks to create branded stickers and GIFs that become part of the company&#8217;s content library. Montaque said the startup has also worked with brands to measure the impact of these campaigns across a variety of metrics.</p>
<p>Holler&#8217;s content now reaches 75 million users each month, compared to 19 million users a year ago, while revenue has grown 226%, he said. (Apparently, last year was the first time the company saw significant revenue growth.)</p>

<p>The startup has now raised more than $51 million in total funding. The Series B was co-led by CityRock Venture Partners and New General Market Partners, with participation from Gaingels, Interplay Ventures, Relevance Ventures, Towerview Ventures and WorldQuant Ventures.</p>
<p>“Holler is more than simply a groundbreaking technology company,” said CityRock Managing Partner Oliver Libby in a statement. “Under Travis Montaque’s visionary leadership, Holler boldly stands for a new era of ethics in social media, and also deeply reflects the values of diversity, inclusion and belonging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Montaque (who, as a Black tech CEO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/to-promote-diversity-rewire-your-broken-corporate-culture/">wrote a post for TechCrunch last year</a> about bringing more diversity to the industry) said that Holler will use the funds to continue developing its product and advertising model. For one thing, he noted that although stickers and GIFs were an obvious starting point, the company is now looking to explore and create new media formats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to invent a new kind of content consumption paradigm,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Potential threats to the free flow of GIFs continue to trouble the U.K.&#8217;s competition watchdog.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">$400 million purchase</a> of Giphy, announced last year, is now facing an in-depth probe by the CMA after the regulator found the acquisition raises competition concerns related to digital advertising. It now has until September 15 to investigate and report.</p>
<p>The watchdog took a first look at the deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-facebooks-400m-acquisition-of-giphy/">last summer</a>. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/uks-competition-watchdog-still-eyeing-facebooks-giphy-buy/">kept on looking into 2021</a>. And then last week the CMA <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-purchase-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns">laid out </a>its concerns &#8212; saying the (already completed) Facebook-Giphy acquisition could further reduce competition in the digital advertising market where the former is already a kingpin player (with over 50% share of the display advertising market).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The regulator said it had found evidence that, prior to the acquisition, Giphy had planned to expand its own digital advertising partnerships to other countries, including the U.K.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Giphy and Facebook remain merged, Giphy could have less incentive to expand its digital advertising, leading to a loss of potential competition in this market,&#8221; it wrote a week ago.</p>
<p>The CMA also said it was worried a Facebook-owned Giphy could harm social media rivals were the tech giant to squeeze the supply of animated pixels to others &#8212; or require rivals to sign up to worse terms (such as forcing them to hand over user data that it might then use to further fuel its ad targeting engines, gaining yet more market power).</p>
<p>On March 25 the companies were given five days by the regulator to address its concerns &#8212; by offering legally binding proposals intended to allay concerns.</p>
<p>An in-depth &#8220;phase 2&#8221; investigation could have been avoided if concessions were offered that were acceptable to the regulator but that is evidently not the case as the CMA has announced the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/facebook-inc-giphy-inc-merger-inquiry?=0">phase 2 referral</a> today. Given the announcement has come just five working days after the last notification it appears no concessions were offered.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook and the CMA for comment.</p>
<p>A Facebook spokesperson said: &#8220;We will continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation. This merger is good for competition and in the interests of everyone in the U.K. who uses Giphy and our services &#8212; from developers to service providers to content creators.”</p>
<p>While Facebook has already completed its acquisition of Giphy, the CMA&#8217;s investigation continues to put a freeze on its ability to integrate Giphy more deeply into its wider business empire.</p>
<p>Albeit, given Facebook&#8217;s dominant position in the digital advertising space, its business need to move fast via product innovation is a lot less pressing than years past &#8212; when it was building its market dominance free from regulatory intervention.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/uks-cma-launches-investigation-into-digital-advertising-and-its-potential-harm-to-consumers/">recent years</a>, the CMA has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/14/uk-asks-competition-watchdog-to-put-adtech-market-review-top-of-its-to-do-list/">paying close mind to the digital ad market</a>. Back in 2019 it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">reported</a> substantial concerns over the power of the adtech duopoly, Google and Facebook. Although in its final report it said it would wait for the government to legislate, rather than make an intervention to address market power imbalances itself.</p>
<p>The U.K. is now in the process of setting up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">a pro-competition regulator with a dedicated focus on big tech</a> &#8212; in response to concerns about the &#8220;winner takes all&#8221; dynamics seen in digital markets. This incoming Digital Market Unit will oversee a “pro-competition” regime for internet platforms that will see fresh compliance requirements in the coming years.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the CMA continues to scrutinize tech deals and strategic changes &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">recently opening a probe</a> of Google&#8217;s plan to depreciate support for third-party cookies in Chrome after complaints from other industry players.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/ubers-autocab-acquisition-gets-eyed-by-uk-competition-watchdog/">January</a> it also announced it was taking a look at Uber&#8217;s plan to acquire Autocab. However on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-clears-uber-and-autocab-deal">Monday</a> it cleared that deal, finding only &#8220;limited indirect&#8221; competition between the pair and not finding evidence to indicate Autocab was likely to become a significant and more direct competitor to Uber in the future.</p>
<p>The regulator also considered whether Autocab and Uber could seek to put Autocab’s taxi company customers that compete against Uber at a disadvantage by reducing the quality of the booking and dispatch software sold to them, or by forcing them to pass data to Uber. But its phase 1 probe found other credible software suppliers and referral networks that the CMA said these taxi companies could switch to if Uber were to act in such a way &#8212; leading to it to clear the deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As COVID-19 vaccines are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2021/3/30/22340007/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-july-4-independence-day">becoming</a> more readily available to larger groups of the U.S. population, Facebook has teamed up with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to launch new Facebook profile frames that allow users to share their support for getting vaccinated with their family and friends. The effort follows a similar launch in the U.K. through a partnership with National Health Services (NHS), which has already resulted in a quarter of Facebook users in the U.K. having seen a Facebook friend with the profile frame.</p>
<p>At launch, users in the U.S. can pick between frames which include banners that say either &#8220;Let&#8217;s Get Vaccinated&#8221; or &#8220;I Got My COVID-19 Vaccine&#8221; in English or Spanish. The banner will appear overlaid on the edge of their profile picture next to a blue bubble that reads &#8220;We Can Do This.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although there were already a variety of vaccine-promoting profile frames to choose from on Facebook, these were all third-party efforts until now. The new frames were created, in part, by Facebook, which will allow the company to better track their usage over time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2133133" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133133" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2133133" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-9.57.11-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-9.57.11-AM.jpg 1228w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-9.57.11-AM.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-9.57.11-AM.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-9.57.11-AM.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-9.57.11-AM.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-9.57.11-AM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133133" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>In the weeks ahead, Facebook says it will show people a summary in their News Feed of all your friends, family members and people you follow who are using the new COVID-19 vaccine profile frames. For that reason, adopting the first-party frames will be important, if you want to be a part of that list that&#8217;s shown to others.</p>
<p>Facebook notes that it&#8217;s launching the frames because <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/srv6t/">research shows</a> how social norms can have a major impact on people&#8217;s attitude and behavior when it comes to their health &#8212; a notable assertion, given that the company wants to otherwise downplay the power its network has when it comes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">the spread of disinformation</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/social-media-ceos-hedge-on-whether-theyd-boot-the-12-anti-vax-super-spreaders-cited-by-states-attorneys-general/">or anti-vax sentiments</a>.</p>

<p>For this effort, Facebook believes, and the research supports, that when people see others who they know and trust getting the vaccine, they&#8217;ll be encouraged to do the same. This can be particularly effective when it comes to encouraging those who were otherwise unsure about getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Leveraging social media to encourage vaccinations has been part of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/toolkits/essential-workers.html#anchor_1612717860995">the CDC&#8217;s toolkit</a> as well, which is why you likely saw several photos from healthcare workers and essentials workers sharing their vaccination photos and talking about their experience. The CDC had also provided <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/toolkits/community-organization.html#anchor_1612795099571">sets</a> of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/toolkits/essential-workers.html#anchor_1612717860995">sample</a> social media graphics and messages that could be used by organizations that wanted to promote vaccinations across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>The new profile frames are rolling out starting today to Facebook users in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every tech vendor has to pass security muster with customers, typically a tedious activity involving answering long questionnaires. <a href="http://kintent.com">Kintent</a>, a new startup that wants to automate this process, announced a $4 million seed today led by Tola Capital with help from a bunch of tech industry angel investors.</p>
<p>After company co-founder and CEO Sravish Sridhar sold his previous startup <a href="https://www.progress.com/kinvey">Kinvey</a>, which provided backend as a service to mobile app developers, he took a couple of years off while he decided what to do next. The <a href="https://investors.progress.com/news-releases/news-release-details/progress-acquires-kinvey-leader-backend-service-baas-technology">sale to Progress Software</a> in 2017 gave him that luxury.</p>
<p>He knew firsthand from his experience at Kinvey that companies like his had to adhere to a lot of compliance standards, and the idea for the next company began to form in his head. He wanted to create a new startup that could make it easier to figure out how to become compliant with a given standard, measure the current state of compliance and get recommendations on how to improve. He created Kintent to achieve that goal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So the big picture idea is can we build a system of record for trust and our first use case is information security and data privacy compliance, specifically if you&#8217;re a company that is building a SaaS business and you&#8217;re storing customer data or PHI, which is health information,&#8221; Sridhar explained.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="M5kayxFSZl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/securityscorecard-snags-180m-series-e-to-measure-a-companys-security-risk/">SecurityScorecard snags $180M Series E to measure a company&#8217;s security risk</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SecurityScorecard snags $180M Series E to measure a company&#8217;s security risk&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/securityscorecard-snags-180m-series-e-to-measure-a-companys-security-risk/embed/#?secret=M5kayxFSZl" data-secret="M5kayxFSZl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s product is called Trust Cloud. He says that they begin by looking at the lay of your technology land in terms of systems and the types of information you are storing, looking at how compliant each system is with whatever standard you are trying to adhere to.</p>
<p>Then based on how you classify your data, the Trust Cloud generates a list of best practices to stay in compliance with your desired standard, and finally it provides the means to keep testing to validate what you&#8217;ve done and that you are remaining in compliance.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2019, spent the first part of 2020 developing the product and began selling it last October. Today, it has 35 paying customers. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the high six figures in revenue. We&#8217;ve been growing at about 20-30% month-over-month consistently since we launched in October, and the customers are across 11 verticals already,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With 14 employees and some money in the bank from this funding round, he is thinking ahead to adding people. He says that diversity has to be more than something you just talk about, and he has made it one of the core founding values of the company, and one he takes very seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very conscious with every hire that we make that we&#8217;re really pushing to extend ourselves to [find] people from different walks of life, different statuses and so on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is also working on a DEI component for the Trust Cloud, which it will be offering for free, which enables companies to provide a set of diversity metrics to measure against and then report on how well you are doing, and how you can improve your numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mmhmm/">Mmhmm</a>, the software that allows folks to personalize their appearance on video chat, has today announced that it&#8217;s introducing usage-based enterprise accounts.</p>
<p>In a conversation with TechCrunch, founder and CEO Phil Libin said this is a natural evolution, remarking that mmhmm has had hundreds of registrations from users all at the same company.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was clear that there was a big demand for enterprise accounts,&#8221; said Libin. &#8220;Not only for central management, to keep it as easy as possible, but also for getting everything on brand. Companies and organizations of all kinds are realizing video is a permanent part of how we&#8217;re going to do business and it needs to be on brand.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The enterprise accounts are priced the same as individual Pro accounts, at $10/month or $100/year. However, when an organization signs up with an enterprise account, they only pay for the number of users who were active on mmhmm each month, rather than worrying about seats.</p>
<p>Enterprise accounts can also share design system assets built specifically for mmhmm to &#8220;stay on brand&#8221; as Libin said. Folks who opt in to enterprise can also control employee accounts under one umbrella, invite via link, claim an email domain and enjoy a single bill.</p>
<p>Libin also gave us a glimpse into the financials of the business, explaining that while it&#8217;s too early to tell, the conversion rate to Pro accounts is outpacing that of Evernote, one of Libin&#8217;s earlier ventures.</p>
<p>He said that, with freemium tools like both <a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/">mmhmm</a> and Evernote, the likelihood of a user upgrading to premium grows with every month they&#8217;re on the platform. At Evernote, it was half a percent after the first month, and then 5% by the end of the first year, and after two years it would jump to 12%.</p>
<p>Obviously, mmhmm doesn&#8217;t have 24 months&#8217; worth of data. That said, the product is doing 10x better than Evernote did.</p>
<p>But revenue is not the focus, according to Libin. The company is far more concerned with ensuring the onboarding process is easy for casual users and that they really understand what they can do with the platform. In the spirit of that, mmhmm is launching new interactive tutorial videos on the platform to ensure people are fully aware of the features.</p>

<p>Mmhmm first came on the scene in the summer of last year in a closed beta, and eventually opened up to everyone who has a Mac in November 2020. Alongside the launch of enterprise, mmhmm is also launching a Windows version of the app in open beta.</p>
<p>Libin said that mmhmm is in a growth stage, and that after starting five different companies, he knows the biggest challenge is people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in some startups now that have been through this hyper growth stage,&#8221; said Libin. &#8220;The toughest thing at this stage is getting people, keeping people from burning out, and doing career development. This is my fifth startup, so I&#8217;m trying to demonstrate some learning behavior and apply lessons learned from previous mistakes. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So, let me preempt this by saying that there are plenty of robotics verticals worth getting excited about. But at the moment, everyone sure seems focused on warehouse fulfillment. It’s understandable, of course. Right now, it’s Amazon versus the world, and the retail giant certainly has a leg up on much of the world on the robotics front &#8212; questions around human labor are a different conversation entirely (though that’s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/ballot-counting-for-amazons-historic-union-vote-starts-today/&amp;ie=UTF-8">one I’m happy to have</a>).</p>
<p>I’ve spoken to a number of executives at top fulfillment robotics companies, and the message is pretty much the same across the board: How can they stay competitive with Amazon? There’s an answer to that question dripping with more existential dread than I would care to impart in a robotics roundup on a Thursday morning, so I’ll just say that, for better or worse, the easiest answer it automation.</p>
<p>There’s a reason, after all, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/this-is-boston-dynamics-next-commercial-robot/">Boston Dynamics’ latest robot</a> is designed for the warehouse. It may be the company’s second commercially available robot when it arrives this summer, but in a lot of ways, it’s BD’s first purpose-built robot. Spot, after all, was a direct outgrowth of the quadrupedal robotics research that basically dates back to the company’s founding. The company regularly describes Spot as a platform, and the applications are about as varied as you’d expect.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2130946" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130946" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2130946" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/STRETCH-TRUCK-UNLOAD_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.2021-03-26-16_47_15.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130946" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>Stretch evolved from Handle, which evolved from Atlas, but the robotic was created with one very specific thing in mind: moving boxes. Of course, that means a lot of things in the warehouse setting &#8212; and Boston Dynamics will get around to many in the future. For now, however, that mostly means unloading trucks and building orders on pallets. This is obviously a huge growth market, so it will be fascinating to see how an organization like Boston Dynamics scales &#8212; especially if/when the Hyundai deal goes through.</p>
<p>Some raises worth mentioning in the category. I’ve mentioned before that China is worth watching for fulfillment robots, and this week Beijing-based <a href="https://www.forwardx.com/">ForwardX Robotics made a big splash with a $63 million raise</a>. Led by CDH, Eastern Bell and Dohold Capital, the Series B finds the company expanding growth in the U.S. and China, as well as expanding into additional markets, including Japan, the U.K. and Germany.</p>
<p>Here’s founder/CEO Nicolas Chee on the round:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our customers in the warehousing and manufacturing industries come to us to transform their operations and help them unlock new levels of efficiency that were previously unattainable. ForwardX Robotics’ flexible automation platform enables supply chain facilities to elevate worker performance, reduce growing labor costs pressures, and adapt quickly and effectively to changes in the market.</p></blockquote>

<p>There was a <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/ambi-robotics-raises-61m-for-picking-systems/">decent-sized round for Ambi Robotics</a>, which is also using the opportunity to come out of stealth. Founded by UC Berkeley professor (and frequent TC Sessions: Robotics guest) Ken Goldberg, the company announced a $6.1 million seed. The startup specializes in pick and place robotics, starting with a pair of machines: the AmbiSort and AmbiKit. Goldberg has a pretty devoted following in the category, so this will definitely be one to watch.</p>

<p>This week we broke the news of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/drone-data-scanning-company-skycatch-announces-a-25m-raise/">Skycatch’s $25 million raise</a>. We’ve covered the drone startup a number of times over the years. While countless companies are currently taking great pains to put drones to work in the real world, Skycatch has actually turned theory into practice. Its 3D imaging drones have already been deployed to thousands of sites all over the world.</p>
<p>Speaking of actually deploying robots into the real world, the delivery category has been doing a decent job of this. With COVID-19 still very much an issue in much of the country and world, now’s a pretty good time to start testing these system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131686" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131686" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2131686" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nbrhd-reef-cartken.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nbrhd-reef-cartken.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nbrhd-reef-cartken.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nbrhd-reef-cartken.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nbrhd-reef-cartken.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nbrhd-reef-cartken.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nbrhd-reef-cartken.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nbrhd-reef-cartken.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nbrhd-reef-cartken.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131686" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> REEF Technologies</p></div></p>
<p>Granted, the tech isn’t in any real danger of replacing delivery people outright any time soon, but we are seeing a number of companies and cities get pretty aggressive about testing. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-spinoff-cartken-and-reef-technologies-launch-miamis-first-delivery-robots/">add Cartken to that list</a>. The company, founded by former Google engineers, has begun testing in Miami &#8212; a city, I’m told, by countless breathy thinkpieces and at least one Will Smith song, that is the place to be.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130829" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130829" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2130829" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210325_03_01.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210325_03_01.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210325_03_01.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210325_03_01.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210325_03_01.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210325_03_01.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210325_03_01.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210325_03_01.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210325_03_01.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130829" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Toyota</p></div></p>
<p>Nuro, meanwhile, has had very little issue building excitement, event without the Fresh Prince’s encouragement. The delivery startup announced a massive $500 million Series C, back in November. More insight into that round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro/">arrives this week</a>, as the Toyota-powered Woven Capital announces it was part of the round. The fund’s head of investments and acquisitions, George Kellerman, tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nuro was a good jumping off point, because a lot of the work that we’re doing is really focused on developing autonomous passenger vehicles, so this is a way for us to learn and advance through a partner that is laser-focused on local goods delivery. There’s a lot of opportunity to learn from them, and potentially over time, to collaborate and help them expand globally.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://thras.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a>, an early mover and leading player in the wave of startups emerging to consolidate and scale companies that sell their goods mainly via Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, has raised some more funding and is making a key executive appointment to do some scaling of its own. The company, which to date has acquired and consolidated over 100 brands (and 15,000 products) selling on Amazon, has picked up $100 million, and alongside that it&#8217;s announcing a new CFO, retail vet Bill Wafford, as it eyes up its next steps, including a public listing.</p>
<p>The $100 million is an extension to Thrasio&#8217;s Series C &#8212; a round that saw a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$750 million injection</a> only about six weeks ago, and a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thrasio-reaches-1b-valuation-sets-new-us-speed-record-for-unicorns-301093829.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous close of $260 million last July</a>.</p>
<p>Josh Silberstein, who is the co-founder and co-CEO with Carlos Cashman, said Thrasio is not disclosing valuation except to note that it is 50% higher than the it was a month ago for Thrasio, which made a profit of $100 million on $500 million in revenues last year, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For some context, when we reported on the $750 million round, we noted that the valuation was potentially between $3 billion and $4 billion. All a spokesperson would tell us at the time was that it was &#8220;less than $10 billion&#8221; although a debt round in January put the valuation at around $3 billion.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uzWVnqb0X4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/">Thrasio raises $750M more in equity for its Amazon roll-up play</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Thrasio raises $750M more in equity for its Amazon roll-up play&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/embed/#?secret=uzWVnqb0X4" data-secret="uzWVnqb0X4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It has now raised $1.85 billion in equity and debt.</p>
<p>Silberstein said the latest $100 million is coming from previous backers that didn&#8217;t get the allocation they hoped for in the previous financing. The list of past backers <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/266344-84/company/profile#general-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">includes</a> Oaktree, Advent, Harlan Capital, Peak6, Western Technology Investment and Upper 90, which is led by Jason Finger, the co-founder of one of the early players in food delivery startups Seamless.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Giving insiders a little more of a share also seems to hint at the fact that the company looks to be preparing for its next steps as a business, which might include a public listing via a SPAC or a more traditional IPO route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are engaged in conversations where valuation where may once again become a topic so holding off on additional commentary for now,&#8221; said Silberstein in response to the question. &#8220;We’ve reached a point that there are legal consequences to being anything other than vague.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>As part of that process, Wafford is coming on as CFO from a previous role as CFO at JC Penney and before that, CFO of Vitamin Shoppe, in a longer resumé that also includes finance roles at retailers like Walgreens and Target.</p>
<p>(Side note: Wafford&#8217;s time at Walgreens included running Walgreens Venture Capital, and it crossed over with the period when Walgreens inked its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130909005578/en/Theranos-Selects-Walgreens-as-a-Long-Term-Partner-Through-Which-to-Offer-Its-New-Clinical-Laboratory-Service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately disastrous deals with Theranos</a>, although it seems that deal was made with a different division of the company than the one he oversaw.)</p>
<p>Wafford is replacing Joe Falcao, a longtime employee of the company, who is taking a role as SVP, Finance and Treasurer, to scale the company&#8217;s treasury, tax and international finance functions.</p>
<p>Wafford&#8217;s experience across a range of bigger brick-and-mortar retailers that work with and partner with smaller brands across a number of categories from fashion to health and household goods is notable, in that it&#8217;s an analogue of what Thrasio is essentially building in the online world, where its 15,000-plus products run the gamut from a <a href="https://www.shopbitly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapeutic sock maker</a>, to a company that has developed a <a href="https://angryorange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spray to remove pet odors</a> and stains, to a <a href="https://willowandeverett.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-end kitchen goods maker</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thrasio&#8217;s trajectory and the speed at which it has achieved growth is impressive to say the least, especially how they&#8217;ve capitalized on the market changes that have occurred over the last twelve months,” said Bill Wafford, CFO, in a statement. “I&#8217;ve been delighted to discover an energizing, team-minded culture that embraces experimentation and adaptability. I&#8217;m thrilled to take on the role to prepare the organization for its next phase of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one estimate</a> there are about 5 million third-party sellers on Amazon today, a number that appears to be growing exponentially, with more than 1 million sellers joining the platform in 2020 alone. Thrasio&#8217;s business model is based around the premise that most of them are not that well-prepared to scale when and if the most successful of this lot see their products take off.</p>
<p>Silberstein and Thrasio estimate that there are probably 50,000 businesses selling on the Amazon platform with FBA (<a href="https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulfillment by Amazon</a>) that are making $1 million or more per year in revenues.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happens when you get into that price range is that it gets hard to grow your business and manage it,&#8221; he said, citing SEO, marketing and supply chain management as some of the challenges. &#8220;That means as you grow from $1 million to $10 million, the margins would decrease and it gets even harder to make returns. We simply observed the reality that all these great companies had reached a point between a lack of access to capital and simply not being able to keep doing what they do. We thought, if we acquire 10-20 of these we would have the scale to build best in breed supply chain, marketing and so on. We would fix the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>It realized quickly, though, that there was an opportunity to take that even further and make that the business itself. And so Thrasio has been building a huge analytics engine that digs into Amazon data and a lot more to determine which companies are interesting, how to help them sell better, and eventually to conceive of even bigger businesses outside of the Amazon ecosystem, covering other marketplaces, other sales channels and direct D2C sales.</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t been the only one. Possibly spurred by Thrasio&#8217;s success, we&#8217;ve seen launches and major funding for a plethora of these roll-up plays. Branded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched its own roll-up business on $150 million in funding</a> earlier this year, and others including<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berlin Brands Group</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SellerX</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heyday</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroes</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perch</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and more have collectively raised or committed from their own balance sheets well over $1 billion in aid of their own efforts to buy up small but promising third-party merchants.</span></p>
<p>With Amazon only getting bigger by the day, and the challenge of weeding out quality from quite a lot of me-too knock-offs also growing, there is a clear role for improving discoverability and connecting consumers to the most interesting products, and helping those products succeed. At the same time, it will be worth watching how the roll-ups themselves grow and if they manage to deliver on all that they are promising to the brands they are buying, and to their investors.</p>
<p><em>Article corrected to note that the number of companies it has acquired are over 100, with 15,000 products among them, and that the company made $100 million in profit last year, not revenues.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Next Insurance recently announced that it has raised a $250 million round, valuing the SMB-focused insurance provider at $4 billion. The company last raised another $250 million in September 2020, at a valuation of $2 billion. This funding also comes after Next Insurance <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic/">acquired Juniper Labs</a> in December, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/06/investors-still-love-software-more-than-life/">AP Intego more recently</a>.</p>
<p>Next sells small-business coverage across a number of categories (workers&#8217; comp, commercial auto, general liability, etc.) for different classes of workers. Think fitness companies, or construction concerns. Put together, Next&#8217;s bet is that its ability to price coverage across different categories and industries will allow it to scale its gross written premium (GWP) quickly by attracting myriad small businesses, and upselling them to other products over time.</p>
<p>Next Insurance&#8217;s new round and new valuation come at an interesting time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/06/investors-still-love-software-more-than-life/">for the insurtech space more broadly</a>. Some air has come out of Lemonade&#8217;s share price, the rental-insurance unicorn being an early public debut for the broader tech-enabled, neo-insurance niche.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since Lemonade&#8217;s debut, we&#8217;ve seen Root Insurance go public as well. The car insurance tech startup has struggled since its debut, losing value and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investor-alert-kirby-mcinerney-llp-213000827.html">attracting lawsuits</a> despite <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3666921-root-eps-misses-0_07-beats-on-revenue">besting investor growth expectations</a>. MetroMile, another neo-insurance company focused on automotive that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/how-will-investors-value-metromile-and-oscar-health/">went public via a SPAC-led combination</a>, has been slightly uneven since starting to trade. Hippo, which focuses on home insurance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/06/investors-still-love-software-more-than-life/">intends to list via a SPAC itself at a $5 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>Inside those numbers you can find optimism, and some lackluster trading results. How to parse the mix will depend on one&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>For Next Insurance&#8217;s backers, however, it&#8217;s all systems go. And there&#8217;s reason to believe that their enthusiasm is not misplaced, despite some chop in Next&#8217;s broader market.</p>
<p>Next says its GWP doubled in the half-year after its last round. That makes its valuation doubling seem somewhat reasonable &#8212; if private investors were willing to pay for its shares at a certain GWP multiple, why not re-up at double the price and double the GWP while the company continues to scale?</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As Next Insurance makes its first acquisition, insurtech looks energetic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic/embed/#?secret=9A2d50kYCt" data-secret="9A2d50kYCt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Just how big is Next today? It reached a GWP run rate of $100 million back in February of 2020. And it reached a $200 million GWP run rate in February of this year. So, larger than that by a few months&#8217; growth, exclusive of the AP Intego business, which had around $185 million in active premium around the time its deal with Next Insurance was announced.</p>
<p>To clarify the numbers, TechCrunch reached out to Next Insurance for detail on when it doubled its GWP, and when the AP Intego deal started to count toward its numbers. Per an email from CEO Guy Goldstein, the doubling metrics regarding GWP was &#8220;in relation to that 2020 figure and [was calculated] before the AP Intego acquisition.&#8221; So, we can presume that the firm is now well north of the $200 million GWP run rate that it had previously cited.</p>
<p>Finally, TechCrunch asked the company about the SPAC boom and if it intended to avoid that rapid path to the public markets. &#8220;We’re always evaluating our options, but right now, the main focus remains on growing the business,&#8221; Goldstein responded.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a no.</p>
