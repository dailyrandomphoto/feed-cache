										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online fraud and identity theft is a global problem that has only been exacerbated with increased online transactions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it is estimated that Brazilian companies lose over $41 billion due to fraud every year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to tackle this problem head on, Lincoln Ando and Raphael Melo started idwall in mid-2016. São Paulo-based idwall started as an automated background check solution and has since grown into a suite of data and identity validation and risk analysis products. For the consumer market, its &#8220;MeuID&#8221; app is aimed at users who want to change the way they identify themselves and share their data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now the Brazilian regtech has raised $38 million in a Series C round led by Endurance.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GGV Capital, monashees, Canary, Qualcomm Ventures, ONEVC, Peninsula and Norte also participated in the funding, bringing its total raised to nearly $50 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has grown 1,458% between 2017 and 2020, with average growth of 144% per year. Its more than 300 clients include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 unicorns, two out of the three biggest banks in Brazil and companies such as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> iFood, Claro, Cielo, Loggi, Ebanx, QuintoAndar and OLX, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs make up a significant portion of its client base, and in 2020, the company saw its revenue from clients in the financial industry alone climb by 588% compared to 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idwall uses machine learning and AI to automate the onboarding process via its face match, background check, risk analysis, ID validation and automated optical character recognition (OCR) offerings to help companies avoid fraud.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fraud prevention platform Sift raises $50M at over $1B valuation, eyes acquisitions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/fraud-prevention-platform-sift-raises-50m-at-over-1b-valuation-eyes-acquisitions/embed/#?secret=qyZMQff0H8" data-secret="qyZMQff0H8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said its APIs verify personal documents and information by searching in public and private databases “quickly and pursuant to the compliance rules.” Idwall does all this by first validating that an ID is authentic. Then it works to ensure the person using it is actually the owner of the ID. And lastly, it runs a full background check. It claims it does all this in less than three minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help them do all these onboarding processes in a safer, better and faster way,” said idwall co-founder and CEO Ando.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, idwall has generated more than 65 million data reports for its clients, a number that it says surged by 5,000 times between 2017 and 2020.Those reports, it claims, have helped its clients scale their operations, register more of their own clients and optimize compliance and KYC processes, as well as reduce fraud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the pandemic’s drive to digital led to a massive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increase in the number of digital bank accounts, mobile payment services and also of companies adjusting to digital platforms and/or expanding their digital operations &#8212; leading to a boom in business for idwall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more digitized companies become, the more client expectations grow — and market competition grows stronger,” Ando said. “Our mission is to always stay ahead of innovation in our market, and that’s why we invest so much in growth and in building the best possible team to develop our products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of that includes using its new capital to recruit more developers, strengthen its existing products and release new ones. Idwall plans to increase its headcount from its current 200 to about 300 over the next few months. The company is also examining the possibility of expanding outside of Brazil to all of Latin America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of the identity validation and fraud problems faced in Brazil are seen in other Latin American countries as well,” Ando said. “Besides, places like Mexico and Colombia also have highly innovative companies pushing the envelope when it comes to identity and technology. We still have a lot to achieve in Brazil, but we see a big opportunity for us to take our mission even further.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, in its home country, recent regulatory changes in Brazil in recent years have also led to an increase in demand for idwall’s offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Brazil’s documentation databases are highly siloed, the company says, with each state having its own model for the most common identity document, the RG (“Registro Geral” or “General Registry”). Plus, each citizen can be issued a different RG document in each state.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Brazil’s Roaring 20s see the rise of early-stage startups?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/will-brazils-roaring-20s-see-the-rise-of-early-stage-startups/embed/#?secret=Fq6bjHax04" data-secret="Fq6bjHax04" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s undeniable how much digital onboarding and automated identity validation processes are fundamental for the Latin American market to reach as far as it has the potential to,” Ando said. “It’s extremely difficult to understand and validate identification and personal data in Brazil.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in general, the company has observed how weary Brazilians are of having to show their IDs for routine events. Idwall helps with that via its aforementioned “MeuID” solution, which stores in a single wallet all the documents necessary for the onboarding processes of fintechs, startups, office buildings and other businesses.</span></p>
<p>Its investors are, naturally, bullish.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hans Tung, GGV Capital’s managing partner, describes idwall as a “one-of-a-kind” startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“idwall is leading the discussions and innovations in Brazil regarding digital onboarding and identity validation,” he said. “And their B2C digital identity app MeuID could be the first true super-app in Latin America.”</span></p>
<p>GGV aims to invest in category leaders that are using technology to create positive impact for its users and for society, Tung added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idwall founders are tackling a huge yet underserved problem in Brazil, and have led the company through terrific growth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They have the ingredients to become the leading personal data platform in LatAm for the enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marcos Toledo, managing partner at Canary, notes that idwall was one of his firm&#8217;s first investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lincoln and Raphael&#8217;s abilities to build and scale a business solving a very relevant problem in Brazil have caught our attention,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Their culture, tech level and agility as a company also are very remarkable in the Brazilian market.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When two of Indonesia&#8217;s biggest companies &#8212; ride-hailing company Gojek and e-commerce marketplace Tokopedia &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/">joined forces</a> as GoTo Group last month, a key highlight from the merger was that the last-mile delivery space is still a huge global trend</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, the e-commerce and last-mile delivery market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is projected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be worth over $20 billion in the next five years. Big players like Jumia have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">considerable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market share yet smaller platforms are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carving out theirs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of such is ride-hailing-turned-logistics company <a href="https://www.gokada.ng/">Gokada</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/24/nigerias-gokada-raises-5-3m-round-for-its-motorcycle-ride-hail-biz/">Gokada launched</a> in 2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a ride-hailing company in Lagos, Nigeria. But i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n 2020, Gokada began offering logistics (Gsend) and food delivery services (GShop) after a ride-hailing ban by the Lagos State government affected its operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company is combining all these services (which have operated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">independently in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) into a single application.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In September and October, we launched GShop which is the food delivery platform for Gokada</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we realized from our customers was that while they were using the Gsend and GShop </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">separately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they came to us asking if we could put them together,&#8221; said Gokada CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/nikhilgoel91">Nikhil Goel</a> to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So doing this is more like a transition from other things we were doing and making it easier for our customers to have all our services in one platform and create a super app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gokada&#8217;s super app plans are coming off the back of an impressive year for the company despite a troubling first few months during the pandemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as February, the company downsized and <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/02/03/gokada-lays-off-staff/">laid off more than half its staff</a> after the ban on motorcycles in Lagos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pivoted to logistics and food delivery and hasn&#8217;t looked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past year, Gokada has crossed over $100 million in annualized transaction value. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has also helped more than 30,000 merchants on its platform to execute over 1 million food delivery and e-commerce orders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Before Gokada ventured into ride-hailing in Lagos, people questioned us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we entered the delivery space, it was the same question people asked. They said we didn&#8217;t have the experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But today, if you look at it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">critically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we&#8217;ve changed this market in a different manner,&#8221; Goel said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goel, who <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/03/17/gokada-announces-nikhil-goel-as-new-ceo/">took over the reins</a> at Gokada this March after founder Fahim Saleh </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-53420183"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tragically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-53420183"> passed on</a>, has been instrumental to the company&#8217;s impressive growth so far</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per information shared by Gokada, the company&#8217;s volume growth has increased 3x in the last six months while revenue increased 10x within the past year.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159332" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159332" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2159332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png?w=375" alt="Gokada" width="375" height="666" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gokada</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before becoming CEO, Goel had three roles since joining the company in 2019 &#8212; VP of Rides, COO, and acting president. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he also co-founded Indian edtech startup Classplus and worked as a general manager at Indian food delivery giant Zomato</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His stint at Zomato and knowledge of the food-delivery and logistics space will be key to how Gokada pulls off its super app ambitions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gokada is only present in Lagos, the company is looking to launch its services across other cities including Abuja, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Ogun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And not only will the super app allow Gokada customers in these cities to access food delivery, e-commerce (medicines and groceries among other supplies), and logistics, but they will be able to use ride-hailing services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to start with neighbouring markets to Lagos &#8212; Ogun and Ibadan. In the latter, there&#8217;s already a ride-hailing platform in the form of SafeBoda. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which is present in Uganda and Nigeria, employs a super app model in the East African country but offers only ride-hailing services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Ibadan, the only Nigerian city where it operates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For much of last year, SafeBoda has enjoyed dominance in the southwestern city but Gokada&#8217;s arrival, especially as it plans to offer other services, might threaten its commanding position</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started with its ride-hailing service in Lagos. We were mostly known as one of the pioneers of ride-hailing in Lagos before the ban. So far, we&#8217;ve not ventured outside Lagos, and the reason for that has been that we wanted to remain focused on our new business here. And it&#8217;s evident that when you move across Lagos, you will see our delivery bikes everywhere on the road. But ride-hailing will always stay with us wherever we go outside the city,&#8221; the CEO added. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gokada is in talks to secure operational licenses for ride-hailing but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has already acquired a NIPOST licence to mitigate future risks on the regulatory front</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow them to operate courier logistics services across the country.</span></p>
<p>While services in a super app can differ from one platform to another, payments is the defining functionality that ties those offerings together. For now, Gokada only provides a subset of that which is a wallet feature and a debit card option to pay for these services. On why this is the case, Goel said: &#8220;Before many of these companies like Grab and Gojek got into payments, they were providing other services. The idea for a super app is to provide customers with different services under one umbrella to ease their lives. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing but we&#8217;re open to a payments play in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other markets in Asia, Africa doesn&#8217;t have clear leaders in the super app race. Therefore, Gokada will join a growing <a href="https://techcabal.com/2020/08/21/factsheet-super-app-africa/">list of platforms</a> clamouring for supremacy in their respective markets, a spot OPay seemed to be gunning for before <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/07/02/opay-restructuring-plans/">shutting down its non-fintech verticals</a> last year to focus on its payment services. </span></p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/rise-of-digital-banks-in-indonesia-3-million-more-users-added-in-2020/">report by Momentum Works</a>, downloads of digital banking apps in Indonesia grew 7% in 2020, with apps from established banks like BTPN Jenius, OCBC Nyala and Permata leading. But Momentum Works also observed that “many Indonesian digital bank users tend to download multiple digital bank applications and explore around,” so a dominant player hasn’t emerged yet. Major tech companies like <a href="https://www.regulationasia.com/sea-group-to-establish-digital-banking-operations-in-indonesia/">Sea Group</a>, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Grab-and-others-see-big-chance-in-ASEAN-digital-banking">Grab</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/gojek-buys-slice-of-indonesian-bank-in-biggest-fintech-deal-yet">Gojek</a> are also working on their own neobank services.</p>
<p>Line <a href="https://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/global/2020/65">introduced banking services to its Thai users</a> last October, as part of a joint venture with Kasikorn Vision Company, a subsidiary of Kasikorn Bank.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freight forwarding &#8212; the process of organising how and where items will be shipped around the world, and specifically the technology that underpins that work &#8212; continues to be a huge area of the logistics market, not least because of the huge boom in e-commerce in the last year, and because of the Covid-19-mandated need to simply be more efficient in how things are being moved around. Today, one of the bigger players in that space is announcing more funding to capitalize on the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sennder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sennder</a>, a digital freight forwarder that focuses on moving cargo around Europe (and specifically focusing on trucks and &#8220;full truck load&#8221;, FTL, freight forwarding), has raised $80 million in funding, at a valuation that the company confirms is now over $1 billion.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based startup has been on something of a funding tear this year. In January, it announced a $160 million round, and this $80 million is closing out its Series D. Baillie Gifford has led this latest Series D extension, with Hedosophia, Accel, Lakestar, HV Capital, Project A and Scania all participating in the previous part of the Series D.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding makes Sennder, which has now raised some $350 million, one of the most well-funded of the freight forwarders, but it&#8217;s a hot area at the moment. Another player out of Europe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/zencargo-raises-42m-to-expand-its-digital-first-freight-forwarding-platform-internationally/">Zencargo, picked up $42 million</a> just last month. Other competitors include the likes of Flexport in the US.</p>
<p>Sennder is growing organically, but it&#8217;s also making some acquisitions to scale up &#8212; a mark not just of the activity in the market but also the fragmentation. In May, it <a href="https://www.sennder.com/press/sennder-acquires-dutch-based-cars-cargo-supplying-digital-offering-whilst-expanding-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired Cars&amp;Cargo</a> to give it a stronger presence in France and Benelux. Other companies that it has acquired have included Uber Freight Europe and Everoad in 2020, and it also operates a JV with Poste Italiane, Italy&#8217;s postal service. Altogether it now has eight hubs in Europe.</p>
<p>The plan will be to make more acquisitions of this kind, the company said, to expand a network that now covers 12,500 trucks that it says works with ten German DAX 30 and eleven Euro Stoxx 50 shippers and is expected to move more than 1 million truckloads in 2021.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have carried our momentum from 2020 into 2021, having already made one acquisition and signed several strategic partnerships,&#8221; said David Nothacker, CEO and Co-Founder of sennder, in a statement. &#8220;We look to expand our European footprint, bringing more carriers and shippers onto the sennder platform, while expanding our digital offering – such as SaaS. Acquisitions and strategic partnerships are part of this strategy – the additional funds give us the flexibility to capitalize on the right opportunities. Baillie Gifford has backed a wave of revolutionary tech companies; their commitment to sennder is a vote of confidence in our team, technology, and business model.”</p>
<p>Stephen Paice, Co-manager, Baillie Gifford European Growth Trust PLC, added: “We are delighted to join the sennder team on its journey to disrupt Europe’s logistics industry. We strongly believe its technology has the potential to create tremendous value for stakeholders and society in an industry plagued with inefficiencies and needless CO2 emissions. What’s particularly impressive, beyond the progress shown so far, is the purpose-driven and entrepreneurial mind-set instilled within the company. This will no doubt be an important factor for long-term success.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of professional services has long relied on contractors to fill in for assignments and projects that might not be a part of the course of daily work, but are essential work nonetheless. Today, a startup that’s built a marketplace to make it easier for freelance developers, designers and others with technical skills with those job opportunities is announcing a significant round of funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malt</a>, which provides a way for developers, data scientists, designers, project managers and others working in related fields to connect with fixed-term job opportunities in their fields, has picked up €80 million ($97 million at today&#8217;s rates), money that the company plans to use to expand its business to more markets.</p>
<p>We understand from sources that the investment &#8212; led by Goldman Sachs Growth Equity and Eurazeo &#8212; values Malt at €400 million ($489 million).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vincent Huguet, Malt&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Hugo Lassiège and Jean-Baptiste Lemée, said in an interview that the funding in part will be used towards continuing to expand the company across Europe with a view to, longer term, also breaking into the U.S. In Europe, the company was founded in Paris, and it currently has operations in France (Paris, Lyon), Germany (Munich), and Spain (Madrid). The plan is to extend that to Benelux next, with the UK and Italy company after that.</p>
<p>The company has to date amassed 250,000 freelancers in its community, with 30,000 businesses tapping this pool to fill jobs. End customers include the likes of Unilever, Lufthansa, Bosch, BlaBla Car, L&#8217;Oreal and Allianz, and it also partners with traditional consultancies like McKinsey to help them source people for projects. Altogether the company has handled some €300 million in business since being founded in 2013.</p>
<p>These numbers, it seems, are just the tip of the iceberg. It&#8217;s estimated that there are some 6 million people in Europe working as freelancers today, and Malt estimates that the freelance consulting market is worth some €350 billion annually in the region.</p>
<p>Although recruitment for many parts of the economy has largely gone digital in the last two decades, Malt is tackling a part of the temp economy that has ironically held a strong offline presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing is that we are a very open marketplace, an Airbnb-style search marketplace,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all really based on our search engine. In a market that is very opaque, where offline and online players [those connecting technical workers with jobs] are protecting their bases, we have opened the information.&#8221; It also provides payment services and advanced solutions for some of its customers once people are engaged, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Freelancer&#8221; is a pretty loaded term in the tech world today &#8212; it could mean anything from a gig worker delivering food, driving you around or cleaning a house, from the plethora of people who work on fixed-term contracts, and soemtimes the implications are not great. Critics will say companies lean on the freelancer model in order to skirt around having to provide extensive benefits to those doing the jobs.</p>
<p>Malt is working in a somewhat different area, focusing on a gap in the market that has been around for a long while, finding people with specific, valued technical skills to fill in for project-based work, but has often been a tough one to crack for employers, Huguet said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going after those who charge a few hundred dollars per day and connecting them with mid- and large-sized companies,&#8221; said Huguet, who described Malt as very different from the likes of Fiverr, which also lets people find skilled workers but focuses on finding the lowest bidder for a job. &#8220;You search for a specific freelancer as the employer. You don&#8217;t post a specific task for freelancers to respond.&#8221; The average time of engagement is around three weeks but might be as long as three months, he said.</p>
<p>What has been interesting &#8212; and has definitely had an impact on how Malt has grown, and the investment it&#8217;s announcing today &#8212; is how much the working world has shifted in the last year and a half. Not only has Covid-19 changed how people work in offices &#8212; if they are working in offices at all anymore &#8212; but the rapidly changing circumstances have somewhat played into the idea of building out work strategy on more concrete short- and medium-term goals, with longer-term remaining a conditional. This fits the kind of jobs that Malt typically helps fill requirements for, and the changes also has meant more workers coming into Malt&#8217;s universe looking for work.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we can see already and predict in the next quarters is that we will be a post covid winner,&#8221; Huguet said. &#8220;People are now considering different options. The idea of a full-time employee was that when everyone was in office people knew how to work 9-6, and that&#8217;s what was expected. Now that people are working on projects, employers are more open to consultants. This plus the bigger hiring freezes helped us grow much faster. The market and the mindset have changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, people who might have previously looked first for full-time employment are now feeling more secure putting their eggs into the freelance basket. &#8220;More than 90% of freelancers are joining us by choice,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>What will be interesting is to see how and if companies like LinkedIn, which has been a strong player in professional recruitment, make more headway in this space, on the back of a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-new-gig-a-linkedin-freelancer-market-rivaling-upwork-fiverr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of a freelancer marketplace earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We are watching what it&#8217;s doing, but we think it will be hard for them to do,&#8221; Huguet said. He pointed out that LinkedIn&#8217;s profiles today are dedicated to classic recruitment, so doing the matching for freelance is very different.</p>
<p>Regardless of how LinkedIn&#8217;s interest plays out, its activity there also points to a big opportunity, one big reason for why investors are backing Malt right now.</p>
<p>“Malt is at a pivotal time in its development. This new round of funding will allow the company to scale rapidly and drive even greater impact,&#8221; said Yann du Rusquec, a partner at Eurazeo. &#8220;We are excited to partner with Vincent and Alexandre—and offer the expertise of our Growth and Venture teams along with the depth of Eurazeo&#8217;s network in Europe—to drive Malt’s future success.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to support Malt to build the leading freelance marketplace in Europe,&#8221; added Alexandre Flavier, executive director at Goldman Sachs Growth Equity. &#8220;Malt is at the forefront of the future of work, promoting agility, innovation, impact, freedom of choice, making freelancing simpler and more reliable. We are excited to partner with Malt’s founders, empower their community of highly skilled freelancers, and give companies access to the world’s best freelance talents.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://www.wefox.com/en-de">Wefox</a> has raised a $650 million Series C funding round led by Target Global. Following this funding round, the company has reached a post-money valuation of $3 billion. Wefox is a digital insurer focused on personal insurance products, such as household insurance, motor insurance and personal liability insurance.</p>
<p>“It’s much more than we wanted to raise initially. It was a very fast process and essentially we were oversubscribed by 4x or so,” co-founder and CEO Julian Teicke (pictured right) told me.</p>
<p>In December 2019, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/wefox-unicorn/">reported</a> a $1.65 billion valuation. And the company says today’s funding round is one of the largest Series C rounds of all time — and likely the largest Series C round for an insurtech company more specifically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Almost all of the big existing investors are participating,” Teicke said. OMERS Ventures, G Squared, Mountain Partners, Merian, Horizons Ventures, Eurazeo, Mubadala Capital, Salesforce Ventures, Speedinvest, CE Innovation Capital, GR Capital and Seedcamp are all participating once again in this Wefox founding round. New investors include FinTLV, Ace &amp; Co, LGT and its affiliated impact investing platform Lightrock, Partners Group, EDBI, Jupiter and Decisive.</p>
<p>“Not only have we raised a super large amount but also in a very fast time. It took us a total of four weeks to get all commitments in,” co-founder an CFO Fabian Wesemann (pictured left) told me.</p>
<p>Wefox believes it can now iterate and generate more and more revenue as it scales — it just needs capital to reach the next level. “We’re tackling that $5.2 trillion industry that has been stuck in the pre-internet era. We nailed how to disrupt it in our core market,” Teicke said.</p>
<p>But what makes Wefox different from legacy insurance companies? Wefox isn’t a direct-to-consumer insurance company. Most insurance products are still sold by agents and the startup believes this isn’t going to change anytime soon.</p>
<p>That’s why Wefox has 700 agents selling Wefox products exclusively. It also partners with associate brokers — around 5,000 can distribute Wefox products.</p>
<p>“While the rest of the industry seems to say that human agents are dead, we think they’re more relevant than ever,” Teicke said.</p>
<p>In 2020 alone, the company generated $140 million in revenue. If you look at Wefox Insurance, the company’s insurance carrier, the company reported a profit for 2020. As for the group, “we’re going to show overall profitability by 2023,” Wesemann said.</p>
<p>That fast growth rate combined with a clear path to profitability means that Wefox has an ambitious roadmap. As a full-stack insurance company licensed in Lichtenstein, Wefox can passport its license to other European countries. The company is currently live in five markets right now and is working on expanding to Italy soon.</p>
<p>In addition to new markets, Wefox plans to sell new insurance products — property and casualty insurance, pet insurance, health insurance, life insurance… If you’re thinking about an insurance product, chances are Wefox is already working on it. “This year we’re launching around 20 new insurance products,” Teicke said.</p>
<p>While distribution is managed decentrally with local agents talking with local customers, insurance products are managed centrally. The startup prioritizes products by revenue potential and goes down the list one product at a time.</p>
<p>Finally, Wefox has ambitious plans when it comes to reducing administrative costs. The company has been investing in automation so that common processes are handled by an algorithm. Currently, 80% of its processes are handled automatically. It’s a never-ending process as you have to adapt your processes when you launch new products.</p>
<p>Wefox is also working on prevention. The company has put together an AI team in Paris to prevent bad things from happening in the first place. As always with insurance companies, it’s all about optimizing every layer and every step of the customer journey to build a product that stands out from what’s already out there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://zenyum.com/">Zenyum</a>, a startup that wants to make cosmetic dentistry more affordable, announced today it has raised a $40 million Series B. This includes $25 million from L Catterton, a private equity firm focused on consumer brands. The round’s other participants were Sequoia Capital India (Zenyum is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/19/sequoia-surge-inaugural-cohort-india-southeast-asia/">an alum of its Surge accelerator program</a>), RTP Global, Partech, TNB Aura, Seeds Capital and FEBE Ventures. L Catteron Asia’s head of growth investments, Anjana Sasidharan, will join Zenyum’s board.</p>
<p>This brings Zenyum’s total raised so far to $56 million, including <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/zenyum-secures-13m-fuel-expansion-plans">a $13.6 million Series A announced in November 2019</a>. In a press statement, Sasidharan said, “Zenyum’s differentiated business model gives it a strong competitive advantage, and we are excited to partner with the founder management team to help them realize their growth ambitions.” Other dental-related investments in L Catteron’s portfolio include Ideal Image, ClearChoice, dentalcorp, OdontoCompany, Espaçolaser and 98point6.</p>

<p>Founded in 2018, the company’s products now include ZenyumSonic electric toothbrushes; Zenyum Clear, or transparent 3D-printed aligners; and ZenyumClear Plus for more complex teeth realignment cases.</p>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Julian Artopé told TechCrunch that ZenyumClear aligners can be <a href="https://www.zenyum.com/sg-en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-braces-prices-in-singapore/">up to 70% cheaper than other braces</a>, including traditional metal braces, lingual braces and other clear aligners like Invisalign, depending on the condition of a patients’ teeth and what they want to achieve. Zenyum Clear costs $2,400 SGD (about $1,816 USD), while ZenyumClear Plus ranges from $3,300 to $3,900 SGD (about $2,497 to $2,951 USD).</p>
<p>The company is able to reduce the cost of its invisible braces by combining a network of dental partners with a technology stack that allows providers to monitor patients’ progress while reducing the number of clinic visits they need to make.</p>
<p>First, potential customers send a photo of their teeth to Zenyum to determine if ZenyumClear or ZenyumClear Plus will work for them. If so, they have an in-person consultation with a dentists, including an X-ray and 3D scan. This costs between $120 to $170 SGD, which is paid to the clinic. After their invisible braces are ready, the patient returns to the dentist for a fitting. Then dentists can monitor the progress of their patient’s teeth through Zenyum’s app, only asking them to make another in-person visit if necessary.</p>
<p>ZenyumClear is currently available in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan, with more markets planned.</p>
<p>Sequoia India principal Pieter Kemps told TechCrunch, “There are 300M customers in Zenyum’s core markets—Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Taiwan—who have increased disposable income for beauty. We believe spend on invisible braces will grow significantly from the current penetration, but what it requires is strong execution on a complex product to become the preferred choice for consumers. That is where Zenyum shines: excellent execution, leading to new products, best-in-class NPS, fast growth, and strong economics. This Series B is a testament to that, and of the belief in the large opportunity down the road.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thousands of electric vehicle charging stations will be built around the country over the next decade. <a href="https://www.chargerhelp.com/">ChargerHelp!</a>, founded in January 2020 by Kameale C. Terry and Evette Ellis, wants to make sure they stay up and running.</p>
<p>The idea for the on-demand repair app for EV charging stations came to Terry when she was working at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/electric-vehicle-charging-software-ev-connect-raises-12-million/">EV Connect</a>, where she held a number of roles including director of programs and head of customer experience. She noticed long wait times to fix non-electrical issues at charging stations due to the industry practice to use electrical contractors.</p>
<p>“When the stations went down we really couldn’t get anyone on site because most of the issues were communication issues, vandalism, firmware updates or swapping out a part — all things that were not electrical,” Terry said in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After Terry quit her job to start ChargerHelp!, she joined the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, where she developed a first-of-its-kind EV Network Technician Training Curriculum. Shortly after, Terry and Ellis were accepted into Elemental Excelerator’s startup incubator and have landed contracts with major EV charging network providers like EV Connect and SparkCharge.</p>
<p>The company uses a workforce-development approach to hiring, meaning that they only hire in cohorts. Workers receive full training, earn two safety licenses, are guaranteed a wage of $30 an hour and receive shares in the startup, Terry said.</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that Kameale Terry will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</strong></a>, a one-day virtual event that is scheduled June 9. We’ll be covering a lot of ground with Terry, from how she developed her EV repair curriculum to what she sees in the company’s future.</p>
<p>Each year TechCrunch brings together founders, investors, CEOs and engineers who are working on all things transportation and mobility. If it moves people and packages from Point A to Point B, we cover it. This year’s agenda is filled with leaders in the mobility space who are shaping the future of transportation, from EV charging to autonomous vehicles to urban air taxis.</p>
<p>Among the growing list of speakers are <strong>Rimac Automobili</strong> founder <strong>Mate Rimac</strong>,  <strong>Revel Transit</strong> CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong><strong>, community organizer,</strong> <strong>transportation </strong>consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Remix/Via</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong>, who will come together to discuss how (and if) urban mobility can increase equity while still remaining a viable business.</p>
<p>Other guests include <strong>Motional</strong>’s President and CEO <strong>Karl Iagnemma</strong>, <strong>Aurora </strong>co-founder and CEO <strong>Chris Urmson</strong>,<strong> GM</strong>‘s VP of Global Innovation <strong>Pam Fletcher</strong>, <strong>Scale AI</strong> CEO <strong>Alexandr Wang</strong>, <strong>Joby Aviation</strong> founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and<strong> LinkedIn</strong> founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong> (whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby), investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Ventures</strong> and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of <strong>Construct Capital</strong>, <strong>Zoox</strong> co-founder and CTO <strong>Jesse Levinson</strong>.</p>
<p>We also recently announced a panel dedicated to China’s robotaxi industry, featuring three female leaders from Chinese AV startups: <strong>AutoX</strong>’s COO<strong> Jewel Li</strong>, <strong>Huan Sun</strong>, general manager of Momenta Europe with <strong>Momenta</strong>, and <strong>WeRide</strong>’s VP of Finance<strong> Jennifer Li</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t wait to book your tickets to TC Sessions: Mobility as prices go up at the door. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grab your passes</a> right now and hear from today’s biggest mobility leaders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>For my American readers, you might be traveling — perhaps for the first time in more than a year — because of the Memorial Day holiday. While Memorial Day is meant to honor members of the U.S. military who died while serving, the three-day weekend has become the unofficial kick off to summer. This year, those traveling by car, truck or SUV will be met by the most expensive Memorial Day weekend gas prices since 2014, according to AAA. The organization also estimates that 37 million Americans will travel by plane and automobile over the holiday — a 60% increase over the same period last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Be safe out on these busy roads, frens.</p>
<p><strong>One story to highlight</strong>: Mark Harris dug into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/the-financial-pickle-facing-elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-system/">contracts for the Las Vegas Loop System</a>. He found that restrictions put in place by Nevada regulators are making it difficult for The Boring Company to meet contractual targets for its LVCC Loop, Elon Musk’s first underground transportation system. Shortly after publication, Steve Hill, president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), tweeted that a Loop test this week, with a few hundred participants, had demonstrated its planned 4,400 passenger per hour capacity, which could release $13 million in construction funds currently being held back. While this bodes well for TBC, the story lays out a number of other issues that could pose a challenge for the company. We will continue to dig into this story of tunnels and transport.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now a request, dear reader. We&#8217;re a bit more than a week away from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>, a one-day virtual event scheduled for June 9 that is bringing together some of the best and brightest minds in transportation, including <strong>Mate Rimac</strong> of Rimac Automobili, <strong>Pam Fletcher</strong> of vp of global innovation at GM, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, Joby Aviation founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and LinkedIn founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>, whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby, and investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of Urban Innovation Fund, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of Autotech Ventures and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of Construct Capital.</p>

<p>Micromobility rivals <strong>Bird</strong> and <strong>Lime</strong> have come out with news this week that they&#8217;re both marketing as sustainability initiatives. Let&#8217;s start with Bird.</p>
<p>Bird has unveiled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/next-gen-bird-three-scooter-comes-with-bigger-battery-and-better-software/">next-generation scooter,</a> the Bird Three, that it will unveil in New York and Berlin this summer. It&#8217;s got a longer-range battery with 1kWh capacity and an improved diagnostic monitoring system to keep the battery lasting as long as possible. Bird says its better, smarter battery means it&#8217;s ultimately a more sustainable scooter because it has a longer life and needs to be charged a lot less.</p>
<p>Ideally, a better battery and better software will also help produce a longer-lasting vehicle so that Bird can cut down on depreciation and maintenance costs, which have really not helped the company in its push for profitability. Last week, Bird announced a SPAC merger with Switchback II. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">regulatory filings</a> that accompanied the announcement demonstrate just how difficult it is to turn a profit given the unit economics of shared scooters.</p>
<p>Lime is similarly positioning its updated subscription service, Lime Prime, as a sustainable initiative. With each new Prime member sign up, Lime promises to plant a tree through One Tree Planted. But more importantly, the subscription service helps the regular Lime rider perhaps save a bit of money. Members have access to waived unlock fees on any vehicle, and in markets with no start fees, the benefit will be 25% off the ride price. Additionally, riders can get free 30 minute reservations on any vehicle.</p>
<h2>Two-wheel swag news</h2>
<p><strong>Zaiser Motors</strong> announced the launch of its <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/19/2232729/0/en/Electric-motorcycle-manufacturer-Zaiser-Motors-launches-equity-crowdfunding-campaign-on-Wefunder.html">Wefunder campaign</a> to raise funds for development and production of its Electrocycle. It&#8217;s a good-lookin&#8217; vehicle, charcoal-black with a design that breaks away from a super traditional gasoline-era style and looks more like something a small Batman might ride. All of the components are designed to be recyclable within the first 10 years of production, the company says. The Electrocycle has 300 miles of range, swappable batteries and is less than $25,000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in scooter world, the <strong>Scotsman</strong>, a Silicon Valley-based electric scooter brand, has unveiled a scooter that&#8217;s 3D printed entirely in carbon fiber composite. And I don&#8217;t just mean some parts are composite. The whole frame, the handlebars, the stem and the baseboard are all made of this strong, sustainable, lightweight material. It also means the scooters are highly customizable, each frame printed depending on the owner&#8217;s height, weight, arm and leg lengths and riding position. At a starting price of $2,999, it&#8217;s not cheap, but that might be a signal from the industry that scooters are increasingly become viable transport options and not just toys. You can <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scotsman-electric-scooter#/">pre-order here</a>.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The march of IPOs appears to picking up pace. For instance, <strong>Full Truck Alliance</strong>, the Chinese digital freight platform known as Manbang Group, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1838413/000119312521175480/d260023df1.htm#rom260023_17">filed for an IPO</a>. The filing didn&#8217;t specify the exact amount it was aiming to raise. Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported that the company wants to <a href="https://whbl.com/2021/05/28/chinas-full-truck-alliance-files-for-1-5-billion-u-s-ipo/">raise up to $1.5 billion</a>, which would give it a valuation of $20 billion.</p>
<p>Full Truck Alliance&#8217;s S-1 provides a number of interesting details, including the how much money can be captured by effectively connecting truckers with shippers. The company reported that about 20% of all China&#8217;s heavy-duty and medium-duty truckers fulfilled shipping orders on our platform in 2020. (More than 2.8 million truckers fulfilled shipping orders on its platform last year.) Full Truck Alliance said last year it facilitated 71.7 million fulfilled orders with a gross transaction value of RMB173.8 billion (US$26.6 billion).  The first quarter number show it is growing. In the first quarter, the company had  22.1 million fulfilled orders, a 170.2% increase from the same period.</p>
<p>Full Truck Alliance raised $3.6 billion in private funding, most recently last fall at an $11.7 billion valuation, from firms like SoftBank Vision Fund (22.2% pre-IPO stake), Sequoia Capital China (7.2%), Permira, Tencent, Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners and Baillie Gifford.</p>
<p>The IPO about six months since the company raised $1.7 billion in a funding round that included backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital China, Permira, Fidelity, Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners, Tencent and Jack Ma&#8217;s YF Capital. A look at the S-1 shows that the principal shareholders are Softbank with a 22.2% stake, followed by 8.9% held by Full Load Logistics, a limited liability company owned by Full Truck Alliance CEO Hui Zhang. Sequoia has a 7.2% stake and Master Quality Group Limited, another organization controlled by Zhang, hold 6.6% of shares.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>E2open Parent Holdings Inc.</strong> said it will acquire logistics execution platform BluJay Solution, <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/e2open-to-acquire-blujay-solutions-deal-valued-at-1-7b">Freightwaves reported</a>. The deal could be valued at $1.7 billion, consisting of $760 million in cash and 72.4 million shares.</p>
<p><strong>First Move Capital</strong>, the Boulder-based venture firm that has invested in used car marketplaces Frontier Auto Group and Vroom as well as mobility-as-a-service startup Via, has c<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/fm-capital-steps-up-automotive-investments-with-new-150m-fund/">losed a new $150 million fund</a> that will focus on the automotive and transportation sectors. Proceeds from the round will be exclusively allocated to new investments; seven have already been made, including into autonomous vehicle startup Gatik, cloud-based automotive retail platform Tekion and e-commerce startup Revolution Parts.</p>
<p><strong>Hydra Energy</strong> received CAD$15 million ($12 million) from Just Business to expand beyond pilots and deliver hydrogen-powered trucking, the company announced. This funding is to support the further development of Hydra&#8217;s initial waste hydrogen capture plant in British Columbia, its fueling infrastructure and conversion kits. The Canadian company has raised CAD $22 million (USD $17.2 million) to date. One other update worth sharing, Hydra&#8217;s flagship hydrogen-as-a-service project, is scheduled to break ground later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Miles</strong>, the German car-sharing service has received investment from Delivery Hero CFO Emmanuel Thomassin, HelloFresh CFO Christian Gärtner, Chargepoint CFO Rex Jackson as well as Norwegian top manager Stine Rolstad Brenna. Thomassin has joined the company&#8217;s advisory board. The company disclosed to TechCrunch that it generated 20 million euros ($24.39 million) of revenue in 2020, quadruple the amount from the previous year. The results helped the company achieve profitability in October 2020. Miles is now focused on expansion. In the first four months in 2021, the company launched electric vehicles and expanded its car fleet to Munich. Miles intends to grow beyond Germany and is currently examining the best markets to launch in.</p>
<p><strong>MotoRefi </strong>raised another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/goldman-sachs-leads-45m-investment-into-auto-fintech-startup-motorefi/">$45 million in a round</a> led by Goldman Sachs just five months after investors poured $10 million into the fintech startup to help turbocharge its auto refinancing business. While the company didn&#8217;t give me specifics on its revenue — CEO Kevin Bennett cited a 7x growth year-over-year but didn&#8217;t provide the baseline — it did disclose it&#8217;s on track to issue $1 billion in loans by the end of the year. That&#8217;s a fivefold increase from the same period last year.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Eye</strong>, the publicly traded Swedish company that supplies driver monitoring systems for a dozen automakers, acquired emotion-detection software startup Affectiva for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/">$73.5 million in a cash-and-stock deal</a>. The startup, which says it developed software that can detect and understand human emotion, spun out of MIT Media Lab in 2009. Since then, it has landed a number of development and proof of concept deals as well as raised capital, but it never quite reached the mass-scale production contracts.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Smart Eye comes in. Smart Eye, which has won 84 production contracts with 13 OEMs, including BMW and GM, is keen to combine with its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The companies&#8217; founders see an opportunity to expand beyond driver monitoring systems &#8212; tech that is often used in conjunction with advanced driver assistance systems to track and measure awareness &#8212; and into the rest of the vehicle. Together, the technology could help them break into the emerging &#8220;interior sensing&#8221; market, which can be used to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant&#8217;s emotional state.</p>
<p><strong>Tritium</strong>, a Brisbane-based developer and producer of direct current fast EV chargers, announced a merger agreement with a special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp. II. The deal is expected to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/ev-fast-charger-developer-tritium-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-at-1-2b-valuation/">value the company at $1.2 billion</a>. The transaction is expected to generate gross proceeds of up to $403 million. Tritium will be listed under the ticker &#8220;DCFC.&#8221;</p>
<p>This particular SPAC deal is unusual in that it does not include private investment in public equity, or PIPE &#8212; a fundraising round that typically occurs at the time of the merger and injects more capital into the company. Tritium CEO Jane Hunter told us that the company didn&#8217;t need a PIPE because DCRN is a more than $400 million SPAC and its shareholder group agreed to a minimum cash closing of just $200 million, which significantly reduces redemption risk. &#8220;Also, our revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56% since 2016 as we expand our presence in major markets where we have a significant market share, such as the U.S. and Europe,&#8221; Hunter said. &#8220;This revenue growth helps to reduce our reliance upon new funds to implement our growth strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Wejo</strong>, the connected vehicle data startup backed by GM and Palantir, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/gm-palantir-backed-wejo-to-go-public-via-spac/">plans to go public</a> through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Virtuoso Acquisition Corp. The agreement, announced in a regulator filing, will give the combined company an enterprise valuation of $800 million, which includes debt. There were earlier reports that the SPAC deal was imminent. The filing confirms the news and provides more detail.</p>
<p>The deal raises $330 million in proceeds for Wejo, including a $230 million cash contribution from Virtuoso and a $100 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Previous strategic investors Palantir and GM anchored the transaction, according to Wejo. The company did not disclose the amounts of those investments. Current shareholders will retain 64% ownership of the company, according to its investor deck.</p>

<p>Senate Republicans released their response to Joe Biden&#8217;s sweeping $2 trillion investment plan, which would earmark $174 billion for electric vehicle investments. Their proposal would shrink it down to $928 billion. And that $174B for EVs? That would be reduced to just $4 billion, under the GOP plan.</p>
<p>It seems that the main point of contention between the President and his GOP colleagues is the definition of the word &#8216;infrastructure.&#8217; Republicans are sticking to a more traditional definition, so their counterproposal still contains plenty of money for things like roads, the water system, bridges and broadband.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s plan aimed to provide consumer tax incentives and incentives for EV chargers, incentives to boost domestic manufacturing and enough funds to install at least 500,000 public charging stations across the country by 2030. A memo obtained by <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/554820-biden-holds-firm-on-climate-provisions-in-infrastructure">The Hill</a> suggests Biden intends to hold firm to his proposal, so expect further negotiations in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The Senate Finance Committee on May 26 marked up the <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Clean%20Energy%20for%20America%20Act.pdf">Clean Energy for America Act</a>, an important step before it hits the Senate floor for a vote. Among other things, the bill would remove 200,000 unit cap on tax credits for consumers buying EVs &#8212; that means the tax credit could be used toward buying a Tesla, a manufacturer that hasn&#8217;t been eligible for the credit because they&#8217;ve sold over 200,000 cars in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Debbie Stabenow</strong> (D-MI) added an amendment to the bill that would create an additional $2,500 consumer credit for vehicles assembled in the U.S. and another $2,500 for vehicles assembled in a unionized facility. If it passes, the additions would bring the maximum consumer tax credit for EVs to $12,500 &#8212; no small sum! The credits would expire in 2025. &#8220;Electric vehicles are part of our transportation future,&#8221; Sen. Stabenow said. &#8220;The question is not when they will be built, it&#8217;s where they will be built: in Asia or America?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm</strong> sold her holdings in electric bus manufacturer Proterra after Republicans criticized her for a potential conflict of interest. The GOP&#8217;s complaint arose after Biden made a virtual visit to a Proterra factory in April. The sale provided Granholm with a net gain of $1.6 million, DOE told reporters.</p>

<h2>A little bird</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896211 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif" alt="blinky cat bird green" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I hear and see things, but we&#8217;re not selfish. Let me share.</p>
<p>This week, &#8220;a little bird&#8221; is all about big employment moves and departures and how one hire is connected to a potentially massive IPO.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s kick things off with <strong>Celina Mikolajczak</strong>, the now <em>former</em> vice president of battery technology at <strong>Panasonic Energy of North America</strong>. You might recall that Mikolajczak recently took a board seat at solid state battery company <strong>QuantumScape</strong>. Welp, she is now taking a job at the company as vice president of manufacturing engineering, beginning in July. She has resigned from the board in connection with accepting the offer. In her new role, Ms. Mikolajczak will lead the transition of the Company&#8217;s tools and manufacturing processes from research and development to production, <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-170075/">QuantumScape said in a regularly filing</a>.</p>
<p>Mikolajczak has a long history researching and developing better lithium-ion batteries. Her technical consulting practice at Exponent focused on lithium-ion cell and battery safety and quality. She then took a senior management position at <strong>Tesla</strong> that was focused on cell quality and materials engineering. During her time at Tesla, Mikolajczak developed the battery cells and packs for Tesla&#8217;s Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Roadster Refresh.</p>
<p>After leaving Tesla, Mikolajczak went on to serve as director of engineering focused on battery development for rideshare vehicles at Uber Technologies. And in 2019, she joined Panasonic Energy of North America, where she is vice president of battery technology. While at Panasonic, Mikolajczak led a team of more than 200 engineers and other technical staff to improve lithium-ion cell manufacturing and to bring the latest cell technologies to mass production for Tesla at the Gigafactory facility in Sparks, Nevada.</p>
<p>Speaking of <strong>Tesla</strong> &#8230; it looks like <strong>Scott Sims</strong>, director of engineering, left the company this month. His title doesn&#8217;t quite capture his role. Sims was the person leading the design and engineering for vehicle user interfaces, streaming, video games and mobile applications. Importantly, he was responsible for cloud computing as it related to the Tesla mobile app, a critical tool for any owner.</p>
<p>Finally, the big news on Friday (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/electric-truck-maker-rivian-is-said-to-select-ipo-underwriters">via Bloomberg</a>) is that <strong>Rivian</strong> has selected underwriters for an initial public offering. The company could seek an eye-popping value of $70 billion. I have confirmed some (but not all) of Bloomberg&#8217;s reporting. Obviously big news that I&#8217;ll be watching and digging into. I had heard rumbling about a potential Rivian IPO, but Bloomberg put together the critical deets.</p>
<p>To me, the biggest indication that Rivian was getting ready to make a move was <strong>Ger Dwyer</strong> taking the vp of business finance position at the company, which he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gerard-dwyer-5819832_the-next-chapter-this-is-my-first-week-activity-6803492501547307008-REU4/">posted about on LinkedIn</a>. You might recall, that I scooped the news a couple of weeks ago that Dwyer was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/waymos-cfo-and-head-of-automotive-partnerships-are-leaving-the-autonomous-vehicle-company/">leaving his post as CFO at <strong>Waymo</strong></a>. I noted at the time that Dwyer&#8217;s departure comes at a time when the demand for CFOs has rocketed alongside the continuous string of public offerings, including those done via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies.</p>

<p>Loads and loads of news. Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/developing-the-aurora-driver-to-move-millions-of-goods">published a blog post</a> that gives a few new details on its testing and self-driving trucks strategy in Texas. The autonomous vehicle company said its first commercial pilots will move goods on several &#8220;middle-mile&#8221; routes in Texas. A safety driver will be behind the wheel of these self-driving trucks, which will drive autonomously between hubs. The terminal or hub system is one that other AV companies have adopted — at least for now. The idea is that loads can be consolidated, which would theoretically make operations more efficient. Aurora did add, that &#8220;for shippers and carriers with existing hubs and large volumes of freight, we expect to ultimately drive the complete route with no need for an intermediate consolidation point.&#8221;</p>
<p>One other item that jumped out to me: the company is expanding into a second office in Texas, suggesting that they&#8217;re scaling up, at least in terms of people.</p>
<p><strong>Germany&#8217;s</strong> lower house of parliament <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/germany-gives-greenlight-to-driverless-vehicles-on-public-roads/">adopted legislation</a> that will allow driverless vehicles on public roads by 2022, laying out a path for companies to deploy robotaxis and delivery services in the country at scale. While autonomous testing is currently permitted in Germany, this would allow operations of driverless vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The bill still needs to pass through the upper chamber of parliament, or the Bundesrat. Included in the bill are possible initial applications for self-driving cars on German roads, such as public passenger transport, business and supply trips, logistics, company shuttles that handle employee traffic and trips between medical centers and retirement homes.</span></p>
<p><strong>PAVE</strong>, which stands for Partners for Autonomous Vehicle Education, piloted a workshop with local governments earlier this month throughout Ohio. The educational workshop, which was done in partnership with Drive Ohio, wasn&#8217;t open to the public. But my Autonocast podcast co-host Ed Niedermeyer, who also happens to be director of communications for PAVE, gave me the inside scoop on what went down.</p>
<p>PAVE says it doesn&#8217;t do any kind of policy advocacy; instead the aim is to arm public policymakers with the facts they need to make good policy. This pilot helped PAVE lay a foundation for a curriculum that can be used elsewhere; that might seem trivial, but the complexity of issues around AVs makes these workshops with elected officials potentially powerful tool.</p>
<p>Ed told me that one of the main challenges was educating on potentially controversial topics, like policy and regulation, &#8220;where we have to get facts across without imparting biases.&#8221; He noted that the organization&#8217;s public sector and academic advisory councils were both helpful as neutral authorities. Finally, he said that one of the most practical education PAVE did was around the best practices that its members and advisors have developed in early AV deployments.</p>
<p><strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, the U.S.-based self-driving truck startup, is partnering with South Korean conglomerate SK Inc. to explore the possibility of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-partnering-with-sk-group-to-expand-into-asia/">deploying its autonomous vehicle technology</a> in Asia. While Kodiak co-founder and CEO Don Burnette couched the initial agreement as a first step toward a commercial enterprise in Asia, the reach of SK shouldn&#8217;t be discounted. SK Inc., a holding company of SK Group, has more than 120 operating companies, including ones connected to the logistics industry.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of the partnership is to sell and distribute Kodiak&#8217;s self-driving technology in the region. Kodiak will examine how it can use SK&#8217;s products, components and technology for its autonomous system, including artificial intelligence microprocessors and advanced emergency braking systems. Both companies have also agreed to work together to provide fleet management services for customers in Asia.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong>, fresh off its splashy F-150 Lightning electric truck reveal, announced it is pushing its investment in EVs up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">$30 billion by 2025</a>, up from a previous spend of $22 billion by 2023. The company announced the fresh cashflow into its EV and battery development strategy, dubbed Ford+, during its investor day.</p>
<p>The company said it expects 40% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030. Ford sold 6,614 Mustang Mach-Es in the U.S. in Q1, and since it unveiled its F-150 Lightning last week, the company says it has already amassed 70,000 customer reservations.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai</strong> held the North American reveal of the upcoming all-electric Ioniq 5 crossover. One new detail that I found interesting: Hyundai developed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/hyundai-is-launching-in-car-payments-in-the-all-electric-ioniq-5/">in-car payment system</a> that will debut in the Ioniq 5. The feature will offer drivers the ability to find and pay for EV charging, food and parking. When the vehicle comes to North America in fall 2021, the payments system will launch with Dominoes, ParkWhiz and Chargehub.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors&#8217;</strong> cash-rich SPAC dreams have turned out to be nothin&#8217; more than wishes, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">Alex Wilhelm and Aria Alamalhodaei reported</a>. The upshot: a disappointing first-quarter earnings that was a pile-up of red-ink-stained negativity. The lowlights include higher-than-expected forecasted expenses, a need to raise more capital and lower-than-anticipated production of its Endurance vehicle this year &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000. In short, the company is set to consume more cash than the street expected and is further from mass production of its first vehicle than promised.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Motors</strong> revealed the in-cabin tech of its upcoming electric luxury Air sedan. I spoke to Derek Jenkins, who heads up design at Lucid, and he provided a detailed tour of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/lucid-motors-reveals-all-the-tech-inside-its-all-electric-air-sedan/">all the tech in the vehicle</a>. It goes far beyond the curved 34-inch display and second touchscreen, which received much of the attention. The user experience, particularly the underlying software, matters in all cars. But it can be the death of an electric vehicle model if not done properly.</p>
<p>It appears Lucid is on the right track. I won&#8217;t really know until I&#8217;m able to test the Air. Let&#8217;s hope that is soon.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> has delayed deliveries of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-the-r1t-launch-edition-by-one-month/">R1T Launch Edition</a>, the limited edition release of its first series of &#8220;electric adventure vehicles,&#8221; by a month. Customers who preordered can now expect to start receiving their pickup trucks in July instead of June, with Launch Edition deliveries to be completed by spring 2022. The one-month delay was due to a combination of small issues, including delays on shipping containers, the ongoing chip shortage as well as ensuring the servicing piece is properly set up. It&#8217;s worth noting that Rivian told me that it has been largely unaffected by the chip shortage compared to the rest of the industry because its products don&#8217;t require as many as other vehicles on the market today.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> had a number of news items this week, so I&#8217;ll just point to the most notable ones. Tesla has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/tesla-china-user-data-storage/">established a data center</a> in China to carry out the &#8220;localization of data storage,&#8221; with plans to add more data facilities in the future, the company announced through its account on microblogging platform Weibo. All data generated by Tesla vehicles sold in mainland China will be kept domestically. The move was in response to new requirements drafted by the Chinese government to regulate how cameras- and sensors-enabled carmakers collect and utilize data. One of the requirements states that &#8220;personal or important data should be stored within the [Chinese] territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, two safety-related pieces of Tesla news that seem in opposition to each other.</p>
<p>First, Tesla started delivering Model 3 and Model Y vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america/">without radar</a>, fulfilling a vision of CEO Elon Musk to only use cameras combined with machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and other active safety features. The decision has prompted blowback though from the National Traffic Highway and Safety Administration, Consumer Reports and IIHS over safety concerns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tesla finally — and after loud and frequent urging from industry and safety advocates, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot/">activated the in-cabin camera</a> in new Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. The camera will be used as a driver monitoring system. Tesla has been criticized for not activating the driver monitoring system within its vehicles even as evidence mounted that owners were misusing the system. Owners have posted dozens of videos on YouTube and TikTok abusing its advanced driver assistance system known as Autopilot &#8212; some of whom have filmed themselves sitting in the backseat as the vehicle drives along the highway.</p>
<h3>Other nugs (no not that kind)</h3>
<p><strong> Apex.AI</strong> hired Paul Balciunas as its CFO. Balciunas was the former CFO of Canoo. He also was an executive at Deutsche Bank, where he acted as a lead underwriter of the initial public offering for Tesla in 2010, and has since focused on auto tech and new mobility players.</p>
<p><strong>Blyncsy</strong>, a Utah-based startup movement and data intelligence company launched an AI-powered technology called Payver, that will use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/utah-dot-pilots-blyncsys-ai-powered-road-maintenance-technology/">crowdsourced video data</a> to give transport agencies up-to-date information on which roads require maintenance and improvements. Blyncsy is offering this service to governments at a reduced cost and with no long-term commitment. Utah&#8217;s DOT will be the first to pilot the program beginning June 1, deploying Payver in the Salt Lake County region, which covers more than 350 road miles. Blyncsy will be announcing other pilots in different states over the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Scale AI</strong> hired Mark Valentine to head up its federal-focused division. Valentine comes with experience and connections. He was  a commander in the U.S. Air Force, senior military advisor to FEMA and most recently, GM of national security for Microsoft. He will lead Scale&#8217;s government partnership efforts.</p>
<p>Scale has also hired Michael Kratsios, the former CTO of the White House, as managing director and head of strategy. The company said he is focused on accelerating the development of AI across industries. Michael joined at the end of Q1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://june.so">June</a>, a new startup that wants to make it easier to create analytics dashboards and generate reports even if you’re not a product analytics expert. June is built on top of your <a href="https://segment.com">Segment</a> data. Like many no-code startups, it uses templates and a graphical interface so that non-technical profiles can start using it.</p>
<p>“What we do today is instant analytics and that’s why we’re building it on top of Segment,” co-founder and CEO Enzo Avigo told me. “It lets you access data much more quickly.”</p>
<p>Segment acts as the data collection and data repository for your analytics. After that, you can start playing with your data in June. Eventually, June plans to diversify its data sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our long-term vision is to become the Airtable of analytics,” Avigo said.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a>, June may look familiar. The company has built a template library to help you get started. For instance, June helps you track user retention, active users, your acquisition funnel, engagement, feature usage, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159290" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159290" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png" alt="" width="1024" height="583" class="size-full wp-image-2159290" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=2048,1165 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159290" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> June</p></div></p>
<p>Once you pick a template, you can start building a report by matching data sources with templates. June automatically generates charts, sorts your user base into cohorts and shows you important metrics. You can create goals so that you receive alerts in Slack whenever something good or bad is happening.</p>
<p>Advanced users can also use June so that everyone in the team is using the same tool. They can create custom SQL queries and build a template based on those queries.</p>
<p>The company raised a seed round of $1.85 million led by Point Nine. Y Combinator, Speedinvest, Kima Ventures, eFounders and Base Case also participated, as well as several business angels.</p>
<p>Prior to June, the startup’s two co-founders worked for Intercom. They noticed that the analytics tool was too hard to use for many people. They didn’t rely on analytics to make educated decisions.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of companies using June every week and that number is growing by 10% per week. Right now, the product is free but the company plans to charge based on usage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is already underway on building its first floating spaceport platform, and the plan is for it to start hosting launches as early as next year. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared those details on the progress of its build for Deimos, one of two converted oil rigs that SpaceX purchased earlier this year in order to transform them into floating launch and landing sites for its forthcoming Starship reusable rocket.</p>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s purchase of the two rigs at the beginning of this year was for the creation of Deimos and Phobos, two floating spaceports named after the moons of Mars. They&#8217;ll act as offshore staging grounds for Starship launch activities, and the name is appropriate because the eventual plan is to have Starship provide transport for both people and goods to and from the red planet.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ocean spaceport Deimos is under construction for launch next year <a href="https://t.co/WJQka399c7">https://t.co/WJQka399c7</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399088815705399305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk and SpaceX have previously shared their vision for a future in which spaceports like Deimos are positioned within convenient reach of major hubs around the world, making it possible for SpaceX to operate a globe-spanning network of hypersonic point-to-point travel using Starships ferrying people from destinations as far flung as Beijing to New York in around 30 minutes. Before that, however, SpaceX will be looking to conduct orbital flight testing of the still in-development Starship, and its accompany booster, the Super Heavy.</p>
<p>Musk said earlier this year that it could b<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/spacexs-floating-oil-rig-spaceship-launch-pad-could-be-operating-later-this-year-according-to-elon-musk/">egin flying rockets from its offshore platforms as early as the end of 2021</a>. This new timeline indicates that rosy estimate has been pushed, which is pretty standard for the multi-CEO. The company has recently made good progress in its Starship program, however, with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/spacex-successfully-launches-and-lands-its-starship-prototype-rocket/">successful high-altitude launch and landing test</a> at its Texas &#8216;Starbase&#8217; development site.</p>
<p>SpaceX is now in the process of getting ready for its first orbital flight test, which will include flying Starship atop Super Heavy for the first time, and a recovery of the Starship following the test after it splashes down off the coast of Hawaii. It&#8217;s now doing longer fire Raptor engine ground tests to get ready for that next big milestone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of thousands of Chinese students enrolled in overseas schools are stranded as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt life and airlines worldwide. Learning at home in China, they all face one challenge: Their school websites and other academic resources load excruciatingly slowly because all web traffic has to pass through the country&#8217;s censorship apparatus known as the &#8220;great firewall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotting a business opportunity, Alibaba&#8217;s cloud unit worked on connecting students in China to their university portals abroad through an <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/partner/fortinet">arrangement</a> with American cybersecurity solutions provider Fortinet, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-cloud-vpn-idUSKCN24O356">reported</a> last July, saying Tencent had a similar product.</p>
<p>Details of Tencent&#8217;s offering have come to light. An app called &#8220;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E9%95%BF%E9%B9%85%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F-%E8%85%BE%E8%AE%AF%E6%B5%B7%E5%A4%96%E5%AD%A6%E6%9C%AF%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F%E5%99%A8/id1548408161">Chang&#8217;e Education Acceleration</a>&#8221; debuted on Apple&#8217;s App Store in March, helping to speed up loading time for a selection of overseas educational services. It describes itself in a mouthful: &#8220;An online learning free accelerator from Tencent, with a mission to provide internet acceleration and search services in educational resources to students and researchers at home and abroad.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alibaba said its technology works to speed up network connections for students while the optional VPN solutions are provided by partners including Fortinet.</p>
<p>Chang&#8217;e is not a VPN, Tencent told TechCrunch. The firm didn&#8217;t say how it defines VPN or explain how Chang&#8217;e works technically. Tencent said Chang&#8217;e rolled out on the app&#8217;s official website in October.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;VPN&#8221; is a loaded term in China as it often implies illegally bypassing the &#8220;great firewall.&#8221; People refer to its euphemism &#8220;accelerator&#8221; or &#8220;scientific internet surfing tool&#8221; otherwise. When Chang&#8217;e is switched on, iPhone&#8217;s VPN status is shown as &#8220;on&#8221;, according to a test by TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159263" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159263" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2159263" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="604" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159263" class="wp-caption-text">Tencent&#8217;s Chang&#8217;e website &#8216;accelerator&#8217; helps Chinese students stuck home get on their school websites faster. Screenshot: TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>On the welcome page, Chang&#8217;e asks users to pick from eight countries, including the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., for &#8220;acceleration&#8221;. It also shows the latency time and expected speed increased for each region.</p>
<p>Once a country is picked, Chang&#8217;e shows a list of educational resources that users can visit on the app&#8217;s built-in browser. They include the websites of 79 top universities, mostly U.S. and the U.K. ones; team collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, Trello and Slack; remote-learning platforms UDemy, Coursera, Lynda and Khan Academy; research networks such as SSRN and JSTOR; programming and engineering communities like Stack Overflow, Codeacademy and IEEE; economics databases from the World Bank and OECD; as well as resources for medical students like PubMed and Lancet.</p>
<p>Many of these services are not blocked in China but load slowly on mainland China behind the &#8220;great firewall.&#8221; Users can request sites not already on the list to be included.</p>

<p>The offerings from Alibaba and Tencent are indicative of the inadvertent consequences caused by Beijing&#8217;s censorship system designed to block information deemed illegal or harmful to China&#8217;s national interest. Universities, research institutes, multinational corporations and exporters are often forced to seek censorship circumvention apps for what the authorities would consider innocuous purposes.</p>
<p>VPN providers have to obtain the government&#8217;s green light to legally operate in China and users of licensed VPN services are <a href="http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2011/content_1860856.htm">prohibited from</a> browsing websites thought of us endangering China&#8217;s national security. In 2017, Apple removed hundreds of unlicensed VPN apps from its China App Store at Beijing&#8217;s behest.</p>
<p>In October, TechCrunch reported that the VPN app and browser <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/new-chinese-browser-lets-users-get-around-great-firewall/">Tuber gave Chinese users a rare glimpse</a> into the global internet ecosystem of Facebook, YouTube, Google and other mainstream apps, but the app was removed shortly after the article was published.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more than 400 million Arabic speakers globally and that number isn&#8217;t slowing down anytime soon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Arabic, to most people, is a tough language even to those who speak it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/what-makes-arabic-hard-and-why-that-shouldnt-stop-you-from-learning-it/">Duolingo</a>, someone fluent in Egyptian Arabic might not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> understand Yemeni Arabic speakers because of the vast difference in dialect</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While individuals can easily navigate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dialects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it can be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hard for them to find tailored Arabic content essential for everyday life</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.almentor.net/en/mentor/Ihab-Fikry">Dr Ihab Fikry</a> and <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-mostafa-kamel">Ibrahim Kamel</a> founded <a href="https://www.almentor.net/en/home">Almentor.net</a> in 2016 as an online video learning platform to compensate for this lack of online learning content for Arabic speakers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In collaboration with hundreds of leaders, educators, and experts, the platform offers courses and talks in various fields like health, humanities, technology, entrepreneurship, business management, lifestyle, drama, sports, corporate communication, and digital media</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Almentor closed a $3.5 million seed round and two years ago raised $4.5 million Series A led by Egypt&#8217;s Sawari Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this Series B investment, the Dubai-based edtech company has raised $14.5 million in total. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco and Paris-based VC firm Partech led the financing round with participation from Sawari Ventures, fellow Series A investor Egypt Ventures, and Sango Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almentor provides Arab learners with the necessary skills </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">crucially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed to advance their professional careers and personal lives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform claims to have the biggest continuous learning library in the region and one of the biggest worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With offices in Dubai, Cairo, and Saudi Arabia, its video content </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is developed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in-house and made in Arabic and English</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The vision and reason behind starting Almentor is we understand that in our region of more than 100 million people, of which 90% cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">properly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learn with any other language other than Arabic,&#8221; Fikry said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So we wanted to have a cutting-edge state of the art platform that will change people&#8217;s ideology and help them be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">objective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and focus based on topics that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be taught</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as prodigious learning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For first-time products like Almentor, it can be hard to get both investors and customers on board</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO Fikry, the first challenge was to convince the investment community in the MENA region that Almentor was creating a new industry in video e-learning that &#8220;had lots of potential to power tools in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almentor&#8217;s business is an intersection of education, media, and technology. Its offerings </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are dissected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into three: the flagship B2C product, a white-label B2B model for blue-chip companies, and the last, which Fikry calls the &#8216;special project&#8217; for governmental bodies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its B2C product, Almentor sells courses to users for $20-$30 of which they get to keep for a lifetime. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fikry says that in June, the company is planning to introduce a subscription-based model where users can have unlimited access to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its 12,000 video content for a fee to its more than 1 million registered users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2159243 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?w=680" alt="Almentor" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png 1201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B model is where Almentor opens its library to companies to customize their content for employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These videos are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tutorials or training needed to thrive at work, and since 2016, Almentor has executed 78 deals with partner companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special project&#8217;s model highlights Almentor&#8217;s work with the government. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One time, the company had a partnership with the Egyptian government to upskill the country&#8217;s movie industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has completed 11 more similar special projects since launching five years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across all three models, Fikry says Almentor has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivered more than 2 million learning experiences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company wants to improve content production and quality and educate people in the MENA region on why they need the product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are now leading the continuous video learning industry in the Arab region, and we have a responsibility that goes beyond our ambitions for Almentor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our responsibility now is to work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unceasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve the industry as a whole in the Arab region, and this can only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be achieved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through gaining the confidence of the Arab learners in the value, professionalism and impartiality of the content provided by the platform and working in line with the global learning trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment for Partech, general partner Cyril Collon said: “Since our first interaction, we have been very impressed by Ihab and Ibrahim, two fantastic mission-driven entrepreneurs who have been executing on a bold vision since 2016, and who built the leading Arabic self-learning go-to content provider in the Middle East and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We are looking forward to supporting the company in its next phase of growth to serve the 430 million Arabic-speaking population and expand access to on-demand cutting-edge personal learning &amp; developments options</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cloud kitchens are already meant to reduce the burden of infrastructure on food and beverage brands by providing them with centralized facilities to prepare meals for delivery. This means the responsibility falls on cloud kitchen operators to make sure they have enough locations to meet demand from F&amp;B clients, while ensuring fast deliveries to end customers.</p>
<p>Indonesian network <a href="https://dishserve.com/">DishServe</a> has figured out a way to make running cloud kitchen networks even more asset-light. Launched by budget hotel startup RedDoorz’s former chief operating officer, DishServe partners with home kitchens instead of renting or buying its own facilities. It currently works with almost 100 home kitchens in Jakarta, and focuses on small- to medium-sized F&amp;B brands, serving as their last-mile delivery network. Launched in fall 2020, DishServe has raised an undisclosed amount of pre-seed funding from Insignia Ventures Partners.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;RedDoorz raises $70M to expand its budget hotel network in Southeast Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/18/reddoorz-seriesc/embed/#?secret=SYe1N1vmW2" data-secret="SYe1N1vmW2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>DishServe was founded in September 2020 by Rishabh Singhi. After leaving RedDoorz at the end of 2019, Singhi moved to New York, with plans to launch a new hospitality startup that could quickly convert any commercial space into members’ clubs like Soho House. The nascent company had already created sample pre-fabricated rooms and was about to start leasing property when the COVID-19 lockdown hit New York City in March 2020. Singhi said he went on a “soul searching spree” for a couple of months, deciding what to do and if he should return to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>He realized that since many restaurants had to switch to online orders and delivery to survive the pandemic, this could potentially be an equalizer for small F&amp;B brands that compete with larger players, like McDonald’s. But lockdowns meant that a lot of people had to pick from a limited range of restaurants close to where they lived. At the same time, Singhi saw that there were a lot of people who wanted to make more money, but couldn’t work outside of their homes, like stay-at-home moms.</p>
<p>DishServe was created to connect all three sides: F&amp;B brands that want to expand without spending a lot of money, home entrepreneurs and diners hungry for more food options. Its other founders include Stefanie Irma, an early RedDoorz employee who served as its country head for the Philippines; serial entrepreneur Vinav Bhanawat; and Fathhi Mohamed, who also co-founded Sri Lankan on-demand taxi service PickMe.</p>
<p>The company works with F&amp;B brands that typically have between just one to 15 retail locations, and want to increase their deliveries without opening new outlets. DishServe’s clients also include cloud kitchen companies who use its home kitchen network for last-mile distribution to expand their delivery coverage and catering services.</p>
<p>“The brands don’t to have to incur any upfront costs, and it’s a cheaper way to distribute as well because they don’t have to pay for electricity, plumbing and other things like that,” said Singhi. “And for agents, it gives them a chance to earn money from their homes.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hangry, an Indonesian cloud kitchen startup with plans to become a global F&#038;B company, closes $13M Series A&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/hangry-an-indonesian-cloud-kitchen-startup-with-plans-to-become-a-global-fb-company-closes-13m-series-a/embed/#?secret=88i440K97S" data-secret="88i440K97S" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Before adding a home kitchen to its network, DishServe screens applicants by asking them to send in a series of photos, then doing an in-person check. If a kitchen is accepted, DishServe upgrades it so it has the same equipment and functionality as the other home kitchens in its network. The company covers the cost of the conversion process, which usually takes about three hours and costs $500 USD, and maintains ownership of the equipment, taking it back if a kitchen decided to stop working with DishServe. Singhi said DishServe is usually able to recover the cost of a conversion four months after a kitchen begins operating.</p>
<p>Home kitchens start out by serving DishServe’s own white-label brand as a trial run before it opens to other brands. Each can serve up to three additional brands at a time.</p>
<p>One important thing to note is that DishServe’s home kitchens, which are usually run by one person, don’t actually cook any food. Ingredients are provided by F&amp;B brands, and home kitchen operators follow a standard set of procedures to heat, assemble and package meals for pick-up and delivery.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159237" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159237" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2159237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png" alt="Screenshots of DishServe's apps for home kitchen operators and customers" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DS-Screenshots.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2159237" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshots of DishServe&#8217;s apps for home kitchen operators and customers</p></div></p>
<p>DishServe makes sure standard operating procedures and hygiene standards are being maintained through frequent online audits. Agents, or kitchen operators, regularly submit photos and videos of kitchens based on a checklist (i.e. food preparation area, floors, walls, hand-washing area and the inside of their freezers). Singhi said about 90% of its agents are women between the ages of 30 to 55, with an average household income of $1,000. By working with DishServe, they typically make an additional $600 a month once their kitchen is operating at full capacity with four brands. DishServe monetizes through a revenue-sharing model, charging F&amp;B brands and splitting that with its agents.</p>
<p>After joining DishServe, F&amp;B brands pick what home kitchens they want to work with, and then distribute ingredients to kitchens, using DishServe’s real-time dashboard to monitor stock. Some ingredients have a shelf life of up to six months, while perishables, like produce, dairy and eggs, are delivered daily. DishServe’s “starter pack” for onboarding new brands lets them pick pick five kitchens, but Singhi said most brands usually begin with between 10 to 20 kitchens so they can deliver to more spots in Jakarta and save money by preparing meals in bulk.</p>
<p>DishServe plans to focus on growing its network in Jakarta until at least the end of this year, before expanding into other cities. “One thing we are trying to change about the F&amp;B industry is that instead of highly-concentrated, centralized food business, like what exists today, we are decentralizing it by enabling micro-entrepreneurs to act as a distribution network,” Singhi said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cookie pop-ups getting you down? Complaints that the web is &#8216;unusable&#8217; in Europe because of frustrating and confusing &#8216;data choices&#8217; notifications that get in the way of what you&#8217;re trying to do online certainly aren&#8217;t hard to find.</p>
<p>What is hard to find is the &#8216;reject all&#8217; button that lets you opt out of non-essential cookies which power unpopular stuff like creepy ads. Yet the law says there should be an opt-out clearly offered. So people who complain that EU &#8216;regulatory bureaucracy&#8217; is the problem are taking aim at the wrong target.</p>
<p>EU law on cookie consent is clear: Web users should be offered a simple, free choice &#8212; to accept or reject.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem is that most websites simply aren&#8217;t compliant. They choose to make a mockery of the law by <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">offering a skewed choice: Typically a super simple opt-<em>in</em> (to hand them all your data) vs a highly confusing, frustrating, tedious opt-out (and sometimes even <em>no reject option at all</em>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Make no mistake: This is ignoring the law by design. Sites are choosing to try to wear people down so they can keep grabbing their data by only offering the most cynically asymmetrical &#8216;choice&#8217; possible. </span></p>
<p>However since that&#8217;s not how cookie consent is supposed to work under EU law sites that are doing this are opening themselves to large fines under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and/or ePrivacy Directive for flouting the rules.</p>
<p>See, for example, these <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">two whopping fines handed to Google and Amazon in France</a> at the back end of last year for dropping tracking cookies without consent&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JYj8ST5VxR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">France fines Google $120M and Amazon $42M for dropping tracking cookies without consent</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France fines Google $120M and Amazon $42M for dropping tracking cookies without consent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/embed/#?secret=JYj8ST5VxR" data-secret="JYj8ST5VxR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While those fines were certainly head-turning, we haven&#8217;t generally seen much EU enforcement on cookie consent &#8212; yet.</p>
<p>This is because data protection agencies have mostly taken a softly-softly approach to bringing sites into compliance. But there are signs enforcement is going to get a lot tougher. For one thing, DPAs have published detailed guidance on what proper cookie compliance looks like &#8212; so there are zero excuses for getting it wrong.</p>
<p>Some agencies had also been offering compliance grace periods to allow companies time to make the necessary changes to their cookie consent flows. But it&#8217;s now a full three years since the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection regime (GDPR) came into application. So, again, there&#8217;s no valid excuse to still have a horribly cynical cookie banner. It just means a site is trying its luck by breaking the law.</p>
<p>There is another reason to expect cookie consent enforcement to dial up soon, too: European privacy group <a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a> is today <a href="https://wecomply.noyb.eu">kicking off a major campaign</a> to clean up the trashfire of non-compliance &#8212; with a plan to file up to 10,000 complaints against offenders over the course of this year. And as part of this action it&#8217;s offering freebie guidance for offenders to come into compliance.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s announcing the first batch of 560 complaints already filed against sites, large and small, located all over the EU (33 countries are covered). noyb said the complaints target companies that range from large players like Google and Twitter to local pages &#8220;that have relevant visitor numbers&#8221;.</p>
<p>“A whole industry of consultants and designers develop crazy click labyrinths to ensure imaginary consent rates. Frustrating people into clicking ‘okay’ is a clear violation of the GDPR’s principles. Under the law, companies must facilitate users to express their choice and design systems fairly. Companies openly admit that only 3% of all users actually want to accept cookies, but more than 90% can be nudged into clicking the ‘agree’ button,&#8221; said noyb chair and long-time EU privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Instead of giving a simple yes or no option, companies use every trick in the book to manipulate users. We have identified more than fifteen common abuses. The most common issue is that there is simply no ‘reject’ button on the initial page,&#8221; he added. “We focus on popular pages in Europe. We estimate that this project can easily reach 10,000 complaints. As we are funded by donations, we provide companies a free and easy settlement option &#8212; contrary to law firms. We hope most complaints will quickly be settled and we can soon see banners become more and more privacy friendly.”</p>
<p>To scale its action, noyb developed a tool which automatically parses cookie consent flows to identify compliance problems (such as no opt out being offered at the top layer; or confusing button coloring; or bogus &#8216;legitimate interest&#8217; opt-ins, to name a few of the many chronicled offences); and automatically create a draft report which can be emailed to the offender after it&#8217;s been reviewed by a member of the not-for-profit&#8217;s legal staff.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an innovative, scalable approach to tackling systematically cynical cookie manipulation in a way that could really move the needle and clean up the trashfire of horrible cookie pop-ups.</p>
<p>noyb is even giving offenders a warning first &#8212; and a full month to clean up their ways &#8212; before it will file an official complaint with their relevant DPA (which could lead to an eye-watering fine).</p>
<p>Its first batch of complaints are focused on the OneTrust consent management platform (CMP), one of the most popular template tools used in the region &#8212; and which European privacy researchers have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/cookie-consent-tools-are-being-used-to-undermine-eu-privacy-rules-study-suggests/">previously shown</a> (cynically) provides its client base with ample options to set non-compliant choices like pre-checked boxes&#8230; Talk about taking the biscuit.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cookie consent tools are being used to undermine EU privacy rules, study suggests&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/cookie-consent-tools-are-being-used-to-undermine-eu-privacy-rules-study-suggests/embed/#?secret=DkFz84v0GJ" data-secret="DkFz84v0GJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A noyb spokeswoman said it&#8217;s started with OneTrust because its tool is popular but confirmed the group will expand the action to cover other CMPs in the future.</p>
<p>The first batch of noyb&#8217;s cookie consent complaints reveal the rotten depth of dark patterns being deployed &#8212; with 81% of the 500+ pages not offering a reject option on the initial page (meaning users have to dig into sub-menus to try to find it); and 73% using &#8220;deceptive colors and contrasts&#8221; to try to trick users into clicking the &#8216;accept&#8217; option.</p>
<p>noyb&#8217;s assessment of this batch also found that a full 90% did not provide a way to easily withdraw consent as the law requires.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158886" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158886" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2158886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158886" class="wp-caption-text">Cookie compliance problems found in the first batch of sites facing complaints (Image credit: noyb)</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a snapshot of truly massive enforcement failure. But dodgy cookie consents are now operating on borrowed time.</p>
<p>Asked if it was able to work out how prevalent cookie abuse might be across the EU based on the sites it crawled, noyb&#8217;s spokeswoman said it was difficult to determine, owing to technical difficulties encountered through its process, but she said an initial intake of 5,000 websites was whittled down to 3,600 sites to focus on. And of those it was able to determine that 3,300 violated the GDPR.</p>
<p>That still left 300 &#8212; as either having technical issues or no violations &#8212; but, again, the vast majority (90%) were found to have violations. And with so much rule-breaking going on it really does require a systematic approach to fixing the &#8216;bogus consent&#8217; problem &#8212; so noyb&#8217;s use of automation tech is very fitting.</p>
<p>More innovation is also on the way from the not-for-profit &#8212; which told us it&#8217;s working on an automated system that will allow Europeans to &#8220;signal their privacy choices in the background, without annoying cookie banners&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time of writing it couldn&#8217;t provide us with more details on how that will work (presumably it will be some kind of browser plug-in) but said it will be publishing more details &#8220;in the next weeks&#8221; &#8212; so hopefully we&#8217;ll learn more soon.</p>
<p>A browser plug-in that can automatically detect and select the &#8216;reject all&#8217; button (even if only from a subset of the most prevalent CMPs) sounds like it could revive the &#8216;do not track&#8217; dream. At the very least, it would be a powerful weapon to fight back against the scourge of dark patterns in cookie banners and kick non-compliant cookies to digital dust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech in Africa is a goldmine. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are betting big on startups offering a plethora of services from payments and lending to neobanks, remittances and cross-border transfers, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rightfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of these services solves unique sets of challenges.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.svb.com/svb-capital">SVB Capital</a>, the investment arm of U.S. high-tech commercial bank Silicon Valley Bank led this Series C round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others who participated in this round include existing investors &#8212; Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, 500 Startups, Tribe Capital, and Brue2 Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipper Cash </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018 by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamserunjogi"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ham Serunjogi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maijid/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Maijid Moujaled.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair met in Iowa after coming to the U.S. for studies. Following their stints at big names like Facebook, Flickr and Yahoo!, the founders decided to work on their own startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company which offers mobile-based, no fee,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">P2P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payment services, was present in seven countries: Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it has expanded to a new territory outside Africa. &#8220;We&#8217;ve expanded to the U.K., it&#8217;s the first market we&#8217;ve expanded to outside Africa,&#8221; CEO Serunjogi said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition and as a sign of growth, the company which boasts more than 200 employees plans to increase its workforce by hiring 100 staff throughout the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The number of users on Chipper Cash has increased to 4 million, up 33% from last year. And w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hile the company averaged 80,000 transactions daily in November 2020 and processed $100 million in payments value in June 2020, it is unclear what those figures are now as Serunjogi declined to comment on them, including its revenues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we reported its Series B last year, Chipper Cash wanted to offer more business payment solutions, cryptocurrency trading options, and investment services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So what has been the progress since then? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve launched cards products in Nigeria and we&#8217;ve also launched our crypto product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re also launching our US stocks product in Uganda, Nigeria and a few other countries soon,&#8221; Serunjogi answered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adopted in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">African users are responsible for a sizeable chunk of transactions that take place on some global crypto-trading platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, African users accounted for $7 billion of the $8.3 billion in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/african-crypto-usage-spurs-luno-as-customers-reach-7m/">Luno&#8217;s total trading volume</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance P2P users in Africa also <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/05/17/binance-users-grow/">grew 2,000%</a> within the past five months while their volumes increased by over 380%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals and small businesses across Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya account for most of the crypto activity on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipper Cash is active in these countries and <a href="https://chippercash.com/bitcoin/">tapping into this opportunity</a> is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a no brainer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our approach to growing products and adding products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on what our users find valuable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can imagine, crypto is one technology that has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adopted in Africa and many emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we want to give them the power to access crypto and to be able to buy, hold, and sell crypto whenever,&#8221; the CEO added.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2159198 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="314" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png 1298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=768,354 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its crypto service isn&#8217;t available in Nigeria, the largest crypto market in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind this is the Central Bank of Nigeria&#8217;s (CBN) regulation on crypto activities in the country prohibiting users from converting fiat into crypto from their bank accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To survive, most crypto players have adopted P2P methods but Chipper Cash isn&#8217;t offering that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd according to Serunjogi, the company is &#8220;looking forward to any development in Nigeria that allows it to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be offered</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">freely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for the investment service Chipper Cash plans to roll out in Nigeria and Uganda soon. Presently, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria’s capital market regulator SEC is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/nigerias-sec-warns-investment-platforms-to-stop-trading-unregistered-foreign-securities/">keeping tabs on local investment platforms</a> and bringing their activities under its purview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Chipper Cash will not be exempt when the product is live in Nigeria and has begun engaging regulators to be ahead of the curve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As fintech explodes and as innovation continues to move forward, consumers have to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be protected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invest millions of dollars every year in our compliance programs, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the regulators </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that these products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are offered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a compliant manner is important,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Serunjogi noted. </span></p>
<h2>Six billion-dollar companies in Africa; the fifth fintech unicorn?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During our call, Serunjogi made some remarks about Nigeria&#8217;s central bank which resembles comments made by Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga Agboola back in March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While acknowledging the central banks in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda for creating environments where innovation can thrive, he said: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nigeria has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most exciting and vibrant tech ecosystem in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s credit </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to CBN for creating and fostering an environment that allowed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups like ourselves and others like Flutterwave to blossom.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>Most fintechs would argue that the CBN stifles innovation but comments from both CEOs seems to suggest otherwise. From all indication, Chipper Cash and Flutterwave strive to be on the right side of the country&#8217;s apex bank policies and regulations. It is why they are one of the fastest-growing fintechs in the region and also billion-dollar companies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re not getting into our valuation, but we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most valuable private startup in Africa today after this round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that&#8217;s a reflection of the environment that regulators like CBN have created to allowed innovation and growth,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Serunjogi commented when asked about the company&#8217;s valuation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until last week, the only private unicorn startup in Africa this year was Flutterwave. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then China-backed and African-focused fintech OPay came along as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company was reported to be in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">raising $400 million at a $1.5 billion valuation</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Serunjogi&#8217;s comment is anything to go by, Chipper Cash might currently be valued between $1-2 billion thus joining the exclusive billion-dollar club</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to be sure, I asked Serunjogi again if the company is indeed a unicorn. This time, he gave a more cryptic answer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re not commenting on the size of our valuation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things that I&#8217;ve been quite keen on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">externally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that the valuation of our company has not been a focus for us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s not a goal we&#8217;re aspiring to achieve. For us, the thing that drives us is that we have a product that is impactful to our users.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serunjogi added that this investment actualizes the importance of possessing a solid balance sheet and onboarding SVB Capital and getting existing investors to double down is a means to that end</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to him, a strong balance sheet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will provide the infrastructure needed to support key long-term investments which will translate to more exciting products down the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look at our investors as key partners to the business. So having very strong partners around the table makes us a stronger company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are partners who can put capital into our business, and we&#8217;re also able to learn from them in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other ways,&#8221; he said of the investors backing the three-year-old company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Ribbit Capital and Bezos Expeditions in last year&#8217;s Series B, this is SVB Capital&#8217;s first foray into the African market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, the managing director of SVB Capital <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilli">Tilli Bannett</a>, confirmed the fund&#8217;s investment in Chipper Cash</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the VC firm invested in Chipper Cash because it has created an easy and accessible way for people living in Africa to fulfil their financial needs through enhanced products and user experiences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a result, Chipper has had a phenomenal trajectory of consumer adoption and volume through the product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the role Chipper has forged for itself in fostering financial inclusion across Africa and the vast potential that still lies ahead,&#8221; she added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech remains the bright spot in African tech investment. In 2020, the sector accounted for more than 25% of the almost $1.5 billion raised by African startups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This figure will likely increase this year as four startups have raised $100 million rounds already: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">TymeBank</a> in February, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> in March, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">OPay</a> and Chipper Cash this May</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All except TymeBank are now valued at over $1 billion, and it becomes the first time Africa has witnessed two or more billion-dollar companies in a year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Jumia (e-commerce), Interswitch (fintech), and Fawry (fintech), the continent now has six billion-dollar tech companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s another interesting piece of information. The timeframe at which startups are reaching this landmark seems to be shortening. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it took Interswitch and Fawry seventeen and thirteen years </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it took Flutterwave five years; Jumia, four years; then OPay and Chipper Cash three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>We reached out to the VC firm for comment regarding Chipper Cash&#8217;s valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel kicked off this year’s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/better-processor-thin-light-laptops.html#gs.2pn9zr">virtual Computex</a> by <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/better-processor-thin-light-laptops.html#gs.2pn9zr">announcing</a> two new 11th Gen U-Series chips for use in thin, lightweight laptops. It also unveiled its first 5G M.2 module for laptops, designed in a partnership with MediaTek (Intel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/apple-acquiring-most-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business-1b-deal/">sold its smartphone modem business to Apple in 2019</a>).</p>
<p>Both of Intel’s new chips have Intel Irix Xe graphics. The flagship model is the Core i7-1195G7, which has base clock speed is 2.9 GHz, but can reach up to 5.0 GHz on a single core using Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 tech. The other chip, called the Core i5-1155G7, has a base clock speed of 2.5GHzm and a maximum of 4.5GHz. Both chips have four cores and eight threads.</p>

<p>The 5G M.2 module, called the “5G Solution 5000,” supports 5G NR midband, sub-6GHz frequencies and eSIM tech. Intel has partnerships with telecoms in North America, EMEA, APAC, Japan and Australia. The module is expected to be in laptops produced by Acer, ASUS, HP and other manufacturers by the end of this year, and OEMs are also working on 250 designs based on 11th Gen U-Series chips, expected to hit the market by the holidays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The vast majority of people in India, the world’s second most populous nation, don’t have health insurance coverage. A significant portion of the population that does have coverage get it from their employers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plumhq.com">Plum</a>, a young startup that is making it easier and more affordable for more firms in the nation to provide insurance coverage to their employees, said on Monday it has raised $15.6 million in its Series A funding to accelerate its growth.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the new funding round, with participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital India’s Surge, Tanglin Venture Partners, Incubate Fund, and Gemba Capital. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">reported</a> earlier this year that Plum was in talks with Tiger Global for the new financing round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kunal Shah (founder of Cred), Gaurav Munjal, Roman Saini and Hemesh Singh (founders of Unacademy), Lalit Keshre, Harsh Jain and Ishan Bansal (founders of Groww), Ramakant Sharma and Anuj Srivastava (founders of Livspace), and Douglas Feirstein (founder of Hired) also participated in the new round, which brings one-a-half-year-old startup’s to-date raise to $20.6 million.</p>
<p>Plum offers health insurance coverage on a B2B2C model. The startup partners with small businesses to provide health insurance coverage to all their employees (and their family members), charging as little as $1 a month for an employee.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2159214 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The startup has developed the insurance stack from scratch and partnered with insurers to include additional coverage on pre-existing conditions and dental, said Abhishek Poddar, co-founder and chief executive of Plum, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>(Like fintech firms, which partner with banks and NBFCs to provide credit to customers, online insurance startups maintain partnerships with insurers to provide health insurance coverage. Plum maintains partnerships with ICICI Lombard, Care Health, Star Health and New India Assurance.)</p>
<p>Poddar, who has worked at Google and McKinsey, said Plum is making it increasingly affordable and enticing for businesses to choose the startup as their partner. Most insurance firms and online aggregators in India today currently serve consumers. There are very few players that engage with businesses. Even among those that do, they tend to be costlier and not as flexible.</p>
<p>Plum offers its partnered client&#8217;s employees the option to top up their health insurance coverage or extend it to additional members of the family. Unlike its competitors that require all the premium to be paid annually, Plum gives its clients the ability to pay each month. And signing up an entire firm for Plum takes less than an hour.</p>
<p>The speed is a key differentiator for Plum. Small businesses have to typically spend months in negotiating with other insurers. Bangalore-based Razorpay has also partnered with Plum to give the fintech startup’s clients a three-click, one-minute option to sign up for insurance coverage.</p>

<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to further expand its offerings, making its platform open to smaller businesses with teams as small as seven employees to sign up, said Poddar. The startup plans to cover 10 million people in India with insurance by 2025, and eventually expand to international markets, he said.</p>
<p>India has an under-penetrated insurance market. Within the under-penetrated landscape, digital distribution through web-aggregators today accounts for just 1% of the industry, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent report.</p>
<p>“As India’s healthcare insurance industry rapidly expands and transforms, Plum is well positioned to make comprehensive health insurance accessible to millions of Indians. We are excited to partner with Abhishek, Saurabh and the Plum team as they scale their leading tech-enabled platform to employers across the country,&#8221; said Scott Shleifer, Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>
<p>Plum is the latest investment from Tiger Global in India this year. The hedge fund, which has backed over 20 Indian unicorns, has emerged as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/?tpcc=ECTW2020">most prolific investor in Indian startups in recent months</a>, winning founders with its pace of investment, check size and favorable terms. Last week, the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/tiger-global-koo-app-twitter/">invested in Indian social network Koo</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jai Kisan, an Indian startup that is attempting to bring financial services to rural India, where commercial banks have a single-digit penetration, said on Monday it has raised $30 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale its business.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people in India today live in rural areas. Most of them don&#8217;t have a credit score. The professions they work on &#8212; largely farming &#8212; aren&#8217;t considered a business by most lenders in India. These farmers and other professionals also don&#8217;t have a documented credit history, which puts them in a risky category for banks to grant them a loan.</p>
<p>Much of the credit these people do raise ends up getting invested in unproductive usage, which leads to higher interest and default rates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Three-year-old Mumbai-headquartered <a href="http://jai-kisan.com">Jai Kisan</a> is attempting to address this by treating farmers and other similar professionals as businesses instead of consumers.</p>
<p>The startup has developed its own system &#8212; which it calls Bharat Khata &#8212; that is helping individuals and businesses get access to cheaper financing and ensures that the money they raise is being used for agri-inputs and equipment and other income generating purposes and enablement of rural commerce transactions.</p>
<p>Arjun Ahluwalia, co-founder and chief executive of Jai Kisan, said financial services is crucial for these individuals as their entire economy depends on it. &#8220;The ability to buy now and pay later is how most people shop for things in India. Credit is an expectation by the Indian customer &#8212; it&#8217;s not a value added service,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is availability of formal financing to customers, it&#8217;s not just customer who does well. The entire ecosystem that revolves around that customer benefits,&#8221; he said, pointing to the rise of Bajaj Finance, which has helped several businesses flourish in India by giving credit to customers at the time of purchase, and Xiaomi, India&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/xiaomi-india-localization/">largest smartphone vendor</a>, which sells a large number of its devices to customers on monthly instalment plans.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159207" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159207" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2159207 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="984" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159207" class="wp-caption-text">Ahluwalia at a conference in 2019 (India FinTech Forum)</p></div></p>
<p>Bharat Khata service, which was launched in April last year, captured more than $380 million of annualized GTV run-rate across over 25,000 storefronts by the financial year that ended in March this year, the startup said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jai Kisan has financed over 15% of the transactions which portrays the monetizability and quality of commerce being captured. The ability to have visibility and virality of high-quality transactions has enabled Jai Kisan to scale business by over 50% in 3 months. The unprecedented growth trajectory stands testament to Jai Kisan’s capabilities to deploy capital efficiently by focusing on core customer credit needs,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>The startup, which operates in eight Indian states in South India, is now looking to scale its presence across the country and also increase the headcount. On Monday, it said it had raised $30 million in a Series A round led by Mirae Asset, Syngenta Ventures, and existing investors Blume, Arkam Ventures, NABVENTURES, Prophetic Ventures and Better Capital.</p>
<p>An unspecified amount of the financing was raised as debt from Blacksoil, Stride Ventures, and Trifecta Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jai Kisan is at the cusp of disrupting the rural financing industry and we’re glad to be a part of their growth story. Jai Kisan’s stellar growth, excellent asset quality and expanding footprint make them a highly differentiated player in the segment,&#8221; said Ashish Dave, chief executive of the India Venture Investments for the South Korean firm Mirae Asset.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mirae Asset has always believed in backing companies which aim to become category leaders which is evident from our other investments and we believe Jai Kisan is on the journey of doing so for rural finance,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Like most fintech startups, Jai Kisan has so far relied on its banking and other financial institutions to finance credit to businesses. The startup said it will now finance 20% of all loans by itself. Which is why it is also raising some money in debt in the new round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Delhivery, India’s largest independent e-commerce logistics startup, has raised $277 million in what is expected to be the final funding round before the firm files for an IPO later this year.</p>
<p>In a regulatory filing, the Gurgaon-headquartered startup disclosed it had raised $277 million in a round led by Boston-headquartered investment firm Fidelity. Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, Abu Dhabi’s Chimera, and UK&#8217;s Baillie Gifford also participated in the new round, a name* of which the startup didn&#8217;t specify.</p>
<p>The new round valued the 10-year-old startup at about $3 billion. Delhivery &#8212; which also counts SoftBank Vision Fund, Tiger Global Management, Times Internet, The Carlyle Group, and Steadview Capital among its investors &#8212; has raised about $1.23 billion to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Delhivery began its life <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/delhivery-seriesd/">as a food delivery firm</a>, but has since shifted to a full suite of logistics services in over 2,300 Indian cities and more than 17,500 zip codes.</p>
<p>It is among a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/indias-blackbuck-raises-150-million-to-digitize-freight-and-logistics-across-india/">handful of startups</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/rivigo-india-seriese/">attempting to digitize</a> the demand and supply system of the logistics market through a freight exchange platform.</p>

<p>Its platform connects consigners, agents and truckers offering road transport solutions. The startup says the platform reduces the role of brokers, makes some of its assets such as trucking &#8212; the most popular transportation mode for Delhivery &#8212; more efficient, and ensures round the clock operations.</p>
<p>This digitization is crucial to address the inefficiencies in the Indian logistics industry that has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d529d48c-dc1b-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482">long stunted</a> the national economy. Poor planning and forecasting of demand and supply increases the carrying costs, theft, damages, and delays, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report last month about India’s logistics market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.delhivery.com">Delhivery</a>, which says it has delivered over 1 billion orders, works with “all of India’s largest e-commerce companies and leading enterprises,” according to its website, where it also says the startup has worked with over 10,000 customers. For the last leg of the delivery, its couriers are assigned an area that never exceeds 2 sq km, allowing them to make several delivery runs a day to save time.</p>
<p>Indian logistics market’s TAM (total addressable market) is over $200 billion, Bernstein analysts said.</p>
<p>The startup said late last year that it was planning to invest over $40 million within two years to expand and increase its fleet size to meet the growing demand of orders as more people shop online amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>(*Indian news outlet Entrackr, which <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/05/exclusive-ipo-bound-delhivery-raises-277-mn-led-by-fidelity/">first reported</a> on the filing, suggested it&#8217;s a Series H round. But according to insight platform Tracxn, there is no record of a Series G round for Delhivery. The startup didn&#8217;t comment on Sunday.)</p>
