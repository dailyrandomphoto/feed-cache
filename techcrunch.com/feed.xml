										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a troubled year that saw broadband satellite operator <a href="https://www.oneweb.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneWeb</a> file for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/oneweb-to-file-for-bankruptcy-as-effort-to-securing-funding-including-from-investor-softbank-falls-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> bankruptcy</a>, get rescue finance from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/the-uk-government-to-acquire-satellite-company-oneweb-in-deal-funded-in-part-by-indias-bharti-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK government</a> and Bharti, and then emerge out of that with a launch of part of its fleet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/oneweb-launches-36-satellites-to-join-its-global-broadband-constellation-on-orbit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last month</a>, the London-based company today announced a another $1.4 billion in funding &#8212; money that it says will be enough to (finally) get the rest of its first-generation fleet of 648 satellites off the ground.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The 36 new satellites OneWeb launched in December brought the total number in orbit to 110 satellites, so there are still more than 500 left to launch.</span></p>
<p>SoftBank Group Corp. and Hughes Network Systems are providing the financing, the company said. The news comes about a month after OneWeb launched 36 satellites, its third launch to put more of its fleet into orbit. At the time, its executive chairman <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/98e57ccc-8ecf-4a6a-afa9-1c8366043b56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunil Bharti Mittal said</a> that it was on track to raise $400 million &#8212; so this represents a more-than threefold increase on that amount.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“OneWeb’s mission is to connect everyone, everywhere. We have made rapid progress to re-start the business since emerging from Chapter 11 in November,&#8221; said Neil Masterson, CEO of OneWeb, in a statement. &#8220;We welcome the investments by SoftBank and Hughes as further proof of progress towards delivering our goal.”</p>
<p>SoftBank and Hughes are both past backers and partners in OneWeb, so this is something of an insurance policy to make sure that its previous investment doesn&#8217;t go completely to waste. (At least some of it has already been written down: SoftBank years ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/softbank-expects-24-billion-in-losses-from-vision-fund-wework-and-oneweb-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an eye-watering loss of $24 billion</a> due in part to that OneWeb bet.)</p>
<p>Hughes, meanwhile, invests via its parent company EchoStar and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/07/oneweb-is-a-step-closer-to-bringing-its-global-satellite-based-internet-services-to-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inked a deal with the company way back in 2017</a> to build the terrestrial infrastructure that would work with OneWeb&#8217;s satellites. Deals, building and rollouts in the world of satellite technology play out over a number of years, and often face delays, so being three years out &#8212; or even more &#8212; on seeing any fruits from that deal is not hugely surprising.</p>
<p>OneWeb acknowledged the long-time connection between the investors and confirmed that the ground network is still being built by Hughes.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome the investment from SoftBank and Hughes. Both are deeply familiar with our business, share our vision for the future, and their commitment allows us to capitalise on the significant growth opportunity ahead for OneWeb,&#8221; said Mittal in a statement. &#8220;We gain from their experience and capabilities, as we deliver a unique LEO network for the world.”</p>
<p>Originally, Hughes had planned for the first services to start running in 2019 &#8212; although that was when OneWeb and its fleet of LEO (low-earth orbit) satellites was still a very shiny idea, backed by $1.7 billion in venture funding.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s original idea was always great but (no pun intended) also something of a moonshot: LEO satellites have already been proven to be a strong and useful complement to terrestrial networks for providing broadband connectivity to more remote areas that couldn&#8217;t be reached in other ways. The idea with OneWeb was to make that service something useful and used by a much bigger group of on-the-ground users, with <a href="https://www.oneweb.world/technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the promise</a> being 400Mbps for everyone.</p>
<p>While broadband usage has certainly exploded in the interim, what OneWeb perhaps didn&#8217;t bank on was that those building non-satellite systems for providing connectivity would also be progressing in their network advances; nor how long it might take, or the financing needed, to get its fleet off the ground on the timelines it was promising.</p>
<p>These days, OneWeb says that growing ubiquity of 5G, Internet of Things and connectivity needs overall still present a strong use case for its approach &#8212; which it says &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">includes a network of global gateway stations and a range of user terminals for different customer markets capable of delivering affordable, fast, high-bandwidth and low-latency communications services.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Secretary of State, BEIS, The Rt. Hon. Kwasi Kwarteng, said in a statement: “Our investment in OneWeb is part of our continued commitment to the UK’s space sector, putting Britain at the forefront of the latest technological advances. Today’s investment brings the company one step closer to delivering its mission to provide global broadband connectivity for people, businesses and governments, while potentially unlocking new research, development and manufacturing opportunities in the UK.”</p>
<p>SoftBank is getting a seat on OneWeb&#8217;s board with this deal.</p>
<p>“We are excited to support OneWeb as it increases capacity and accelerates towards commercialisation,&#8221; said Masayoshi Son, Representative Director, Corporate Officer, Chairman &amp; CEO of SoftBank, in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to continue our partnership with Bharti, the UK Government and Hughes to help OneWeb deliver on its mission to transform internet access around the world.”</p>
<p>Pradman Kaul, President of Hughes, added: “OneWeb continues to inspire the industry and attract the best players in the business to come together to bring its LEO constellation to fruition. The investments made today by Hughes and SoftBank will help realise the full potential of OneWeb in connecting enterprise, government and mobility customers, especially with multi-transport services that complement our own geostationary offerings in meeting and accelerating demand for broadband around the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is the latest to be added to the Trump Administration&#8217;s military blacklist. On Thursday, the Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2472464/dod-releases-list-of-additional-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1237-of-fy/">added</a> nine more companies to its list of alleged Chinese military companies, including Xiaomi.</p>
<p>Xiaomi was the world&#8217;s third-largest smartphone maker as of Q3 last year, coming ahead of Apple and trailing behind Samsung and Huawei, according to market researcher <a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor">IDC</a>.</p>
<p>In November, President Donald Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">signed an executive order</a>, which was set to take effect in January, to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-securities-investments-finance-communist-chinese-military-companies/">bar investment</a> in companies designated as supporting efforts of China&#8217;s military, intelligence and security apparatuses. Huawei, China&#8217;s major chipmaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">SMIC</a>, and the country&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/nyse-reverses-plans-to-delist-chinas-three-big-telcos/">three largest telecoms operators</a> are among the targets of the list.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The military blacklist is different from the Commerce Department&#8217;s entity list, which famously cuts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/us-commerce-department-adds-46-huawei-affiliates-to-entity-list/">Huawei</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-commerce-department-entity-list/">DJI</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/">SenseTime</a> and other Chinese tech firms off their U.S. suppliers over national security concerns.</p>
<p>Xiaomi &#8220;confirms that it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a &#8216;Communist Chinese Military Company&#8217; defined under the NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act]. The company will take appropriate course of actions to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders,&#8221; a Xiaomi spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Like the entity list, the U.S. government&#8217;s military blacklist has caused confusion around compliance. In response to the sanctions on China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the New York Stock Exchange made three moves. It first announced to delist the three Chinese telcos, then decided not to after consultation with regulators, but eventually reversed its reversal and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/the-nyse-will-delist-three-chinese-telecoms-after-all/"> said it would delist them</a>, after all, upon further evaluation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company is reviewing the potential consequences of this to develop a fuller understanding of its impact on the group. The company will make further announcements as and when appropriate,&#8221; the Xiaomi representative said.</p>
<p>Xiaomi is listed in Hong Kong, and the executive order could force American investors to divest their holdings in the phone maker, whose shares tumbled more than 11% to $29 apiece on the blacklist announcement.</p>
<p>While Xiaomi&#8217;s operations and technology access are unaffected in the latest round of U.S. government assault, a supply chain ban could become a sword of Damocles. The Chinese phone maker has been working closely with Qualcomm and was notably<a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-11-snapdragon-888-221003638.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAC8x6DK3flg35_l1wvr7GMdm-ngC9WiFtxFHwzBJQCu_9L7CIAXGajm2elon3TKKfpjZIN8hnQ9o3QKf0NJ-LNy8B2wz6YEzEcap2bfX0uMiX5knzFIcL_2tHkMnDuMLBsYjCTkoZyFIT0LPJB_3H-tPP4KoST9jrkYDRZ_14Nd-"> the first to get</a> the high-end Snapdragon 888 chips. To evade restrictions imposed by the entity list, Huawei <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/">spun out its budget phone unit Honor</a> in a bid to save its supply chain. It remains to be seen how Joe Biden will tackle Trump-era policies towards Chinese tech giants.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Lots of demand, little supply, boom goes the price.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As expected, shares of Poshmark exploded this morning, blasting over 130% higher in afternoon trading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-prices-ipo-above-range-as-public-markets-continue-to-yolo-startups/">from the company&#8217;s above-range IPO price of $42</a>. The enormous and noisy debut of Poshmark comes a day after Affirm, another IPO, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/">treated similarly by the public markets</a>.</p>
<p>Both explosive debuts were preceded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/the-ipo-market-looks-hot-as-airbnb-and-c3-ai-raise-price-targets/">by huge December debuts from C3.ai, Doordash and Airbnb</a>. It seems today that any venture-backed company that can claim some sort of tech mantle is being treated to a strong IPO pricing run and a huge first-day result.</p>
<p>This is, of course, annoying to some people. Namely, certain elements of the venture capital community who would prefer to keep all outsized gains in their own pockets. But, no matter. You might be wondering what is going on. Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2 class="c-mrkdwn__pre" data-stringify-type="pre">Here&#8217;s how you get a big first-day IPO pop</h2>
<p>TechCrunch has covered the IPO window as closely as we can over the last few years. And the late-stage venture capital markets, along with the changing value of tech stocks and the huge boom in consumer (retail) investing.</p>
<p>Based on my participation in as much of that reporting as I could take part in here&#8217;s how you get a 130% first-day IPO pop in a company that has actually been around long enough for investors to math-out reasonable growth and profit expectations for the future:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exist in a climate of near-zero interest rates.</strong> This leads to super-cheap money, bonds being shit and no one wanting to hold cash. Lots of dollars go into more speculative assets, like stocks. And lots of money goes into exotic investments, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/us-vc-fundraising-hits-record-69b-in-2020-after-a16z-closes-two-mega-funds#:~:text=US%20venture%20capital%20funds%20have,%244.5%20billion%20in%20commitments%20Friday.">like venture capital funds</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week we &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> &#8212; had a lot to get through, as the news volume in early 2021 has been rapid and serious. Sadly this means that some early-stage rounds missed the cut, though we did make sure to have some Series A material in the show.</p>
<p>So, what did the assembled crew get to? Here&#8217;s your cheat sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/venture-capitalists-react-to-visa-plaid-deal-meltdown/?tpcc=ECTW2020">demise of the Plaid-Visa deal</a>, our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/plaid-ceo-touts-new-clarity-after-failed-visa-acquisition/">chat with the CEO of the fintech unicorn</a> and what the failed transaction <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/will-startup-valuations-change-given-rising-antitrust-concerns/">could mean</a> for startup valuations more broadly.</li>
<li>Why the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/two-year-old-nuvia-sells-to-qualcomm-for-1-4-billion/">$1.4 billion Nuvia exit to Qualcomm</a> is impressive in scale and puzzling. This topic also gave Danny a chance to talk about chips, his favorite thing.</li>
<li>Auto-insurance rates can often depend on highly variable demographic data like marital status, income and education. Loop is a new seed-stage startup that wants to make the process more equitable.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/loop-launches-out-of-stealth-to-make-auto-insurance-more-equitable/"> It landed millions this week,</a> underscoring a broader insurtech wave.</li>
<li>SuperCharger Ventures pivoted its fintech accelerator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/inside-supercharger-ventures-debut-virtual-edtech-accelerator/">into an edtech accelerator</a>! We discuss why the shift and its surprising focus on B2B makes a ton of sense.</li>
<li>Crypto&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/cryptos-lose-ground-as-bitcoin-falls-23-ether-29-in-last-24-hours/">going up and down</a>, ahead of the anticipated Coinbase IPO and the known Bakkt SPAC. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/2021-a-spac-odyssey/">More on that here</a>.</li>
<li>Sticking to the SPAC front, SoFi joined the list of companies using blank-check companies to approach the public markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-talkspace-m-a-hudson-executive/online-therapy-provider-talkspace-to-go-public-via-1-4-billion-spac-deal-idUSKBN29I1A2">is Talkspace</a>, the tele-therapy startup that you&#8217;ve heard of.</li>
<li>Then there was SoftBank, of course, which has its own SPAC in the market now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/softbank-will-reportedly-file-for-a-spac-on-monday/">confirming earlier reports.</a> Which makes perfect sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many SPACs and bits of IPO news and funding rounds to pick through and cover that we&#8217;re already straining the time limits of the show to even cover half of the material. This week that meant that we excised a chunk of the show to a forthcoming Saturday episode that is focused on e-commerce.</p>
<p>So, we will talk to you again soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://capsule.video/">Capsule</a>, a video Q&amp;A platform aimed at brands, emerged last year in direct response to the challenges companies were facing in terms of reaching consumers during the pandemic. Now, the business has closed on $2 million in pre-seed funding. The round was led by Array Ventures and included participation from Bloomberg Beta and other angels.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by the same team that originally created the animated GIF capture tool and social network <a href="https://phhhoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phhhoto</a>, which eventually lost out to Instagram’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/22/instagram-boomerang/?_ga=2.127143629.1347273196.1592833498-1783005191.1582664406">clone</a>, Boomerang. Phhhoto shut down in 2017 and the team pivoted to work on an experiential marketing business, <a href="https://hypno.com/">Hypno.</a> The new company had been working with brands that hosted live events and experiences as a way to connect with customers. Hypno would offer them things like photo booths and other camera platforms that allowed for interactivity.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic essentially killed Hypno&#8217;s business as live events dried up. However, the brands Hypno had worked with still had the same needs &#8212; they just had to go about reaching their customers in a different way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2096765" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096765" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2096765" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capsule-frame.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capsule-frame.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capsule-frame.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capsule-frame.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capsule-frame.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capsule-frame.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capsule-frame.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capsule-frame.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096765" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Capsule</p></div></p>
<p>That&#8217;s how Capsule came to exist. Launched last year, the startup offers a full platform for hosting Q&amp;A sessions, where the brand starts with a template that they then customize to match their campaign by changing the logo, colors, buttons, background and URLs &#8212; sort of a like a Squarespace for the video Q&amp;A format.</p>
<p>The brand will then write their questions and prompts for consumers to answer, in the form of short video responses. This Q&amp;A URL is distributed however the company chooses &#8212; like on social media, for example. A new feature also allows a &#8220;capsule&#8221; to be embedded on the website.</p>
<p>The consumers&#8217; responses to the Q&amp;A are curated for the final video product. What makes the technology even more interesting is how Capsule assembles this footage.</p>
<p>Capsule instantly and automatically processes the video, adding elements like music and graphics, pre-roll or post-roll, which makes the resulting video appear professionally edited. The startup does this by using its own JavaScript-based programming language that automates mixing of things like color, audio, graphics and dynamic type. All the customer has to do is select the kind of video they want &#8212; like one with an energetic feel or a more somber one, for instance.</p>
<p>Today, Capsule has grown its library to about 20 base templates. But each of these can be edited by changing colors, styles and even the music &#8212; including either from direct uploads or from thousands of royalty-free tracks Capsule provides.</p>
<p><div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2096700-1" width="1920" height="1080" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Video.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Video.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Video.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Capsule co-founder Champ Bennett, the platform&#8217;s flexibility has led to a wide range of use cases. Though the company&#8217;s first customers had come from the live events space that Hypno had catered to, new customers soon began to adopt the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we immediately started to hear from both our existing customers and then, suddenly, a bunch of new customers that were coming our way, is that the platform was useful in so many different contexts,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;For example, UGC [user-generated content] campaigns or generating social content to promote a business, or awareness, or product reviews and testimonials, or even creators who just wanted a faster way to make content that looked and felt a little bit more professional,&#8221; Bennett says.</p>
<p>At launch, Capsule was used by companies like Netflix and organizations like OkayAfrica. It&#8217;s since landed contracts with hundreds of customers, including teams inside larger organizations like Google, Samsung, Salesforce, Deloitte and The Wall Street Journal, along with other small-to-medium businesses, like <a href="https://thyroidawareness.capsule.video/">Paloma Health</a>. The USO has also used Capsule.</p>
<p>These brands and others are especially hungry for tools that help them create original, short-form video content, which is becoming a key way businesses are marketing their products and services. Capsule notes that studies have <a href="https://databox.com/videos-vs-images-in-facebook-ads">indicated</a> video click-through rates are two-three times higher than static images and 95% of businesses are <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data">reporting</a> an increase in their video spend year-over-year.</p>
<p>The pandemic had accelerated the existing demand for video content, but brands faced challenges in terms of video being difficult to scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Increasingly, brands have started to kind of hack the way that they can create video,&#8221; says Bennett. &#8220;And one of the ways they&#8217;re doing that is by tapping into different creators within their organizations &#8212; whether it&#8217;s employees or founders or partners or influencers or fans of the brand or whatever it is &#8212; then activating them to create content on their behalf,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;We call this community-generated content, which is sort of like an iteration on user-generated content. It&#8217;s this idea that content can come from anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Capsule says it wanted to work with Array Ventures GP Shruti Gandhi, who has an engineering background, because she very deeply understood the core technology. She introduced the team to Bloomberg Beta in New York, which also immediately understood what Capsule was building, Bennett says.</p>
<p>With the additional funds, Capsule will be hiring a product designer and will be developing new collaboration features, like the ability to upvote content.</p>
<p>Longer-term, the company believes its platform will enable more people to get involved with video creation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It turns out that there are so many different people within businesses who are capable of creating video content. They just don&#8217;t have the technical know-how to do it. They&#8217;re not video editors,&#8221; Bennett says. &#8220;So what we&#8217;re really doing is untapping this creative potential that exists inside of businesses everywhere, small and large.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Previously, we introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/flexible-vc-a-new-model-for-startups-targeting-profitability/">the concept of flexible VC</a>: structures that allow founders to access immediate risk capital while preserving exit and ownership optionality. We list here all the active flexible VCs we have identified, broken into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue-based</li>
<li>Compensation-based</li>
<li>Blended-return streams</li>
</ul>
<h2>Revenue-based flexible VCs</h2>
<p><em>These investors are paid back primarily based on a percentage of revenues.</em></p>
<h3>Capacity Capital</h3>
<p>Chattanooga, TN-based <a href="https://capacity.is/capital/">Capacity Capital</a> was launched in 2020 with a primary focus on the southeastern U.S. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdbragdon/">Jonathan Bragdon</a>, its CEO, describes Capacity as “a team of founders-turned-funders making non-dilutive, founder-aligned investments of $50,000-$300,000 in post-startup, post-revenue businesses planning to 2x revenues in 12-24 months. Investments are typically in exchange for a capped, single-digit revenue share and a right to equity under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>If the company sells or raises enough capital, the investment converts into an agreed-upon percentage of equity. If the company grows without raising additional equity funding, founders redeem most of the equity right, based on a pre-agreed return amount. With a portfolio that includes food, tech and services, the fund is industry-agnostic and focused on the overlooked and underrepresented with high-margin business models.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan sometimes refers to their investments as &#8220;micro-mezzanine” because “mezz is typically structured as a contractual periodic payment, with some equity-like upside, but subordinate to other debt … so most lenders look at it like equity. But, it is typically shorter term with fewer control mechanisms than equity (i.e., not VC). I wanted [a term for] something similar (between debt and equity) but on an extremely small scale.”</p>
<p>In addition to a fund, the overall <a href="https://capacity.is/">Capacity</a> organization provides direct mentorship, consulting and connects founders to a broad network of talent, diverse forms of capital and existing resources focused on the post-startup stage of growth. The founders, LPs and venture partners have a long history in local startup ecosystems in the Southeast including <a href="https://launchtn.org/">LaunchTN</a>, <a href="https://colab.co/">The Company Lab</a>, <a href="https://costarters.co/">CO.STARTERS</a> and several other regional funds and resources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Only a few weeks <a href="https://therealdeal.com/national/2020/12/24/porch-valuation-soars-to-1b-after-ipo/">after its SPAC IPO</a>, Porch today announced that it has made four acquisitions, worth a total of $122 million. The most important here is probably the acquisition of <a href="https://hoaic.com/">Homeowners of America</a> for $100 million, which gets Porch deeper into the home insurance space. In addition, Porch is also acquiring mover marketing and data platform <a href="https://v12data.com/v12-data/">V12</a> for $22 million, as well as home inspection service <a href="https://www.palm-tech.com/">Palm-Tech</a> and <a href="https://iroofing.org/">iRoofing</a>, a SaaS application for roofing contractors. Porch did not disclose the acquisition prices for the latter two companies.</p>
<p>You may still think of Porch as a marketplace for home improvement and repair services &#8212; and that&#8217;s what it started out as when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/05/home-improvement-and-repair-marketplace-porch-raises-6-3m-from-sv-angel-jeff-skoll-and-others/">launched</a> about seven years ago. Yet while it still offers those services, a couple of years after its 2013 launch, the company <a href="https://porchgroup.com/story">pivoted</a> to building what it now calls a &#8220;vertical software platform for the home.&#8221; Through a number of acquisitions, the Porch Group now includes Porch.com, as well as services like HireAHelper, Inspection Support Network for home inspectors, Kandela for providing services around moving and an insurance broker in the form of the Elite Insurance Group. In some form or another, Porch&#8217;s tools are now used &#8212; either directly or indirectly &#8212; by two-thirds of U.S. homebuyers every month.</p>

Image Credits: Porch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Porch founder and CEO Matt Ehrlichman told me, he had originally planned to take his company public through a traditional IPO. He noted that going the increasingly popular SPAC route, though, allowed him to push his timeline up by a year, which in turn now enables the company to make the acquisitions it announced today.</p>
<p>&#8220;In total, we had a $323 million fundraise that allows us now to not only be a public company with public currency, but to be very well capitalized. And picking up that year allows us to be able to go and pursue acquisitions that we think make really good fits for Porch,&#8221; Ehrlichman told me. While Porch&#8217;s guidance for its 2021 revenue was previously $120 million, it&#8217;s now updating that guidance to $170 million based on these acquisitions. That would mean Porch would grow its revenue by about 134% year-over-year between 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>As the company had previously laid out in its public documents, the plan for 2021 was always to get deeper into insurance. Indeed, as Ehrlichman noted, Porch these days tends to think of itself as a vertical software company that layers insurtech on top of its services in order to be able to create a recurring revenue stream. And because Porch offers such a wide range of services already, its customer acquisition costs are essentially zero for these services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096726" style="width: 367px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Homeowners-of-America-Insurance-Company-logo-.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096726" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2096726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Homeowners-of-America-Insurance-Company-logo-.png" alt="" width="357" height="85" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Homeowners-of-America-Insurance-Company-logo-.png 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Homeowners-of-America-Insurance-Company-logo-.png?resize=150,36 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Homeowners-of-America-Insurance-Company-logo-.png?resize=300,72 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Homeowners-of-America-Insurance-Company-logo-.png?resize=50,12 50w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2096726" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Homeowners of America</p></div></p>
<p>Porch was already a licensed insurance brokerage. With Homeowners of America, it is acquiring a company that is both an insurance carrier as well as a managing general agent..</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re able to capture all of the economic value from the consumer as we help them get insurance set up with their new home and we can really control that experience to delight them. As we wrap all the technology we&#8217;ve invested in around that experience we can make it super simple and instant to be able to get the right insurance at the right price for your new home. And because we have all of this data about the home that nobody else has &#8212; from the inspection we know if the roof is old, we know if the hot water system is gonna break soon and all the appliances &#8212; we know all of this data and so it just gives us a really big advantage in insurance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data, indeed, is what a lot of these acquisitions are about. Because Porch knows so much about so many customers, it is able to provide the companies it acquires with access to relevant data, which in turn helps them offer additional services and make smarter decisions.</p>
<p>Homeowners of America is currently operating in six states (Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia) and licensed in 31. It has a network of more than 800 agencies so far and Porch expects to expand the company&#8217;s network and geographic reach in the coming months. &#8220;Because we have [customer acquisition cost]-free demand all across the country, one of the opportunities for us is simply just to expand that across the nation,&#8221; Ehrlichman explained.</p>
<p>As for V12, Porch&#8217;s focus is on that company&#8217;s mover marketing and data platform. The acquisition should help it reach its medium-term goal of building a $200 million revenue stream in this area. V12 offers services across multiple verticals, though, including in the automotive space, and will continue to do so. The platform&#8217;s overall focus is to help brands identify the right time to reach out to a given consumer &#8212; maybe before they decide to buy a new car or move. With Porch&#8217;s existing data layered on top of V12&#8217;s existing capabilities, the company expects that it will be able to expand these features and it will also allow Porch to not offer mover marketing but what Ehrlichman called &#8220;pro-mover&#8221; services, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;V12 anchors what we call our marketing software division. A key focus of that is mover marketing. That&#8217;s where it&#8217;s going to have, long term, tremendous differentiation. But there are a number of other things that they&#8217;re working on that are going to have really nice growth vectors, and they&#8217;ll continue to push those,&#8221; said Ehrlichman.</p>
<p>As for the two smaller acquisitions of iRoofing and Palm-Tech, these are more akin to some of the previous acquisitions the company made in the contractor and inspection verticals. Like with those previous acquisitions, the plan is to help them grow faster, in part through integrating them into the overall Porch group&#8217;s family of products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business is and continues to be highly recurring or reoccurring in nature,&#8221; said <span class="il">Porch</span> CFO Marty Heimbigner. &#8220;Nearly all of our revenues, including that of these new acquisitions, is consistent and predictable. This repeat revenue is also high margin with less than 20% cost of revenue and is expected to grow more than 30% per year on our platform. So, we believe these deals are highly accretive for our shareholders.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to a recent letter sent to its investors, <a href="https://www.tigerglobal.com/home">Tiger Global Management</a>, the New York-based investing powerhouse, is raising a new $3.75 billion venture fund called Tiger Private Investment Partners XIV that it expects to close in March.</p>
<p>The fund is Tiger Global&#8217;s thirteenth venture fund, despite its title &#8212; the partners might be superstitious &#8212; and it comes hot on the heels of the firm&#8217;s twelfth venture fund, closed exactly a year ago, also with $3.75 billion in capital commitments.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the firm declined to comment on the letter or Tiger Global&#8217;s broader fundraising strategy when reached this morning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot of capital to target, even amid a sea of enormous new venture vehicles. New Enterprise Associates closed its newest fund with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/nea-venture-capitals-quiet-giant-closes-on-3-6-billion/">$3.6 billion</a> last year. Lightspeed Venture Partners soon after announced <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/lightspeed-boosts-three-funds-with-4b/">$4 billion</a> across three funds. Andreessen Horowitz, the youngest of the three firms, announced in November it had closed a pair of funds totaling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/a16z-is-now-managing-16-5-billion-after-announcing-two-new-funds/">$4.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tiger Global seemingly has a strong case to present potential limited partners. Last year alone, numerous of its portfolio companies either went public or were acquired.</p>

<p>Yatsen Holding, the nearly five-year-old parent company of China-based <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cosmetics-perfectdiary/all-girls-buy-it-in-china-perfect-diary-gives-cosmetics-world-a-makeover-with-live-streams-low-prices-idUSKBN25M0BP">cosmetics giant</a> Perfect Diary, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-perfect-diary-ipo/perfect-diary-parents-shares-soar-in-u-s-debut-idUSKBN27Z2NK">went public</a> in November and is now valued at $14 billion. (Tiger Global&#8217;s ownership stake didn&#8217;t merit a mention on the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819580/000119312520282237/d57580df1.htm#rom57580_16">regulatory filing</a>.)</p>
<p>Tiger Global also quietly <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000162827920000112/filename4.htm">invested</a> in the cloud-based data warehousing outfit Snowflake and, while again, it didn&#8217;t have a big enough stake to be included in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000162828020013010/snowflakes-1.htm#ia73499eb79a34ddeaa563501d30356b0_106">S-1</a>, even a tiny ownership percentage would be valuable, given that Snowflake is now valued at $85 billion.</p>
<p>And Tiger Global backed Root insurance, a nearly six-year-old, Columbus, Ohio-based insurance company that <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2020/10/28/588450.htm">went public</a> in November and currently boasts a market cap of $5.3 billion. Tiger owned 10.3% sailing into the offering.</p>

<p>As for M&amp;A, Tiger Global saw at least three of its companies swallowed by bigger tech companies during 2020, including Postmates&#8217;s all-stock sale to Uber for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">$2.65 billion</a>; Credit Karma&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/intuit-credit-karma/">$7 billion</a> sale in cash and stock to Intuit; and the sale of Kustomer, which focused on customer service platforms and chatbots, for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/">$1 billion</a> to Facebook.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, whose roots are in hedge fund management, launched its private equity business in 2003, spearheaded by Chase Coleman, who&#8217;d previously worked for hedge-fund pioneer Julian Robertson at Tiger Management; and Scott Shleifer, who joined the firm in 2002 after spending three years with the Blackstone Group. Lee Fixel, who would become a key contributor in the business, joined in 2006.</p>
<p>Shleifer focused on China, Fixel focused on India and the rest of the firm&#8217;s support team (it now has 22 investing professionals on staff) helped find deals in Brazil and Russia before beginning to focus more aggressively on opportunities in the U.S.</p>
<p>Every investing decision was eventually made by each of the three. Fixel left in 2019 to launch his own investment firm, <a href="https://addition.com/">Addition</a>. Now Shleifer and Coleman are the firm&#8217;s sole decision-makers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cbGFxXLGw3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/14/lee-fixel-is-leaving-tiger-global/">Lee Fixel is leaving Tiger Global</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lee Fixel is leaving Tiger Global&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/14/lee-fixel-is-leaving-tiger-global/embed/#?secret=cbGFxXLGw3" data-secret="cbGFxXLGw3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Whether the firm eventually replaces Fixel is an open question, though it doesn&#8217;t appear to be the plan. Tiger Global is known for grooming investors within its operations rather than hiring outsiders, so a new top lieutenant would almost surely come from its current team.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the firm&#8217;s private equity arm &#8212; which has written everything from Series A checks (Warby Parker) to checks in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars &#8212; is currently managing assets of $30 million, compared with the $49 billion that Tiger is managing more broadly.</p>
<p>A year ago, Tiger Global, which employs 100 people altogether, was reportedly managing <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiger-global-raises-3-75-billion-venture-fund-11579887013">$36.2 billion</a> in assets.</p>
<p>According to the outfit&#8217;s investor letter, the firm&#8217;s gross internal rate of return across its 12 previous funds is 32%, while its net IRR is 24%.</p>
<p>Tiger Global&#8217;s investors include a mix of sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments, pensions and its own employees, who are collectively believed to be the firm&#8217;s biggest investors at this point.</p>
<p>Some of Tiger Global&#8217;s biggest wins to date have included a $200 million bet on the e-commerce giant JD.com that produced a $5 billion for the firm. According to the WSJ, it also cleared more than $1 billion on the Chinese online-services platform Meituan, which went public in 2018.</p>

<p>Tiger Global also reportedly reaped <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/tiger-global-is-said-to-reap-3-billion-from-flipkart-investment">$3 billion</a> from majority sale of India&#8217;s Flipkart to Walmart in 2018,  though the Indian government has more recently been <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/tiger-global-moves-delhi-high-court-against-flipkart-tax-ruling-11600702202999.html">trying to recover $1.9 billion</a> from the firm, claiming it has outstanding tax due on the sale of its share in the company.</p>
<p>One outcome that might surprise even Tiger Global&#8217;s investors ties to the connected fitness company Peloton, 20% of which the firm owned at the time of Peloton&#8217;s  2019 IPO (a deal that Fixel reportedly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/07/01/lee-fixel-raises-1-billion-fund-addition/?sh=7f5c48eb19a1">brought to the table</a>, along with Flipkart). By adding new users throughout the pandemic, Peloton &#8212; which was valued by private investors at $4 billion and doubled in value immediately as a publicly traded company &#8212; now boasts a market cap of $48.6 billion.</p>
<p>Tiger Global has invested its current fund in roughly 50 companies over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Among its newest bets is <a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a>, an eight-year-old, San Francisco-based digital lending platform that yesterday announced <a href="https://finledger.com/2021/01/13/blend-raises-300-million-series-g-at-3-3-billion-valuation/">$300 million in Series G funding</a>, including from Coatue, at a post-money valuation of $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>It also led the newly announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">$450 million Series C round</a> for Checkout.com, an eight-year-old, London-based online payments platform that is now valued at $15 billion. And it wrote a follow-on check to Cockroach Labs, the nearly six-year-old, New York-based distributed SQL database that just raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-scores-160m-series-e-on-2b-valuation/"> $160 million in Series E funding</a> at a $2 billion valuation, just eight months after raising an $86.6 million Series D round.</p>

<p>Another of its newest, biggest bets centers on the online education platform Zuowebang, in China. Back in June, Tiger Global co-led a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zuoyebang-fundraiisng/chinese-online-tutor-zuoyebang-raises-750-million-in-fresh-round-idUSKBN240093">$750 million Series E round</a> in the company.</p>
<p>Last month, it was back again, co-leading a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-online-education-startup-draws-061425152.html">$1.6 billion round</a> in the distance-learning company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s official. 2020 was one of the warmest years on record, either edging out or coming in just behind 2016 for the warmest year in recorded history according to data from U.S. government agencies (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had the year just tied with 2016, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put the figure just behind 2016&#8217;s totals).</p>
<p>No matter the ranking, the big picture for the climate isn&#8217;t pretty, according to scientists from NASA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/">Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a> (GISS) in New York and the Washington, DC-based NOAA.</p>
<p>“The last seven years have been the warmest seven years on record, typifying the ongoing and dramatic warming trend,” said GISS Director <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/gschmidt/">Gavin Schmidt</a>, in a statement. “Whether one year is a record or not is not really that important – the important things are long-term trends. With these trends, and as the human impact on the climate increases, we have to expect that records will continue to be broken.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>That&#8217;s a dire message for the nation considering the cost of last year&#8217;s record-breaking <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/"> 22 weather and climate disasters.</a> At least 262 people died and scores more were injured by climate-related disasters, according to the NOAA.</p>
<p>And the combination of wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, tornados, tropical cyclones and severe weather events like hail storms in Texas and the derecho that wrecked the Midwest cost the nation $95 billion.</p>

<p>Both organizations track temperature trends to get some sort of picture of the impact that human activities &#8212; specifically greenhouse gas emissions &#8212; have on the planet. The image that comes into focus is that human activity has already contributed to increasing Earth&#8217;s average temperature by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the industrial age took hold in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Most troubling to scientists is that this year&#8217;s near record-setting temperatures happened without a boost from the climatic weather phenomenon known as El Niño, which is a large-scale ocean-atmosphere climate interaction linked to a periodic warming.</p>
<p>“The previous record warm year, 2016, received a significant boost from a strong El Niño. The lack of a similar assist from El Niño this year is evidence that the background climate continues to warm due to greenhouse gases,” Schmidt said, in a statement.</p>
<p>The warming trends the word is experiencing are most pronounced in the Arctic, according to NASA. There, temperatures have warmed three times as a fast as the rest of the globe over the past 30 years, Schmidt said. The loss of Arctic sea ice &#8212; whose annual minimum area is declining by about 13% per decade &#8212; makes the region less reflective, which means more sunlight is being absorbed by oceans, causing temperatures to climb even more.</p>
<p>These accelerating effects of climate change could be perilous for the world at large, Katharine Hayhoe, a professor at Texas Tech University <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/2020-tied-for-hottest-year-on-record/">wrote in an email to The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p class=" font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest pb-md mw-md ma-auto pr-sm pl-sm ">&#8220;What keeps us climate scientists up in the dead of night is wondering what we don’t know about the self-reinforcing or vicious cycles in the Earth’s climate system,&#8221; Hayhoe wrote. &#8220;The further and faster we push it beyond anything experienced in the history of human civilization on this planet, the greater the risk of serious and even dangerous consequences. And this year, we’ve seen that in spades&#8230; It’s no longer a question of when the impacts of climate change will manifest themselves: They are already here and now. The only question remaining is how much worse it will get.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Tesla is arguably the most interesting connected consumer hardware company since Apple exploded in scale with the success of the iPhone."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer hardware has always been a tough market to crack, but the COVID-19 crisis made it even harder.</p>
<p>TechCrunch surveyed five key investors who touch different aspects of the consumer electronics industry, based on our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/?verticals=576769646">TechCrunch List</a> of top VCs recommended by founders, along with other sources.</p>
<p>We asked these investors the same six questions, and each provided similar thoughts, but different approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ggvc.com/ggv_employee/hans-tung/">Hans Tung</a>, managing partner, GGV Capital</li>
<li>Dayna Grayson, co-founder and general partner, <a href="https://www.constructcap.com">Construct Capital</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sosv.com/team/cyril-ebersweiler/">Cyril Ebersweiler</a>, general partner, SOSV</li>
<li><a href="https://luxcapital.com/team/bilal-zuberi/">Bilal Zuberi</a>, partner, Lux Capital</li>
<li><a href="https://www.shasta.vc/bio/rob-coneybeer/">Rob Coneybeer</a>, managing director, Shasta Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the pandemic, each identified bright spots in the consumer electronic world. One thing is clear, investors are generally bullish on at-home fitness startups. Multiple respondents cited Peloton, Tonal and Mirror as recent highlights in consumer electronics.</p>
<p>Said Shasta Venture&#8217;s Rob Coneybeer, &#8220;With all due respect to my friends at Nest (where Shasta was a Series A investor), Tonal is the most exciting consumer connected hardware company I’ve ever been involved with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides asking about the trends and opportunities they&#8217;re pursuing in 2021, the investors we spoke to also identified other investors, founders and companies who are leaders in consumer hardware and shared how they&#8217;ve reshaped their investment strategies during the pandemic. Their responses have been edited for space and clarity.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Hans Tung, GGV Capital</h2>
<p><strong>Which consumer hardware sector shows the most promise for explosive growth?</strong></p>
<p>For consumer hardware, offering end users a differentiated experience is extremely important. Social interactions, gamification and high-quality PGC (professionally generated content) such as with Peloton, Xiaomi and Tonal is a must to drive growth. It’s also easy to see how the acceleration of the digital economy created by COVID-19 will also drive growth for hardware.</p>
<p>First, services improved by the speed and reliability of 5G such as live streaming, gaming, cloud computing, etc. will create opportunity for new mobile devices and global mass market consumers will continue to demand high-quality, low-cost hardware. For example, Arevo is experimenting with “hardware as a service” with a 3D printing facility in Vietnam.</p>
<p>For enterprise hardware, security, reliability and fast updates are key competitive advantages. Also as a result of 5G… manufacturing automation and industrial applications. Finally IoT for health and safety may find its sweet spot thanks to COVID-19 with new wearables that track sleep, fitness and overall wellness.</p>
<p><strong>How did COVID-19 change consumer hardware and your investment strategy?</strong></p>
<p>One opportunity for consumer hardware companies to consider as a result of COVID-19 is how they engage with their customers. They should think of themselves more like e-commerce companies, where user experience, ongoing engagement with the consumer and iteration based on market feedback rule the day. While Peloton had this approach well before COVID, it has built a $46 billion company thinking about their products in this way.</p>
<p>For example, some consumers felt the bike was too expensive so instead of responding with a low-end product, the company partnered with Affirm to make their hardware more affordable with pay-as-you-go plans. A Peloton bike is not a one-and-done purchase; there is constant interaction between users, and the company that drives more satisfaction in the hardware adds more value in the business.</p>
<p><strong>Entering 2021, in what way is hardware still hard?</strong></p>
<p>Hardware is still hard because it takes more to iterate fast. The outcome for competitors relative to speed-to-market can be dramatic. For example, every year I look at future generation of EVs with lots of innovations and cool features from existing OEMs but see very few of these making it to market compared to Tesla and other pure players that are cranking out vehicles. Their speed of execution is impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Who are some leaders in consumer hardware &#8212; founders, companies, investors?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>John Foley, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/">Peloton</a>. John and the Peloton team have cracked the code on the integration of community experience and hardware.</li>
<li>Sonny Vu, founder of Misfit and founder/CEO of <a href="http://www.arevo.com">Arevo</a>, maker of ultrastrong, lightweight continuous carbon fiber products on demand. Experienced founder and team with 3D printing manufacturing know-how at scale are now able to offer breakthrough consumer and industrial products at competitive prices.</li>
<li>Manu Jain, head of <a href="https://www.mi.com/">Xiaomi</a>’s business in India where Xiaomi is the #1-selling smart phone. He built the Indian operation from the ground up; had zero dollar marketing budget for the first three years; and localized manufacturing for all Xiaomi phones sold in India.</li>
<li>Jim Xiao, founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.bymason.com">Mason</a>, a rising star who is creating &#8220;mobile infrastructure as a service.&#8221;</li>
<li>Irving Fain, founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.boweryfarming.com">Bowery Farming</a>. Irving and his team are on a mission to reimagine modern farming.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you would like to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong></p>
<p>Worry less about trends and build products that resonate with customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ispot.tv">ISpot.tv</a> announced today that it has acquired <a href="https://www.acemetrix.com">Ace Metrix</a>, a deal that brings two TV and video ad measurement companies together.</p>
<p>ISpot founder and CEO Sean Muller said that the companies have complementary solutions. After all, he said, &#8220;In simple terms, there are only two reasons why brands buy advertising — one is to deliver business results and the other is to build brand recognition, likability and impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The existing iSpot platform excels in the first area, Muller said, measuring the reach and conversation rates of ads that run on both TV and streaming. Ace Metrix, on the other hand, measures how an ad affects consumer sentiment — so by bringing the two companies together, it can offer &#8220;a complete solution in one platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Muller added that measuring the brand impact of an ad has become even more important as marketers try to navigate a constantly changing news landscape (to put it mildly).</p>
<p>&#8220;Brands are being forced to have a say in politics and all sorts of things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Understanding the way your messages are being perceived is crucially important &#8230; When you invest in a piece of creative, it becomes even more important to ensure that your message is on point and triggers the right emotions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Muller also noted that Ace had annualized SaaS revenues &#8220;north of the double digit millions&#8221; and that it was cashflow positive. The combined company has annual contracts with more than 500 brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re integrating the companies together very quickly — it&#8217;s already underway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be one company, one vision and so the Ace products become part of the iSpot product suite. But we will maintain the Ace name for those products.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Philips Hue bulbs are pretty great, but they have a mortal enemy: the humble light switch. If you&#8217;ve got a Hue bulb tied to a standard light switch, flipping that switch means the Hue bulb loses power completely&#8230; along with any fancy tricks like controlling the bulb through your phone or a voice assistant.</p>
<p>A few solutions for this exist, but mostly involve swapping out the switch in question for something with a bit more smarts. This morning Signify (the company previously known as Philips Lighting) announced an official solution that works with your existing switches, albeit with a caveat or two.</p>
<p>Called the &#8220;wall switch module,&#8221; it&#8217;s expected to ship later this year — spring if you&#8217;re in Europe, or summer if you&#8217;re in North America. Once wired up, it turns your existing light switch into something more like a Hue controller, allowing it to toggle between different light presets rather than simply cutting power.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At $40 each (or $70 for a two-pack), it&#8217;s&#8230; not cheap. Add in the fact that it&#8217;s powered by a battery (presumably to remove the need for a neutral wire and simplify installation) with an estimated lifespan of ~five years, this probably isn&#8217;t something you want to implement house-wide. But for a single light switch or two, it seems like a decent solution.</p>
<p><strong>The company also announced a few new Hue accessories, in case you&#8217;re looking to expand your collection: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A revised version of its portable dimmer switch, which will ship in February and cost $25. The separate on/off buttons are becoming a single toggle, and a &#8220;Hue&#8221; button is being added to let you trigger a specific lighting scene.</li>
<li>A new light bar, the Philips Hue Amarant, which is meant to live outside and be mounted on the ground or an overhang. It&#8217;ll ship in March in North America, and cost $170 each (though you&#8217;ll also need an outdoor Hue power supply box, which will add $60-$70 to the price if you don&#8217;t have one already.)</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> is <a href="https://blog.medium.com/medium-acquires-social-ebook-platform-glose-cf2e94485d8">acquiring</a> Paris-based startup <a href="https://glose.com/what-is-glose">Glose</a> for an undisclosed amount. Glose has been building iOS, Android and web apps that let you buy, download and read books on your devices.</p>
<p>The company has turned reading into a multiplayer experience, as you can build a bookshelf, share notes with your followers and start conversations in the margins. Sure, there are social platforms that let you talk about books, such as Goodreads. But Glose&#8217;s differentiating point is that the social features are intrinsically linked with the reading features — those aren&#8217;t two separate platforms. There are also some gamification features that help you stay motivated as you read difficult books — you get streak rewards for instance.</p>
<p>In many ways, Glose’s one-tap highlighting and commenting features are reminiscent of Medium’s features on this front. You can highlight text in any reading app on your phone or tablet but you can’t do much with it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More recently, Glose has launched a separate service called <a href="https://glose.education">Glose Education</a>. As the name suggests, that version is tailored for universities and high schools. Teachers can hand out assignments and you can read a book as a group.</p>
<p>More than 1 million people have used Glose and 25 universities have signed up to Glose Education, including Stanford and Columbia University.</p>
<p>But Glose isn’t just a software play. The company has also put together a comprehensive bookstore. The company has partnered with 20,000 publishers so that you can buy e-books directly from the app.</p>
<p>And if you are studying Virginia Wolf this semester, Glose also provides hundreds of thousands of public domain books for free. Glose also supports audio books.</p>
<p>This is by far the most interesting part, as Medium now plans to expand beyond articles and blogs. While Glose is sticking around for now, Medium also plans to integrate e-books and audio books to its service.</p>
<p>It’s a smart move, as many prolific bloggers are also book writers. Right now, they write a blog post on Medium and link to a third-party site if you want to buy their books. Having the ability to host everything written by an author is a better experience for both content creators and readers.</p>
<p>“We’re impressed not only by Glose&#8217;s reading products and technology, but also by their experience in partnering with book authors and publishers,&#8221; Medium CEO Ev Williams said in a statement. “Books are a means of exploring an idea, a way to go deeper. The vast majority of the world’s ideas are stored in books and journals, yet are hardly searchable nor shareable. With Glose, we want to improve that experience within Medium’s large network of engaged readers and writers. We look forward to working with the Glose team on partnering with publishers to help authors reach more readers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Glose team will remain in Paris, which means that Medium is opening its first office outside of the U.S. Glose will continue to honor its partnerships with authors, publishers, schools and institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Confusion over an update to Facebook-owned chat platform WhatsApp&#8217;s terms and conditions has triggered an intervention by Italy&#8217;s data protection agency.</p>
<p>The Italian GPDP said today it has contacted the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to raise concerns about a lack of clear information over what&#8217;s changing under the incoming T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p>In recent weeks WhatsApp has been alerting users they must accept new T&amp;Cs in order to keep using the service after February 8.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A similar alert over updated terms has also triggered concerns in India &#8212; where a petition was filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">today</a> in the Delhi High Court alleging the new terms are a violation of users&#8217; fundamental rights to privacy and pose a threat to national security.</p>
<p>In a notification on its <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9519943">website</a> the Italian agency writes that it believes it is not possible for WhatsApp users to understand the changes that are being introduced under the new terms, nor to &#8220;clearly understand which data processing will actually be carried out by the messaging service after February 8.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096622" style="width: 428px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096622" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2096622" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3399.png?w=418" alt="" width="418" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3399.png 737w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3399.png?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3399.png?resize=185,300 185w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3399.png?resize=418,680 418w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_3399.png?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096622" class="wp-caption-text">Screengrab of the T&amp;Cs alert being shown to WhatsApp users in Europe. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch.</p></div></p>
<p>For consent to be a valid legal basis for processing personal data under EU law the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that users are properly informed of each specific use and given a free choice over whether their data is processed for each purpose.</p>
<p>The Italian agency adds that it reserves the right to intervene &#8220;as a matter of urgency&#8221; in order to protect users and enforce EU laws on the protection of personal data.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the EDPB with questions about the GPDP&#8217;s intervention. The steering body&#8217;s role is typically to act as a liaison between EU DPAs. But it also issues guidance on the interpretation of EU law and can step in to cast the deciding vote in cases where there is disagreement on cross-border EU investigations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/11/turkey-investigates-whatsapp-and-facebook-over-data-privacy-update">Earlier this week</a> Turkish antitrust authorities also announced they are investigating WhatsApp&#8217;s updated T&amp;Cs &#8212; objecting to what they claimed are differences in how much data will be shared with Facebook under the new terms in Europe and outside.</p>
<p>While on Monday, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission &#8212; which is WhatsApp&#8217;s lead data regulator in the EU &#8212; told us the messaging app has given it a commitment EU users are not affected by any broader change to data-sharing practices. So Facebook&#8217;s lead regulator in the EU has not raised any objections to the new WhatsApp T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p>WhatsApp itself has also claimed there are no changes at all to its data sharing practices anywhere in the world under this update.</p>
<p>Clearly there&#8217;s been a communications failure somewhere along the chain &#8212; which makes the Italian objection to a lack of clarity in the wording of the new T&amp;Cs seem reasonable.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the GDPD&#8217;s intervention, a WhatsApp spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are reviewing the Garante&#8217;s announcement regarding WhatsApp&#8217;s Privacy Policy update. We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way or require Italian users to agree to new data-sharing practices with Facebook. Instead, this update provides further transparency about how we collect and use data, as well as clarifying changes related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional. We remain committed to providing everyone in Italy with private end-to-end encrypted messaging.</p></blockquote>
<p>How exactly the Italian agency could intervene over the WhatsApp T&amp;Cs is an interesting question. (And, indeed, we&#8217;ve reached out to the GPDP with questions.)</p>
<p>The GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism means cross-border complaints get funneled through a lead data supervisor where a company has its main regional base (Ireland in WhatsApp&#8217;s case). But as noted above, Ireland has &#8212; thus far &#8212; said it doesn&#8217;t have a problem with WhatsApp&#8217;s updated T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p>However under the GDPR, other DPAs do have powers to act off their own bat when they believe there is a pressing risk to users&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Such as, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">2019</a>, when the Hamburg DPA ordered Google to stop manual reviews of snippets of Google Assistant users&#8217; audio (which it had been reviewing as part of a grading program).</p>
<p>In that case Hamburg informed Google of its intention to use the GDPR&#8217;s Article 66 powers &#8212; which allows a national agency to order data processing to stop if it believes there is “an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects” &#8212; which immediately led to Google suspending human reviews across Europe.</p>
<p>The tech giant later amended how the program operates. The Hamburg DPA didn&#8217;t even need to <em>use</em> Article 66 &#8212; just the mere threat of the order to stop processing was enough.</p>
<p>Some 1.5 years later and there are signs many EU data protection agencies &#8212; outside a couple of key jurisdictions that oversee the lion&#8217;s share of big tech &#8212; are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/further-delay-to-gdpr-enforcement-of-2018-twitter-breach/">becoming frustrated</a> by perceived regulatory inaction against big tech.</p>
<p>So there may be an increased willingness among these agencies to resort to creative procedures of their own to protect citizens&#8217; data. (And it&#8217;s certainly interesting to note that France&#8217;s CNIL recently slapped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">Amazon and Google with big fines over cookie consents</a> &#8212; acting under the ePrivacy Directive, which does not include a GDPR-style one-stop-shop mechanism.)</p>
<p>In related news this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">week</a>, an opinion by an advisor to the EU&#8217;s top court also appears to be responding to concern at GDPR enforcement bottlenecks.</p>
<p>In the opinion <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-01/cp210001en.pdf">Advocate General Bobek takes the view</a> that the law allows national DPAs to bring their own proceedings in certain situations &#8212; including in order to adopt “urgent measures” or to intervene “following the lead data protection authority having decided not to handle a case.”</p>
<p>The CJEU ruling on that case is still pending but the court tends to align with the position of its advisors so it seems likely we&#8217;ll see data protection enforcement activity increasing across the board from EU DPAs in the coming years, rather than being stuck waiting for a few DPAs to issue all the major decisions.</p>

<p>The decision from Taco Bell, a subsidiary of Yum Brands,<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/taco-bell-will-not-be-adding-fake-meat-from-beyond-meat-to-its-menu.html"> is a departure from the Mexican fast food chain&#8217;s commitment to go it alone</a> as it developed new vegetarian menu items.</p>
<p>“We’ve looked. We’ve met with Beyond, we’ve met with Impossible — our head of innovation knows everybody, and they all know her,” Julie Felss Masino, Taco Bell’s president of North American operations, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/taco-bell-will-not-be-adding-fake-meat-from-beyond-meat-to-its-menu.html">told CNBC back in 2019</a>. “But I think what we’re proud of is that we’ve been doing vegetarian for 57 years.”</p>
<p>Now the company wants más alternative proteins from the Southern California alternative protein provider. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have long been a leader in the vegetarian space, but this year, we have more meatless options in store that vegetarians, veggie-curious and even meat-eaters will love,&#8221; said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell&#8217;s Global Chief Food Innovation Officer. </span></p>
<p>Taco Bell boasts that it already has over 30 vegetarian ingredients on the U.S. menu, but its lack of protein alternatives was noticeable, as many of its competitors embraced the meat substitute craze.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most developers don&#8217;t enjoy writing documentation for their code and that makes life quite a bit harder when a new team member tries to get started on working on a company&#8217;s codebase. And even when there are documentation or in-line comments in the source code, that&#8217;s often not updated, and, over time, that information becomes close to irrelevant. <a href="https://swimm.io/">Swimm</a>, which today announced that it has raised a $5.7 million seed round, aims to automate as much of this process as possible after the initial documentation has been written by automatically updating it as changes are made.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Pitango First, with TAU Ventures, Axon Ventures and FundFire also investing in this round, together with a group of angel investors that include the founder of developer platform Snyk.</p>

<p>Swimm&#8217;s marketing mostly focuses on helping teams speed up onboarding, but it&#8217;s probably a useful tool for any team. Using Swimm, you can create the standard &#8212; but auto-updated &#8212; documentation, but also walkthroughs and tutorials. Using its code browser, you also can easily find all of the documentation that relates to a given file.</p>
<p>The nifty part here is that while the tool can&#8217;t write the documentation for you, Swimm will automatically update any code examples in the documentation for you &#8212; or alert you when there is a major change that needs a manual update. Ideally, this will reduce the drift between the codebase and documentation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096561" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plans-scroll-4x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096561" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2096561" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plans-scroll-4x.png?w=680" alt="" width="348" height="261" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plans-scroll-4x.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plans-scroll-4x.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plans-scroll-4x.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plans-scroll-4x.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plans-scroll-4x.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plans-scroll-4x.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plans-scroll-4x.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2096561" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Swimm</p></div></p>
<p>The founding team members &#8212; Oren Toledano (CEO), Omer Rosenbaum (CTO), Gilad Navot (chief product officer) and Tom Ahi Dror (chief business officer) &#8212; started working on this problem based on their experience while running <a href="https://www.itc.tech/">Israel Tech Challenge</a>, a coding bootcamp inspired by the training program used by the Israeli Defence Forces&#8217; 8200 Intelligence Unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We met with many companies in Israel and in the U.S. to understand the engineering onboarding process,&#8221; Toledano told me. &#8220;And we felt that it was kind of broken &#8212; and many times, we heard the sentence: &#8216;we throw them to the water, and they either sink or swim.&#8217; &#8221; (That&#8217;s also why the company is called Swimm). Companies, he argues, often don&#8217;t have a way to train new employees on their code base, simply because it&#8217;s impossible for them to do so effectively without good documentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The larger the company is, the more scattered the knowledge on the code base is &#8212; and a lot of this knowledge leaves the company when developers leave,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>With Swimm, a company could ideally not just offer those new hires access to tutorials that are based on the current code base, but also an easier entryway to start working on the production codebase as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096582" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096582" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2096582" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-swimm_ig-product@3x.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2096582" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Swimm</p></div></p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s worth noting here is that developers run Swimm locally on a developer&#8217;s machine. In part, that&#8217;s because this approach reduces the security risks since no code is ever sent to Swimm&#8217;s servers. Indeed, the Swimm team tells me that some of its early customers are security companies. It also makes it easier for new users to get started with Swimm.</p>
<p>Toledano tells me that while the team mostly focused on building the core of the product and working with its early design partners (and its first set of paying customers), the plan for the next few months is to bring on more users after launching the product&#8217;s beta.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Software development is now at the core of every modern business. <span class="il">Swimm</span> provides a structured, contextual and transparent way to improve developer productivity,&#8221; said Yair Cassuto, a partner at Pitango First who is joining <span class="il">Swimm</span>&#8216;s board. &#8220;<span class="il">Swimm</span>’s solution allows for rapid and insightful onboarding on any codebase. This applies across the developer life cycle: from onboarding to project transitions, adopting new open source capabilities and even offboarding.&#8221;                        <wbr></wbr>                                                           <wbr></wbr></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a brief announcement today, the Canadian nuclear fusion technology developer <a href="https://generalfusion.com/">General Fusion</a> announced that the investment firm created by Shopify founder Tobias Lütke has joined the company&#8217;s cap table.</p>
<p>The size of the investment made by Lütke&#8217;s Thistledown Capital was not disclosed, but with the addition, General Fusion has the founders of the two biggest e-commerce companies in the Western world on its cap table.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, first invested in the company nearly a decade ago and General Fusion has been steadily raising cash since that time. In 2019, the company hauled in $100 million. That capital commitment is part of a haul totaling at least, $192 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/general-fusion">according to Crunchbase</a> although the real figure is likely higher.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, General Fusion <a href="https://generalfusion.com/2020/07/general-fusion-brings-in-more-large-global-investors/">kept adding cash</a> throughout 2020 as it looked to develop its demonstration fusion reactor.</p>
<p>General Fusion&#8217;s process is based on technology called magnetized target fusion (MTF), first proposed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab and developed in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The process involves creating a magnetically confined moderately warm plasma of around 100 eV (roughly 50 times the photon energy of visible light) in a flux conserver (a shell that preserves the magnetic field). By rapidly compressing the flux conserver and the magnetic field inside of it surrounding the plasma, the plasma is superheated to a temperature that can initiate a fast fusion burn and create a fusion reaction, <a href="https://generalfusion.com/2017/06/tokamak-compression-experiments-general-fusion-cap-congress/">according to a 2017 description of the technology</a> from General Fusion&#8217;s chief science officer and founder, Michel Laberge.</p>
<p>The company uses a roughly three-meter sphere filled with molten lead-lithium that&#8217;s pumped to form a cavity. A pulse of magnetically confined plasma fuel is then injected into the cavity. Then, around the sphere, pistons create a pressure wave into the middle of the sphere, compressing the plasma to fusion conditions.</p>
<p>Neutrons escaping from the fusion reaction are captured in the liquid metal, and the heat from that metal generates electricity via a steam turbine. A heat exchanger steam turbine produces the power and the steam is recycled to run the pistons.</p>
<p>In recent years, both General Fusion and its main North American competitor <a href="https://cfs.energy/">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</a> have made strides in getting their small-scale nuclear fusion technology ready for commercialization.</p>
<p>In the past, the wry joke about fusion technologies was that they were always 10 years away, but now companies are looking at a four-year horizon to bring fusion to initial markets, if not the masses.</p>
<p>For its part, Commonwealth Fusion Systems is in the process of building a 10-ton magnet that has the magnetic force equivalent to 20 MRI machines. “After we get the magnet to work, we’ll be building a machine that will generate more power than it takes to run. We see that as the Kitty Hawk moment [for fusion],” said Bob Mumgaard, the chief executive of Commonwealth Fusion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/with-84-million-in-new-cash-commonwealth-fusion-is-on-track-for-a-demonstration-fusion-reactor-by-2025/">in an interview last year</a>.</p>
<p>Other startup companies are also racing to bring technologies to market and hit the 2025 timeline like the United Kingdom’s <a href="https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/">Tokamak Energy</a>.</p>

<p>Like General Fusion, Commonwealth also has deep-pocketed backers including the Bill Gates-backed sustainable-technology-focused investor, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. In all, those investors have committed over $200 million to the company, which formally launched in 2018.</p>
<p>As these companies begin readying their technologies for market, governments are laying the groundwork to make it easier for them to commercialize.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/133/text?r=1&amp;s=3">signed the COVID relief and omnibus appropriations bill</a> that included an amendment to support the development of fusion energy in the U.S.</p>
<p>The new amendment directed the Department of Energy to carry out a fusion energy sciences research and development program; authorized DOE programs in inertial fusion energy and alternative concepts to find new ways forward for fusion power; reauthorized the INFUSE program to create public-private partnerships between national labs and fusion developers; and created a milestone-based development program to support companies not just through R&amp;D, but into the construction of full-scale systems.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this milestone program that was a cornerstone of the policy work that the Fusion Industry Association wanted to see in the U.S., according to a December statement from the organization.</p>
<p>By unlocking $325 million in financing over a five-year period, the U.S. government will actually double its research with matching contributions from the fusion industry. These demonstration facilities could go a long way toward accelerating the deployment of fusion technologies.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Thistledown Capital was formed to invest in tech that can decarbonize industry. The firm, based in Ottawa, has already backed CarbonCure, a technology that captures carbon dioxide from the air.</p>
<p>“<span class="il">General</span> <span class="il">Fusion</span> has a strong record of attracting funding support from some of the world’s most influential technology leaders,” said Greg Twinney, CFO, <span class="il">General</span> <span class="il">Fusion, in a statement.</span> “<span class="il">Fusion</span> is planet-saving technology, and we are proud to support the mission of Thistledown Capital in its pursuit for a greener tomorrow.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin launched its first mission of 2021, flying its New Shepard rocket in West Texas to a medium height of just over 350,000 feet. This is the first flight for this particular booster, and for the capsule it carried, which was equipped with a range of new passenger safety, control and comfort systems that Blue Origin was testing during flight for the first time. Also on board was a life-sized test dummy called &#8220;Mannequin Skywalker&#8221; that recorded information during the flight and landing that the Blue Origin will now review.</p>
<p>Based on the video stream and commentary from the company, this looks like a very successful test, including a takeoff, booster separation, controlled landing burn and touchdown &#8212; and a parachute-aided landing back on terra firma for the crew capsule. The mission didn&#8217;t carry any real passengers, although there were 50,000 postcards on board from school kids globally that have now officially been to space (past the Karman line) which will be returned to those students via Blue Origin&#8217;s nonprofit &#8220;Club for the Future.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is essentially what the mission will look like once Blue Origin actually begins to fly paying private astronauts to suborbital space as well; while we don&#8217;t have a timeline for when that&#8217;ll happen, today&#8217;s launch included key tests of a crew alert system that will provide anyone onboard with crucial mission information, as well as a new soft lining on the wall for protection during the weightless portion of the flight, as well as for sound and vibration dampening for the comfort of those on board. This capsule was also equipped with a carbon dioxide scrubber, which will be used to provide safe atmosphere for those within the capsule during the course of the flight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Parents with kids stuck learning at home during the pandemic have had to look for alternative activities to promote the hands-on learning experiences kids are missing out on due to attending class virtually. The New York-based educational technology startup <a href="https://thimble.io/">Thimble</a> aims to help address this problem by offering a subscription service for STEM-based projects that allow kids to make robotics, electronics and other tech using a combination of kits shipped to the home and live online instruction.</p>
<p>Thimble began back in 2016 as a Kickstarter project when it raised $300,000 in 45 days to develop its STEM-based robotics and programming kits. The next year, it began selling its kits to schools, largely in New York, for use in the classroom or in after-school programs. Over the years that followed, Thimble scaled its customer base to include around 250 schools across New York, Pennsylvania and California, which would buy the kits and gain access to teacher training.</p>
<p>But the COVID-19 pandemic changed the course of Thimble&#8217;s business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A lot of schools were in panic mode. They were not sure what was happening, and so their spending was frozen for some time,&#8221; explains Thimble co-founder and CEO Oscar Pedroso, whose background is in education. &#8220;Even our top customers that I would call, they would just give [say], &#8216;hey, this is not a good time. We think we&#8217;re going to be closing schools down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pedroso realized that the company would have to quickly pivot to begin selling directly to parents instead.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096509" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096509" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2096509" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set4.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set4.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set4.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set4.jpg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set4.jpg?resize=768,598 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set4.jpg?resize=680,529 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set4.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096509" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thimble</p></div></p>
<p>Around April, it made the shift &#8212; effectively entering the B2C market for the first time.</p>
<p>The company today offers parents a subscription that allows them to receive up to 15 different STEM-focused project kits and a curriculum that includes live instruction from an educator. One kit is shipped out over the course of three months, though an accelerated program is available that ships with more frequency.</p>
<p>The first kit is basic electronics, where kids learn how to build simple circuits, like a doorbell, kitchen timer and a music composer, for example. The kit is designed so kids can experience &#8220;quick wins&#8221; to keep their attention and whet their appetite for more projects. This leads into future kits like those offering a Wi-Fi robot, a little drone, an LED compass that lights up and a synthesizer that lets kids become their own DJ.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096505" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096505" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2096505" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set8-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set8-1.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set8-1.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set8-1.jpg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set8-1.jpg?resize=768,598 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set8-1.jpg?resize=680,529 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set8-1.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096505" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thimble</p></div></p>
<p>While any family can use the kits to help kids experience hands-on electronics and robotics, Pedroso says that about 70% of subscribers are those where the child already has a knack for doing these sorts of projects. The remaining 30% are those where the parents are looking to introduce the concepts of robotics and programming, to see if the kids show an interest. Around 40% of the students are girls.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thimble.io/subscriptions/">subscription</a> is more expensive than some DIY projects at $59.99/per month (or $47.99/mo if paid annually), but this is because it includes live instruction in the form of weekly one-hour Zoom classes. Thimble has part-time employees who are not just able to teach the material, but can do so in a way that appeals to children &#8212; by being passionate, energetic and capable of jumping in to help if they sense a child is having an issue or getting frustrated. Two of the five teachers are women. One instructor is bilingual and teaches some classes in Spanish.</p>

<p>During class, one teacher instructs while a second helps moderate the chat room and answer the questions that kids ask.</p>
<p>The live classes will have around 15-20 students each, but Thimble additionally offers a <a href="https://thimble.io/subscriptions-3/">package</a> for small groups that reduces class size. These could be used by homeschool &#8220;pods&#8221; or other groups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096508" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096508" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2096508" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set5.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set5.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set5.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set5.jpg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set5.jpg?resize=768,598 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set5.jpg?resize=680,529 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/creator-set5.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096508" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thimble</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We started hearing from pods and then micro-schools,&#8221; notes Pedroso. &#8220;Those were parents who were connected to other parents, and wanted their kids to be part of the same class. They generally required a little bit more attention and wanted some things a little more customized,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>These subscriptions are more expensive at $250/month, but the cost is shared among the group of parents, which brings the price down on per-household basis. Around 10% of the total customer base is on this plan, as most customers are individual families.</p>
<p>Thimble also works with several community programs and nonprofits in select markets that help to subsidize the cost of the kits to make the subscriptions more affordable. These are announced, as available, through schools, newsletters and other marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Since pivoting to subscriptions, Thimble has re-established a customer base and now has 1,110 paid customers. Some, however, are grandfathered in to an earlier price point, so Thimble needs to scale the business further.</p>
<p>In addition to Kickstarter, Thimble has raised funds and worked on the business over the year with the help of multiple accelerators, including LearnLaunch in Boston, Halcyon in D.C. and Telluride Venture Accelerator in Colorado.</p>
<p>The startup, co-founded by Joel Cilli in Pittsburgh, is now around 60% closed on its seed round of $1 million, but isn&#8217;t announcing details of that at this time.</p>
