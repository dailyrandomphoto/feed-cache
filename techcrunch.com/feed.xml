					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s Daily Crunch time for Monday, June 14. I will be standing in for <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alexander Wilhelm</a> while he’s off enjoying his time away from the news cycle &#8212; if I don’t have to report for jury duty.</p>
<p>Big news today! We launched the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/">Nubank EC-1</a>, an extensive look into one of the biggest startups in the world. More on this down below.</p>
<p>And have you heard that TechCrunch recently launched a new podcast? On “Found,” Darrell Etherington and Jordan Crook interview one early-stage startup founder each week about the ins and outs and ups and downs of founding a company. In the latest episode, the pair <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/how-one-founder-is-bringing-the-global-corporate-security-industry-out-of-the-dark-ages/">spoke to Cory Siskind</a>, founder of Base Operations, which earlier this year raised $2.2 million in seed funding to capitalize on its recent launch of a street-level threat-mapping platform for use in supporting enterprise security operations. Subscribe to “<a href="http://apple.co/found">Found” on Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or the <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.</p>

Version 15 has a lot of expectations riding on it, not least of which is the new multitasking features.</li>
<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/"><strong>You get a Google Workspace and you get a Google Workspace!</strong></a> The company announced today that Workspace, which has heretofore been known as G Suite, is open to everyone.

<h2>How contrarian hires and a pitch deck started Nubank’s $30 billion fintech empire</h2>
<p>Founded in 2013 and based in São Paulo, Brazil, Nubank serves more than 34 million customers, making it Latin America&#8217;s largest neobank.</p>
<p>Reporter Marcella McCarthy spoke to CEO David Velez to learn about his efforts to connect with consumers and overcome entrenched opposition from established players who were friendly with regulators.</p>
<p>In the first of a series of stories, she interviewed Velez about his early fundraising efforts. For a balanced perspective, she also spoke to early Nubank investors at Sequoia and Kaszek Ventures, Latin America&#8217;s largest venture fund, to find out why they funded the startup while it was still pre-product.</p>
<p>“There are people you come across in life that within the first hour of meeting with them, you know you want to work with them,” said Doug Leone, a global managing partner at Sequoia who&#8217;d recruited Velez after he graduated from grad school at Stanford.</p>
<p>Marcella also interviewed members of Nubank&#8217;s founding team to better understand why they decided to take a chance on a startup that faced such long odds of success.</p>
<p>“I left banking to make a fifth of my salary, and back then, about $5,000 in equity,” said Vitor Olivier, Nubank&#8217;s VP of operations and platforms.</p>
<p>“Financially, it didn’t really make sense, so I really had to believe that it was really going to work, and that it would be big.”</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/supreme-court-revives-linkedin-bid-to-protect-user-data-from-web-scrapers/">given LinkedIn another chance</a> to stop a rival company from scraping personal information from users’ public profiles, a practice LinkedIn says should be illegal but one that could have broad ramifications for internet researchers and archivists.</p>
<p>Battery recycling startup Redwood Materials, which was founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/redwood-materials-is-setting-up-shop-near-the-tesla-gigafactory-as-part-of-broader-expansion/">has purchased 100 acres of land</a> near the Gigafactory that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada. The company is trying to create a circular supply chain by collecting the scrap from consumer electronics companies and battery cell manufacturers, processing these discarded goods by extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and then supplying those back to Panasonic and other customers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/e3-2021-catch-up/">first and last all-virtual E3</a> gaming soiree kicked off today, with announcements from Microsoft, Square Enix and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>And rounding out today, we’ve got a review for you. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/beats-studio-buds-offer-a-compact-design-noise-canceling-and-android-ios-fast-pairing-at-150/">Beats Studio Buds</a> are a compact, noise-canceling and somewhat affordable alternative to AirPods.</p>

<p><em>This week, we talk to Anna Rubanova. A comedy writer-turned podcast producer, she&#8217;s worked on myriad podcasts, including &#8220;The Thrilling Adventure Hour&#8221; and &#8220;Election Profit Makers&#8221; (featuring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/how-i-podcast-election-profit-makers-david-rees/">recent How I Podcaster, David Rees</a>). Rubanova serves as an executive producer at Forever Dog and has hosted programs for WNYC Studios and Stitcher Premium. She co-produces and hosts the narrative sketch comedy show &#8220;<a href="http://www.lefthandedradio.com/">Left Handed Radio</a>&#8221; with Adam Bozarth. </em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I use my phone a lot. I used to write down ideas for sketches and would inevitably forget what made them good. &#8220;When I win the lottery, I’m gonna teach a fish how to smoke.&#8221; That&#8217;s in one of my notes and I have no idea what it&#8217;s referring to. With a voice memo, I can capture the feel of the bit immediately. The recording can serve as a jumping off point for a fully written sketch, maybe a prompt for improv. I might re-record it using a better mic or, screw it, use it as is. I go with whatever is funniest or, sometimes, good enough. You can always justify it later with context. With enough music, restoration or SFX, the worst-quality audio sounds intentional. Plus, there&#8217;s no point in doing something &#8220;correctly&#8221; in podcasting. It&#8217;s like trying to make the perfect sandwich. Anyone who thinks there&#8217;s one way to podcast or do radio or utilize two slices of bread is a fraud or a solipsist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of podcast perfection, Left Handed Radio is my everything. It&#8217;s a portfolio, creative outlet, comedy scrapbook and excuse to play with my best friend and partner in all things, Adam Bozarth. We make sketches, stream-of-consciousness monologues, anything that strikes us as funny or interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, we&#8217;ve accumulated a good deal of recording equipment. Nothing fancy: a couple of Zooms, two AudioTechnica 2020 USB mics, and a Rhode shotgun. Most of what we have was meant for DIY filmmaking. There was a post-YouTube short-form comedy boom about a decade ago. When all those branded content sites went down, we stopped messing with video and leaned harder into animation and podcasting. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrative audio is my passion. Podcasting is my job. Like I said, we don&#8217;t collect equipment but, as producers of up to 12 shows at a time, we needed to invest in plug-ins and software. The easiest DAW for dialogue has to be Audition. Logic is great for building out soundscapes and, obviously, music. We record remote calls to Audition and mark edit points like we would in a studio. (Thank you, Loopback!) Two years ago, I dropped a whopping $1,000 on restoration software. In the pandemic, that software has saved me hours of work. When everyone is recording from home, literally anything can go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days when clipping and plosives were our biggest concern. One time, a podcaster (i.e. someone with their own podcast) called into a show I was producing from a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rooftop party</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By the time I finished restoring the recording, nobody could tell. (Thank you, RX-7; I wish I could afford RX-8.) Plug-ins aren&#8217;t just useful, they can be delightful. We have one that can make audio sound like it&#8217;s coming from a loudspeaker underneath a woolen blanket. Have I found a good use for it? No, not yet. But I can imagine the possibilities.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, Google&#8217;s in-house incubator Area 120 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/google-launches-a-work-tracking-tool-and-airtable-rival-tables/">introduced</a> a new work-tracking tool called <a href="https://tables.area120.google.com/about">Tables</a>, an AirTable rival that allows for tracking projects more efficiently using automation. Today, Google says Tables will officially &#8220;graduate&#8221; from Area 120 to become an official Google product by joining Google Cloud, which it expects to complete in the next year.</p>
<p>The Tables project was started by long-time Google employee, now Tables&#8217; GM, Tim Gleason, who spent 10 years at the company and many more before that in the tech industry. He said he was inspired to work on Tables because he always had a difficult time tracking projects, as teams shared notes and tasks across different documents, which quickly got out of date.</p>
<p>Instead of tracking those sorts of notes and tasks associated with a project across various documents that have to be manually updated by team members, Tables uses bots to help take on some of the administrative duties involved in guiding team members through a project &#8212; like scheduling recurring email reminders when tasks are overdue, messaging a chat room when new forms are received, moving tasks to other people&#8217;s work queues, or updating tasks when schedules are changed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The team saw Tables as a potential solution for a variety of use cases, including of course project management, as well as IT operations, customer service tracking, CRM, recruiting, product development and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2049986" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2049986" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2049986" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=1536,1040 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2049986" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The service was launched last September to test product market fit, Google says, and quickly found traction.</p>
<p>According to VP/GM and Head of Platform for Google Cloud <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitzavery/">Amit Zavery</a>, early customer feedback was positive and the team saw customers adopting the service for multiple projects &#8212; another strong signal for its potential growth. He declined to say how many customers were already using the service, however.</p>
<p>The pandemic also likely played a role in Tables&#8217; adoption, Zavery noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you saw what happened with COVID, I think work-tracking became a pretty big area of interest for many customers who we&#8217;re speaking to,&#8221; he says, explaining that everyone was trying to quickly digitize.</p>
<p>Popular use cases included inventory management, healthcare supply tracking and use in mortgage-lending workflows. However, the team found Tables was adopted across a variety of industries beyond these, as hoped. On average, customers would use Tables in a department with around 30 to 40 people, they found.</p>
<p>Most customers were abandoning more manual processes to use Tables instead, not coming from a rival service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things were very fragmented in different documents or with different people, so using technologies like this really seems to have resonated very well,&#8221; Zavery says. &#8220;Now you had one central place for structured information you can access and do things on top of it versus trying to have 15 different sheets and figuring out how they are related because there&#8217;s no structure behind each of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another factor that prompted Tables&#8217; adoption was how quickly people could be productive, thanks in part to its ability to integrate with existing data warehouses and other services. Currently, Tables supports Office 365, Microsoft Access, Google Sheets, Slack, Salesforce, Box and Dropbox, for example.</p>
<p>Tables was one of only a few Area 120 projects to launch with a paid business model, along with ticket seller Fundo, conversational ads platform AdLingo and Google’s recently launched Orion WiFi. During its beta, an individual could use Tables for free, with support for up to 100 tables and 1,000 rows. The paid plan was supposed to cost $10 per user per month, with support for up to 1,000 tables and 10,000 rows. This plan also included support for larger attachments, more actions and advanced history, sharing, forms, automation and views.</p>
<p>However, Google never began charging for its paid tier during the beta, it says.</p>
<p>As Tables graduates into Google Cloud&#8217;s lineup, it will be integrated with Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-acquires-appsheet-to-bring-no-code-development-to-google-cloud/">no-code app building platform</a>, <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/">AppSheet</a>, which has a free tier, allowing the freemium model to continue. Users who want additional features will be able to upgrade to a premium plan. It will also be offered as a standalone product, for those who want that experience.</p>
<p>Google will leverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/">Workspace</a> to get Tables in front of more users, as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Lwu4WVpwPK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/">Google opens Workspace to everyone</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google opens Workspace to everyone&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/embed/#?secret=Lwu4WVpwPK" data-secret="Lwu4WVpwPK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;it&#8217;s going to be delivered through Workspace integration, because that&#8217;s a very large community of users who expect some similar kind of functionality,&#8221; Zavery says. &#8220;That will be a big differentiator, when you talk about the breadth of things we can do &#8212; because of having that community of users on Sheets, the things they do with Drive, and the data they collect &#8212; we can automatically add this and augment their experience.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2049988" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2049988" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2049988" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="505" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png 3232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=768,570 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=680,505 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=1536,1141 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=2048,1521 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2049988" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The project taps into the growing interest in no-code, spreadsheet-powered database platforms &#8212; like AirTable, for example, which had<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/airtable-raises-185m-and-launches-new-low-code-and-automation-features/"> closed on $185 million</a> in Series D funding in the days before Tables&#8217; release, valuing its business at $2.585 billion, post-money.</p>
<p>As Tables transitions to Google Cloud, the Tables beta version will remain free until a fully supported Cloud product becomes available in the next year. At that point, users will migrate to the new service.</p>
<p>Over time, Tables plans to add more functionality as it ties in with AppSheet, to make using the service more seamless &#8212; so people don&#8217;t have to hop around from one product to another to accomplish tasks. It will also work to provide better ease of use, mobile support and connectivity with more backend systems.</p>
<p>Official pricing hasn&#8217;t been finalized but shouldn&#8217;t be very different from the beta version.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automattic is expanding its lineup of online writing platforms with its acquisition of<a href="https://dayoneapp.com/"> Day One,</a> a popular journaling app for Mac and Apple mobile devices. The app has been downloaded more than 15 million times since its <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/a-message-to-day-one-users">March 2011 launch</a> on the Mac and iTunes App Store, offering users a private place to share their thoughts. Since then, it&#8217;s been awarded the App Store Editor’s Choice, App of the Year and the Apple Design Award, along with praise from various reviewers.</p>
<p>Deal terms were not immediately available. The companies were asked for comment.</p>
<p>The addition makes for an interesting expansion of Automattic&#8217;s now growing collection of online writing tools, which today include blogging platforms WordPress.com and Tumblr &#8212; the latter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/verizon-is-selling-tumblr-to-wordpress-parent-automattic/">as of 2019</a>, when Automattic took the aging social blogging network off parent company Verizon&#8217;s hands for a fraction of its earlier $1 billion acquisition price. (Verizon still owns TechCrunch, too&#8230;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">for now</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike WordPress and Tumblr, which tend to focus on publishing to a public audience, Day One&#8217;s focus has been on privacy. The app offers end-to-end encryption for all your journal entries, which can include text, media and even audio recordings. It has also offered advanced features like automatic backups, auto-import of Instagram posts, voice transcriptions, templates, rich text formatting, location history and optional printed books, as well as integrations with other platforms like Spotify, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and more.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Private equity firm Apollo to buy Verizon Media assets for $5B, will rename business &#8216;Yahoo&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/embed/#?secret=hH4MmT4gNq" data-secret="hH4MmT4gNq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With its addition to Automattic, Day One will allow users to choose to publish select journal entries to WordPress.com and Tumblr, and, soon, import content from either platform back into Day One, too. The app may also make sense as a way for existing Tumblr users to sync their private entries over to a more protected and backed-up writing tool &#8212; instead of accidentally publishing them to their main blog.</p>
<p>Automattic, <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/06/14/day-one-the-journaling-app-joins-automattic/">in an announcement</a>, notes Day One CEO Paul Mayne will continue to lead the development of Day One following the acquisition. The team will also remain intact.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/day-one-at-automattic"> in a blog post</a>, Mayne hints at why he sold the app, noting the deal will allow Day One access to the same technological, financial and security benefits that help power WordPress.com and Tumblr.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is incredibly exciting news. For the past 10 years since I started Day One, I’ve worked to not only create the best digital journaling experience in the world, but one that will last,&#8221; shares Mayne. &#8220;By joining Automattic, I’m now more confident than ever that the preservation and longevity of Day One is sure,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Mayne also noted there were no current plans to change the private nature of Day One, but the app would integrate with other Automattic products going forward, while continuing to sustain itself via a subscription model.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every day in the United States, more than 100 people die because of a car crash. Some are teenagers, like the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-30/writer-michael-lewis-tabitha-soren-daughter-dies-in-crash">daughter of writer Michael Lewis and Tabitha Soren, and her boyfriend</a>, who died in a wrong-way crash. Some are well known, like Kevin Clark, who played the drummer in “School of Rock,” who was <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/5/26/22454359/kevin-clark-dies-school-of-rock-crash-avondale-western-chicago">hit and killed by a driver while bikin<span style="text-decoration: underline;">g</span></a>. Others are not household names, like <a href="https://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/police-charge-26-year-old-woman-in-connection-to-fatal-dwi-related-crash/6125812/">Janell Katesigwa, who was killed by a drunk driver in Albuquerque, New Mexico,</a> and left behind four children.</p>
<p>Something else happens every day, too: a lack of congressional urgency to require available technology to prevent the next tragedy.</p>
<p>Sadly, what is stopping advanced technology from preventing these deaths is business as usual in Washington, which means a lot of talk about saving lives, but little action.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Vehicle safety is based on using layers of protection that have led to a five-fold reduction in the occurrence of car crash deaths in the United States over the last 50 years.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Existing advanced vehicle safety technology, such as driver monitoring systems, automatic emergency braking and lane-departure warnings, can dramatically reduce crashes like the three described above &#8212; and the thousands of others that are a result of drunk, drugged, drowsy and distracted driving.</p>
<p>But only if the technology becomes standard equipment in new vehicles. When technology &#8212; underwritten by standards, bolstered by oversight and backstopped by accountability &#8212; can annually spare tens of thousands of families from tragedy, our federal government must act.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks and months, Congress will debate the future of motor vehicles in the United States. The debate will be focused on renewing the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act, which is also referred to as the “highway bill.”</p>
<p>But make no mistake: While issues such as the future of the gas tax and arcane parliamentary procedures will grab headlines, vital decisions will be made about whether the growing and preventable public health crisis of car crash deaths will be prioritized or once again considered non-essential.</p>
<p>Despite the estimated <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic">38,680 highway fatalities</a> last year, which represented a 7.2% increase over 2019, some federal policymakers have failed to focus on available remedies that would result in fewer funerals and a reduction in lifelong debilitating injuries.</p>
<p>Perhaps the delay is a result of too many in Congress who believe the only available solution is rushing unsupervised driverless vehicles into the marketplace. Even if a green light for mass driverless vehicle production were given today, it would be decades before they could make a significant impact on improving overall safety. This single-minded focus on a unicorn to fix all transportation issues misunderstands the technical challenges and misreads the public mood.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/aaa-survey-finds-86-of-drivers-afraid-to-ride-in-automated-vehicles/">AAA survey found 86% of respondents</a> would not trust riding in driverless vehicles, <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2021/05/drivers-should-know-if-they-are-sharing-the-road-with-self-driving-test-vehicles/">while another found consumers do not feel comfortable sharing the road with them</a>. The technology industry’s habit of beta-testing unproven software on the public, combined with car companies’ track record of delaying safety in exchange for profit, will not increase consumer trust of the safety, inclusivity and equity of driverless technology.</p>
<p>Vehicle safety is based on using layers of protection that have led to a five-fold reduction in the occurrence of car crash deaths in the United States over the last 50 years. Seatbelts and airbags protect you when you crash. Electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes help you avoid rolling over. Regulations provide minimum levels of performance and recalls serve as a backstop to provide oversight when there is a defect.</p>
<p>It is hard to remember, but there was once a time when dual braking systems, intended to provide a safe stop even in the event of a catastrophic failure of one braking system, were considered revolutionary. Now such a layer of protection is standard.</p>
<p>At a time when the promise of automated vehicle technology could make or break America’s place atop the automobile industry, many in Congress want to ignore history and cut away layers of protection to rush driverless vehicles into the marketplace. One Senate proposal creates a fast track for manufacturers to sell tens of thousands of automated vehicles based on a flimsy promise that their vehicle is as safe as the least safe vehicle meeting current minimum standards. No one should forget that the Ford Pinto met all the minimum standards when it was recalled for exploding upon impact when hit from behind. Driverless vehicles should be held to a higher standard than the minimum.</p>
<p>Congress has an opportunity to help build public trust in the safety of driverless technology by requiring existing innovations that will be the building blocks of driverless vehicles into cars right away, with immediate benefits. For example, in the future, automated vehicles will need driver monitoring systems to make smooth handoffs between machine and driver, automated braking to avoid crashes and lane-keeping technology to keep vehicles where they belong. Today these systems, when working correctly, can help limit crashes by assisting human drivers, just as someday these features may assist computer drivers. Using technology to save lives now does not preclude saving more lives later.</p>
<p>As Congress begins to actively debate the future of the automobile industry, there is a lot of talk about upgrading roads, encouraging electric battery-powered vehicles and accelerating the introduction of driverless cars. Yet, there is not nearly enough talk about what is needed to make us all safer sooner.</p>
<p>There have been a variety of reasonable bills introduced to help the U.S. catch up to the rest of the developed world when it comes to vehicle safety and safeguarding pedestrians. They include improving the safety of our back-seat passengers in crashes, better recall procedures, and more robust and transparent data collection, along with requiring advanced safety features now common around the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have a long way to go and no time to waste. The European Union, despite a larger population and an almost identical number of vehicles and land size, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/news/2021-04-20-road-safety_en">had under 19,000 crash deaths last year</a>, less than half of the U.S. death toll. Further, the EU’s record-low vehicle-related deaths came without a single driverless vehicle on the road, but with robust consumer information and a regulatory scheme that mandates safety.</p>
<p>In the U.S., however, car manufacturers concerned about challenges from new market entrants &#8212; foreign and domestic &#8212; are lobbying for looser regulations and immunity from responsibility for automated vehicle crashes. Congress must push the industry to move quickly to protect lives before profits and stand behind their products when things inevitably go wrong. The best time to appropriately assign accountability regarding who will be held responsible if a car with a computer driver kills your loved ones, or a systemwide defect impacts an entire driverless fleet, is before the crash.</p>
<p>Moreover, history demonstrates that thoughtful requirements for all vehicles, crafted in a way to keep pace with major innovations in the automobile industry, have always been necessary to ensure vehicle safety is not reserved for the rich alone.</p>
<p>Federal legislation requiring objective performance standards based on data collected from driverless cars being tested on public streets can provide a path to this future. Yet Congress seems poised to do little, or nothing, once again. It is time for policy makers to reconcile the notion that the long-term viability of the driverless vehicle industry and keeping public roads safer now with incremental improvements, federal oversight and legal responsibility are not opposing ideas but necessary partners.</p>
<p>There is no question the U.S. can lead in the coming era of vehicle innovation while improving safety for all drivers, passengers and pedestrians. Success in this ambitious task will require moving forward quickly with existing safety technology and dispensing with the idea that innovations, safety and accountability are incompatible when, in fact, each is integral to the long-term success of the other.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raquel Urtasun, the former chief scientist at Uber ATG, is the founder and CEO of Waabi, an autonomous vehicle startup that came out of stealth mode last week. The Toronto-based company, which will focus on trucking, raised an impressive $83.5 million in a Series A round led by Khosla Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urtasun joined Mobility 2021 to talk about her new venture, the challenges facing the self-driving vehicle industry and how her approach to AI can be used to advance the commercialization of AVs.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2>Why did Urtasun decide to found her own company?</h2>
<p>Urtasun, who is considered a pioneer in AI, led the R&amp;D efforts as a chief scientist at Uber ATG, which was acquired by Aurora in December. Six months later, we have Waabi. The company&#8217;s <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">mission is to take an AI-first approach to solving self-driving technology. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>I left Uber a little bit over three months ago to start this new company, Waabi, with the idea of having a different way of solving self-driving. This is a combination of my 20-year career in AI as well as more than 10 years in self-driving. Thinking about a new company was something that was always in my head. And the more that I was in the industry, the more that I started thinking about going away from the traditional approach and trying to have a diverse view of how to solve self-driving was actually the way to go. So that&#8217;s why I decided to do this company. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 1:21)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Supreme Court has given LinkedIn another chance to stop a rival company from scraping personal information from users&#8217; public profiles, a practice LinkedIn says should be illegal but one that could have broad ramifications for internet researchers and archivists.</p>
<p>LinkedIn lost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/15/linkedin-sues-scrapers/">its case against Hiq Labs</a> in 2019 after the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the CFAA does not prohibit a company from scraping data that is publicly accessible on the internet.</p>
<p>The Microsoft-owned social network argued that the mass scraping of its users&#8217; profiles was in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, which prohibits accessing a computer without authorization.</p>
<p>Hiq Labs, which uses public data to analyze employee attrition, argued at the time that a ruling in LinkedIn&#8217;s favor &#8220;could profoundly impact open access to the Internet, a result that Congress could not have intended when it enacted the CFAA over three decades ago.&#8221; (Hiq Labs has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-sues-two-companies-engaged-in-data-scraping-operations/">been sued by Facebook</a>, which it claims scraped public data across Facebook and Instagram, but also Amazon Twitter, and YouTube.)</p>
<p>The Supreme Court said it would not take on the case, but instead ordered the appeal&#8217;s court to hear the case again in light of its recent ruling, which found that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling/">a person cannot violate the CFAA</a> if they improperly access data on a computer they have permission to use.</p>
<p>The CFAA was once dubbed <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/12/worst-law-technology-strikes-again-2017-review">the “worst law”</a> in the technology law books by critics who have long argued that its outdated and vague language failed to keep up with the pace of the modern internet.</p>
<p>Journalists and archivists have long scraped public data as a way to save and archive copies of old or defunct websites <a href="https://gizmodo.com/were-archiving-yahoo-answers-so-youll-always-know-how-b-1846643969">before they shut down</a>. But other cases of web scraping have sparked anger and concerns over privacy and civil liberties. In 2019, a security researcher <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/16/millions-venmo-transactions-scraped/">scraped millions of Venmo transactions</a>, which the company does not make private by default. Clearview AI, a controversial facial recognition startup, claimed it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">scraped over 3 billion profile photo</a>s from social networks without their permission.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Gatik's Apeksha Kumavat, Nuro's Amy Jones Satrom and Starship Technologies' Ahti Heinla joined us to discuss their companies’ unique approaches to autonomous delivery. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We kicked off this year’s TC Sessions: Mobility with a talk featuring three leading players in the field of autonomous delivery. Gatik co-founder and chief engineer Apeksha Kumavat, Nuro head of operations Amy Jones Satrom, and Starship Technologies co-founder and CTO Ahti Heinla joined us to discuss their companies’ unique approaches to the category.</p>
<p>The trio discussed government regulation on autonomous driving, partnerships with big corporations like Walmart and Domino’s, and the ongoing impact the pandemic has had on interest in the space.</p>
<h2>The pandemic effect</h2>
<p>Delivery is one of the countless categories that have been profoundly impacted by COVID-19. Interest in autonomous delivery has compounded, but will this be a permanent sea change? Or will things regress some when life returns to normal?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Kumavat:</strong> Even before the pandemic hit, this whole e-commerce trend was already on the rise. No one wants their deliveries to be done after a week or two weeks. Everyone is expecting them to be done on the same day, as well as curbside pickup options. There was already a rise in the expectations of e-commerce and on-demand deliveries even before the pandemic hit. Post-March 2020, what we have seen is a huge increase in that trajectory. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 1:55)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jones Satrom:</strong> When you think about the number of trips the consumer used to take just for shopping, that’s roughly 40% of the trips they would take. They now have habits around that kind of stuff. It’s a timesaver for the consumer. We do see those trends continuing and we do see folks sustaining the online ordering piece and wanting to be able to get things when they want them. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 8:39)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Redwood Materials, the battery recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, has purchased 100 acres of land near the Gigafactory that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada as part of an expansion plan that aligns with the Biden Administration&#8217;s drive to increase adoption of electric vehicles and boost domestic battery recycling and supply chain efforts.</p>
<p>The company said Monday that its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada will also nearly triple in size. Redwood is adding another 400,000 square feet onto the Carson City recycling facility, which is expected to be operational by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As part of its growth plans, Redwood is also hiring hundreds of workers. The company, which is backed by Amazon, employs 130 people today and expects to add more than 500 jobs over the next two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Redwood&#8217;s expansion announcement follows the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-supply-chain-disruptions-task-force-to-address-short-term-supply-chain-discontinuities/">Biden Administration&#8217;s 100-day review</a> of the U.S. supply chain and the release of a<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/FCAB%20National%20Blueprint%20Lithium%20Batteries%200621_0.pdf?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&amp;stream=top"> Department of Energy&#8217; document</a> that lays out a plan to improve the domestic supply chain for lithium-based batteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;America has a clear opportunity to build back our domestic supply chain and manufacturing sectors, so we can capture the full benefits of an emerging $23 trillion global clean energy economy,&#8221; Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm said Monday in a statement. &#8220;Private sector investment like this is a sign that we can&#8217;t slow down. The American Jobs Plan will unlock massive opportunities for US businesses as it spurs innovation and demand for technologies&#8211;like vehicle batteries and battery storage&#8211;creating clean energy jobs for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redwood Materials, which was founded in 2017, is trying to create a circular supply chain. The company has a business-to-business strategy, recycling the scrap from battery cell production as well as consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. Redwood collects the scrap from consumer electronics companies and battery cell manufacturers like Panasonic. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and then supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers. The aim is to create a closed loop system that will ultimately help reduce the cost of batteries and offset the need for mining.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials has a number of customers, and has only publicly disclosed that it is working with Panasonic, Amazon and AESC Envision in Tennessee</p>
<p>Redwood Materials says it recovers about 95% to 98% of the elements from the batteries such as nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper. Today, it receives 3 gigawatt-hours annually, a figure that the company says is equivalent to about 45,000 cars.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In December 1991, about 20 days before the Soviet Union formally disintegrated, my family landed in San Francisco as religious refugees fleeing persecution. I was a 9-year-old kid who had just experienced his first airplane trip and was utterly mesmerized by the skyscrapers of the city’s skyline as we drove past. It felt like arriving into the future.</p>
<p>My parents had almost nothing to their names. No degrees or specialized skills. Not a word of English. Only a few hundred dollars in cash from selling most of our possessions in Russia. They had just learned that half of our “luggage” &#8212; makeshift bags that were hand-sewn by my mother out of used floor rugs — was lost in transit.</p>
<p>Our journey wasn’t made possible by some employer seeking specialized labor, nor by a merit assessment that deemed our family as economically valuable immigrants. Instead, it was made possible by many Americans seeing inherent value in human beings seeking a better life. From people who wrote letters to Congress to increase refugee quotas, to sponsoring families who shared their homes and paychecks and lives to support arriving families, to organizations like<a href="https://worldrelief.org/"> World Relief</a>, which funded unsecured loans to pay for airline tickets for those who couldn’t afford them &#8212; all did their part with no expectation of economic gain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			I worry that outlier success stories &#8212; especially those that are filled with considerable luck and privilege like mine &#8212; can send the wrong message.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Integration into life in the United States wasn’t easy. Our family had to rely on welfare for several years as our parents learned English in night classes and attempted many different ways to make a living for our family of eight. Not being able to find a full-time job, my father tried every mail-order contract gig he could learn about &#8212; from cutting out thousands of leather pieces for shoes to soldering electronic boards to order to translation of documents from English to Russian. Eventually, he started his own business repairing and maintaining computers.</p>
<p>In every moment, I saw my parents seeking to pay back what others had selflessly done for us. They taught me there’s dignity to doing good work, even if it’s work that others don’t find glamorous. Even a decade later, our family was still barely scraping by financially. As I was applying to colleges as a senior in high school, our entire family would pack up our minivan on most evenings after dinner to clean dental clinics to make ends meet.</p>
<p>This is the point in my tale where it might make the most sense to insert my own story of living out a wildly unbelievable version of the American dream — especially for a refugee.</p>
<p>I could tell you how after college I co-founded Webflow, a <a href="https://webflow.com/no-code">no-code software development</a> company that employs nearly 300 people and is now valued at over $2 billion. And how stories like mine are the reason why we should open our doors to more refugees to come to the United States.</p>
<p>However, I worry that outlier success stories &#8212; especially those that are filled with considerable luck and privilege like mine &#8212; can send the wrong message. These tales can imply that the value and worth of immigrants and refugees are primarily economic. I worry that especially now, at a time when immigration has become a politically polarizing issue in this country, the conversation about the value of immigrants will continue shifting toward being purely merit-based.</p>
<p>Too often, if “merit” is the criterion, human beings are seen as worthy of joining our country if and only if they’re the “best of the best” or the “cream of the crop” in some skill or industry. In such cases, people are judged solely by how much economic value they can create in the short term.</p>
<p>Yes, merit-based immigration has an important place in our economy to solve shorter-term skill gaps in various industries. But if we <em>only</em> focus on that, I believe that our nation will have lost an important part of its character and heritage. We shouldn’t reduce our efforts to offer a safe haven to people whose lives are threatened back home. Turning our backs on the most vulnerable only to focus on the most economically advantageous would betray the spirit of what I believe makes the United States a beacon of hope and opportunity for so many people.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can get outsized economic benefits in the longer term by accepting more refugees. I know this because for every startup founder story like mine, there are hundreds of thousands of hard-working refugees who needed some help at first but are now contributing massively to our tax base as nurses, doctors, lawyers, firefighters and business owners. In fact, refugees<a href="https://immigrationforum.org/article/immigrants-as-economic-contributors-immigrant-entrepreneurs/#:~:text=Refugees%20have%20a%20higher%20rate,percent%20of%20non%2Drefugee%20immigrants."> have the highest rate of entrepreneurship</a>.</p>
<p>After experiencing hardship and oppression in their originating countries, refugees have unparalleled drive to make a better living for themselves, their families and their communities &#8212; which helps lift our entire economy.</p>
<p>My hope is that more people are given this kind of opportunity and that more industry leaders will start to advocate for immigration on humanitarian terms &#8212; not just economic ones. It will make our economy stronger in the end.</p>
<p>When given the chance to live freely without fearing for our lives, my family and so many others like us will work harder than most to contribute to society. Why? Because we feel a deep sense of gratitude to a nation that welcomed and accepted us because of, first and foremost, who we are as human beings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This weekend, all of your friends morphed one by one into animated, Pixar-inspired characters. This isn’t a fever dream, and you’re not alone.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Snapchat released a <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/bad1396b0f8d494d845b1d6438c115f2">Cartoon 3D Style Lens</a>, which uses AR to make you look like a background character from “Frozen.” On Snapchat, over 215 million users have engaged with the Cartoon 3D lens, and it&#8217;s been viewed more than 1.7 billion times. Naturally, even though TikTok’s own AR cartoon effects aren’t quite as convincing as Snapchat’s, people are turning to TikTok to share videos of themselves as Disney princesses, because of course they are.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that a Disney-esque AR trend has gone viral. In August 2020, Snapchat had 28.5 million new installs, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/snapchat-had-a-big-august-amid-tiktok-uncertainty/">its biggest month</a> since May 2019, when it got 41.2 million new installs. It might not be a coincidence that in early August 2020, Snapchat released the <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/0ad185e6dd5e418a9659fa96dce788e0">Cartoon Face lens</a>, which users realized could be used to “Disneyfy” their pets &#8212; the tag <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@djangosmiles/video/6860585253157752070?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">#disneydog</a> got 40.9 million views across platforms on TikTok. Then, Snapchat struck viral gold again in December, when they released the <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/449d01c9513c40288d74397352cb304e">Cartoon lens</a>, which rendered more realistic results for human faces than the previous iteration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to Sensor Tower, Snapchat&#8217;s global installs continued to climb month-over-month throughout the rest of 2020, though installs slightly declined in December. Still, Snapchat got 36 million downloads that month. Now, after the newest Cartoon Style 3D lens went viral again, Snapchat hit No. 6 on the App Store’s free apps charts, compared to TikTok’s No. 2 slot. Still, Snapchat downloads in May were 32 million, down from 34 million in April, while TikTok saw 80.3 million installs in May, up from 59.3 million in April.</p>

<p>But there’s a new app in the No. 1 slot that also made an impact on this weekend’s cartoon explosion. Released in March, Voilà AI Artist is yet another platform that turns us into cartoon versions of ourselves. Unlike the AR-powered effects on Snapchat or TikTok, Voilà is a photo editor. Users upload a selfie, and after watching an ad (the ad-free version costs $3 per week), it reveals what you would look like as a cartoon.</p>
<p>Voilà AI Artist was only downloaded 400 times globally in March 2021. By May, the app surpassed 1 million downloads, and during the first two weeks of this month alone, the app has been downloaded more than 10.5 million times.</p>

<p>Again, like the repetitive iterations on the “Disneyfy” trend, apps like Voilà aren’t new. FaceApp went viral in 2019, showing people what they’ll look like when they’re old, graying and wrinkled. The app became the center of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-responds-to-privacy-concerns/">privacy controversy</a>, since it uploaded users’ photos to the cloud to edit their selfies with AI. FaceApp made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-responds-to-privacy-concerns/">a statement</a> that it “might store updated photos in the cloud” for “performance and traffic reasons,” but that “most images” are deleted “within 48 hours.” Still, this ambiguous language set off the warning bells, urging us to think about the potentially nefarious implications of seeing what we’ll look like in 60 years. Two years earlier, FaceApp put out a “hotness” filter, which made users’ skin lighter &#8212; FaceApp apologized for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/25/faceapp-apologises-for-building-a-racist-ai/">racist AI</a>. Voilà, which is owned by Wemagine.AI LLP in Canada, has also been criticized for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@a_ali_flores/video/6972879431211715845?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">its AI’s eurocentrism</a>. As these apps grow in popularity, they can also uphold some of our culture’s most harmful biases.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165717" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165717" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2165717" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?w=505" alt="" width="505" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png 1018w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=111,150 111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=223,300 223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=768,1034 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=505,680 505w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165717" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Voilà</p></div></p>
<p>Like FaceApp, Voilà requires an internet connection to use the app. Additionally, its <a href="https://www.wemagine.ai/terms">terms</a> outline that users grant the company “a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use in any way, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute Uploaded and Generated content.” Basically, that means that if you upload an image to the platform, Voilà has the right to use it, but they don’t own it. This isn’t abnormal for these apps &#8212; when we <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/termsofuse">upload photos to Instagram</a>, for example, we also grant the platform the right to use our images.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a good thing that apps like Voilà force us to consider what we give up in exchange for the knowledge that we’d make a good Disney princess. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">TikTok updated its U.S. privacy policy</a> to dictate that the app “may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information” from users’ content. This includes “faceprints and voiceprints,” terms that TikTok left undefined. When TechCrunch reached Tiktok for comment, they couldn’t confirm why the terms now changed to allow for the automatic collection of biometric data, which refers to any features, measurements or characteristics of our body that distinguish us, even fingerprints.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that as Voilà climbed to the No. 1 slot on the App Store, Snapchat re-upped their Pixar-inspired AR lens. Facebook’s own Spark AR platform is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebooks-spark-ar-platform-expands-to-video-calling-with-multipeer-api/">rolling out new features</a>, and last week at WWDC, Apple announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apples-realitykit-2-allows-developers-to-create-3d-models-for-ar-using-iphone-photos/">major update to RealityKit</a>, its AR software. But these trends reveal more about our growing comfort with face-altering AR than they do about our nostalgia for Disney.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fraud protection startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nsure-ai-payment-assurance">nSure AI</a> has raised $6.8 million in seed funding, led by DisruptiveAI, Phoenix Insurance, AXA-backed venture builder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/kamet-ventures/">Kamet</a>, Moneta Seeds and private investors.</p>
<p>The round will help the company bolster the predictive AI and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> algorithms that power nSure AI&#8217;s &#8220;first of its kind&#8221; fraud protection platform. Prior to this round, the company received $550,000 in pre-seed funding from Kamet in March 2019.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-headquartered startup, which currently has 16 employees, provides fraud detection for high-risk digital goods, such as electronic gift cards, airline tickets, software and games. While most fraud detection tools analyze each online transaction in an attempt to decide which purchases to approve and decline, nSure AI&#8217;s risk engine leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>NSure AI, which is backed by insurance company AXA, <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/88074/nsureai-raises-68-million">said</a> it has a 98% approval rating on average for purchases, compared to an industry average of 80%, allowing retailers to recapture nearly $100 billion a year in revenue lost by declining legitimate customers. The company is so confident in its technology that it will accept liability for any fraudulent transaction allowed by the platform.</p>
<p>Founders Alex Zeltcer and Ziv Isaiah started the company after experiencing the unique challenges faced by retailers of digital assets. The first week of their online gift card business found that 40% of sales were fraudulent, resulting in chargebacks. The founders began to develop their own platform for supporting the sale of high-risk digital goods after no other fraud detection service met their needs.</p>
<p>Zeltcer, co-founder and chief executive, said the investment &#8220;enables us to register thousands of new merchants, who can feel confident selling higher-risk digital goods, without accepting fraud as a part of business.”</p>
<p>NSure AI, which currently monitors and manages millions of transactions every month, has approved close to $1 billion in volume since going live in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mac-reddin-7a275716b">Mac Reddin</a>, the co-founder and CEO of<a href="https://www.commsor.com/"> Commsor</a>, met the first professional investor for his company’s $16 million Series A on Lunch Club, a marketplace for 1:1 video introductions. Commsor, which sees itself as an operating system for community managers, then experienced firsthand the benefit of matching people within similar industries in an engaging, online setting.</p>
<p>It’s thus quite fitting that, months later, Commsor is adding a company to its tech stack that is focused on private networking within communities. Commsor has scooped up <a href="https://www.meetsy.io/">Meetsy</a>, a startup that helps people within communities facilitate creative and spontaneous conversations with each other. Meetsy, a fully bootstrapped business, was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/btramer/">Bradley Tramer</a> and sold for an undisclosed price.</p>
<p>Commsor launched months ago to be the solution that helps community managers prove that they’re not wasting the budget and their work is tied to real, valuable outcomes. Commsor could pull an insight like, “Here are three Google engineers that are using your [insert community platform name here]. so maybe it’s time to approach Google and ask if they want an enterprise contract.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pvDhJ1Ljay"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/chief-community-officer-is-the-new-cmo/">Chief community officer is the new CMO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chief community officer is the new CMO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/chief-community-officer-is-the-new-cmo/embed/#?secret=pvDhJ1Ljay" data-secret="pvDhJ1Ljay" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With the acquisition, Commsor’s ambition appears to be broadening a bit. In order for a community to be outwardly valuable to a business, it has to be inwardly healthy. The members have to connect, riff and have a chance to debate that shared interest that placed them there in the first place. Meetsy works within companies, matching employees to employees, alumni programs, and with venture capitalists that want their portfolio companies to connect with one another as well.</p>
<p>“If Commsor helps you prove the business value of community, and Meetsy helps you build a better community, those two together compound into an even bigger impact.”</p>
<p>Even as growing vaccination rates in the United States may turn on the faucet for in-person interactions, many think there will continue to be a virtual component to interactions, especially with distributed teams. Surely enough, the wave of super-connector apps has grown larger as remote work gets deeper roots. The aforementioned Lunch Club <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/lunchclub-tops-100-million-valuation-amid-quarantine-usage-spike.html">was last valued at $100 million,</a> Workvivo raised $16 million in financing and Gatheround landed a $3.5 million seed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/gatheround-raises-millions-from-homebrew-bloomberg-and-stripes-coo-to-help-remote-workers-connect/">round last month</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every virtual event tool I&#8217;ve seen how some sort of networking built into it, but it&#8217;s usually what I&#8217;d consider &#8216;dumb networking&#8217;,&#8221; Reddin said. He&#8217;s alluding to the common &#8220;speed dating&#8221; strategy of placing random people with each other for a few minutes, and then shuffling to repeat.</p>
<p>Meetsy, he said, has refined a robust matching system so a community manager can come in and define people by their self-chosen attributes. It can then fill out match rules based on guidelines for how they want matches to happen. For example, Meetsy could make sure that fintech VCs only meet fintech startups to spark a future investment, or that employees only can meet without employees outside of their current team to promote cross-collaboration.</p>
<p>“That way it&#8217;s not just smashing two rocks together and hoping sparks fly,” Reddin said.</p>
<p>The two companies will continue to exist underneath existing branding, but Meetsy users might be able to get a discount on Commsor or benefit from future bundling features. Meetsy has always been free to use but will experiment with new paid features in the future such as white-labeling capabilities, or a tier-system that requires companies to pay once they hit a certain scale of community members.</p>
<p>Tramer, the founder of Meetsy, said that combining tools with Commsor will help community managers “foster meaningful connection at scale and measure the impact of those connections.”</p>
<p>“In five years, I see &#8216;curated introductions&#8217; as a core pillar of community engagement alongside events and forums,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Cory Siskind finished school, she was dropped into a high-stakes job helping large multinational corporations manage their operational security in Mexico City, with almost no relevant lived experience. Eventually, she realized that this was more or less par for the course in the corporate security field, which lagged behind other mission-critical enterprise services, like information security.</p>
<p>The industry still relied on recent grads doing manual work like combing through blogs and local news reports, and on security industry veterans with contacts on the ground to build a sort of &#8220;whisper network&#8221; of ground truth. Those things are obviously still valuable, but advancements in technology mean that there are many, many more sources of information that can provide valuable insight into the security situation in any particular country, region or even neighborhood, and machine learning has progressed to the point where it can do a lot of the legwork involved in helping analysts parse the data.</p>
<p>Cory tells us all about how she came to the conclusion that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/base-operations-raises-2-2-million-to-modernize-physical-enterprise-security/"> Base Operations needed to be built</a> to bring modern tech to bear on the capabilities gap she saw in how companies manage their global security footprint, and how she set out getting the skills needed to build her startup as a sole founder. We talk about the challenges of fundraising in an area where most traditional VCs likely feel out of their depth, and building a sales operation that can handle big clients even very early on in her startup&#8217;s life.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re like me, you spent the weekend longing for the mixed bag that is downtown Los Angeles during E3. I’ve got fond memories of fish tacos, The Last Bookstore, watching playoff basketball in garishly lit hotel lobbies and, of course, video game press conference after video game press conference.</p>
<p>For a second year in a row, the show’s gone all virtual, owing to…well, you know, that virus that has defined the past year and a half of our lives. Last year’s show was canceled altogether (though a handful of companies still kept to the schedule). Show organizers simply didn’t think they would be able to pull together a digital event &#8212; and frankly, it’s probably for the best that they understood those limitations.</p>
<p>The 2021 event, which kicked off on Saturday, marks the first all-virtual version of the event. For the time being, it’s also the last. Mayor Eric Garcetti kicked off the show by announcing that E3 would return to the LA Convention Center in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gaming had a banner 2020, and while growth has slowed, as parts of the world look forward to a post-pandemic life, things are still growing. Some well-timed <a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/industry-expertise/video-games/">numbers from NPD</a> this morning point to a 3% year-over-year growth for May 2021, as spending on gaming rose to $4.5 billion. Year-to-date, things are up 17%.</p>
<p>The timing of last year’s canceled event was certainly unfortunate from a hardware standpoint. Console refreshes are massive events at E3. 2020 gave us the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Announcements were relegated to Sony and Microsoft’s own events. That meant the companies were able to draw things out &#8212; revealing small details, piece by piece, rather than saving everything for the big show. It’s a strategy that lends itself much better to virtual presentations and blog posts than it does big conventions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congrats to <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@XboxP3</a> and the whole team on a great showcase. Great time to be a gamer</p>
<p>&mdash; Hermen Hulst (@hermenhulst) <a href="https://twitter.com/hermenhulst/status/1404168837872951306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Sony is sitting this one out, too. While it’s entirely possible the company will be holding a big, virtual State of Play event at some point this summer, it won’t be tied to E3. Still, some Sony execs like PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst used the opportunity congratulate Microsoft on “a great showcase” on Twitter. So that’s a nice thing.</p>
<p>Thus far, Microsoft is the only one of the big three to present at the event. Nintendo will be holding a Treehouse event tomorrow. The Switch Pro could be on tap for the event, with an upgraded OLED display and internals. That would likely also mean a bunch of upgraded content for the new version of the four-year-old console.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YnVzOA2wNs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, went big on games. Understandable, given the recent launch of the Series X. And, let’s face it, these virtual events are perfectly suited for playing a whole bunch of trailers. The company showcased 30 games (and a fridge) in all. Of those, 27 will be part of the Xbox Game Pass, in case you had any doubt about what the future of gaming on the Xbox will look like. The event was framed as a combination Xbox and Bethesda showcase, having acquired the publisher earlier this year.</p>
<p>“Our growing family of 23 studios is devoted to advancing the medium we all love,” the company writes, “so we were happy to share that now through the end of the year, you can look forward to back-to-back monthly releases coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, led by a record five new titles from Xbox Game Studios this holiday, including Halo Infinite.”</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/W18OP8BZc6I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>

<p>Microsoft’s Flight Simulator will be hitting the new Xboxes on July 27th, along with a Top Gun expansion pack. That’s in honor of Top Gun: Maverick, which is apparently still coming out at some point.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/t30FL8a9KWs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Square Enix also held its customary big showcase on Sunday. The publisher will be releasing a bunch of new Marvel titles. Highlights include:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-jFYYMkJh4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>

<p>Marvel’s Avenger, meanwhile, will be getting the Black Panther-themed expansion pack, War for Wakanda. That’s arriving in August.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntQ-utIdWWE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It wouldn’t be a Square Enix event without a Final Fantasy spinoff, right? The perennial favorite RPG is birthing Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, which arrives on a slew of different platforms next year.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Axmg1E4HrVE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>

<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFzsANuSbdw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Extraction is due out on September 16. Originally titled Rainbow Six: Quarantine, the name was changed for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Capcom and Take-Two will showcase tonight, followed by Nintendo Direct and Bandai Namco tomorrow. On Thursday, EA is set to hold its own Play Live event. Meanwhile, here&#8217;s some video of that new Xbox fridge. Who said there wasn&#8217;t any new hardware?</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnIiRygj-nY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Welp, the mobility event is over and we had loads of interesting interviews &#8212; and anyone with an Extra Crunch subscription can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/">access the videos</a>. For instance, Rita Liao moderated a panel with executives from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-rise-of-robotaxis-in-china/">three Chinese robotaxi companies</a> — WeRide, AutoX and Momenta — that also test and develop in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>One interesting takeaway on the regulations front is that policymaking for AVs in China is driven from the bottom up rather than a top-down effort by the central government, the three panelists explained. They also spoke about how foreign counterparts can crack open China&#8217;s market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jewel Li from AutoX laid out the challenges of operating in China:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s not as simple as opening up an office, right? It&#8217;s much more than that, to be able to succeed in the market. You need to build the landscape, you need to build the ecosystem, your own partners. The whole ecosystem chain is quite long. It&#8217;s quite complicated, involving government relations. It also involves the data that you have already accumulated. The driving experience has to fit in the local world. Many things comes into play.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other highlights included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/building-an-electric-powerhouse/">my interview with Mate Rimac</a> of Rimac Automobili, who disclosed how close the company came to failing, provided advice to fellow and aspiring founders and explained his interest in electric robotaxis. Then there was the discussion about the AV industry between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/">Motional&#8217;s Karl Iagnemma and Aurora&#8217;s Chris Urmson</a> — not an interview to miss. More recaps of the event will be published in the coming week.</p>

<p>This week, as Kirsten Korosec mentioned above, we had our big Mobility event, where the leaders, upstarts and startups of the mobility world joined us on our virtual stage to talk about the future of moving people, goods and even ideas. I led a panel with <strong>Remix</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong>, community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong> and <strong>Revel</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>. We discussed the importance of mobility companies being equitable and accessible to everyone in a city, especially the most vulnerable, and how that affects profitability.</p>
<p>Something interesting that came out of my questioning was Reig&#8217;s comments about Revel achieving profitability. (The revelations about profitability were<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/revel-electric-mopeds-freedom-mayhem-uncertain-future/"> first shared in May</a>, although Reig did provide a bit more color during the event.) For three months in the summer of 2020, Revel was full-company profitable, &#8220;so beyond just market profitability, beyond just unit economics,&#8221; said Reig. &#8220;I&#8217;m talking my salary and everything else that&#8217;s involved in running a company.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was back when Revel was only an e-moped company and before it added several other business lines, including EV charging hubs, e-bikes and ride-hailing. We don&#8217;t know exactly how Revel is measuring profitably — are we talking EBITDA? Gross profit? — and on the panel we didn&#8217;t have time to dig into the money salad. But it is notable as the company settles into its newest business line of ride-hailable Tesla vehicles. We&#8217;ll be watching Revel closely as it continues to ramp up its different revenue streams. Maybe someday they&#8217;ll go public so we can have a closer look.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get back to the important issue of whether or not mobility companies, like Revel, can help cities achieve equitability of movement. Movement should be a right, not a privilege, but it often feels like we&#8217;re playing the same game with different vehicles today. Mobility has always benefited those at the top more, so why should it be any different today? Does the moral highway really drive us toward justice? What good reason do companies have to spend their time and money actually making sure their services help cities achieve equity of movement?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if you&#8217;re doing the work that theoretically is to serve people then you should want to serve all people,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1402727043603865602">said Butler.</a> &#8220;For companies, I would say that people like to say it takes too much time or costs too much money to do things equitably, but whether or not you&#8217;re retrofitting a house or retrofitting your company, whenever you retrofit something it costs more money. So if you think about equity as something you build in from the beginning, it will actually save you money and take less time than if you try to do it later because someone tells you to do it or you&#8217;ve had some controversy.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can watch the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/equity-accessibility-and-cities/">full talk on Extra Crunch</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Some micro morsels&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://leoride.co/">Leo Riders</a></strong>, an e-scooter platform for those in the hospitality industry, is expanding into Athens, Greece, with more than 20 agreements with local hotels. Hotels like Brown Hotel and Colors Urban Hotel will now be able to offer guests e-scooters to ride around the city. Sounds sick. What could go wrong?!</p>
<p>E-scooter subscription and sales company<strong> Unagi</strong> is expanding its <a href="https://allaccess.unagiscooters.com/sign_up">&#8220;All-Access&#8221; service&#8221;</a> to Chicago, D.C. and some other regions around those two great American cities.</p>

<p><strong>Didi</strong>, the Chinese ride-hailing company, has already raised tens of billions of dollars from the private market. Now it&#8217;s ready to tap the public one.</p>
<p>The company filed for an IPO, and digging a bit into the filing here&#8217;s what we find. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/despite-flat-growth-ride-hailing-colossus-didis-us-ipo-could-reach-70b/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Alex Wilhelm</a> notes, the S-1 shows how quickly and painfully COVID-19 blunted Didi&#8217;s global operations. As COVID-19 numbers have fallen and economies have opened back up, Didi has settled back to late-2019 gross transaction volume numbers.</p>
<p>Didi manage a GTV recovery in China. However, its aggregate numbers are flatter, and recent quarterly trends are not incredibly attractive. And taking a historical look at its financial figures, it&#8217;s clear that Didi has never generated positive operating income. The company&#8217;s revenues in Q1 2021 were smaller than its Q3 and Q4 2020 numbers, for example.</p>
<p>A few other items of note, the company reported a $1.7 billion loss on $21.6 billion in revenue for 2020. And some of its largest stakeholders are SoftBank with 21.5%, Uber with 12/5% and Tencent with 6.8%.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Branch Insurance</strong>, a startup offering bundled home and auto insurance, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/branch-raises-50m-to-offer-bundled-auto-home-insurance-via-an-api/">$50 million in a Series B funding round</a> led by Anthemis Group. Acrew, Cherry Creek Holdings and existing backers Greycroft, HSCM Bermuda, American Family Ventures, SignalFire, SCOR P&amp;C Ventures, Foundation Capital and Tower IV also participated in the round. The startup has raised $82.5 million in total funding since its inception in 2017.</p>
<p>A couple of <strong>Chinese grocery delivery companies</strong> filed for IPOs this week. First up is <strong>Dingdong</strong>, which previously raised more than $400 million from investors including General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital China, Starquest China, Qiming Venture Partners, Bertelsmann Asia Investments and General Atlantic. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1854545/000119312521185539/d121652df1.htm">regulatory filing</a> shows that Digndong had a net loss of $485 million on $1.73 billion in revenue last year. Then there&#8217;s <strong>Missfresh</strong>, which has raised more than $2 billion from investors, including a fund under state-backed China International Capital Corporation, ICBC International Securities, Tencent, Abu Dhabi Capital Group, Tiger Global and a fund managed by the government of Changshu county. Missfresh reported a $252 million net loss on $956 million in revenue in 2020, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1851682/000119312521185472/d123092df1.htm#rom123092_18">according to the filing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Circulor</strong>, a supply chain traceability and CO2 tracking company, raised $14 million in a Series A funding round. The Westly Group led the round, with participation by Salesforce Ventures, BHP Ventures, Future Positive Capital, 24Haymarket and Sky Ocean Ventures, alongside existing investors in the company. Circulor&#8217;s product is used by Volvo Cars to trace the cobalt used in its all-electric XC40 Recharge and by Polestar to assess the environmental and human rights risks of sourcing cobalt, lithium, nickel, lithium and mica for its electric cars.</p>
<p><strong>Embraer&#8217;s</strong> electric vehicle takeoff and landing unit Eve Urban Air Mobility is in talks to merge with special purpose acquisition company Zanite Acquisition Corp. The deal would value the combined entity at about $2 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/embraer-s-eve-said-in-2-billion-merger-talks-with-zanite-spac?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hesai</strong>, a Shanghai-based lidar maker founded in 2014, raised more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/china-lidar-hesai-300-million-funding/">$300 million in a Series D funding round</a> led by GL Ventures, the venture capital arm of private equity firm Hillhouse Capital, smartphone maker Xiaomi, on-demand services giant Meituan and CPE, the private equity platform of Citic. Huatai International Private Equity Fund, the USD investment arm of Huatai Securities, Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Capital as well as Qiming Venture Partners, also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Incari</strong>, a Berlin-based HMI startup, closed a €15 million ($18.1 million) Series A financing round led by Lukasz Gadowski, the founder of Delivery Hero and Team Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>, the eVTOL company backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, acquired 3D Robotics. Under the deal, 3D Robotics co-founder Chris Anderson will become chief operating officer at Kitty Hawk, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/06/11/larry-page-kitty-hawk-air-taxi-sebastian-thrun/?sh=1dec5d1738cb">Forbes reported</a>. The article also revealed that Kitty Hawk engineer Damon Vander Lind, who built the initial versions of Heaviside, was dismissed, CEO Sebastian Thrun confirmed to Forbes.</p>
<p><strong>Nvidia</strong> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/nvidia-acquires-hi-def-mapping-startup-deepmap-to-bolster-av-technology/">acquiring DeepMap</a>, the high-definition mapping startup announced. The company said its mapping IP will help Nvidia&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology sector, Nvidia Drive. Nvidia is expected to finalize the acquisition in Q3 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Trucks Venture Capital</strong>, the venture firm that backs early-stage entrepreneurs in transportation, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/trucks-vc-launches-two-new-funds-for-early-and-late-stage-transportation-startups/">launching two new funds</a>. Its new core fund, known as Trucks Venture Fund 2, was raised over the last year and recently closed on $52,525,252. The fund is backed by three auto OEMs and three auto suppliers that make everything from bicycles to Class 8 big rig trucks, as well as one communications company, according to Trucks VC.

<p>Last week, I shared the <strong>Waymo One</strong> app information courtesy of Sensor Tower, the mobile app market intelligence firm. There are not many other AV developers that have launched ride-hailing apps, although that might be changing.</p>
<p>Argo AI and Zoox have job listings for Android software engineers. Zoox is looking for an iOS engineer as well.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower did note to TechCrunch that Pony.ai has launched a few apps. PonyPilot+ has hit about 6,000 installs on China&#8217;s App Store. PonyPilot has seen about 2,000 in the U.S., most of which happened in the first three months of 2020, according to Sensor Tower. The company also has two apps available in Russia called PonyExpress+, which has seen about 1,500 installs, and PonyFleetGO. There are no download estimates for PonyFleetGo.</p>
<p>AutoX also has an app available, AutoX Food Delivery, which has reached about 200 installs in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>President Joe Biden</strong> has set his sights on hardening the country&#8217;s supply chains for essential goods and critical minerals. The White House said on June 8 it had created a task force aimed at addressing supply chain bottlenecks, including in semiconductors and critical minerals used in EV batteries.</p>
<p>Biden wants to get many more Americans driving electric vehicles, but the majority of key critical minerals in batteries, like lithium and graphite, are mined and processed abroad. As part of a Fact Sheet also released on June 8, Biden&#8217;s administration said it would create a task force to identify opportunities to produce minerals domestically &#8212; something that until now has kicked up a lot of controversy amongst environmental groups.</p>
<p>The <strong>U.S.</strong> <strong>Department of Energy</strong> released a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/FCAB%20National%20Blueprint%20Lithium%20Batteries%200621_0.pdf">blueprint for lithium batteries</a> through 2030 that calls for eliminating two key minerals from batteries &#8212; cobalt and nickel &#8212; as a way of fortifying the supply chain. The DOE says it will support R&amp;D efforts to develop batteries without these minerals, which are largely found in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo or Indonesia, and are processed mainly in China. Scientific innovation is certainly one way to reduce America&#8217;s dependence on foreign adversaries for its batteries.</p>
<p>The <strong>House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee</strong> passed a sweeping $547 billion infrastructure package after a whopping 19 hours of debate (pour one out for the Congressional interns). The final vote was 38-26. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/the-station-aurora-gets-closer-to-a-spac-deal-spins-new-strategy-and-waymo-one-app-numbers/">As a reminder</a>, the INVEST in America Act would largely fund improvements to roads, bridges and passenger rail, but earmarks $4 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and around $4 billion to invest in zero-emission transit vehicles.</p>
<p>Just two Republicans on the committee voted in favor of the bill. The <a href="https://transportation.house.gov/invest-in-america">INVEST in America Act</a> is still very, very far from becoming law: It now advances to the full House for further debate, then would be sent to the Senate for further rehashing, etcetera etcetera&#8230; nevertheless, it&#8217;s an encouraging sign, especially as legislators managed to work out over 200 proposed amendments to the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> is changing its tune on proposed tailpipe emission rules in California. The country&#8217;s largest automaker had previously opposed California&#8217;s tough emissions limits for passenger vehicles, which it reached in concert with five other automakers: Ford, Honda Motor Company, Volkswagen AG, Volvo and BMW. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/us/politics/gm-biden-fuel-economy-rules.html">New York Times reported</a> that GM CEO Mary Barra said in a Wednesday letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan that &#8220;GM supports the emissions reduction goals of California through model year &#8217;26,&#8221; and that, &#8220;the auto industry is embarking upon a profound transition as we do our part to achieve the country&#8217;s climate commitments.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, she said that GM &#8220;believes that the same environmental benefits can and should be achieved through a high-volume electric vehicle pathway.&#8221; That is to say, she said the best way to reduce emissions is to boost EV sales through government incentives, rebates and other programs.</p>
<p>The EPA will be publishing its proposed tailpipe emissions reductions and fuel economy standards in July. Regan has been meeting with major OEMs, including GM, in advance of that release.</p>

<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Aria Alamalhodaei dug into the aspirations of the burgeoning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight/">electric vertical take-off and landing industry</a>. The upshot: The industry is bullish on its future, a view perhaps augmented by the string of partnership deals, SPACs, private funding and newly achieved unicorn statuses.</p>
<p>However, as in any disruptive industry, the forecast may be cloudier than the rosy picture painted by passionate founders and investors. A quick peek at comments and posts on LinkedIn reveals squabbles among industry insiders and analysts about when this emerging technology will truly take off and which companies will come out ahead. Other disagreements have higher stakes. Wisk Aero filed a lawsuit against Archer Aviation alleging trade secret misappropriation. Meanwhile, valuations for companies that have no revenue yet to speak of &#8212; and may not for the foreseeable future &#8212; are skyrocketing.</p>
<p>Electric air mobility is gaining elevation. But there&#8217;s going to be some turbulence ahead. This is an Extra Crunch article, which means it requires a subscription. Happy reading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Campos has struggled with depression since she was eight years old. Over the years, she’s tried all sorts of therapies &#8212; from behavioral to pharmacotherapy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, when Campos was in her early 20s, she learned to program and created a system to help manage her mental health. It started as a personal project, but as she talked to more people, Campos realized that many others might benefit from the system as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So she built an application to provide access to mental health tools for Spanish-speaking people and began testing it with a small group. At first, Campos herself was her own chatbot, texting with users who were tired of dealing with depression.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the month, I was pretending I was an app, and would send these people a list of activities they had to complete during the day, such as writing in a gratitude journal, and then asking them how those activities made them feel,” Campos recalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her thinking was that sometimes with depression and anxiety comes “a lot of avoidance,” where people resist potential treatment out of fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results from her small experiment were encouraging. So, Campos set out to conduct a bigger sample of experiments, and raised about $10,000 via a crowdfunding campaign. With that money, she hired a developer to build a chatbot for her app, which was mostly being used via Facebook Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then an earthquake hit Mexico City and that developer lost everything &#8212; including his home and computer &#8212; and had to relocate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was left with nothing,” Campos says. But that developer introduced her to another, who disappeared with his payment, and again, left Campos, “with nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I realized at the beginning of 2019, I was going to have to do this by myself,” Campos said. So she used a site that she described as a “Wix for chatbots,” and created one herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After experimenting with the app with a sample of 700 people, Campos was even more encouraged and raised an angel round of funding for <a href="https://yana.com.mx/">Yana</a>, the startup behind her app. (Yana is an acronym for “You Are Not Alone.”) By early 2020, with just three months of runway left, she pivoted to create an app with chatbot integration that wasn’t just limited to use via Facebook Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campos ended up launching the app more broadly during the same week that her city in Mexico went into quarantine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, she said, she saw “normal, steady growth.” But then on October 10, 2020, Apple’s App Store highlighted Yana for International Mental Health Day, and the response was overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was also my birthday so I was at a spa in a nearby town, relaxing, when I started hearing my cell phone go crazy,” Campos recalls. “Everything went nuts. I had to go back to Mexico City because our servers were exploding since they were not used to having that kind of volume.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of that exposure, Yana went from having around 80,000 users to reaching 1 million users two weeks later. Soon after that, Google highlighted the app as one of best for personal growth in 2020, and that too led to another spike in users. Today, Yana is about to hit the 5 million-user mark and is also announcing it has raised $1.5 million in funding led by Mexico’s ALLVP, which has also invested in the likes of Cornershop, Flink and Nuvocargo.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Funding for mental health-focused startups rises in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/funding-for-mental-health-focused-startups-rises-in-2020/embed/#?secret=5wfWdQ1mdn" data-secret="5wfWdQ1mdn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic hit last year, six of Yana’s nine-person team decided to quarantine together in a “startup house” in Cancun to focus on building the company. Earlier this year, the company had raised $315,000 from investors such as 500 Startups, Magma and Hustle Fund. The company had pitched ALLVP, which was intrigued but wanted to wait until it could write a bigger check. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That time is now, and Yana is now among the top three downloaded apps in Mexico and 12 countries, including Spain, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new capital, Yana is planning to “move away from the depression/anxiety narrative,” according to Campos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to compete in the wellness space,” she told TechCrunch. “A lot of people were looking for us to deal with crises such as a breakup or a loss but then they didn’t always see a necessity to keep using Yana for longer than the crisis lasted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those people would download the app again months later when hit with another crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t want to be that app anymore,” Campos said. “We want to focus on whole wellness and mental health and transmit something that needs to be built every single day, just like we do with exercise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, Yana aims to help people with their mental health not just during a crisis but with activities they can do on a daily basis, including a gratitude journal, a mood tracker and meditation &#8212; “things that prevent depression and anxiety,” Campos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be a vitamin for our soul, and keeping people mentally healthy on an ongoing basis,” she said. “We also want to include a community inside our application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALLVP’s Federico Antoni is enthusiastic about the startup’s potential. He first met Campos when she was participating in an accelerator program in 2017, and then again recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm led Yana’s latest round because it “wanted to be on her team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She [Campos] has turned into an amazing leader, and we realized her potential and strength,” he said. “Plus, Yana is an amazing product. When you download it, it’s almost like you can see a soul in there.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazil is a country riven with economic contradictions. It has one of the largest and most profitable banking industries in Latin America, and is among the world’s most developed financial markets. Financial transactions that would take days to process in the United States through ACH happen instantaneously in Brazil. This sophistication, however, masks a backward state of affairs plagued by appalling customer service, exorbitant fees and lack of banking access for many.</p>
<p>The country’s financial system is volatile and often leaves its citizens with few or no alternatives. <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=58873">According to an HBS case study</a>, “in December 2018 the interest rate in Brazil for corporate loans was 52.3%, for consumer loans it was 120.0% and for credit card indebtedness it was 272.42%.” Those rates are many multiples higher compared to figures in neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Brazil’s banking system is a massive market, and one ill-served by incumbents. If someone could thread the needle of product development, strategy and political horse trading required to build a bank in a country where it is nearly impossible for foreigners to own or invest in a bank, it would be one of the great startup and economic success stories of this century.</p>
<p><b>Nubank</b> is on its way to realizing that objective. Its story is one of unmitigated success, even by the standards of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1">our EC-1 series</a> on high-flying companies and their hard-learned lessons. Just last week, this Brazilian credit card and banking fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">raised a $750 million round led by Berkshire Hathaway</a> at a $30 billion valuation, becoming one of the most valuable startups in the world. It has 40 million users across Brazil, as well as Mexico and Colombia.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s a startup with a CEO and co-founder who isn’t Brazilian, didn’t speak the local language of Portuguese, hadn’t started a company before, and didn’t really know a lot about banking to begin with. This is a story of how raw execution, a “faster, faster” mentality and a fanaticism for making customer experience as enjoyable as a trip to Disney World can completely change the history of an industry — and country — forever.</p>
<p>Our lead writer for this EC-1 is <b>Marcella McCarthy</b>. McCarthy, who spent significant time in Brazil growing up and is trilingual in English, Spanish and Portuguese, has been covering the LatAm and Miami ecosystems for TechCrunch with an eye to the disruption underway in these interconnected regions. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, and illustrations were drawn by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Nubank had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. McCarthy has no financial ties to Nubank or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For most startups, the hardest early challenge is identifying a market and a product to serve it. That wasn’t the case for Nubank CEO David Velez, who understood the massive potential for success if he could break into Latin America’s most valuable economy with even a moderately modern banking offering.</p>
<p>Instead, the challenge was how to rebuild the concept of a bank in a country where banking is widely hated, all while the incumbents heavily entrenched with the state worked to block every move.</p>
<p>Nubank knew its market and geography, and through tenacious fundraising, inventive marketing and product development, and a series of contrarian hires, Velez and his team stripped bare the morass of Brazilian banking to build one of the world’s great fintech companies.</p>

			The challenge was how to rebuild the concept of a bank in a country where banking is widely hated, all while the incumbents heavily entrenched with the state worked to block every move.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In the first part of this EC-1, I’ll look at how Velez brought his skills and experience to bear on this market, how Nubank was founded in 2013, and how the team brought a Californian rather than Brazilian vibe to their first office on — no joke — California Street, in a neighborhood called Brooklin in the city of São Paulo.</p>
<h2>The makings of an entrepreneur</h2>
<p>The idea of being his own boss was ingrained in Velez from his earliest days in Colombia, where he grew up in an entrepreneurial family, with a father who owned a button factory. “I heard from my dad over and over again that you need to start your own company,” Velez said.</p>
<p>But years would pass and Velez still had no idea what he wanted to do. To “kill time,” and also to surround himself with entrepreneurial energy, Velez attended Stanford University — partially financed by the sale of some livestock — and then worked as an analyst at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley before switching to venture capital at General Atlantic and Sequoia.</p>
