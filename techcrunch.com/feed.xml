										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early stage investor Version One, which consists of partners Boris Wertz and Angela Tran, has raised its fourth fund, as well as a second opportunity fund specifically dedicated to making follow-on investments. Fund IV pools $70 million from LPs to invest, and Opportunities Fund II is $30 million, both up from the $45 million Fund III and roughly $20 million original Opportunity Fund.</p>
<p>Version One is unveiling this new pool of capital after a very successful year for the firm, which is based in Vancouver and San Francisco. 2021 saw its first true blockbuster exit, with Coinbase&#8217;s IPO. The investor also saw big valuation boosts on paper for a number of its portfolio companies, including Ada (which raises at a $1.2 billion valuation in May); Dapper Labs (valued at $7.5 billion after riding the NFT wave); and Jobber (no valuation disclosed but raised a $60 million round in January).</p>
<p>I spoke to both Wertz and Tran about their run of good fortune, how they think the fund has achieved the wins it recorded thus far, and what Version One has planned for this Fund IV and its investment strategy going forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have this pretty broad focus of mission-driven founders, and not necessarily just investing in SaaS, or just investing in marketplaces, or crypto,&#8221; Wertz said regarding their focus. &#8220;We obviously love staying early — pre-seed and seed — we&#8217;re really the investors that love investing in people, not necessarily in existing traction and numbers. We love being contrarian, both in terms of the verticals we go in to, and and the entrepreneurs we back; we&#8217;re happy to be backing first-time entrepreneurs that nobody else has ever backed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In speaking to different startups that Version One has backed over the years, I&#8217;ve always been struck by how connected the founders seem to the firm and both Wertz and Tran — even much later in the startups&#8217; maturation. Tran said that one of their advantages is following the journey of their entrepreneurs, across both good times and bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;We get to learn,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s so cool to watch these companies scale [&#8230;] we get to see how these companies grow, because we stick with them. Even the smallest things we&#8217;re just constantly thinking about— we&#8217;re constantly thinking about Laura [Behrens Wu] at Shippo, we&#8217;re constantly thinking about Mike [Murchison] and David [Hariri] at Ada, even though it&#8217;s getting harder to really help them move the needle on their business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wertz also discussed the knack Version One seems to have for getting into a hot investment area early, anticipating hype cycles when many other firms are still reticent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We we went into crypto early in 2016, when most people didn&#8217;t really believe in crypto,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We started investing pretty aggressively in in climate last year, when nobody was really invested in climate tech. Having a conviction in in a few areas, as well as the type of entrepreneurs that nobody else really has conviction is what really makes these returns possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since climate tech is a relatively new focus for Version One, I asked Wertz about why they&#8217;re betting on it now, and why this is not just another green bubble like the one we saw around the end of the first decade of the 2000s.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, we deeply care about it,&#8221; he said. Secondly, we think there is obviously a new urgency needed for technology to jump into to what is probably one of the biggest problems of humankind. Thirdly, is that the clean tech boom has put a lot of infrastructure into the ground. It really drove down the cost of the infrastructure, and the hardware, of electric cars, of batteries in general, of solar and renewable energies in general. And so now it feels like there&#8217;s more opportunity to actually build a more sophisticated application layer on top of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tran added that Version One also made its existing climate bet at what she sees as a crucial inflection point — effectively at the height of the pandemic, when most were focused on healthcare crises instead of other imminent existential threats.</p>
<p>I also asked her about the new Opportunity Fund, and how that fits in with the early stage focus and their overall functional approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t require much change in the way we operate, because we&#8217;re not doing any net new investments,&#8221; Tran said. &#8220;So we recognize we&#8217;re not growth investors, or Series A/Series B investors that need to have a different lens in the way that they evaluate companies. For us, we just say we want to double down on these companies. We have such close relationships with them, we know what the opportunities are. It&#8217;s almost like we have information arbitrage.&#8221;</p>
<p>That works well for all involved, including LPs, because Tran said that it&#8217;s appealing to them to be able to invest more in companies doing well without having to build a new direct relationship with target companies, or doing something like creating an SPV designated for the purpose, which is costly and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Looking forward to what&#8217;s going to change with this fund and their investment approach, Wertz points to a broadened international focus made possible by the increasingly distributed nature of the tech industry following the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the thing that probably will change the most is just much more international investing in this one, and I think it&#8217;s just direct result of the pandemic and Zoom investing, that suddenly the pipeline has opened up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve certainly learned a lot about ourselves over the past year and a half,&#8221; Tran added. &#8220;I mean, we&#8217;ve always been distributed, [&#8230;] and being remote was one of our advantages. So we certainly benefited and we didn&#8217;t have to adjust our working style too much, right. But now everyone&#8217;s working like this, [&#8230;] so it&#8217;s going to be fun to see what advantage we come up with next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selling enterprise software is much more complicated than convincing a potential customer that your solution is the best and signing a contract. A <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey">recent Gartner study </a>found that buying groups for B2B solutions can involve up to six to 10 decision makers, and that the majority of buyers said their most recent purchase was “very complex or difficult” as they came to a consensus while negotiating with vendors.</p>
<p><a href="https://buyerassist.io/">BuyerAssist</a>, a new startup founded by former employees of sales readiness platform MindTickle, wants to make the buying process as smooth as possible. The company is launching its beta product to the public today with $2 million in seed funding led by Stellaris Venture Partners and Emergent Ventures, with participation from angel investors. The capital will be used for hiring in the U.S. and India, with plans to bring BuyerAssist’s platform out of beta later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Headquartered in San Francisco, with an office in Pune, India, BuyerAssist.io was founded last year by Amit Dugar, Shankar Ganapathy and Shyam HN, all alumni of SoftBank Vision 2-backed MindTickle, a platform that enables companies to train their sales staff at scale. The philosophy behind BuyerAssist draws on HN and Ganapathy’s experience on the sales and marketing side of MindTickle: Ganapathy was its director of strategic accounts, while HN served as head of global sales development.</p>
<p>“We’ve sold half a million dollar deals, and deals where you have anywhere form 10 to 25 people involved from the buyer side,” HN told TechCrunch. “There’s a core team of about five to 10 people, but then there is also an extended team that comes and goes during the process.”</p>

<p>The pandemic added an extra layer of complexity to B2B sales, because many deals were done remotely. Furthermore, sales representatives get less time to interact with buyers. The Gartner report found that when B2B buying teams consider a purchase, they spend only 17% of that time meeting with potential suppliers, and the amount of time they spend interacting with any sales representative may be only 5% to 6%. This means vendors have to find ways to keep potential buyers engaged, while making the process easier for them.</p>
<p>BuyerAssist describes itself as a &#8220;operating system for B2B companies to deliver the most effective buying experience.&#8221; It helps by providing a centralized place to gather information that would usually be buried in emails and notes, and make it searchable. It also lets both vendors and buyers share information about their needs (like pricing, information security reviews and when they want to deploy software by), creating more transparency for each side, and stores important files like proposals, contracts and legal documentation.</p>
<p>For vendors, having information and questions from potential buyers organized in one place can help them better understand their deals pipeline and meet revenue goals. BuyerAssist also provides analytics that can help them retain more contracts. For example, it alerts vendors when buyers become less engaged, which may mean they are losing interest.</p>
<p>During its beta stage, BuyerAssist worked with four companies. The platform is currently focused on enterprise software and SaaS companies that do a lot of their sales remotely, but can be used for any complex sales process that involves multiple calls and emails. Other sectors BuyerAssist wants to enter include manufacturing and financial services.</p>
<p>BuyerAssist is part of a new crop of startups focused on helping vendors and buyers work together on complicated sales. Others include Accord, MetaCX, Dealpoint and Redcapped.io. HN said that the space is still very new, so companies are still figuring out their positioning. In BuyerAssist’s case, this means focusing on buyer engagement, instead of mutual success plans or collaborations, from the beginning. HN said the company will double down on investing in two key areas of product development: building its enterprise grade product to support complex sales and becoming the preferred way for buying teams to engage with BuyerAssist’s clients.</p>
<p>In statement about the investment, Stellaris Venture Partners partner Alok Goyal said, “As a venture capitalist focusing on the SaaS space, we get to see hundreds of teams. But it is very rare to find teams that create a perfect storm of domain expertise, functional expertise in different areas of building SaaS companies and at the same time bringing the perfect complementarity between the founders.”</p>
<p>Anupam Rastogi, a partner at Emergent Ventures, said “What excites me about BuyerAssist is that it focuses on reducing friction between buyers and sellers. Buyers want more flexibility and less noise. Sellers want to run a more consistent sales process. BuyerAssist facilitates this, and enables both to build a long term partnership. This is where we see the industry heading in the years and decades to come.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D-printed rocket startup Relativity Space has raised a $650 million Series E, bringing its total raised to over $1.2 billion. Relativity’s post-money valuation now stands at $4.2 billion, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The round was led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, with participation from new investors with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Centricus, Coatue, and Soroban Capital, and participation from existing investors Baillie Gifford, K5 Global, Tiger Global, Tribe Capital, XN, Brad Buss, Mark Cuban, Jared Leto, and Spencer Rascoff.</p>
<p>The funds from the Series E will go toward accelerating the production of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/relativity-space-unveils-plans-for-a-new-much-larger-and-fully-reusable-rocket/">Terran R, the company’s heavy-lift, fully reusable two-stage rocket</a>. Terran R joins Terran 1, Relativity’s debut rocket, which will conduct its first orbital flight at the end of 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has been pretty tight-lipped about Terran R, but are now releasing further details alongside the funding announcement. As expected, Terran 1 and Terran R differ in pretty significant ways: the former is expendable, the latter reusable; the former is designed for small payloads, the latter for large. Even the Terran R’s payload fairing is reusable, and Relativity has devised a system that makes it easier to recover and recycle as it stays attached to the second stage.</p>
<p>The larger rocket will clock in at 216 feet tall with a maximum payload capacity of 20,000 pounds to low Earth orbit. (For comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket stands at around 230 feet with a maximum payload to LEO of 22,800 pounds.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162730" style="width: 4454px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162730" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2162730 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png" alt="" width="4444" height="2500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png 4444w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4444px) 100vw, 4444px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2162730" class="wp-caption-text">Relativity&#8217;s Terran 1 on the left, and Terran R on the right. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Relativity</p></div></p>
<p>Terran R will use seven of its new Aeon R engines on the first stage, each capable of 302,000 pounds of thrust. The same 3D printers that will produce Terran R&#8217;s engines and rockets also currently make the nine Aeon 1 engines that power the Terran 1, which means Relativity doesn&#8217;t have to drastically reconfigure its production line to build the new launch vehicle.</p>
<p>A single Terran R should take around 60 days to build, Ellis estimated. That&#8217;s an incredible pace for a rocket with this kind of payload capacity.</p>
<p>Even though Terran 1 has not seen a launch yet, Relativity shows no signs of slowing down Terran R’s development: Ellis said the company will also launch Terran R from its launch site at Cape Canaveral as early as 2024 and that it signed its first anchor customer, “a well-known blue-chip company,” for the new rocket.</p>
<p>Relativity has printed around 85% of the rocket that will perform the company’s first orbital flight at the end of this year. The Terran 1 that will perform that mission will not be carrying any payload. Terran 1’s second launch is scheduled to take place in June &#8217;22, and will carry cubesats to LEO as part of NASA’s Venture Class Launch Services Demonstration 2 (VCLS Demo 2) contract.</p>
<p>Relativity CEO Tim Ellis in an interview with TechCrunch likened 3D printing to a paradigm shift in manufacturing. “I think really the thing people haven&#8217;t gotten about our approach, or 3D printing in general, is it&#8217;s actually more like transitioning from gas internal combustion engines to electric, or on-premise service to cloud,” Ellis said. “3D printing is a cool technology but more than that, it&#8217;s actually software and data-driven manufacturing and automation technology.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BhkjEc6Q64?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Because the core of 3D printing is a technology stack, the company can produce algorithmically generated structures with “geometries that couldn’t be possible” with traditional manufacturing, Ellis said. And the design can be easily adjusted to fit market demand.</p>
<p>Ellis, who started the metal 3D printing division at Blue Origin before founding Relativity, said that the strategy from day one was to design and build Terran 1 and a heavy-lift counterpart.</p>
<p>The actual mechanisms involved in 3D printing can technically occur in environments even when gravity is much lower – like the gravity on Mars, which is only about 38% of the gravity on Earth. But more importantly, Ellis said it’s an approach that’s “inevitably required” in an uncertain off-planet environment.</p>
<p>“When we founded Relativity, the inspiration was watching SpaceX land rockets and dock with the space station. They were 13 years old and they were, despite all of that pretty inspiring success, the only company that wanted to make humanity a multi-planetary and go to Mars,” Ellis said. “And I thought that 3D printing tech was inevitable to actually build an industrial base on another planet. No one else had actually even tried to go to Mars or said that was their core mission. And that&#8217;s still true today, actually, even five years later, it&#8217;s still just us and SpaceX. And I really do hope to inspire dozens to hundreds of companies to go after that mission.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Digital transformation&#8221; has been on the mind of many an organization in the last year: the pandemic and the shift it&#8217;s brought to how we work are speeding up investments in new apps, infrastructure and work practices to improve productivity regardless of where we sit all day. Now, it looks like we&#8217;re on to the next stage of that journey: actually figuring out how to adopt and run with all that new tech.</p>
<p>In a sign of the times, today a startup called <a href="https://whatfix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whatfix</a> &#8212; which has built a platform that helps make better use of tech investments by giving chatbot-style guidance to users on how to use apps, with the option also to apply AI to understand what a person is doing to suggest what actions to take next &#8212; is announcing $90 million in funding. It will use the money to continue expanding its tech platform and hiring more talent to meet demand, said CEO Khadim Batti, who co-founded the company with Vara Kumar (CTO), in an interview this week.</p>
<p>Sources close to the company &#8212; co-headquartered in San Jose and Bangalore &#8212; confirmed that the Series D round was made at a valuation of around $600 million, triple Whatfix&#8217;s value in its Series C round last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That sharp rise is due in part to the state of the market today, but also the company&#8217;s growth within that bigger trend. Whatfix today has some 500 global customers on its books, The Netherlands Red Cross, Experian, Sentry Financial Services, Cardinal Health Canada, BMC Software Inc., and Bausch &amp; Lomb among them. Some 75% of its business is coming out of the U.S., with another 18% from Europe. Revenues in the last six months have been growing at a rate of 100% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;This pandemic has proven an inflection point for adoption,&#8221; said Batti (pictured above, left with Kumar, right).</p>
<p>This latest tranche of equity funding is coming from a mix of financial and strategic investors.</p>
<p>SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 is leading the round, with Eight Roads Ventures, Sequoia Capital India, Dragoneer Investment Group, F-Prime Capital and Cisco Investments also investing. The company has raised just under $140 million in total.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital adoption solutions&#8221; &#8212; the general term describing what Whatfix has built &#8212; have become a popular solution for enterprises that have found themselves in an IT pickle, Batti said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen more than $500 billion spent on enterprise software, with areas like SaaS growing very fast. There is so much there, and every employee has access to do better work. But most are not adopting or using that software. This means a lot [of inefficiency] in &#8216;digital transformation,'&#8221; said Batti. &#8220;We are focusing on fixing this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Digital adoption and digital experience overall can come in many forms these days.</p>
<p>They include assistants that are embedded directly into apps themselves (with some versions of this &#8212; such as Clippy on Word &#8212; nearly as old as software itself). The category also includes separate platforms that integrate at the back end with the apps that you use, providing not just a single ingestion point for data but intelligence on how best to use it, and what to use. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/dooly-raises-80m-more-for-its-ai-tools-to-help-salespeople-manage-their-busywork/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dooly</a> for sales teams is an example of that, although I don&#8217;t know if it would describe itself as a &#8220;digital adoption solution&#8221; per se.)</p>
<p>Others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/pendo-scores-100m-series-e-on-1-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pendo</a> are geared more at observing how your sites and apps are being adopted and used by others. And there are a number of others out there specifically looking at digital adoption by enterprises and competing directly with Whatfix: they include Apty, Userlane, Applearn.</p>
<p>One of the biggest &#8212; WalkMe &#8212; yesterday <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walkme-announces-launch-of-initial-public-offering-301306903.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced an IPO</a> at an estimated $2.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Overall digital adoption and digital experience are big businesses: one analyst <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-experience-platform-market-size-to-be-valued-at-15-80-billion-by-2025--owing-to-adoption-of-digital-platforms-for-developing-marketing-strategies-by-industry-participants--million-insights-301259286.html#:~:text=All%20Products-,Digital%20Experience%20Platform%20Market%20Size%20To%20Be%20Valued%20At%20%2415.80,By%20Industry%20Participants%20%7C%20Million%20Insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that the market is growing currently at a rate of just under 11% annually and will be worth $15.8 billion by 2025.</p>

That includes Whatfix being able to provide assistance on apps even when they have been customised for a particular workplace. It most commonly appears like a little chatbot on the user&#8217;s screen, like the one in this paragraph, which can expand with more details and information as needed, like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2162944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?w=179" alt="" width="179" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png 706w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?resize=179,300 179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?resize=405,680 405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px" /></p>
<p>The company works with the most popular software packages &#8212; including Salesforce, MS Dynamics, Oracle&#8217;s CRM platform, ServiceNow, SuccessFactors, SharePoint, Workday &#8212; but, since it is used in the form of a browser extension or an overlay integrated by a company&#8217;s IT department, it can be used to help guide people with any application that&#8217;s available over the web. Batti said that one priority the startup has is to build deeper integrations with specific apps so that Whatfix can be used better across mobile and with local apps in future, not just via the web.</p>
<p>Many might think of &#8220;digital adoption&#8221; as training someone to use a particular software package, and while Whatfix is used for that, the company has also found a lot of traction as a tool beyond it, providing support on a more regular basis and across a wider variety of use cases, whether it&#8217;s to help guide people through app usage, or to monitor what they are doing in order to help suggest what to do next, and even populate relevant fields if &#8220;next&#8221; means using a different app.</p>
<p>The platform can be used to create usage guides, multilingual support, multi-device support, user tracking and more, and it comes with low-code options (it can be intergrated into an app with a single line of code, the company says).</p>
<p>The company claims its assistants can increase employee productivity by 35%, reduce training time and costs by 60%, reduce employee case tickets by 50% and increase application data accuracy by 20%.</p>
<p>While the field for digital adoption is very crowded today, it&#8217;s numbers like these, Whatfix&#8217;s own growth, and the fact that software is continuing to get more capable, but also more complex, that have interested investors.</p>
<p>“Digital Adoption Solutions are enhancing the growth and importance of SaaS products for enterprises globally,” said Munish Varma, Managing Partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;Whatfix makes it easier for companies to use SaaS products, which increases productivity. Whatfix, with its roster of global clients, is well placed to become a DAS leader, and we are excited to be part of their journey.” Sumer Juneja, Partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, added: “Enterprises spend billions on applications across multiple functions and yet employee adoption is low. Quick adoption ensures payback on software investments. Whatfix’s solutions will be a key driver for enterprises to achieve this goal, which is reflected in their growth.”</p>
<p>What will be interesting to watch is how platforms like Whatfix&#8217;s will evolve over time, and what further functions they might take on. For example, in enterprises, one of the biggest vulnerabilities in security has been how people mistakenly click on dodgy links in emails or otherwise inadvertently pass on information to malicious hackers. Could there be a role for digital adoption assistants to identify when this might happen and alert people before they click the wrong way? Regardless, the question and very existence of loopholes like that are signals for why we&#8217;ll probably why we&#8217;ll continue to see tools like Whatfix&#8217;s around for some time to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An update to an existing art app that allows artists to access NFT marketplaces directly, could have the potential to democratize access to the NFT world for artists not currently in crypto. <a href="https://sketchar.io/">SketchAR</a>, is an existing mobile app that allows artists to turn photos into illustrations using its AI-based computer vision. It is now is launching a new feature that allows users to turn their art into NFTs directly inside the app, and then sell it. Content produced on the app can also include a public community feed and digital learning courses.</p>
<p>The app, which boasts it has almost a million users already, will start off selecting a single ‘Creator of the Week’ from its community for their art to be NFT’d on the OpenSea marketplace. But a new feature will shortly enable any artist using the platform to create and auction an NFT on-demand.</p>
<p>However, there a catch. The artwork will have to be created directly in the SketchAR app in order to prove the artist is the legitimate rights holder, says the startup. This is, however, an advantage, says the startup, since very few marketplaces monitor the derivation and authenticity of artworks uploaded proactively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And for now, it looks like there is no real equivalent app on the market, although there are of course plenty of ways to create an artwork and then upload it to an NFT marketplace in a separate process.</p>
<p>Andrey Drobitko, CEO and founder told me: “It’s a unique offer since it allows even amateur designers to create an art piece and turn it into an NFT without diving deep into the ecosystem, connecting their wallet to their OpenSea account and paying significant gas fees to minting.”</p>
<p>He said: “Since the art piece comes from the app SketchAR, it also ensures it’s authentic and wasn’t stolen &#8211; something that happened quite a few times with NFTs.&#8221;</p>
<p>SketchAR said it also built its own infrastructure that allows it to use Ethereum and other 2-layer solutions like Flow, Immutable, or Binance Smart Chain, to reduce costs.</p>
<p>“Basically it competes with artists and designers learning a lot about blockchain, how to work with it, and working directly with marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible” added Drobitko.</p>
<p>&#8220;15 years ago I realized I couldn’t make much money as an artist and only continued to make art for pleasure. It’s different now and we’re excited to support artists, help them develop creative skills, and successfully monetize their artworks,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s estimated there are roughly 50 million artists globally, but fewer than 10% are able to make it their primary source of income.</p>
<p>According to NonFungible.com more than $2 billion was spent on NFTs during the first quarter of 2021 representing an increase of about 2,100% from Q4 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based Simulate today announced a $50 million fundraise. Led by Alexis Ohanian’s 776, the Series B brings the meat alternative’s total funding to north of $60 million and values it at $260 million.</p>
<p>Simulate’s first product, Nuggs (formerly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/nuggs-rebrands-as-simulate-with-new-cash-a-new-cto-and-an-expanded-line-of-faux-meat-foods/">also the startup&#8217;s name</a>), has already caused a splash, thanks in no small part to aggressive online advertising. The company notes a massive push in retail availability in the last six months. The chicken nugget alternative was available direct to consumers through online ordering when it launched in Summer 2019 &#8212; availability that moved the needle during U.S. shutdowns over the past year.</p>
<p>“During the height of the pandemic, people really wanted frozen food shipped directly to their door,” founder and CEO Ben Pasternak tells TechCrunch. “At the time, we were DTC only, so we saw a lot of growth there prior to our pivot to retail.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He adds that the majority of the company’s sales now currently come from retail, due to accessibility and more restrictive DTC pricing. Currently, the product is available in 5,000 retail locations, a list that includes pretty massive retail names like Walmart/ Sam’s Club, Target and Whole Foods.</p>
<p>“We are getting ready to launch in restaurants and in fast food,” says Pasternak. “Internationally, we recently launched across Canada, and have plans to expand to other countries too.”</p>
<p>Funding will also go toward expanding the company’s headcount. Currently at 20, Simulate expects to expand employment to 50 people by 2022. “Over half of that expansion will be focused on growing our engineering team,” Pasternak says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>, a corporate spend startup, announced that it has closed a $60 million Series B led by Menlo Ventures. The deal&#8217;s announcement comes after Divvy, another corporate-spend focused startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">sold to Bill.com for several billion dollars</a>, and other unicorns in the space like Brex and Divvy each raised nine-figure rounds.</p>
<p>According to Airbase CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/thejo?lang=en">Thejo Kote</a>, his company&#8217;s round is not a response to the Divvy sale. Instead, he told TechCrunch in an interview, his company kicked off its fundraising process before that deal was announced.</p>
<p>Not that what Airbase undertook was a process in the traditional sense; Kote did not spend months schlepping a deck along Sand Hill Road, imbibing mediocre architecture, overdressed MBAs and good weather in equal quantities. Instead, he decided that his firm was open to raising more capital in April despite having capital in the bank from previous investments, and 10 days later had signed a term sheet with Menlo.</p>
<p>Menlo partner and new Airbase board member Matt Murphy told TechCrunch in a separate interview that his firm had had its eye on the company for some time before its deal, allowing it to move quickly when Kote opened the door to more funding. (Murphy was candid in sharing that he had spent quite some time getting in front of Airbase, which we pass along as evidence of just how competitive the venture capital market can be in 2021.)</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O3IpjLhLG2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">Why did Bill.com pay $2.5B for Divvy?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why did Bill.com pay $2.5B for Divvy?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/embed/#?secret=O3IpjLhLG2" data-secret="O3IpjLhLG2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to Kote, his firm&#8217;s new capital was raised on a $600 million valuation, post-money, which means that the Menlo-led transaction involved 10% of the company&#8217;s shares.</p>
<h2>A segmenting market</h2>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/as-corporate-cards-are-subsumed-into-software-airbase-posts-rapid-growth/">coverage of the corporate spend market</a> has largely focused on the revenue growth of the competing players, and their decision to either charge for the software that they offer along with corporate cards or not. But Kote views the market as segmenting in a somewhat different manner, namely along target customer scale. Divvy, for example, went after SMBs, while Airbase has more of a mid-market focus.</p>
<p>The customer targeting matters, with Kote telling TechCrunch that mid-market companies are looking for a single solution to replace various point-services that they have traditionally paid for. In the case of corporate spend, that could mean that many companies are willing to pay for new software so long as it can replace several services that they were buying discretely before; say, corporate cards and expense management software.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WyG5dem4Xp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/">Spend management startup Ramp confirms $115M raise at a $1.6B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spend management startup Ramp confirms $115M raise at a $1.6B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/embed/#?secret=WyG5dem4Xp" data-secret="WyG5dem4Xp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kote said that the Divvy-Bill.com news was a &#8220;massive validation&#8221; of his company&#8217;s thesis that software would prove key in the market formerly focused on corporate cards, and that offering cards was itself a &#8220;race to the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the view of Airbase&#8217;s CEO, his company has a six to eight quarter lead on its competitors in product terms. The market will vet that perspective, but the company&#8217;s confidence in its vision and new capital should provide it with ample opportunity to prove out its thesis in the coming quarters, and see whether where it views its product in terms of market positioning viz. demand and competitors is correct.</p>
<h2>The investor perspective</h2>
<p>Menlo Ventures seems to think so, to the tune of its largest single check to date from a non-growth fund. What did Murphy et al. find so compelling about the company? In the investor&#8217;s view, Airbase has a shot at replacing point-solutions in mid-market companies, precisely as Kote imagines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Airbase consolidates all the different spend apps which greatly decreases complexity in workflows as finance teams previously had to jump from app to app and don’t have a real time, holistic view in one place. [&#8230;] Of course there is an advantage in not having to pay for multiple apps, but the biggest benefits are simplicity of workflows which is where we heard most of the product love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Murphy continued, adding that at many companies &#8220;a manager won’t know until after [a quarter ends] whether the team for example spent above or below budget,&#8221; which makes integrated solutions more attractive.</p>
<p>Why does the viewpoint matter? It implies that the market that Airbase can sell into is rather large; instead of considering the aggregate non-payroll spend that its possible customer companies may generate and then applying an interchange vig to the total to calculate its potential scale, we might tabulate mid-market software spend on expenses, accounting and other categories as the startup&#8217;s true TAM. And as Airbase can still generate top-line from interchange and other sources, it could be well-situated for long-term growth.</p>
<p>Of course, its competitors are not interested in letting Airbase have all the fun. Ramp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/">recently raised lots of capital</a>, and is investing in its own software stack. With a free price point, it&#8217;s perhaps the most aggressive player on the interchange-first side of its market. And Brex is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/22/2156073/">working to make lots of public noise</a>, again, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/">has its own tower of cash</a>, software focus and recently launched paid-SaaS service.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bGT5VIbNsw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/">Brex raises $425M at a $7.4B valuation, as the corporate spend war rages on</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brex raises $425M at a $7.4B valuation, as the corporate spend war rages on&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/embed/#?secret=bGT5VIbNsw" data-secret="bGT5VIbNsw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now Airbase has more cash than it has ever had in its accounts, and has been busy hiring. The company has picked up a CFO, a general counsel and a VP of sales, from Mattermost, Robinhood and Dropbox, respectively.</p>
<p>Which all sounds very much like the long-term prep work for an eventual IPO. Set your timers for 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, Colombian businessman David Velez decided to reinvent the Brazilian banking system. He didn’t speak Portuguese, nor was he an engineer or a banker, but he did have the conviction that the system was broken and that he could fix it. And as a former Sequoia VC, he also had access to capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His gut instinct and market analysis were right. Today, </span><a href="https://nubank.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nubank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced a $750 million extension to its Series G (which rang in at $400 million this past January), bringing the round to a total of $1.15 billion and their valuation to $30 billion &#8212; $5 billion more than </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/fintech-darling-nubank-raises-blockbuster-400m-series-g-at-25b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when we covered them in January.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extension funding was led by Berkshire Hathaway, which put in $500 million, and a number of other investors.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Velez and his team decided now was a good time to raise again, because, “We saw a great opportunity in terms of growth rate and we’re very tiny when compared to the incumbents,” he told TechCrunch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nubank is the biggest digital bank in the world by number of customers: 40 million. The company started as a tech company in Brazil that offered only a fee-free credit card with a line of credit of R$50 (about USD$10). </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lX85R2M1dP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/fintech-darling-nubank-raises-blockbuster-400m-series-g-at-25b-valuation/">Fintech darling Nubank raises blockbuster $400M Series G at $25B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fintech darling Nubank raises blockbuster $400M Series G at $25B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/fintech-darling-nubank-raises-blockbuster-400m-series-g-at-25b-valuation/embed/#?secret=lX85R2M1dP" data-secret="lX85R2M1dP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It now offers a variety of financial products, including a digital bank account, a debit card, insurance, P2P payment via Pix (the Brazilian equivalent of Zelle), loans, rewards, life insurance and an account and credit card for small business owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nubank serves unbanked or underserviced citizens in Brazil &#8212; about 30% of the population &#8212; and this approach can be extremely profitable because there are many more clients available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banking system in Brazil is one of the few bureaucracies in the country that is actually quite skillful, but the customer service remains unbearable, and banks charge exorbitant fees for any little transaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, the banking industry has been dominated by five major traditional banks: Itaú Unibanco, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, Santander and Caixa Economica Federal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Brazil remains Nubank’s primary market, the company also offers services in Colombia and Mexico (services launched in Mexico in 2018). The company still only offers the credit card in both countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The momentum we’re seeing in Mexico is terrific. Our Mexican credit card net promoter score (NPS) is 93, which is the highest we’ve had in Nubank history. In Brazil the highest we’ve had was 88,” Velez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has been on a hiring spree in the last few months, and brought on two heavyweight executives. Matt Swann replaced Ed Wible (the original CTO and co-founder). Wible continues to be an important player in the company, but more in a software developer capacity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swann previously served as CTO at Bookings.com and StubHub, and as CIO of the Global Consumer Bank at Citi, so he brings years of experience of scaling tech businesses, which is what Nubank is focused on now, though Velez wouldn’t confirm which countries are next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other major hire, Arturo Nunez, fills the new role of chief marketing officer. Nunez was head of marketing for Apple Latin America, amongst other roles with Nike and the NBA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may sound a little odd for a tech company not to have had a head of marketing, but Nubank takes pride in having a $0 cost of acquisition (CAC). Instead of spending money on marketing, they spend it on customer service and then rely on word of mouth to get the word out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we last spoke with Velez in January regarding the $400 million Series G, the company went from having 34 million customers to now having 40 million in a span of roughly 6 months. The funds will be used to grow the business, including hiring more people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen the entire market go digital, especially people who never thought they would,” Velez said. “There is really now an avalanche of all backgrounds [of people] who are getting into digital banking.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Countless popular websites including Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Stack Overflow, GitHub, gov.uk, Hulu, HBO Max, Quora, PayPal, Vimeo, Shopify, Stripe, and news outlets CNN, The Guardian, The New York Times, BBC and Financial Times are currently facing an outage. A glitch at <a href="https://www.fastly.com">Fastly</a>, a popular CDN provider, is thought to be the reason, according to a product manager at Financial Times. Fastly has <a href="https://status.fastly.com">confirmed it&#8217;s facing an outage</a> on its status website.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re currently investigating potential impact to performance with our CDN services,&#8221; the firm said.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><b>Update at 3:50 AM PT:</b> Some websites are slowly coming back up. &#8220;The issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented,&#8221; San Francisco-headquartered Fastly says on its <a href="https://status.fastly.com">status page</a>.</p>
<p><b>Update at 4:02 AM PT:</b> The issue seems to be resolved as affected websites and services now load normally. The company hasn&#8217;t communicated about the source of the outage yet. Overall, it lasted around an hour.</p>
<p>Content delivery networks (CDNs) are a key part of the internet infrastructure. These companies run global networks of servers to improve performance and availability of web services. CDNs act as proxy servers and cache some data as close to the end user as possible. For instance, media content is often cached at a CDN server near you so that it doesn&#8217;t have to be fetched on the original server every time a user loads a web page.</p>
<p>Even though the web is a digital platform, it’s very physical by nature. When you load a page on a server on the other side of the world, it’s going to take hundreds of milliseconds to get the page. Over time, this latency adds up and it feels like a sluggish experience. When a page is already cached, a CDN can usually start sending the content of the page in less than 25 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Over time, CDNs have added more features, such as load balancing, DDoS protection, web application firewalls and other security features. Popular CDNs include Fastly, Cloudflare, CloudFront on Amazon Web Services and Akamai.</p>
<p>Fastly in particular is quite popular with media websites. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/fastly-pops-in-public-offering-showing-that-theres-still-money-for-tech-ipos/">went public</a> in 2019. Fastly shares (NYSE:FSLY) are currently <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLY/">trading</a> at $48.06, down 5.21% compared to yesterday&#8217;s closing price.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s issue isn&#8217;t limited to a data center in particular. Fastly calls it a &#8220;global CDN disruption&#8221; and it sounds like it is affecting the company&#8217;s network globally.</p>

<p>The truck&#8217;s smaller more approachable size and its base price of $19,995 is geared towards entry-level customers who want that SUV or truck lifestyle as well as the ease of navigating and parking in tight urban centers. And while its not an all-electric truck like the upcoming Ford F-150 Lightning, the Maverick is part of the company&#8217;s recently expanded plan to invest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">$30 billion investment in electrification by 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The Maverick also has the distinction of being equipped with the first electric motor designed, developed, tested and manufactured in-house at Ford&#8217;s Van Dyke Transmission Plant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The electric motor and accompanying 2.5 liter engine produces 191 horsepower, 155 pound-feet of torque, and it can tow up to 2,000 pounds. That might not be attractive to those looking to haul one of the larger fifth-wheel campers on the market today. But with a targeted EPA fuel economy of 40 mpg in the city, Ford should find takers. Ford is also offering an option of the EcoBoost engine with an 8-speed automatic, that gives the Maverick 250 horsepower, 277 pound-feet of torque and towing capabilities of up to 4,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The Maverick will come standard as a front-wheel drive and be available in three trims, including the XL, XLT and the Lariat — similar to the F-Series variants. All-wheel drive upgrades are available.</p>
<h2>A bed that&#8217;s also a &#8216;makerspace&#8217;</h2>
<p>[gallery ids="2162823,2162824,2162825"]</p>
<p>The bed of the truck comes in at a polite size of 4.5 feet height by 4 feet wide – as opposed to the F-150&#8217;s 5.5 by 4.3 foot bed — is designed to be flexible. Ford, which wanted to be sure to get that message across, has branded it &#8220;flexbed,&#8221; because it&#8217;s, well, flexible to a range of needs.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s most popular pickup trucks, the F-150 series, are geared towards utility by providing plenty of wattage and storage for power tools. The Maverick is made with the DIY driver in mind. Ford has placed 12 available anchor points and slots that lets the owner subdivide as they might want. This so-called flexbed is equipped with two 12-volt 20-amp prewired sources, plus two 110-volt outlets for powering a &#8220;laptop or tailgate party,&#8221; as Ford suggests in a statement announcing the new vehicle.</p>
<p>Speaking of tailgates, the Maverick&#8217;s is multi-positional, so the driver can adjust it to hold open at whatever position best suits whatever they&#8217;re hauling, giving the truck a bed extender functionality.</p>
<p>Another neat feature of the pickup being so small is that the bed is designed to be accessible by reaching over the bedside, and the designers specifically focused on ensuring things were within reach for the fifth percentile of female.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s talk about tech</h2>
<p>The Maverick is a fully connected vehicle, as we&#8217;ve come to expect with any new vehicle these days. Ford&#8217;s latest pickup has its own hotpot that can give blessed internet to up to 10 devices and it comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. By connecting a smartphone, customers can access the FordPass app, which can be used to remote start the vehicle, lock and unlock doors, locate the truck and check fuel levels.</p>
<p>The compact pickup also has features of the Ford Co-Pilot 360, such as pre-collision assist with auto emergency braking, which alerts the driver through audio and visual signals. There are also high beam headlamps which flip on when no other cars are in front of you, a blindspot information system in case you just drift into another lane without checking over your shoulder, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control. This tech also allows for five standard drive modes including normal, eco, sport, slippery and tow/haul.</p>
<h2>Inside the Maverick</h2>
<p>The pickup&#8217;s interior a has colorful accents that are used to denote a place that&#8217;s intended for human interface such as the center mat with a charging pad or the vents. Rather than fake leather and fake wood, the Maverick features stone-face textures and speckled plastic.</p>
<p>There are some Ford Integrated Tether Slots which allows for customers to mix and match with different accessories they want to add to the interior, like extra cupholders or an iPad holder to entertain the kiddos in the backseat. Because the fuel tank is located behind the cabin, rather than under the bench, customers have far more under-seat storage space. Apparently that cabin can even hold buckets of ice for that tailgate Ford was talking about earlier.</p>
<p>The Maverick has also done away with the arm rests on the doors and speakers on the back doors, allowing more space for those tall S&#8217;well water bottles everyone loves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the lingering mysteries from Uber&#8217;s sale of its Uber ATG self-driving unit to Aurora has been solved.</p>
<p>Raquel Urtasun, the AI pioneer who was the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/uber-hires-raquel-urtasun-to-lead-a-new-atg-self-driving-unit-in-toronto/">chief scientist at Uber ATG</a>, has launched a new startup called Waabi that is taking what she describes as an &#8220;AI-first approach&#8221; to speed up the commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles, starting with long-haul trucks. Urtasun, who is the sole founder and CEO, already has a long list of high-profile backers, including separate investments from Uber and Aurora. Waabi has raised $83.5 million in a Series A round led by Khosla Ventures with additional participation from Uber, 8VC, Radical Ventures, OMERS Ventures, BDC, Aurora Innovation as well as leading AI researchers Geoffrey Hinton, Fei-Fei Li, Pieter Abbeel, Sanja Fidler and others.</p>
<p>Urtasun described <a href="https://waabi.ai/">Waabi</a>, which currently employs 40 people and operates in Toronto and California, as the culmination of her life&#8217;s work to bring commercially viable self-driving technology to society. The name of the company —  Waabi means &#8220;she has vision&#8221; in Ojibwe and &#8220;simple&#8221; in Japanese —  hints at her approach and ambitions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Autonomous vehicle startups that exist today use a combination of artificial intelligence algorithms and sensors to handle the tasks of driving that humans do such as detecting and understanding objects and making decisions based on that information to safely navigate a lonely road or a crowded highway. Beyond those basics are a variety of approaches, including within AI.</p>
<p>Most self-driving vehicle developers use a traditional form of AI. However, the traditional approach limits the power of AI, Urtasun said, adding that d<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">evelopers must manually tune the software stack, a complex and time-consuming task. The upshot, Urtasun says: Autonomous vehicle development has slowed and the limited commercial deployments that do exist operate in small and simple operational domains because scaling is so costly and</span> technically challenging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working in this field for so many years and, in particular, the industry for the past four years, it became more and more clear along the way that there is a need for a new approach that is different from the traditional approach that most companies are taking today,&#8221; said Urtasun, who is also a professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto and a co-founder of the Vector Institute for AI.</p>
<p>Some developers do use deep neural nets, a sophisticated form of artificial intelligence algorithms that allows a computer to learn by using a series of connected networks to identify patterns in data. However, developers typically wall off the deep nets to handle a specific problem and use a machine learning and rules-based algorithms to tie into the broader system.</p>
<p>Deep nets have their own set of problems. A long-standing argument is that they can&#8217;t be used with any reliability in autonomous vehicles in part because of the &#8220;black box&#8221; effect, in which the <em>how</em> and the <em>why</em> the AI solved a particular task is not clear. That is a problem for any self-driving startup that wants to be able verify and validate its system. It is also difficult to incorporate any prior knowledge about the task that the developer is trying to solve, like, oh, driving for instance. Finally, deep nets require an immense amount of data to learn.</p>
<p>Urtasun says she solved these lingering problems around deep nets by combining them with probabilistic inference and complex optimization, which she describes as a family of algorithms. When combined, the developer can trace back the decision process of the AI system and incorporate prior knowledge so they don&#8217;t have to teach the AI system everything from scratch. The final piece is a closed loop simulator that will allow the Waabi team to test at scale common driving scenarios and safety-critical edge cases.</p>
<p>Waabi will still have a physical fleet of vehicles to test on public roads. However, the simulator will allow the company to rely less on this form of testing. &#8220;We can even prepare for new geographies before we drive there,&#8221; Urtasun said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a huge benefit in terms of the scaling curve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urtasun&#8217;s vision and intent isn&#8217;t to take this approach and disrupt the ecosystem of OEMs, hardware and compute suppliers, but to be a player within it. That might explain the backing of Aurora, a startup that is developing its own self-driving stack that it hopes to first deploy in logistics such as long-haul trucking.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the moment to really do something different,&#8221; Urtasun said. &#8220;The field is in need of a diverse set of approaches to solve this and it became very clear that this was the way to go.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Monday afternoon, the U.S. Justice Department said it has seized much of the cryptocurrency ransom that  U.S. pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline paid last month to a Russian hacking collective called DarkSide by tracking the payment as it moved through different accounts belonging to the hacking group and finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/07/us/biden-news-today#colonial-pipeline-ransom-justice-department">breaking into one of those accounts</a> with the blessing of a federal judge.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a feel-good twist to a saga that began with a cyberattack on Colonial and resulted in a fuel shortage made worse by the panic-purchasing of gasoline last month after the company shut down one of its major pipelines (and later suffered a second pipeline shutdown owing to what it described as an overworked internal server). But Christopher Alhberg, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/02/recorded-future-ceo-richard-ahlberg-interview-after-780-million-sale.html">successful</a> serial entrepreneur and the founder of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</a>, a security intelligence company that tracks threats to the government and corporations and runs its own <a href="https://therecord.media/">media arm</a>, suggests that Americans have overestimated DarkSide all along. He explained a lot about the way its operations work last week in an interview that you can <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/intelligence-expert-serial-entrepreneur-christopher/id1498270180?i=1000524313050">hear here</a>. Shorter excerpts from that conversation follow, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Broadly, how does your tech work?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CA: What we do is try to index the internet. We try to get in the way of data from everything that&#8217;s written on the internet, down to the electrons moving, and we try and index that in a way that it can be used for for people who are defending companies and defending organizations. . .  We try to get into the heads of the bad guys, get to the where the bad guys hang out, and understand that side of the equation. We try to understand what happens on the networks where the bad guys operate, where they execute their stuff, where they basically transmit data, where they run the illicit infrastructure &#8212; all of those things. And we also try to get in the way of the traces that the bad guys leave behind, which could be in all kinds of different interesting places.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who are your customers?</strong></p>
<p>CA: We have about 1,000 of them in total, and they range from the Department of Defense to some of the largest companies in the world. Probably a third of our business is [with the] government, one third of our businesses are in the financial sector, then the rest [comprise] a whole set of verticals, including transportation, which has been big.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re helping them predict attacks or understand what happened in cases where it&#8217;s too late?</strong></p>
<p>CA: It can go both ways.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are some of the clues that inform your work?</strong></p>
<p>CA: One is understanding the adversary, the bad guys, and they largely fall in two buckets: You&#8217;ve got cyber criminals, and you&#8217;ve got adversary intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>The criminals over the last month or two here that the world and us, too, have been focused on are these ransomware gangs. So these are Russian gangs, and when you hear &#8216;gang,&#8217; people tend to think about large groups of people [but] it&#8217;s typically a guy or two or three. So I wouldn&#8217;t over estimate the size of these gangs.</p>
<p>[On the other hand] intelligence agencies can be very both well-equipped and [involve] large sets of people. So one piece is about tracking them. Another piece is about tracking the networks that they operate on . . Finally, [our work involves] understanding the targets, where we get data on the potential targets of a cyber attack without having access to the actual systems on premises, then tying the three buckets together in an automated fashion.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you see a lot of cross pollination between intelligence agencies and some of these Russian cutouts?</strong></p>
<p>CA: The short answer is these groups are not, in our view, being tasked on a daily or monthly or maybe even yearly basis by Russian intelligence. But in a series of countries around the world &#8212; Russia, Iran, North Korea is a little bit different, to some degree in China &#8212; what we&#8217;ve seen is that government has encouraged a growing hacker population that&#8217;s been able, in an unchecked way, to be able to pursue their interest &#8212; in Russia, largely &#8212; in cyber crime. Then over time, you see intelligence agencies in Russia &#8212; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)">FSB</a>, <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-svr-denies-solarwinds/31260606.html">SVR</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRU">GRU</a> &#8212;  being able to poach people out of these groups or actually task them. You can find in official documents how these guys have mixed and matched over a long period of time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What did you think when DarkSide came out soon after the cyberattack and said it could no longer access its Bitcoin or payment server and that it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/business/darkside-pipeline-hack.html">shutting down</a>?</strong></p>
<p>CA: If you did this hack, you probably had zero idea what Colonial Pipeline actually was when you did it. You&#8217;re like, &#8216;Oh, shit, I&#8217;m all over the American newspapers.&#8217; And there are probably a couple of phone calls starting to happen in Russia, where basically, again, &#8216;What the hell did you just do? How are you going to try to cover that up?&#8217;</p>
<p>One of the simplest first things you&#8217;re going to do is to basically say either, &#8216;It wasn&#8217;t me&#8217; or you&#8217;re going to try to say, &#8216;We lost the money; we lost access to our servers.&#8217; So I think that was probably fake that whole thing [and that] what they were doing was just to try to cover their tracks, [given that] we found them later come back and try to do other things. I think we overestimated the ability of the U.S. government to come rapidly right back at these guys. That will just not happen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/business/darkside-pipeline-hack.html">that fast</a>, though this is pure conjuring. I&#8217;m not saying that with access to any inside government information or anything of the sort.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I was just reading that DarkSide <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/hacker-group-darksides-operates-in-a-similar-way-to-a-franchise-new-york-times-reporter-says.html">operates like a franchise</a> where individual hackers can come and receive software and use it like a turnkey process. Is that new and does that mean that it opens up hacking to a much broader pool of people?</strong></p>
<p>CA:  That&#8217;s right. One of the beauties of the Russian hacker underground is in its distributed nature. I&#8217;m saying &#8216;beauty&#8217; with a little bit of sarcasm, but some people will write the actual ransomware. Some will use the services that these guys provide and then be the guys who might do the hacking to get into the systems. Some other guys might be the ones who operate the Bitcoin transactions through the Bitcoin tumbling that gets needed . . . One of the interesting points is that to get the cash out in the end game, these guys need to go through one of these exchanges that ended up being more civilized businesses, and there might be money mules involved, and there are people who run the money mules. A lot of these guys do credit card fraud; there&#8217;s a whole set of services there, too, including testing if a card is alive and being able to figure out how you get money out of it. There are probably 10, 15, maybe  20 different types of services involved in this. And they&#8217;re all very highly specialized, which is very much why these guys have been able to be so successful and also why it&#8217;s hard to go at it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do they share the spoils and if so, how?</strong></p>
<p>CA: They do. These guys run pretty effective systems here. Obviously, Bitcoin has been an incredible enabler in this because there is a way to do payments [but] these guys have whole systems for ranking and rating of themselves much like an eBay seller. There&#8217;s a whole set of these underground forums that have historically has been the places that these guys have been operating and they&#8217;ll including include services there for being able to say that somebody is a scammer [meaning in relation to the] thieves who are among the cyber criminals. It&#8217;s much like the internet. Why does the internet work so well? Because it&#8217;s super distributed.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s your advice to those who aren&#8217;t your customers but want to defend themselves?</strong></p>
<p>CA: A colleague produced a pie chart to show what industries are being hit by ransomware and what&#8217;s amazing is that it was just super distributed across 20 different industries. With Colonial Pipeline, a lot of people were like, &#8216;Oh, they&#8217;re coming from the oil.&#8217; But these guys could care less. They just want to find the slowest moving target. So make sure you&#8217;re not the easiest target.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are plenty of companies out there doing the basics and making sure that your systems are patched [but also] hit that damn update button. Get as much of your stuff off the internet so that it&#8217;s not facing out. Keep as little surface area as you can to the outside world. Use good passwords, use multiple two-factor authentication on everything and anything that you can get your hands on.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a checklist of 10 things that you&#8217;ve got to do in order to not be that easy target. Now, for some of these guys &#8212; the really sophisticated gangs &#8212; that&#8217;s not enough. You&#8217;ve got to do more work, but the basics will make a big difference here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabify wants to own the way people in cities move. The Spanish-born ride-hailing company is rolling out a pilot multi-modal subscription model to 40,000 users in Madrid this week, with plans to expand to its other markets throughout Spain and Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;Cabify Go!&#8221; subscription service appears to have something for everyone. All of Cabify’s different mobility offerings &#8212; ride-hailing service, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/movo-grabs-22-5m-to-get-more-cities-in-latam-scooting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric micromobility subsidiary MOVO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bike subscription service Bive and courier service &#8212; are already available under one app, but now customers will also be able to select one of three plans that reflect the mobility needs of different users. Select users will now see a &#8220;Go!&#8221; button on the top-right corner of the screen. This is a step toward making the Cabify name ubiquitous among city dwellers planning a trip, whether they’re taking an old-fashioned taxi ride to the airport or are riding a scooter to work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The subscription scheme ‘Cabify Go!’ is born to make our app their recurring platform, with diverse available services,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leonor Barrueco, Cabify&#8217;s VP of growth,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch. “This approach is strongly aligned with our goal of becoming the leading multi-mobility platform. At this stage there&#8217;s an opportunity to get closer to our users&#8217; multiple and varying needs. We want to offer our users convenient, diverse and sustainable ways to move around the city at an affordable monthly fee.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main subscription offering, &#8220;Cabify Go! Todo en uno&#8221; or &#8220;Everything in one&#8221; plan, costs €6.95 per month and gives users a blanket 10% discount on all their Cabify trips, as well as 30% off Cabify Envíos, its courier service. Subscribers also get two free cancellations each month and are exempt from the additional fee incurred from high demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabify is also offering the &#8220;A dos ruedas&#8221; or &#8220;On two wheels&#8221; plan, which costs €19.95 per month and includes 10 free MOVO rides of up to €6 without any additional cost. The mobility company expects subscriptions to help bring on new users. Currently, the rate of new users in Cabify&#8217;s moped segment is nearly 1.5 times higher than the ride-hailing services&#8217; rate, according to Barrueco. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Given the convergence of the platform space where customers can demand a variety of booming multi-mobility services, some users might be new to alternative options whilst some are new to the whole multi-mobility ecosystem,&#8221; said Barrueco.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, its &#8220;Pedelea&#8221; or &#8220;Pedal&#8221; plan includes the Bive long-term rental service for electric or mechanical bikes, with a competitive monthly price of €49.95 and €28.95, respectively. Servicing and maintenance is included, as well as a 10% discount on ride-hailing trips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bive, which Cabify introduced about a year ago, has already spread from Madrid to Valencia, Sevilla and Barcelona. By integrating the service into Cabify’s subscription offerings, the company hopes to promote the Bive service through another outlet, an idea borne out by internal insights. Barrueca says that 50% of Bive’s user base are new users to the Cabify platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no sign-up or cancellation fees for any of the services, and users can cancel at any time, according to Barrueco. But that&#8217;s par for the course when it comes to mobility subscriptions, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which seem to be on the rise as the subscription business model grows to answer shifting consumption habits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to monetization tech developer <a href="https://www.telecoming.com/blog/subscronomics-the-subscription-economy-will-surpass-228-billion-during-2021/">Telecoming&#8217;s 2021 Subscronomics Report</a>, in the European market, &#8220;with a base of 353 million households and more than 2,100 connected devices (22% of the total worldwide), 560 million subscriptions will be purchased this year (25% of the worldwide total).&#8221; This is expected to contribute to a global subscriptions industry of almost $228 billion, which is 31% higher than in 2020, with an average YOY growth of 23% from now until 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies that have jumped on the monthly rental train early include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/unagi-expands-e-scooter-subscriptions-with-10-5m-in-new-funding/">Unagi</a> with its e-scooters, Swapfiets with bikes and e-bikes and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ev-subscription-service-onto-partners-with-shell-to-expand-access-to-charging/">Onto with electric vehicles</a>.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="S7CaWds4Tt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ev-subscription-service-onto-partners-with-shell-to-expand-access-to-charging/">EV subscription service Onto partners with Shell to expand access to charging</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barrueco says one of Cabify&#8217;s goals in increasing its own business is to contribute to the transformation of cities to be more people-centric and environmentally friendly by making shared modes of transport more accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the company’s top priorities is to ramp up and consolidate our multimobility service proposition which provides our users with diverse sustainable alternatives and aims to replace the dominance of the private car,&#8221; said Barrueco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the global share of EVs over Cabify&#8217;s entire fleet is only about 1%, with hybrid vehicles accounting for 3%, Cabify is targeting 2025 for full electrification for collaborating fleets in Spain, and 2030 in Latin America. The company is collaborating with a number of stakeholders, including IDB Invest, the Ministry of Energy in Chile and car brands to test suitable EV models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This common journey to the general adoption of EVs entails tackling a number of urban and sector-wide challenges such as the scarcity of EV models that are autonomy-wise compatible with ride-hailing services, battery life spans, legal certainty in access to credit or the characteristics and availability of charging points,&#8221; said Barrueco.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rush to back lidar companies continues as more automakers and robotaxi startups include the remote sensing method in their vehicles.</p>
<p>Latest to the investment boom is Hesai, a Shanghai-based lidar maker founded in 2014 with an office in Palo Alto. The company just raised over $300 million in a Series D funding round led by GL Ventures, the venture capital arm of storied private equity firm Hillhouse Capital, smartphone maker Xiaomi, on-demand services giant Meituan and CPE, the private equity platform of Citic.</p>
<p>Hesai <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SIj9Hh7X2qzFauVX9mnFEA">said</a> the new proceeds will be spent on mass-producing its hybrid solid-state lidar for its OEM customers, the construction of its smart manufacturing center, and research and development on automotive-grade lidar chips. The company said it has accumulated &#8220;several hundred million dollars&#8221; in funding to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other participants in the round included Huatai Securities, Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Capital, as well as Qiming Venture Partners. Bosch, Baidu, and ON Semiconductor are also among its shareholders.</p>
<p>Another Chinese lidar startup Innovusion, a major supplier to electric vehicle startup Nio, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/innovusion-64-millions-series-b/">$64 million round led by Temasek</a> in May. Livox is another emerging lidar maker that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/innovusion-64-millions-series-b/">was an offshoot of DJI</a>.</p>
<p>Lidar isn&#8217;t limited to powering robotaxis and passenger EVs, and that&#8217;s why Hesai got Xiaomi and Meituan onboard. Xiaomi makes hundreds of different connected devices through its manufacturing suppliers that could easily benefit from industrial automation, to which sensing technology is critical. But the phone maker also unveiled plans this year to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/xiaomi-ev-subsidiary/"> make electric cars</a>.</p>
<p>Meituan, delivering food to hundreds of millions of consumers in China, could similarly benefit from replacing human riders with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/meituan-jd-com-and-neolix-begin-autonomous-deliveries-in-beijing/"> lidar-enabled unmanned vans and drones</a>.</p>
<p>Hesai, with a staff of over 500 employees, says its clients span 70 cities across 23 countries. The company touts Nuro, Bosch, Lyft, Navya, and Chinese robotaxi operators Baidu, WeRide and AutoX among its customers. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last year, it kickstarted a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/scale-ai-releases-free-lidar-dataset-to-power-self-driving-car-development/">partnership with Scale AI</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, a data labeling company, to launch an open-source data set for training autonomous driving algorithms, with data collected using Hesai&#8217;s lidar in California. </span></p>
<p>Last July, Hesai and lidar technology pioneer Velodyne <a href="https://www.hesaitech.com/en/media/46">entered a long-term licensing agreement</a> as the two dismissed legal proceedings in the U.S., Germany and China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple announced a handful of privacy-focused updates at its annual software developer conference on Monday. One called Private Relay particularly piques the interest of Chinese users living under the country&#8217;s censorship system, for it encrypts all browsing history so nobody can track or intercept the data.</p>
<p>As my colleague Roman Dillet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Private Relay is turned on, nobody can track your browsing history — not your internet service provider, anyone standing in the middle of your request between your device and the server you’re requesting information from. We’ll have to wait a bit to learn more about how it works exactly.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The excitement didn&#8217;t last long. Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-privacy/apples-new-private-relay-feature-will-not-be-available-in-china-idUSL2N2NP2UK">told Reuters</a> that Private Relay won&#8217;t be available in China alongside Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Apple couldn&#8217;t be immediately reached by TechCrunch for comment.</p>
<p>Virtual private networks or VPNs are popular tools for users in China to bypass the &#8220;great firewall&#8221; censorship apparatus, accessing web services that are otherwise blocked or slowed down. But VPNs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/">don&#8217;t necessarily protect users&#8217; privacy</a> because they simply funnel all the traffic through VPN providers&#8217; servers instead of users&#8217; internet providers, so users are essentially entrusting VPN firms with protecting their identities. Private Relay, on the other hand, doesn&#8217;t even allow Apple to see one&#8217;s browsing activity.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90643627/apple-privacy-wwdc-private-relay-vpn-icloud-plus-macos-monterey">interview</a> with Fast Company, Craig Federighi, Apple&#8217;s senior vice president of software engineering, explained why the new feature may be superior to VPNs:</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope users believe in Apple as a trustworthy intermediary, but we didn’t even want you to have to trust us [because] we don’t have this ability to simultaneously source your IP and the destination where you’re going to–and that’s unlike VPNs. And so we wanted to provide many of the benefits that people are seeking when in the past they’ve decided to use a VPN, but not force that difficult and conceivably perilous privacy trade-off in terms of trusting it a single intermediary.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether Private Relay will simply be excluded from system upgrades for users in China and the other countries where it&#8217;s restricted, or it will be blocked by internet providers in those regions. It also remains to be seen whether the feature will be available to Apple users in Hong Kong, which has seen an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hong-kong-security-censorship-idUSKBN29K0ZM">increase in online censorship</a> in the past year.</p>
<p>Like all Western tech firms operating in China, Apple is trapped between antagonizing Beijing and flouting the values it espouses at home. Apple has a history of caving in to Beijing&#8217;s censorship pressure, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/tesla-china-user-data-storage/">migrating all user data in China </a>to a state-run cloud center, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/29/apple-removes-vpn-apps-from-the-app-store-in-china/">cracking down on independent VPN apps</a> in China, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/apple-restricts-chinese-podcasts/">limiting free speech in Chinese podcasts</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/apple-removes-two-rss-feed-readers-from-china-app-store/">removing RSS feed readers from the China App Store</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Hey, founders between gigs: What now?</p>
<p>If you exited your last company for airplane money and are now independently wealthy, congratulations! If you want to build another company, just self-fund. If you want outside capital, VCs will chase after you to invest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most founders are not in that position: <a href="https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate">nine out of 10 startups fail</a>. Even if you achieve a high valuation, you might end up like <a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/21742/fanduel-founders-common-shareholders-get-nothing-in-ppb-deal/">FanDuel</a>’s founders: Their investors got the benefit of a $465 million exit; the founders got zero.</p>
<p>As someone with &#8220;founder&#8221; on your resume, you face a greater challenge when trying to get a traditional salaried job. You’ve already shown that you really want to lead a company and not just rise up the ladder, which means some employers are <a href="https://twitter.com/jstrauss/status/1388909396034408452?s=11">less likely</a> to hire you. One research <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMBPP.2020.90">paper</a> found:</p>
<blockquote><p>[F]ormer founders receive fewer callbacks than non-founders; however, all founders are not disadvantaged similarly. Former founders of successful ventures receive <strong>even fewer </strong>[emphasis added] callbacks than former founders of failed ventures. Through 20 interviews with technical recruiters, we highlight the mechanisms driving this founder-experience discount: concerns related to the applicant&#8217;s capability and ability to fit into and remain committed to the wage employment and the hiring firm.</p></blockquote>
<p>At my prior firm, ff Venture Capital, we invested in a company co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-jenkins-1a09b2172/">Nate Jenkins</a>, who had a successful exit, but not quite enough to buy a private plane. He’s now researching his next opportunity and interviewing for some jobs. At the end of a recent interview, the interviewer summarized, &#8220;I&#8217;ll hire you, but is this what you really want to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, Samuel Sabin, CEO of <a href="https://www.hireblue.co/">HireBlue</a>, observed, “Some founders who work better with more resources at their disposal may be tapped for intrapreneurship roles. Also, some companies value a self-starter mentality.”</p>
<p>So what should you do? Especially if your life partner and/or bank account are burnt out on the income volatility of startups?</p>
<p>I’ve been in this situation myself when I shut down one startup and exited two others. I think you have six main options:</p>
<h3>Full-time initiatives</h3>
<ol>
<li>Launch a new company.</li>
<li>Get a job.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part-time activities</h3>
<ol>
<li>Angel investing, venture capital and mentoring.</li>
<li>Consulting.</li>
<li>Sell information products.</li>
<li>Education and self-improvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>At <a href="http://versatilevc.com">Versatile VC</a>, our new VC fund, we’re creating an online community just for founders who are in transition, <a href="https://versatilevc.com/fnm">Founders’ Next Move</a>. We hope you will join us!</p>
<h2>Full-time initiatives</h2>
<h3>Launch a new company</h3>
<p>If you want to work on your startup idea, the bar for starting a company should always be very high. VCs have a diversified portfolio and most of their investments die. You don’t have a diverse portfolio and so you’re taking far more risk than the VCs. For free resources to help research your ideas, see <a href="http://teten.com/mr">What startup will you build?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just after the release of iOS 12 in 2018, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/ios-12-is-now-available-to-download/">introduced</a> its own built-in screen time tracking tools and controls. It then began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/apple-puts-third-party-screen-time-apps-on-notice/">cracking down</a> on third-party apps that had implemented their own screen time systems, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/28/apple-defends-its-takedown-of-some-apps-monitoring-screen-time/">saying they had done so</a> through technologies that risked user privacy. What wasn&#8217;t available at the time? A Screen Time API that would have allowed developers to tap into Apple&#8217;s own Screen Time system and build their own experiences that augmented its capabilities. That&#8217;s now changed.</p>
<p>At Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, it <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/">introduced</a> a new Screen Time API that offers developer access to frameworks that will allow a parental control experience that also maintains user privacy.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh there’s a Screen Time API, nice <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC21?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC21</a> <a href="https://t.co/Et6lfs6g7X">pic.twitter.com/Et6lfs6g7X</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) <a href="https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1401986759198658560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company added three new Swift <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ManagedSettings?changes=latest_minor">frameworks</a> to the iOS SDK that will allow developers to create apps that help parents manage what a child can do across their devices and ensure those restrictions stay in place.</p>
<p>The apps that use this API will be able to set restrictions like locking accounts in place, preventing password changes, filtering web traffic and limiting access to applications. These sorts of changes are already available through Apple&#8217;s Screen Time system, but developers can now build their own experiences where these features are offered under their own branding and where they can then expand on the functionality provided by Apple&#8217;s system.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">ScreenTime API looks great, I sincerely hope someone provides me a way to bulk change stuff for my kids. If I had known I would have to tweak each kids ScreenTime individually like I do today, I might have had less children. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC21?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC21</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Stan Lemon (@stanlemon) <a href="https://twitter.com/stanlemon/status/1402023431487606789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Developers&#8217; apps that take advantage of the API can also be locked in place so it can only be removed from the device with a parent&#8217;s approval.</p>
<p>The apps can authenticate the parents and ensure the device they&#8217;re managing belongs to a child in the family. Plus, Apple said the way the system will work lets parents choose the apps and websites they want to limit without compromising user privacy. (The system returns only opaque tokens instead of <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mdm/bundle-ids-for-native-ios-and-ipados-apps-mdm90f60c1ce/web">identifiers for the apps</a> and website URLs, Apple told developers, so the third-parties aren&#8217;t gaining access to private user data like app usage and web browsing details. This would prevent a shady company from building a Screen Time app only to collect troves of user data about app usage, for instance.)</p>
<p>The third-party apps can also create unique time windows for different apps or types of activities, and warn the child when time is nearly up. When it registers the time&#8217;s up, the apps lock down access to websites and apps and perhaps remind the child it&#8217;s time to do their homework &#8212; or whatever other experience the developer has in mind.</p>
<p>And on the flip side, the apps could create incentives for the child to gain screen time access after they complete some other task, like doing homework, reading or chores, or anything else.</p>
<p>Developers could use these features to design new experiences that Apple&#8217;s own Screen Time system doesn&#8217;t allow for today, by layering their own ideas on top of Apple&#8217;s basic set of controls. Parents would likely fork over their cash to make using Screen Time controls easier and more customized to their needs.</p>
<p>Other apps could tie into Screen Time too, outside of the &#8220;family&#8221; context &#8212; like those aimed at mental health and well-being, for example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oooh &#8211; an API for Screen Time! Definitely want to build support for this into Streaks, if possible.<a href="https://t.co/keuaJ6WFvo">https://t.co/keuaJ6WFvo</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wwdc21?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#wwdc21</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Quentin Zervaas (@qzervaas) <a href="https://twitter.com/qzervaas/status/1401985372733665282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Of course, developers have been asking for a Screen Time API since the launch of Screen Time itself, but Apple didn&#8217;t seem to prioritize its development until the matter of Apple&#8217;s removal of rival screen time apps was brought up in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apple-ceo-tim-cook-questioned-over-app-stores-removal-of-rival-screen-time-apps-in-antitrust-hearing/">an antitrust hearing last year</a>. At the time, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended the company&#8217;s decision by explaining that apps had been using MDM (mobile device management) technology, which was designed for managing employee devices in the enterprise, not home use. This, he said, was a privacy risk.</p>
<p>Apple has a session during WWDC that will detail how the new API works, so we expect we&#8217;ll learn more soon as the developer info becomes more public.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Today was the kickoff of Apple’s developer conference, WWDC, meaning that the TechCrunch crew was super busy all day and that we have an ocean of news from Cupertino for you to enjoy. But the startup market was just as busy, thankfully, with some fascinating funding rounds, acquisitions and more to parse through. Today we have something for everyone! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p>P.S. Including all of you interested in finance. Here’s a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/this-spac-is-betting-that-a-british-healthcare-company-can-shake-up-the-us-market/">teardown of the Babylon Health SPAC deal</a>. Enjoy!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/live-from-apples-wwdc-2021-keynote/">Apple’s keynote lucre</a>:</strong> Apple’s keynote today was the usual affair of animation, on-screen text, musicals, and lots and lots of news. More below <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-ios-15-with-new-features-for-facetime-and-better-notifications/">but iOS 15</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-shareplay-for-co-watching-streaming-and-screen-sharing-over-facetime/">SharePlay</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">iCloud+</a></strong> are obvious standouts.</li>
<li><strong>The global chip shortage: </strong>The global chip shortage won’t lift until <strong><a href="https://t.co/7N8zkc7TBE">late next year</a></strong>, meaning that we’re likely going to see investment in new chip-fab capacity. Like the news today that <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/bosch-opens-1-2-billion-chip-plant-in-germany/">Bosch opened a $1.2 billion chip manufacturing facility in Germany</a></strong>. Much like the AI market is cleaving along geopolitical fault lines, in time, more countries are going to want to have domestic chip-fab capabilities as a form of self-reliance.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/paytm-ipo-shareholders/">Paytm is going public</a>: </strong>Noida, India-based Paytm, the most valuable startup in the country, will go public, it told employees recently. That’s good news for the company, we suppose, but also potentially big news for India’s larger startup and venture capital scene.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/astra-to-acquire-electric-in-space-propulsion-company-apollo-fusion/"><strong>Astra buys Apollo Fusion</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This is a fun one. Astra, a space launch upstart that is pursuing a SPAC-led IPO, is buying Apollo Fusion, which is focused on what TechCrunch described as “electric propulsion.” So not fusion, sadly, but electric propulsion is a key space technology that allows satellites, for example, to move around while in orbit. It can also be fuel-sipping to a degree, making it a tech that could help satellites and other heavenly bodies enjoy long service lives.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/tiger-global-leads-30m-investment-into-briq-a-fintech-for-the-construction-industry/"><strong>Briq raises its construction-focused fintech service</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The recent implosion of construction-unicorn Katerra is not stopping venture investment in its market. Today Briq, a startup that provides fintech solutions to construction companies, announced that Tiger Global has led a $30 million round into its business. Normally a $30 million check would give us a good feel for how big Briq’s revenue base is today. But with market scuttlebutt indicating that Tiger is content to pour capital into companies with diminutive revenues, it’s hard to say. Briq told TechCrunch that its annual recurring revenue grew by 200% in the last year.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/mendel-raises-18m-to-tease-out-data-structure-from-medicines-disparate-document-trove/">Mendel raises $18M to structure unstructured medical data</a>:</strong> Every industry creates lots of data these days, but the medical industry sweats data like a first-time Peloton user. And, as you can imagine, most of the data that off-gases from the medical world is unstructured and generally a mess. Enter Mendel, which wants to organize, share and exchange medical data after it ingests and cleans it up. I dig it.</li>
<li>Finally today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/lightspeed-buys-ecwid-for-500m-nuorder-for-425m-in-ongoing-e-commerce-consolidation-play/"><strong>Lightspeed has acquired</strong></a> “e-commerce platform Ecwid for $500 million, and NuOrder, a B2B ordering platform servicing wholesales, brands and retailers, for $425 million.” The Canadian point-of-sale provider has been busy buying startups in recent years, part of a larger roll-up strategy that it expects will accrete into an enticing package of services. Or, as the company put it, the deals will help Lightspeed become “the common thread uniting merchants, suppliers and consumers.” That’s pretty heavy on the corporate-speak, but does speak to Lightspeed’s ambitions. I raise this particular set of deals because Lightspeed is not as well known as its scale might have you think.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The hidden benefits of adding a CTO to your board</h2>
<p>Conventional wisdom says startup boards should include a few CEOs who are able to offer informed advice, but having a technical leader in the mix creates real upside, according to Abby Kearns, chief technology officer at Puppet.</p>
<p>Beyond their engineering experience, CTOs can help founders set realistic timelines, identify pain points and bring what Kearns calls &#8220;pragmatic empathy&#8221; to high-pressure situations.</p>
<p>&#8220;A CTO understands the nuts and bolts,&#8221; says Kearns.</p>

<h2>Elsewhere in BigTechLandia</h2>
<p>Pinterest is finally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/pinterest-adds-a-shopping-list-feature-to-round-up-your-saved-products/"><strong>rolling out the ability</strong></a> to save items into a shopping list. The general argument for the long-term value of Pinterest has been that, sure, it has ads, but it’s also essentially an e-commerce sleeping giant. Perhaps Big Pin wants to awaken a bit faster than we had expected.</p>
<p>To close, Microsoft is <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/microsofts-windows-virtual-desktop-is-now-azure-virtual-desktop/">renaming Windows Virtual Desktop to Azure Virtual Desktop</a></strong>. Why the change? Because, loosely, there’s lots more demand for the product in a post-pandemic world than the one that came before it, and thus the ability to “set up a full virtual desktop environment from the Azure portal” using only “a few clicks,” as Frederic reported, could be a big deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter disclosed on Monday that it blocked four accounts in India to comply with a new legal request from the Indian government.</p>
<p>The American social network <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/24019321">disclosed</a> on Lumen Database, a Harvard University project, that it took action on four accounts &#8212; including those of hip-hop artist L-Fresh the Lion and singer and song-writer Jazzy B &#8212; to comply with a legal request from the Indian government it received over the weekend. The accounts are geo-restricted within India but accessible from outside of the South Asian nation. (As part of their transparency efforts, some companies including Twitter and Google make requests and orders they receive from governments and other entities public on Lumen Database.)</p>
<p>All four accounts, like several others that the Indian government ordered to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">blocked in the country earlier this year</a>, had protested New Delhi’s agriculture reforms and some had posted other tweets that criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s seven years of governance in India, an analysis by TechCrunch found.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch that when the company receives a valid legal request, it reviews it under both its own rules and local laws.</p>
<p>“If the content violates Twitter’s Rules, the content will be removed from the service. If it is determined to be illegal in a particular jurisdiction, but not in violation of the Twitter Rules, we may withhold access to the content in India only. In all cases, we notify the account holder directly so they’re aware that we’ve received a legal order pertaining to the account,” the spokesperson added.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2162748 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jazzb-twitter-india-block.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="367" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jazzb-twitter-india-block.jpg 1546w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jazzb-twitter-india-block.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jazzb-twitter-india-block.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jazzb-twitter-india-block.jpg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jazzb-twitter-india-block.jpg?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jazzb-twitter-india-block.jpg?resize=1536,829 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jazzb-twitter-india-block.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The new legal request, which hasn&#8217;t been previously reported, comes at a time when Twitter is making efforts to comply with the Indian government’s new IT rules, new guidelines that several of its peers including Facebook and Google have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/facebook-whatsapp-google-and-other-internet-giants-comply-with-indias-it-rules/">already complied with</a>.</p>
<p>On Saturday, India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had given a “final notice” to Twitter to comply with its new rules, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">unveiled in February this year</a>. The new rules require significant social media firms to appoint and share contact details of representatives tasked with compliance, nodal point of reference and grievance redressals to address on-ground concerns.</p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between Twitter and the government of India of late. Last month, police in Delhi visited Twitter offices to “serve a notice” about an investigation into its intel on classifying Indian politicians’ tweets as misleading. Twitter called the move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-says-concerned-with-india-intimidation-requests-3-more-months-to-comply-with-new-it-rules/">a form of intimidation</a>, and expressed concerns for its employees and requested the government respect citizens’ rights to free speech.</p>

<p>Late last month, Twitter had requested New Delhi to extend the deadline for compliance with the new rules by at least three months.</p>
<p>The Jack Dorsey-led company has grappled with several tough situations in India, one of its biggest market by users, this year. After briefly complying with a New Delhi order early this year, the company faced heat from the government for restoring accounts that had posted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">tweets critical of the Indian government’s policy</a> or Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>The two faced off again publicly in April after New Delhi ordered Twitter and Facebook to take down posts that were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">critical of the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jerome Guillen, a critical executive at Tesla who was working on the development and eventual production of the Tesla Semi, has left the company, the automaker said Monday in a <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-031976/">filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Guillen&#8217;s departure comes just three months after he was moved from the president of automotive position, which included oversight of the Tesla Semi, to a role with less responsibility as head of heavy duty trucking. Guillen had led Tesla&#8217;s entire automotive business from September 2018 until March 2021.</p>
<p>Guillen had a decade-long career at Tesla and held numerous roles at the company. He started at Tesla in 2010 and reported directly to CEO Elon Musk as the program director of the Model S and soon was given more responsibility, including as VP of vehicle engineering. He was later appointed president of automotive before becoming president of heavy duty trucking in March 2021. Guillen is a former Daimler executive who was responsible for the development of the company&#8217;s new generation of Class 8 trucks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Tesla Semi, a battery electric semi-truck, is still in development. The company first revealed the Tesla Semi in November 2017. It had been slated to go into production by 2019, but it has continued to be pushed back. It&#8217;s unclear if Guillen&#8217;s departure will further delay the Semi.</p>
<p>In January, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during the company&#8217;s 2020 Q4 earnings call that all engineering work on the semi had been completed and that it expected to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/elon-musk-says-tesla-semi-is-ready-for-production-but-limited-by-battery-cell-output/">begin deliveries in 2021</a>. The availability of battery cells was the only issue limiting the vehicle&#8217;s production, Musk said at the time. Three months later, Tesla didn&#8217;t provide much of a progress report except to say the semi was in development.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the company announced that the first Tesla Semi Megacharger would be installed at Frito-Lay’s Modesto, California delivery center. The Megacharger charging stations will be capable of serving up to 100 Tesla Semi trucks.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/30/tesla-semi-production-line-new-nevada-building-electric-trucks-per-week/">reported</a> earlier this year that Tesla is building a new production line for its Semi model near its Nevada Gigafactory location, with the aim of producing five semi-trucks per week.</p>
