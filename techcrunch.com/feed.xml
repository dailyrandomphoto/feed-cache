										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish autonomous electric vehicle startup <a class="c-link" href="https://www.einride.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.einride.tech/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Einride</a> is aiming to continue the momentum  sparked by partnerships with Oatly and Lidl,  by seeking additional capital, TechCrunch has learned.<span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr" data-sk="tooltip_parent" aria-describedby="sk-tooltip-1917"> </span></p>
<p>Einride is seeking $75 million in new financing, while at the same time exploring the potential for a public listing through a special purpose acquisition company, according to people with knowledge of the company&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>SPACs, a mechanism in which a publicly traded shell company merges with a private business, have taken the U.S. capital markets by storm led, in part, by startups focused on the electrification of mobility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Early successes of public listings for companies like Nikola (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nikolas-stock-crashes-after-announcing-cancelation-of-contract-with-republic-services-for-2500-garbage-trucks/">despite its dubious claims</a>) helped set the stage for the SPAC boom. Canoo, Fisker Inc, ChargePoint and Lordstown Motors are just a few of the U.S. based EV companies that have gone public via a SPAC in the past year.</p>
<p>Unlike some newly minted SPAC companies, Einride has some fundamentals. The company has already piloted its technology <a href="https://www.einride.tech/press/oatly-reduces-carbon-footprint-first-month-einride-electric-trucks">through a partnership with Oatly</a>, the Swedish oat milk maker.</p>
<p>Oatly began using Einride’s electric trucks on its delivery routes from each of its Swedish production sites in October 2020. Thus far, the trucks have driven over 8,600 electric km and as a result have saved over 10,500 kg of CO2 compared to diesel, according to a statement from the companies.</p>
<p>“Sustainability is at the core of everything we do, and we work hard to lower our emissions across the board. This includes our emissions for transports, which is why we are now shifting to electrical vehicles, which reduces our climate footprint by 87 percent on these routes,” said Simon Broadbent, Supply Chain Director at Oatly, in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>The deal with Oatly was just the beginning. As the ink dried on that partnership, Einride quickly signed other marquee Swedish businesses including the food shipping and logistics company Lidl and the electronics manufacturer Electrolux.</p>
<p>Big automakers have electric and autonomous plans of their own. Argo, a developer of self-driving technology, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/self-driving-startup-argo-ai-hits-7-5-billion-valuation/">is now worth $7.5 billion</a> thanks to an investment from Ford and the VW Group. Ad VW&#8217;s Traton Group is pushing low emission and electrification through a $2.2 billion investment <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-02/traton-to-pour-2-2-billion-into-electric-trucks-software">announced in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Daimler, Paccar, and Volvo<a href="https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/18-companies-and-startups-that-are-leading-the-race-for-the-autonomous-trucks-4ba5a50e6dee"> all have plans</a> as well.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just scratching the surface of the money that&#8217;s pouring in to autonomous, electrified transport. Of course, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/semi">Tesla is in the game with its own semi truck</a> and, in China, Plus AI, is automating a number of vehicles from Manbang, Suning, and FAW Jiefang.</p>
<p id="bc9a" class="is it ez iu b fy iv iw ix gb iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn dm fw" data-selectable-paragraph="">All of this money is aiming to capture a portion of the market for autonomous, electrified vehicles that the consulting firm McKinsey estimated would save the trucking industry over $100 billion. It&#8217;s a potentially huge opportunity in the $260 billion U.S. trucking market alone. Worldwide, businesses spend about $1.2 trillion on trucking, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/distraction-or-disruption-autonomous-trucks-gain-ground-in-us-logistics">according to McKinsey</a>.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">The benefits that would accrue to the industry are more than just financial. Trucking is a huge component of the greenhouse gas emissions that come from the transportation sector &#8212; which includes road, rail, air and marine transportation. In 2016, trucking and transport broadly contributed to roughly 24% of the world&#8217;s total greenhouse gas emissions &#8212; and that number has been steadily increasing.</p>
<p>Any reduction in carbon emissions from the transport sector would be a huge step forward on the path toward a more environmentally sustainable future.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">No wonder venture investors are falling all over each other to invest in these companies. Einride counts  EQT Ventures and NordicNinja VC, a fund backed by Panasonic, Honda, Omron and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, among its investors. Along with backing from Ericsson Ventures, Norrsken Foundation, Plum Alley Investments and Plug and Play Ventures the startup has raised $32 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before kids graduate to the expansive virtual worlds in games like Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite, they often get their start in online social gaming with a game like <a href="https://www.animaljam.com/en">Animal Jam</a>. Here, kids learn to personalize their avatar, explore a world, chat with other players, and trade items in a safe environment with parental controls. Today, the company behind this popular title, WildWorks, is launching a new game, <a href="https://fer.al/en">Fer.al</a>, which builds on Animal Jam&#8217;s legacy while catering to a slightly older crowd of Gen Z teens.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started talking about Fer.al, it was the idea of where do kids go when they age out of Animal Jam?,&#8221; explains Clark Stacey, co-founder and CEO of WildWorks. &#8220;Because there isn&#8217;t a transitional space between a completely walled garden like Animal Jam and&#8230;Instagram and the adult social networks and games that don&#8217;t have those same protections,&#8221; he continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we wanted to provide a place for these older kids to go where the walls are a little bit lower,&#8221; Stacey adds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new game is meant to cater to older kids &#8212; meaning young teens ages 13 to around 18 &#8212; who are now choosing their own games, have their own email address, and don&#8217;t need parental permission to play. The guardrails on chat also won&#8217;t be as high on Fer.al as on Animal Jam, and will focus more on preventing bullying and abuse than blocking words. Players will also be able to connect their online social accounts to their game accounts in the future.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122288" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122288" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122288" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WildWorks</p></div></p>
<p>With <a href="https://fer.al/en">Fer.al</a>, WildWorks is introducing another animal-centered title, but this time it&#8217;s moving into the fantasy realm. Players choose between bipedal humanoid creatures based on folklore and myth including a Kitsune, Senri, Dragon, Jackelope, Werewolf, Kirin, or a Shinigami, with more to come i time.</p>
<p>The characters&#8217; style was inspired by Animal Jam fan art, Stacey says, where kids would create animal avatars that were sort of a mix between manga, Animal Jam&#8217;s style, and other, older animation styles.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, Fer.al players will also be able to personalize their character and change their appearance, design their personal space (this time, a &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; instead of a &#8220;den,&#8221;) discover a world where they can interact with other players, collect items and trade, and venture on quests. But the storyline has also evolved to reflect teens&#8217; interests, including their growing understanding of social media and the desire to grow an online fan base.</p>
<p>The larger narrative involves a reality show where two warring queens, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aradiafellqueen/?hl=en">Aradia</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/delilahlichqueen/?hl=en">Delilah</a> &#8212; each with their own Instagram account, naturally &#8212; are angling for control. The company isn&#8217;t offering a lot of details as to how this narrative plays out in the long-term, but it will involve weekly and monthly contests as the game ramps up, in addition to the everyday missions and quests which are undertaken to gain ingredients to create new clothes or a new &#8220;glamour&#8221; (a rendering effect that goes around your character.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122287" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122287" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122287" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122287" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WildWorks</p></div></p>
<p>Much like Animal Jam &#8212; or even other virtual worlds like some Roblox games &#8212; players are meant to engage in cooperative gameplay to advance. There will be tasks you can&#8217;t complete on your own, meaning you&#8217;ll need to interact and chat. You will also be able to join factions, initially driven by the two queens, as the game advances.</p>
<p>Another notable aspect to Fer.al is that it&#8217;s largely designed to cater to girl gamers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly not intended to be to the exclusion of boys who are in this age range,&#8221; explains Stacey. &#8220;But we recognize the fact that, among the most engaged Animal Jam players, it&#8217;s about 80% girls. We&#8217;ve leaned into that pretty heavily in Animal Jam &#8212; we&#8217;re trying to feature a lot of female scientists and working with them on causes that promote girls in STEM. So we know a lot of the built-in audience is coming from that,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think the need that we recognized is that it&#8217;s not hard for adolescent boys to find online communities that jive with them. It&#8217;s pretty hard for girls to find the same thing. So, as we&#8217;re creating this this community &#8212; everything from the rules to the visuals &#8212; we are very conscious of that. And the people that we&#8217;re going to and asking for what works for you and what doesn&#8217;t, is primarily girls,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122285" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122285" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122285" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122285" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WildWorks</p></div></p>
<p>Building off the Animal Jam fan base has been an advantage for getting Fer.al off the ground. Today, Animal Jam has anywhere between 2.5 million to 4 million monthly active users out of a total of 135 million registered accounts. The gulf between the registered and active figures is indicative of how many kids have since grew out of Animal Jam since its October 2010 launch. But Stacey admits the title has seen some decline since its peak usage, as well.</p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s a lot of interest in what WildWorks does next, it seems.</p>
<p>Within a week of launching the Fer.al website, the game had 75,000 kids sign up to become beta testers. The testers were brought into the beta slowly, starting in April 2020, and initially on desktop only. Now, the beta version of the game sees daily actives in the low 10,000&#8217;s pre-launch. On the Apple App Store and Google Play, over 100,000 people have registered for the pre-release, as well.</p>
<p>Like Animal Jam, Fer.al will offer a freemium experience. But while Animal Jam generated nearly 80% of revenues through subscriptions, Fer.al will use a season pass model of monetization. Users buy the season &#8212; priced around $10 to $20 &#8212; via an in-app purchase, which will unlock unique items and experiences specific to that season. It expects to launch around 7 seasons per year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122289" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122289" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122289" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122289" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WildWorks</p></div></p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t offer seasons until later in the beta test, but Stacey says the conversion rate was at &#8220;the high end of our expectations so far on desktop.&#8221; If the mobile conversion rates remains as high as desktop, it will be in the range to start investing in user acquisition, he says. The company may also consider ads at a later date as well as merchandise, if all goes well.</p>
<p>Salt Lake City-headquartered WildWorks (formerly Smart Bomb Interactive) is majority owned by Signal Peak Ventures, which has invested $20+ million into the company over the years. The company shifted in 2008 to focus on its own IP, resulting in the launch of Animal Jam and other titles.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, WildWorks&#8217; revenue &#8212; largely from Animal Jam and another game, Tag with Ryan &#8212; has ranged between $20+ million to below $30 million. If Fer.al is able to successfully capture the Animal Jam graduates who are looking to move up to &#8220;older kid&#8221; gameplay, it could grow that revenue base by a sizable amount.</p>
<p>Fer.al is launching publically today in all countries, and will be available initially in English. It can be played on PC, Mac, iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Diversity and inclusion as an idea has been on the agenda of tech companies for years now. But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies.</p>
<p>At TC Sessions: Justice, I spoke with Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee, Netflix VP of Inclusion Strategy for Product Wade Davis and Facebook VP of workplace diversity and inclusion Sandra Altine about the work that still needs to be done, the effects of California&#8217;s Proposition 22 and more.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On last summer&#8217;s racial justice uprising</h3>
<p>Last summer, after the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent collective consciousness around racial injustice in the U.S., many tech companies spoke out about racism and equality. Davis said he was happy to see more people speaking about those issues but also a bit frustrated that &#8220;it takes something like that for folks to get truly engaged.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Davis: </strong>And inside of Netflix, one of the things that I was really intentional about is to tell our employees who are not Black, right, to not ask our employees how they feel but for them to be much more introspective of what it felt like for them, right, as a white person, or however they identify for them to do the introspection. Because that&#8217;s what it means to be an ally &#8212; to not put the labor on the group that that is already feeling the impact and the oppression. And what we found was that many of our employees, for the first time had to wrestle with like, what it means to be white. What it means to be in a situation where you are seeing someone who looks like you take the life of someone who looks like me. So we really tried to switch the actual narrative and the conversation to not add more labor and trauma on our Black employees. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 1:10)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Lee said she was a bit skeptical at the time because we&#8217;ve seen this type of response before in light of the violent killings of Black people.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>And then within a few weeks you see that interest and that focus wane once more. So I was skeptical that the enthusiasm would continue and enthusiasm in a way to try to solve all of our racism problems in a short period of time. I was surprised that it did continue. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 3:31)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In her conversations with her counterparts at Uber, Lee said she wanted to make sure that the company didn&#8217;t make such a wide commitment that &#8220;those commitments became nothing more than virtue signaling at the end of the day.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>I said to my leadership, if you really want to come out and make some bold statements about being anti-racist, I&#8217;m going to create almost a litmus test to make sure that you really understand what that means because I don&#8217;t want to go up as a company to say we&#8217;re going to be anti-racist and then do nothing about it because that just relives and rehashes the injustices that we&#8217;ve seen in the past. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 4:25)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So when Uber&#8217;s first post-anti-racism diversity report came out, and it showed Uber&#8217;s Black employee base declined, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/despite-focus-on-anti-racism-ubers-black-employee-base-has-decreased/">Lee said at the time that was not acceptable</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>I think part of the commitments we made around being really anti-racist is transparency at all costs, even when we know that transparency could potentially make us look, not reflect as positively on us. So the question did go back, as you know, when we were putting together our diversity report is, &#8216;wow, these numbers are not where we want them to be. None of us are happy about it.&#8217; But in our commitment of being accountable, you know, we want the public to hold us accountable. We want people to hold accountable, we want to be accountable to our workforce, we&#8217;re going to be as transparent about why that decline in black employees happened and underrepresented people happened, what the cause was and what we are doing. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 6:11)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Netflix, despite having previously reported diversity numbers, only released its <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-inclusion-report-2021">first official diversity report this year</a>. That&#8217;s partly because the team has only been in place for the last three years, Davis said.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Davis: </strong>So we&#8217;re still at the awareness building phase, like from a foundational standpoint, and we&#8217;re really trying to double down so that folks know why I&amp;D matters. Like, what it actually is, and how it impacts all of us. Because oftentimes, folks think of all of these isms and phobias as something that happens to other people. But if we can really make folks understand that there&#8217;s a cost to all these isms, and phobias to all of us individually, interpersonally, culturally, and and institutionally, then it makes it easier down the road when folks start to feel somewhat fatigued, right? Because there is always that fatigue factor. So we&#8217;re really trying to get ahead of that. And to have folks to think through like, what is in it for me, and what is in it for my colleagues. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 17:33)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h3>Sharing the DEI load</h3>
<p>Too often does the work of DEI fall on just a handful of people. At Netflix, Davis said it&#8217;s important that there is a shared load, and that all of its leaders are able to speak to the importance of diversity at the company.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Davis: </strong>And I would say our other largest goal is to make sure that all of our leaders can speak to the importance of AI and be more than just a talking point. So how do we build a model that&#8217;s a train the trainer model, where each of our leaders has a one to one inclusion coach, which requires them to have monthly sit downs with their inclusion partner, where they go on a real intensive journey, so that they can understand how does their leadership style need to evolve and adapt and expand and flex to meet the needs of a larger set of individuals and not the historical ones who folks have engaged with? And we found that to put our leaders on the spot, so that when someone calls me to give a talk, I can say &#8216;No, our COO Greg Peters is just as competent and capable to sit on this panel about inclusion as I am.&#8217; And we feel that we&#8217;re modeling and signaling to our entire organization that this is not just a nice to have, but it&#8217;s part and parcel to your success as an employee, as a leader and to our success as an organization. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 18:26)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>On Prop 22&#8217;s impact on people of color</h3>
<p>Prop 22 went into effect in California earlier this year after a contentious battle where one side, including Uber, Lyft and other tech companies, wanted workers to remain independent contractors and the other side wanted gig workers to be made employees and therefore entitled to more benefits. Prop 22&#8217;s passage was a win for Uber and its counterparts, which collectively spent north of $200 million on its campaign efforts.</p>
<p>Some have wondered how Uber can reconcile its commitment to anti-racism given that many gig workers are people of color. Lee, however, pushed back on that characterization:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>I would challenge some of those that believes that Prop 22 actually disproportionately hurts people of color. If you actually look at the way the civil rights organizations that came out in support of Prop 22, the NAACP of Northern California and Hawaii came out in support of Prop 22, most of the Hispanic civil rights organizations as well. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 24:59)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Prop 22, of course, was in response to the passage of AB 5, which set new standards of worker classification that were designed to make it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>And you looked at the way those exceptions were being made to AB 5, you saw that the exceptions were disproportionately being made for those IC &#8212; you know, independent contractor roles that were predominantly represented by white workers. And they were all getting exceptions from AB 5. And then you look at the roles that were predominantly represented by people of color, especially underrepresented people of color, and those roles were not getting exceptions in AB 5. [&#8230;] For me, how I define racism isn&#8217;t based on intent but it&#8217;s based on impact. And when I see that kind of level of disparate, disproportionate impact, that&#8217;s when I think about, you know, what is racist or not. So I would challenge this notion that [Prop 22] actually disproportionately hurt people of color, especially given that we had civil rights organizations that said we support Prop 22. So, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything that really needs to be reconciled, from my perspective and from the organization&#8217;s perspective. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 24:59)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk is bringing his utility-scale battery ambitions to the Lone Star state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An under-the-radar Tesla subsidiary has been at work building a 100 MW energy storage project in Angleton, Texas, according to an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas and other documents. Bloomberg was </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-08/tesla-is-plugging-a-secret-mega-battery-into-the-texas-grid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first to report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the documents and link a previously unknown subsidiary to Tesla. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gambit Energy Storage LLC applied for an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas, the regulatory body charged with overseeing the state’s electric utilities, in June of last year. Gambit said in the application, viewed by TechCrunch, that it intends to provide wholesale electricity and grid-balancing services on the Energy Reliability Council of Texas grid. The project is located in Angleton, a town about 50 miles west of Galveston near the Gulf Coast. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project’s proposed date of commercial operation is June 1, according to reporting from Bloomberg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Texas grid has been under the microscope since mid-February, when an unprecedented blast of Arctic weather knocked 46,000 MW of power off line at its peak—more than a third of the system’s overall generation capacity. The disaster left millions of Texans in sub-freezing temperatures for days. The ERCOT Board of Directors fired its CEO and the chair of the PUCT resigned in the wake of the catastrophe, while legislators at the capital mull major changes to Texas power market operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla already has contracts for battery storage systems with California Utilities Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E, but this is the company’s first major project elsewhere. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.vendr.com/">Vendr</a> announced a $60 million Series A round, a huge funding event led by Tiger Global, with participation from Y Combinator, Sound Ventures, Craft Ventures, F-Prime Capital, and Garage Capital.</p>
<p>The outsized Series A comes after Vendr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/vendr-raises-4m-from-david-sackss-craft-ventures-to-reduce-saas-bills/">last raised $4 million in a mid-2020 seed round</a>, with TechCrunch reporting that the company was profitable at the time. Vendr had raised just over $6 million total before this latest round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch had a few questions. First, how the company had managed to attract so much capital so quickly. According to an interview with Vendr CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanneu/">Ryan Neu</a>, his startup grew just under 5x in 2020, and was cash flow-positive last year as well. The startup&#8217;s model of standing between SaaS buyers and sellers, speeding up transactions while lowering their cost, appears to have fit well into 2020&#8217;s twin trends of rising software reliance and a focus on cost-control.</p>
<p>Second, how did the company manage to grow so much? Vendr charges its customers between 1% and 5% of their software spend that it manages, which can add up. Neu told TechCrunch that a somewhat standard 500 person company might spend $2 million to $3.5 million on software each year, which by our math would make that company worth no less than $20,000 to $35,000 in revenue for Vendr at 1% of spend. At Vendr&#8217;s midpoint 2.5%, those figures rise $50,000 to $87,500.</p>
<p>At those prices, Vendr can stack up annual revenue pretty quickly. But why would Vendr customers pay it to handle their software spend? Savings, effectively. So long as they save more than Vendr charges, they are coming out ahead. And as the startup claims that it can cut the time to buying, its own customers can reduce time spent on securing tooling.</p>

<p>Everyone wins, it seems, except for software sellers. After all, they are the ones losing a chance to get less-sophisticated buyers to pay more for their code, right? Neu said that his company&#8217;s model isn&#8217;t too bad for selling companies as they close deals much more quickly, at a higher rate of closure. That could save their sales team time, which might help balance the price differentia.</p>
<p>Pressed on what Vendr might be able to do for the selling side of the software market given its present-day buyer focus, the Neu declined to share any possible plans.</p>
<p>Returning to the round, why did Vendr raise the money at all if it was doing just fine sans new external funding? The company told TechCrunch that it has scaled its staff to 60 from 10 a year ago, and that it wanted a stronger balance sheet. That&#8217;s fine. We&#8217;d be hard pressed to find the startup that wouldn&#8217;t take such a large check from Tiger, given the valuation gain the raise implies for Vendr, so there isn&#8217;t too much mystery to unpack.</p>
<p>A theme that TechCrunch has explored in recent weeks has been the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">huge depth of the software market</a>. Given the TAM for bits and bytes, Vendr may be able to keep up the hypergrowth that its new round implies its investors will expect. Let&#8217;s see how 2021 winds up for the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.olo.com/">Olo</a>, the New York-based fintech startup that provides order processing software to restaurants, shared its initial IPO price range this morning. The company&#8217;s debut comes ahead of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/restaurant-software-provider-toast-prepares-for-ipo-11613938981?mod=hp_lista_pos2">the expected IPO of Toast</a>, a Boston-based unicorn with a similar market remit.</p>
<p>Targeting $16 to $18 per share, Olo could raise as much as $372.6 million in its public offering.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Unlike most companies going public in recent quarters that we&#8217;ve tracked, Olo has a history of growth and profitability, making its impending pricing all the more interesting. It&#8217;s unknown if Toast is profitable, but because most venture-backed IPO aren&#8217;t, we&#8217;re presuming it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re doing our usual work: parsing the company&#8217;s pricing interval to get a valuation range for Olo. We&#8217;ll calculate both simple and fully diluted pricing and then do some quick work on its revenue scale to come to grips with its total scale.</p>
<p>Are investors willing to pay more for profits? And, if so, how much? This is a niche question because most IPOs look a bit more like Coursera than Olo, but it&#8217;s still worth answering.</p>
<h2>Olo&#8217;s IPO valuation range</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to follow along, you can read the new S-1 filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001431695/000119312521072308/d867519ds1a.htm">here</a>. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/understanding-toasts-expected-ipo-through-the-lens-of-olos-2020-results/">first look at Olo is here</a>, and its fundraising history is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/olo">here</a>, per Crunchbase.</p>
<p>The company is targeting $16 to $18 per share with an expected sale of 18 million shares. The company is also reserving 2.7 million shares for its underwriters. At the upper end of its range, not counting shares reserved for its bankers, Olo could raise $324 million in its debut.</p>
<p>Per the company, its total number of Class A and B shares outstanding after its IPO would come to 142,012,926, or what we calculate to be 144,712,926 shares, including its underwriters&#8217; option. Using the latter — because we tend to look for valuation extremes — Olo would be worth $2.32 billion to $2.60 billion.</p>
<p>But what about its fully diluted valuation? Adding in shares that are currently tied to un-exercised but vested stock options bring Olo to around 188,085,714 shares. Add in the underwriters&#8217; option and the total rises to 190,785,714 shares.</p>
<p>Using the latter figure, at $16 and $18 per share Olo could be worth $3.05 billion to $3.43 billion on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<h2>Is that expensive?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s find out! Digging back into Olo&#8217;s growth, we can see a business with rapidly expanding software incomes. And the same software revenues are improving in quality over time. From 2019 to 2020, for example, Olo&#8217;s &#8220;platform&#8221; revenues — a mix of subscription and transaction top-line from software — grew from $45.1 million to $92.8 million. Over the same time, the company&#8217;s platform revenue saw its gross margin improve from 73.6% to 84.5%.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are so many ways to secure capital for your startup beyond traditional venture capital, from crowdfunding to debt financings to revenue-share agreements. But is all money created equal if you are on route to becoming a billion-dollar business? Dr. Astrid Scholz, the co-founder of Zebras Unite, Sydney Thomas, a principal at Precursor Ventures, and Brian Brackeen, the founding partner of Lightship Capital, joined us as TC Sessions: Justice to discuss alternative pathways to funding, and if the democratization of capital is a facade.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>On the choice to stay away from traditional venture capital</strong></h3>
<p>Scholz is currently building out Zebras Unite, a founder-led cooperative that is focused on making startups more sustainable, ethical and inclusive. During the panel, she mentioned that the capital arm of Zebras Unite could have been a traditional fund, but the organization ultimately decided to pursue more creative alternatives, such as the <a href="https://zebrasunite.coop/capital-services">Future Economy Lab</a>. This lab, which focuses on helping founders find financing instruments that fit their sectors, took place in Montreal with a focus on climate tech.</p>
<p>Scholz shared why she went for this route, versus a traditional fund:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>In the big scheme of things, [VC] really is just a tiny drop in the large capital pool of capital that&#8217;s out there. And then on the other extreme, you have bank loans. That may or may not be accessible to startup founders, especially if they&#8217;re from certain demographics in this country. Of course we have a massive racial wealth gap and access to capital.</p>
<p>To me, that sounds just like two flavors of capital: vanilla and chocolate. It&#8217;s not interesting, if that was an ice cream store, it was not interesting. At Zebras Unite, we&#8217;re looking to increase the diversity of capital, as well as the diversity of managers of capital. So we&#8217;re very interested in revenue based financing mechanisms. We&#8217;re very interested in non-dilutive early stage forms of support to entrepreneurs who don&#8217;t have friends and family wealth. We were looking at new sort of character-based lending instruments and a bunch of blended approaches, so there&#8217;s more room on the capital spectrum to color in, beyond the two ends of the spectrum. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 3:52)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3><strong>On why venture capital paths can be formed around a more inclusive strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Now, venture capital isn’t the devil, and in a market as hot as right now it’s clear that there is a huge demand to back great ideas. The problem starts when you look at which ideas get backed versus which don’t, and underrepresented founders lose out at a disproportionately higher rate than white founders.</p>
<p>Standards help everyone get on the same page, and in venture, any clarity around how one investor cuts checks versus another can help curb signaling risk and help set expectations on early-stage founders. Lightship Capital uses traditional venture capital but applies it in a way Brackeen thinks is more inclusive to founders.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oftentimes, VCs talk about designing your product for your customer, but then they don&#8217;t design themselves around the customer. They completely ignore what they tell people to do. And so we&#8217;re designed for the underrepresented founders. And for us, that&#8217;s women, minorities, lgbtq, plus disabled. And so the capital path for that founder is different from the white male Zuckerberg founder. Oftentimes, a Series A is very, very difficult, so we bridge that. We’ll write a smaller check &#8211; half a million dollars first &#8211; and then we’ll reserve $1.5 million so they can go out and get a Series A done. And so to do that, we don&#8217;t require board seats and things of that nature, we do require strong collaboration<em>. <strong>(Timestamp: 7:03)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>On how your first check could impact your next check </strong></h3>
<p>Thomas noted that Indie.VC, an alternative financing program that was aimed at slow-growth, bootstrapped founders, shutting down this past week could be a lesson for founders who look to finance their companies from the plethora of programs out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>They were at the frontiers of building access to new capital. I think one of the things that we saw when we would talk to founders who were considering Indie.vc capital versus our capital was, ‘does the investor that you would like after you get that Indie.vc funding, if you decide to go to a more traditional VC firm? Can they actually even do revenue based financing investments, some people actually legitimately can&#8217;t because of the regulatory limits of their fund.<em><strong>(Timestamp: 16:28)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>She went on to explain how this isn’t simply a one-off problem that could happen with. Precursor founding partner Charles Hudson penned a post, months ago, about the <a href="https://www.charleshudson.net/we-only-have-100-points-of-equity-to-split-up">messiness in early-stage cap tables. </a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s unfair, but you have to make a pretty final decision, pretty early on in what type of company you want to build. And I don&#8217;t think that allows for a lot of the flexibility that is the reality of building a startup. When you pivot like five to 10 to 20 to 30 times before you finally get to something that, you know, matters. And so how do we also allow for more flexibility between multiple different types of revenue structures? I just don’t think that exists right now. <strong>(Timestamp: 17:12) </strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<p>Brackeen added that his form loves non-dilutive financing before, and after, they are nicest. Pitch competitions might help a startup launch, but it won’t help founders get from stage to stage. This banter basically answers the question that I set early on: is all capital created equal in the eyes of investors? A cap table filled with different types of financing structures and notes, as Thomas mentions, could lead to your next check investor declining to invest based on a semantic versus a lack of believing in your vision. One side effect we see here is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/a-recapitalization-reckoning/">recapitalizations</a>, an event where startups restructure their entire cap table to squeeze out old investors, bring on new ones and shift the way equity and debt is managed.</p>
<p>Scholz chimed in about how startups should think about capital limitations, but also other corporate structures that could shape the trajectory of a startup.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I think that point about founders basically getting locked into a corporate structure and an investment strategy before they even really know what they&#8217;re building or how it&#8217;s selling is just so important. I always joke, you know, like 99 out of 100, corporate lawyers will tell you to incorporate as a Delaware C. [But] that may or may not be the right answer. There may be a good reason to become a cooperative, and incorporating as a Delaware C will make your life very difficult.<strong> (Timestamp: 17:46)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3><strong>On if VC will be even more relevant five years from now</strong></h3>
<p>The conversation turned into a broader discussion on if venture capital will be as relevant as it is today, five years from now. While Scholz said that she doesn’t even think venture is that important today, the two venture capitalists on the panel &#8211; Brackeen and Thomas &#8211; were good sports about the future of the asset class they have bet their careers on.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Thomas:</strong> The IPOs just keep on coming, and they keep getting bigger. It’s crazy. I think that there is recreating an immense amount of wealth, and that we need to be thoughtful, we need to be careful. And we need to be just considerate of that fact. And so I plan to be in venture for the next ten years. But I Ithink, to Astrid’s point, we are not the only ones on the island. We are connected to all of these other different capital structures, and different communities. But my bet is still here. <strong>(Timestamp 25:14) </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Brackeen:</strong> Capital will continue to play a large role in capitalism, because the two are hand in hand. And venture capital is a version of that. Watch what we do. To see billions of dollars go into these geographies, these communities, these groups, the value creation is outrageous. Morgan Stanley, and others say that racism and sexism cost this country somewhere between $4 trillion and $16 trillion in kind of untapped value. So venture capital can be a key lever in opening </em><em>that faucet. <strong>(Timestamp: 25:52)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was only a matter of time before someone married the nascent nootropic supplements for brain health to the snack bar craze that continues to attract dollars and exits.</p>
<p>That time is apparently now, as Rob Dyrdek, the MTV-famous celebrity, pro-skater and entrepreneur, and Chris Bernard announce a new investment in the company they co-founded, <a href="http://www.getmindright.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mindright</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, alongside celebrity investors including Joe Jonas, Travis Barker, and The Profit&#8217;s Marcus Lemonis. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;When we started down the path of condition-specific food and beverage&#8230; we started doing a lot of research into the nootropics and adaptogens space,&#8221; said co-founder Bernard. Working with a food scientist who did not want to be named (which isn&#8217;t sketchy at all), Dyrdek and Bernard were introduced to several companies producing Ashwagandha, which the two had settled on as the new key ingredient in their snack bars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Along with ginseng and cordyceps mushrooms, the company has a trifecta of new (and old) supplements that have taken the nutraceutical world by storm.</p>
<p>Bernard had initially approached the <a href="https://dyrdekmachine.com/">Dyrdek Machine</a> group about another product, but the company was too far along and not something that Dyrdek felt passionate about backing. The story changed when Bernard returned with plans for this nootropic nosh.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;[Bernard] brought back the concept of the path of what’s evolved from functional foods and probiotics and collagen and sort of the mental health and adaptogen and the supplement world and said here’s how to merge these,&#8221; Dyrdek said of Bernard&#8217;s second pitch. &#8220;It was a home-run for us. Our process is supporting a solopreneur where we help shape and build the company together and provide the outsourced resources. We fund the development of the idea to go to the capital markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>So far, Dyrdek and his team have made 15 investments in consumer and entertainment businesses, and five of those business have since been acquired.</p>
<p>Most deals from Dyrdek Machine follow a similar trajectory. The firm becomes a co-founder and shares common stock and then negotiate a preferred equity investment for the capital infusion. Typically those deals will range from $250,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We co-found it and we share that common share class and our first money is preferred and pick a valuation that balances out the deal,&#8221; Dyrdek said. &#8220;How much equity do we want to develop it with you is what we negotiate with that initial capital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122278" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122278" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2122278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dyrdek.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122278" class="wp-caption-text">Portrait of Rob Dyrdek, founder of <a href="https://dyrdekmachine.com/">Dyrdek Machine</a></p></div></p>
<p>Dyrdek describes his investment firm as founder-driven and market agnostic. &#8220;We want a well-rounded, multi-dimensional founder and then we look at the market and how do we evolve it into something that has a larger, broader appeal,&#8221; Dyrdek said. &#8220;Rather than chasing down nootropics, we found that &#8216;good mood&#8217; was the important thing to the consumer base. That&#8217;s why we drove &#8216;Good mood superfood.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Bernard&#8217;s faith in Dyrdek&#8217;s ability to move the business forward has been proven in the evolution of other companies in the firm&#8217;s portfolio. Dyrdek pointed to Outstanding Foods, another investment, which he said had recently closed a $10 million round at a $100 million valuation. Another startup in the portfolio, Momentous, a supplement manufacturer, also closed on a big round recently after raising $5 million in 2019, Dyrdek said.</p>
<p>For Mindright, Dyrdek&#8217;s involvement brought in other celebrity names once they tried the product. The company counts Joe Jonas and Travis Barker among its seed investors.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They were excited to get involved in this because they believed in what we took the time to create,&#8221; Bernard said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gig workers and warehouse workers have become essential in a pandemic-ravaged economy. In California, a law went into effect earlier this year that makes gig workers independent contractors. Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama are actively seeking to form a union to ensure better protections at the workplace.</p>
<p>At TC Sessions: Justice, I spoke with Gig Workers Collective co-founder and organizer Vanessa Bain, The Congress of Essential Workers founder and former Amazon warehouse worker Christian Smalls and National Council for Occupational Safety and Health Co-Executive Director Jessica E. Martinez about what’s next for gig workers and tech’s contractor workforce, and what battles lie ahead for these essential workers.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On the Amazon union drive</h3>
<p>Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama are in the midst of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-begin-historic-vote-to-unionize/">historic union drive</a>. Smalls, who was fired from his job at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island last year after speaking out about the lack of personal protective equipment, told me he recently spent a few days in Bessemer.</p>
<blockquote><p>The building opened up when Coronavirus started. When New York City became the epicenter, that&#8217;s when Bessemer facility opened up. So the union got a head start on talking to workers. So that&#8217;s a gem for anybody or any union that plans on trying to unionize the building &#8212; that you have a facility in your community that&#8217;s about to open up, when opening, that&#8217;s the best time to connect with workers. That&#8217;s what happened last year. And as a result, the workers had seen what happened to the workers that were unprotected and they don&#8217;t want that. They want better for themselves. And they rightfully desrve that, especially in Alabama. It&#8217;s a right to work state, a state with no state minimum, obviously a red state. So I think it&#8217;s a lot of intangibles against them. But these workers now see the window of opportunity for change systemically. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 4:40)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, President Biden recently came out in support of the unionizing efforts in Bessemer.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would hope that he is a man of his word. He&#8217;s a pro-union guy. He ran his campaign off of that, saying he&#8217;s a union guy and unions need to be strong, and he supports unions all the way. It was powerful to see that the President, the man, the highest plateau in the country, support the union. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:11)</strong></em></p>
<p>[&#8230;] But once again, like Vanessa said, I don&#8217;t put all my eggs in that basket either. I just want to hold him accountable. Make sure that, you. know, we see this all the way through to the end. Even if Alabama is not successful, if we were to try again, in other locations, other parts of the country, that we have the support of the highest power in the country, that is the most powerful thing that will resonate with workers. So it&#8217;s good to see that it&#8217;s happening now. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 14:17)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On the effects of Prop 22</h3>
<p>Already, Prop 22 has affected industries outside of tech. In December, supermarket chain Albertsons began replacing delivery drivers with contractors and hundreds of employees in California were swapped for DoorDash workers, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-17/gig-economy-coming-for-millions-of-u-s-jobs-after-california-s-uber-lyft-vote?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. Meanwhile, tech companies have spoken about implementing Prop 22-like legislation in other parts of the country. Martinez described how some California residents who voted to pass Prop 22 thought they were supporting workers for better access to rights.</p>
<blockquote><p>And unfortunately, you have workers who have possibly died. We have a California rideshare driver who died from COVID-19 last month. His independent classification means his family will receive no workers&#8217; compensation. That is a huge impact to workers and the reality of how it impacts day to day life for workers and in the midst of a pandemic. So I share that, because Prop 22 sets the tone, again, for what could happen nationally. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 17:00)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Bain said she sees the passing of Prop 22 as a failure of &#8220;our entire structure of economy.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>And we have really allowed tech to run rampant under this pretense that somehow it&#8217;s innovative, and especially within the gig economy. I mean, it&#8217;s the opposite of innovative, right? Like it&#8217;s feudalism on your phone, right? It&#8217;s 1-800 dial listserv. So it&#8217;s like, they&#8217;re not doing anything new that justifies creating an entirely different classification of labor than existed before, which is what Prop 22 did, right? It literally created this category of marketplace contractor that retains neither the protections of an independent contractor nor an employee. And allowing, you know, companies to write their own laws in this way is a systemic failure. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 18:57)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/gig-workers-survey-san-francisco/">Gig workers in San Francisco are mostly people of color and many are immigrants, according to survey</a></li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On the PRO Act</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s legislation in the U.S. Senate right now that aims to make it easier for workers to organize and form unions in the country. The Protecting the Right to Organize Act seeks to change labor laws in favor of giving workers more power.</p>
<p>Bain spoke about the importance of getting the PRO Act across the line in light of the passing of Prop 22 in California.</p>
<blockquote><p>These things shouldn&#8217;t be at the mercy of who happens to be, you know, held to a position. These are things that should be codified and enshrined really in law. And things that should be consistent and stable protections that people can rely on and count on. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 20:22)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Martinez explained how the PRO Act aligns with the <a href="https://nationalcosh.org/sites/default/files/2021-02%20National%20Agenda%20for%20Worker%20Safety%20and%20Health.pdf">work she&#8217;s doing at COSH</a>. The organization recently released a national agenda for worker safety and health, along with some recommendations.</p>
<blockquote><p>We want stronger safety laws, tougher enforcement, including a mandatory emergency standard to prevent the spread of infectious disease. And again, this is federally so if there is an ETS or an emergency [temporary] standard pass, it applies all over and impacts all kinds of workers, stronger protections against retaliation. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 07:53)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Martinez added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Employers will funnel resources to try to scare tactics to scare workers from organizing, demanding safer workplaces, job security, and so forth. [The agenda] also includes workers are included in all policy decisions. We believe strongly that workers, more than anyone, understand the job, know the solutions and controls to health and safety issues, and also equity and Inclusion to end the misclassification and better protections for temporary gig workers. Paid sick and family leave for workers also worker centered health protocols, including health for high risk workers and getting access to vaccines. And we want to confront the workplace effects of climate change. Finally, also prevent chemical catastrophes and harmful exposure. [&#8230;] With that said, this is not working in isolation. It works in collaboration with laws, we&#8217;re hoping that will pass, such as the PRO Act, allowing workers to gain bargaining power when organizing, essentially giving them the ability to negotiate with the employer get access to benefits again, such as some job security paid sick leave workers comp and so forth. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 8:23)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and make sure to check out our Friday show that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/softbank-makes-mountains-of-cash-off-of-human-laziness/">featured the Square-Tidal deal, some recent IPOs, and some super-neat rounds</a>.</p>
<p>Much like today&#8217;s show, if I am being honest. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coursera <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/a-first-look-at-courseras-s-1-filing/">filed to go public</a>, which could help set the tone for edtech founders and startups regarding their own valuations and fundraising prospects.</li>

<li>And the world of <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf">AI venture-capital funding</a> shows that while there&#8217;s plenty of capital, the number of startups being founded in the space is dipping.</li>
<li>Starling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/uk-challenger-bank-starling-raises-376m-now-valued-at-1-9b/">raised a huge new round</a> in the fintech space, and Deliveroo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/deliveroo-posted-narrowed-loss-of-309m-with-gross-transactions-surging-to-5-7b-in-2020-eitf-shows/">dropped some financial numbers</a> on its path to going public in short-order.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security firm <a href="http://www.mcafee.com">McAfee</a> announced this morning that will be selling its enterprise business to a consortium led by the private equity firm <a href="https://stgpartners.com/">Symphony Technology Group</a> for $4 billion.</p>
<p>It should pair well with RSA, another enterprise-focused security company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/dell-sells-rsa-to-consortium-led-by-symphony-technology-group-for-over-2b/">the private equity firm purchased</a> last February for $2 billion.</p>
<p>McAfee President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter Leav says that his company has decided to direct the firm&#8217;s resources to the consumer side of the business. &#8220;This transaction will allow McAfee to singularly focus on our consumer business and to accelerate our strategy to be a leader in personal security for consumers,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has been some moves in the last year, <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mcafee-ipo-is-said-to-raise-740-million-in-return-to-market#:~:text=the%20stock%20market.-,(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20McAfee%20Corp.,Wednesday%2C%20according%20to%20a%20statement.">returning to the public markets</a> after a decade as a private company. In January, the company <a href="https://www.channele2e.com/business/talent/mcafee-layoffs-2021-staff-cuts/">reportedly laid off a couple of hundred employees</a> and shut down its software development center in Tel Aviv.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;12 top cybersecurity VCs discuss investing, valuations and no-go zones&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/cybersecurity-vc-survey-investing-valuations/embed/#?secret=ULnNqFGV53" data-secret="ULnNqFGV53" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Although Symphony did not point directly to the RSA acquisition, the two investments create a large combined legacy security business for the firm, both of which have strong brand recognition, but might have lost some of their edge to more modern competitors in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Looking at McAfee&#8217;s <a href="https://ir.mcafee.com/static-files/86dedd74-00e2-4f57-8995-5fef120cef51">latest earning&#8217;s report</a>, Q42020, which the company reported on February 24, 2021, the consumer business grew at a much brisker rate than the enterprise side of the house. The former was up 23% YoY, while the latter grew at a far slower 5% rate.</p>
<p>As for the entire year, the company reported $2.9 billion in total FY2020 revenue, up 10% YoY. That broke down to $1.6 billion in consumer net revenue up 20% YoY, and $1.3 billion in enterprise net revenue, an increase of just 1% for the full year.</p>
<p>The company has a complex history, starting life in the 1980s selling firewall software. It eventually went public before being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/19/intel-buys-cyber-security-giant-mcafee-for-7-68-billion-in-cash/">purchased by Intel for $7.7 billion</a> in 2010 and going private again. In 2014, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/01/07/technology/security/intel-mcafee/index.html">the company changed names</a> to Intel Security before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/03/intel-security-is-mcafee-again/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Intel%20is%20officially%20inking,retain%20a%2049%20percent%20stake.">Intel sold a majority stake it to TPG in 2017</a> for $4.2 billion and changed the name back to McAfee.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year subject to regulatory oversight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paypal-to-acquire-curv-301242347.html">announced</a> that it plans to acquire Curv, a cryptocurrency startup based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Israeli newspaper Calcalist <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3896291,00.html">originally reported</a> the move. And PayPal has now made an official announcement.</p>
<p>Curv is a cryptocurrency security company that helps you store your crypto assets securely. The company operates a cloud-based service that lets you access your crypto wallets without any hardware device.</p>
<p>Curv also lets you set up sophisticated policies so that the new intern cannot withdraw crypto assets without some sort of approval chain. Similarly, you can create allow lists so that regular transactions can go through more easily.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Behind the scenes, Curv uses multi-party computation to handle private keys. When you create a wallet, cryptographic secrets are generated on your device and on Curv’s servers. Whenever you’re trying to initiate a transaction, multiple secrets are used to generate a full public and private key.</p>
<p>Secrets are rotated regularly and you can’t do anything with just one secret. If somebody steals an unsecured laptop, a hacker cannot access crypto funds with the information stored on this device alone.</p>
<p>As you can see, Curv isn’t a cryptocurrency wallet for end users. The company offers its services to exchanges, brokers and over-the-counter desks. If you’re running a fund and you plan on buying a large amount of cryptocurrencies, you could also consider using Curv.</p>
<p>Finally, financial institutions that are looking for a solution to store digital assets and diversify their balance sheet could also work with Curv.</p>
<p>PayPal says that the Curv team will join the cryptocurrency group within PayPal. The payment giant has been gradually rolling out cryptocurrency products. It has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/paypal-to-let-you-buy-and-sell-cryptocurrencies-in-the-us/">partnered with Paxos</a> so that users in the U.S. can buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies from their PayPal account.</p>
<p>In the near future, PayPal also plans to let you buy and sell items using cryptocurrencies. During its <a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/PYPL_Q4-20_Investor_Update-%281%29.pdf">most recent earnings release</a>, the company also said that it plans to launch cryptocurrency products in other countries and in Venmo, the consumer fintech super app owned by PayPal.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are undisclosed and the transaction should close at some point during the first half of 2021. Calcalist <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3896291,00.html">reported</a> that PayPal was paying between $200 million and $300 million for the acquisition. A person close to the company says that the transaction was under $200 million. I guess we’ll find out what happened exactly in the next earnings release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While not entirely non-existent, the union has been an elusive phenomenon in Silicon Valley. More recently, however, big names like Google and Kickstarter have taken key steps toward forming unions, as have smaller startups like Glitch, which made history this week by signing a collective bargaining agreement – the first team of software engineers to do so. Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama, meanwhile, are currently on the cusp of forming their own historic union. In this panel from TC Sessions: Justice, we discuss how we got here, what comes next and steps tech employees can take.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On Why Now?</h3>
<p>As has been the case with management throughout history, tech companies have long fought tooth and nail against labor organizing. Over the course of the last couple of years, however, we may have seen something of a critical mass that could represent the beginnings of a sea change for the industry.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Redwine:</strong> It seems like tech workers are reacting to some of the maturity of tech and the expansion of the platforms that we all work on, and also more worker instability in general in the US, especially. I think it&#8217;s sort of a response that workers are becoming more formal in their organizing efforts<em><strong>. (Timestamp: 1:08)</strong></em></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Parul Koul (Google):</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Koul:</strong> A variety of tactics and strategies have been tried, and we’ve been able to analyze the successes and failures of past movements and arrive at a point where we’ve developed enough institutional and organizational knowledge to try something new and – in some ways – more complex.<strong> (</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 3:25)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On Whether The Pandemic Will Spur More Organizing</h3>
<p>Covid-19 has radically transformed where – and how – we work. It’s upended many industries and cause millions to lose jobs. Could the pandemic prove to be yet another inflection point for a growing movement.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Koul:</strong> In our case, what we saw was companies moving to work from home and then, in certain categories of employees, not really receiving the same benefits […] whether it’s a stipend to buy equipment or even having the benefit from working from home […] We also saw a mass movement and social and political protests against police brutality erupt right in the middle of the pandemic. For me, and many other organizers at Google, it really galvanized us to do something and respond to that in the streets and in our own way. <strong>(</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 6:56)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>On How – or if – Unions Can Protect Against Layoffs</h3>
<p>For many industries, layoffs have become all but an inevitability during the pandemic. In a number of the aforementioned cases, they’ve continued even in the wake of employee unionizing. Ultimately, how much protection does a union give workers against layoffs?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Reckers:</strong> Kickstarter won its union on February 18, 2020. The pandemic hit in mid-March. The company announced that they were going to have pretty massive layoffs in early-April. That was a very difficult time. We looked at the numbers and did see that a number of the people they were proposing to layoff were advocates for the union or union members. That was very hard to stomach. What happens, though – and where the union comes into play – is that the company was not able to just lay people off like that. Especially under the terms that they wanted to impose unilaterally, without any consultation with staff. The difference was that when the company proposed these layoffs, because there was already a union in place, Kickstarter had to negotiate with the group of employees about the terms of that layoff. <em><strong>(</strong><strong>Timestamp: 9:10)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On How to Get Started</h3>
<p>First steps toward unionization are often difficult in an environment where organizing is frowned upon management. Many early conversations happen after hours and off-the-clock for fear of repercussion. This can be doubly difficult in an environments like white collar workers tech company, where some employees don’t tacitly understand the benefits of organizing.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Reckers:</strong> You can best support each other by getting into conversations with your coworkers and understanding what’s been going on with them. The first question I often get from people is how to first start having conversations. I think that’s a challenge, especially since we’re not taught how to do that. But starting a conversation about what their experiences have been like at the organization or company, how long they’ve been there, how has there changed? What did they want to see when they were hired? What sort of workplace were they looking for? And how can we make sure that we have some way of achieving that?

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On Whether Expressions of Support From Management Are Always Positive</h3>
<p>Management often adopts the narrative that they support unions following hard fought battles. In the wake of support from certain tech executives and political leaders like Joe Biden, the question arises about whether such sentiments can ultimately have negative repercussions for organizing.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Redwine:</strong> First and foremost, it’s really important to remember that the things that people in power say do not matter. All of the power that you have doesn’t come from people at the top giving it to you. It comes from linking arms with the people next to you and taking that power and influence for yourself. (<em><strong>Timestamp: 28:27)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ann Arbor-based <a href="https://refraction.ai/">Refraction A</a>I announced today that it has raised a $4.2 million seed round. The startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/demo-with-matthew-johnson-roberson-refraction-ai/">debuted on the TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility stage</a> back in 2019, was founded by a pair of University of Michigan professors (Matthew Johnson-Roberson &#8212; now CTO &#8212; and Ram Vasudevan) seeking to solve a number of issues posed by many delivery robots.</p>
<p>With an initial prototype built on a bicycle foundation, the company’s REV-1 robot is designed to operate in bike lanes and roads, rather than the standard sidewalk &#8216;bot. The different approach allows the robot to travel at higher speeds (topping out at 15 miles per hour) and removes some of the messy pedestrian-dodging issues that come with sidewalk use (while introducing some new ones on that narrow sliver of asphalt shared by cyclists).</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/47WNq9u4QsY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Refraction is currently testing a small fleet in its native Ann Arbor. The seed round, led by Pillar VC, will be used for R&amp;D, expanding the company’s reach and recruiting more customers, with a focus on grocery store and restaurant deliveries. Other investors include, eLab Ventures, Osage Venture Partners, Trucks Venture Capital, Alumni Ventures Group, Chad Laurans and Invest Michigan.</p>
<p>Another key differentiator is the use of cameras, versus LIDAR. The decision comes with some technological trade-offs, but benefits include a lower price point and the ability for the company to more quickly scale its fleet. The technology is also not easily districted by weather conditions encountered in the upper midwest, though it has limitations, too. As the company puts it, if you&#8217;re not comfortable walking out in it, the robot probably won&#8217;t be, either.</p>
<p>“Our platform uses technology that exists today in an innovative way, to get people the things they need, when they need them, where they live,&#8221; CEO Luke Schneider said in a release tied to the news. &#8220;And we’re doing so in a way that reduces business’ costs, makes roads less congested, and eliminates carbon emissions.”</p>
<p>With this new funding, the company plans to expand operations beyond its native Ann Arbor, though no additional test markets have been announced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon said on Monday it has expanded its food delivery service, called Amazon Food, across 62 zip codes in Bangalore, in what is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">first public update since entering the new category</a> in India last May.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce group said Amazon Food now reaches key localities in Bangalore such as Whitefield, HSR, Sarjapur, Koramangala, Indiranagar, MG Road, Jayanagar, JP Nagar, Frazer Town, Malleshwaram, Rajajinagar, and Vijayanaga.</p>
<p>At the time of the launch in May last year, Amazon Food was available in just four zip codes in Bangalore.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as Amazon Food remains limited to one key market in India, the company is aggressively trying to undercut the competition &#8212; heavily funded startups Zomato and Swiggy &#8212; in the city.</p>
<p>Food delivery is free to Prime members, while others have to pay a fee of 19 Indian rupees (26 cents) &#8212; cheaper than fees levied by Swiggy and Zomato.</p>
<p>The company, which has committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">investing $6.5 billion in its India operations</a>, said it has amassed 2,5000 restaurants and cloud kitchens in Bangalore &#8212; also referred as Bengaluru. Amazon Food customers can enjoy &#8220;offers&#8221; from these restaurants as well as cashbacks from Amazon, the company said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2122243" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="834" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=300,244 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=768,625 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=680,554 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/amazon-food.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It, however, did not share why it has been uncharacteristically so slow with the expansion of Amazon Food in the country.</p>
<p>(Well, I mean, there is a global pandemic &#8212; but Amazon also makes a number of what its employees say &#8220;one-way door&#8221; and &#8220;two-way door&#8221; bets. Two-way door bets are those that the company has not fully committed to and is just attempting to test the waters before making a concrete decision. Think of Amazon Prime as a one-way door bet. So it&#8217;s not clear from day 1 how committed Amazon is to any new service.)</p>
<p>&#8220;With the expansion of Amazon Food in Bengaluru, we continue in our endeavor to offer unmatched convenience and value while being a part of their everyday lives. Amazon Food brings some of the city’s top restaurants including national outlets and as well as local favorites which are popular and follow strict delivery and safety protocols,&#8221; said Sameer Khetarpal, Director of Category Management at Amazon India, in a statement.</p>
<p>Ant Financial-backed Zomato and Prosus Ventures-backed Swiggy have established duopoly in the food delivery market in India, with analysts at Bank of America estimating their combined market share to be over 90%. (Uber exited the Indian food delivery market early last year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/uber-sold-its-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato-for-206m/">selling its local food business to Zomato</a>.)</p>
<p>The expansion of Amazon Food also comes at a time when Zomato, which according to analysts leads the market, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-valued-at-5-4-billion-in-new-250-million-investment/">preparing to file for an IPO</a>.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s food delivery market is especially tough to crack because of local conditions. Unlike in the developed markets such as the U.S., where the value of each delivery item is about $33, in India, a similar item carries the price tag of $4, according to research firms. Both Zomato and Swiggy have significantly improved their unit economics in the past year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Antibiotic resistance is one of the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance#:~:text=Antibiotic%20resistance%20occurs%20naturally%2C%20but,treat%20them%20become%20less%20effective.">biggest potential threats to global health today</a>. But Locus Biosciences is hoping that their crPhage technology might provide a new solution.</p>
<p>Based in North Carolina’s Research Triangle, the startup recently<a href="https://www.locus-bio.com/locus-biosciences-completes-first-of-its-kind-controlled-clinical-trial-for-crispr-enhanced-bacteriophage-therapy/"> announced promising phase 1b clinical trial results</a> for their use of CRISPR-Cas3-enhanced bacteriophages as a treatment for urinary tract infections caused by escherichia coli. Led in part by former Patheon executive and current Locus CEO Paul Garofolo, the startup launched in 2015 with the goal of using a less popular application of CRISPR technology to address growing antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>CRISPR-Cas3 technology has notably different mechanisms from its more well-known CRISPR-Cas9 counterpart. Where the Cas9 enzyme has the ability to cleanly cut through a piece of DNA like a pair of scissors, Garofolo describes Cas3 more like a Pac-Man, shredding the DNA as it moves along a strand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“You wouldn’t be able to use it for most of the editing platforms people were after,” he said, noting that meant there wouldn’t be as much competition around Cas3. “So I knew it would be protected for some time, and that we could keep it quiet.”</p>
<p>Garofolo and his team wanted to use CRISPR-Cas3 not to edit harmful bacteria found in the body, but to destroy it. To do this, they took the DNA-shredding mechanism of Cas3 and used it to enhance bacteriophages—viruses that can attack and kill different species of bacteria. Together, co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer Dave Ousterout—who has a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from Duke—thinks this technology offers an extremely direct and targeted way of killing bacteria.</p>
<p>“We armed the phages with this Cas3 system that attacks E. coli, and that sort of dual mechanism of action is what comes together, essentially, as a really potent way to remove just E. coli,” he said in an interview.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech&#8217;s role in the COVID-19 response: Assist, don&#8217;t reinvent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/techs-role-in-the-covid-19-response-assist-dont-reinvent/embed/#?secret=ysswavaKuA" data-secret="ysswavaKuA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That specificity is something that antibiotics lack. Rather than targeting only harmful bacteria in the body, antibiotics typically wipe out all bacteria they come across. “Every time we take antibiotics, we’re not thinking about all the other parts of us that are impacted by the bacteria that do good things,” said Garofolo. But the precision of Locus Biosciences’ crPhage technology means that only the targeted bacteria would be wiped out, leaving those necessary to the body’s normal function intact.</p>
<p>Beyond offering this more specific approach to treatment of pathogens, or any bacteria-based disease, Garofolo and his team also suspect that their approach will also be extremely safe. Though deadly to bacteria, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/phage-therapy">bacteriophages are typically harmless to humans</a>. The safety of CRISPR in humans is well-established, too.</p>
<p>“That’s our secret sauce,” said Garofolo. “We can build drugs that are more powerful than the antibiotics they’re trying to replace, and they use phage, which is probably one of the world’s safest ways to deliver something into the human body.”</p>
<p>While this new technology could certainly help treat pathogens and infectious diseases, Garofolo hopes that indications in immunology, oncology, and neurology might benefit from it too. “We’re starting to figure out that <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/infectious-agents/infections-that-can-lead-to-cancer/bacteria.html">some bacteria might promote cancer</a>, or inflammation in your gut,” he said. If researchers can identify the bacteria at the root cause of those conditions, Garofolo and Ousterout think the crPhage technology might prove to be an effective treatment.</p>
<p>“If we’re right about that, it’s not just about infections or antimicrobial resistance, but helping people overcome cancer or delay the onset of dementia,” Garofolo said. “It’s changing the way we think about how bacteria really help us live.”</p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the restaurant industry across different cities was massively hit by the pandemic-induced lockdowns last year, food aggregator platforms helped by driving online customers to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.getkoinz.com/">Koinz</a> is one such startup in Egypt. Its value for food and beverages brands before, during and after the lockdowns has bagged the startup a $4.8 million seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2018 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hussein-momtaz/">Hussein Momtaz</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-said-496278b2/">Ahmed Said</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahkhaldi/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Acompanies_company_people_index%3BDkf5dpxeRFybMPZ%2Bev8Ifw%3D%3D">Abdullah Al Khaldi</a>, Koinz set out to solve two major problems in Egypt&#8217;s food aggregation industry.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offline and online food and restaurant experience in the country are totally separate. Most food aggregators who deal with delivery tend to focus on the online customer, and there&#8217;s no sophisticated experience for the offline customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the unit economics of the food aggregation industry is quite challenging. According to Momtaz, the startup&#8217;s CEO, the food aggregation industry usually takes about 25%-30% average commission from F&amp;B players for business to start to make sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is not because they want to squeeze money from the hands of restaurants or brands,&#8221; Momtaz said to TechCrunch. &#8220;But the cost of acquiring customers and retaining them for the food aggregator itself is very high; that&#8217;s why they need very high commissions from the brands or restaurants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where Koinz comes in. The company developed a mobile app for takeout and delivery orders that manages offline customer experiences while delivering an engagement platform to manage loyalty programs, customer feedback and analytics about the online and offline customer base.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122070" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122070" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="407" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=1536,920 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1226 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-Founders.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122070" class="wp-caption-text">Abdullah Al Khaldi (CRO), Hussein Momtaz (CEO), and Ahmed Said (CTO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online food experience for Koinz customers is like a treasure hunt, and Momtaz claims the company&#8217;s business model has cracked the industry&#8217;s unit economics. This, alongside providing brands with insights, differentiates the platform from other aggregators and makes its customer acquisition cost and retention cost 60% less than most of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s how the platform works. When customers visit a brand using for the first time, they enter their phone numbers to instantly receive points for their order via text message. After various restaurant visits and making orders, they accumulate enough points. They&#8217;ll need to download the Koinz mobile application to redeem them, thereby converting these offline customers to online ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, these offline customers can now discover new places to eat, read and leave reviews, and order delivery or takeout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;None of the small or big brands in the region had something like this before. The offline customer is like a ghost. He walks into the brands, takes his orders, and leaves without the brands knowing anything about him. Koinz is changing that,&#8221; the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building its platform this way, Koinz tries to be different from other online aggregators that erode restaurant owners&#8217; profit margins while delivering limited customer access and interaction. How? By collecting real-time data and leveraging a digital rewarding system designed to drive customers to deepen their relationship with restaurants.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122071" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122071" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2122071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Koinz-app-Points.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122071" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Koinz</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands can configure their gifts lists and determine what customers can redeem their points for. For instance, customers in an Egyptian restaurant called Buffalo Burger can exchange 68 points for a Diablo Fries Medium; or wait till they get to 160 points to get a Mozzarella Sticks Medium; or 236 points for a Double Diggler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, every brand has its own configuration. A customer cannot get points in Buffalo Burger and redeem them at Hamburgini. Koinz charges subscriptions to the brands for its engagement and feedback platform and collects commission whenever an order is made via its platform, which varies across its markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of its original business model, Koinz had to iterate several times. Before using phone numbers to collect customers&#8217; information, the company used QR codes and NFC tags. Momtaz says this was highly ineffective, and the move to phone numbers helped skyrocket its growth and value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-man team back in 2018 is now 80, and the platform, which is basically powering the growth of restaurants in the Middle East, claims to have had up to 4 million consumers earn points on its platform. These consumers have redeemed almost 300,000 rewards, while almost 800,000 customers have left reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in Egypt, Koinz has expanded to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Like Egypt, these markets have similar dynamics and demographics. They have also witnessed one of the <a href="https://www.consultancy-me.com/news/3151/online-grocery-sales-in-ksa-and-uae-doubles-during-covid-19">highest rates of new or increased users</a> in online deliveries &#8212; restaurant products and groceries &#8212; during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, consumers in the Middle East are outpacing the global appetite in food delivery, <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/money/majority-of-middle-east-consumers-plan-to-spend-more-this-year-1.977492">with 64% ordering in at least once a week</a> compared to 40% made by global consumers. And with the fast-food industry in MENA was estimated at nearly $31 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach nearly $60 billion by 2025, there&#8217;s so much room for Koinz to grow in the region. Momtaz says the company is also considering a move to Sub-Saharan Africa in the nearest future despite them having distinct demographics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneur and investor Justin Mateen led this seed round. Since leaving Tinder in 2014, Mateen has been an active investor in early-stage companies. Koinz is his first investment in the MENA region. According to him, Koinz&#8217;s ability to allow food and beverages brands to understand their customers&#8217; needs and simultaneously increase their profit margins was one of the reasons he invested in the Egyptian-based startup.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The company&#8217;s unique business model will continue to scale as the food delivery space evolves. Hussein&#8217;s drive and excitement for what the team is building are what convinced me to lead a round in the Middle East for the first time,&#8221; Mateen added.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African-focused VC 4DX Ventures and strategic angel investors from Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia participated as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Orth, co-founder and managing director of the firm, said of the investment that with restaurants in the region suffering under the traditional aggregator model, especially during the pandemic, Koinz has quickly become a win-win for both consumers and restaurant owners across the Middle East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the three-year-old company plans to use the capital to hire more talent and fuel its expansion across the Middle East, Mateen and Orth will join its board of directors.</span></p>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Our transportation desk is taking shape. Two new reporters, Aria Alamalhodaei and Rebecca Bellan started Monday and have already provided some new and interesting coverage. Tamara Warren, a former editor at the Verge who has been writing about automotive and tech for two decades, reviewed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/the-aston-martin-dbx-is-a-tale-of-two-vehicles/">Aston Martin DBX</a>. This week, Abigail Basset, a World Car Juror former CNN producer who writes about cars, tech, business — pretty much everything — break down the new VW ID. 4.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re just getting started. <em>Vamos.</em></p>
<p>Please help welcome them and follow them on Twitter and maybe even drop them a DM. You can find them @RebeccaBellan and Aria over @breadfrom.</p>

<p>Scooter clutter has prompted a number of entrepreneurs to start companies, all aiming to solve the problem. Tortoise has its repositioning software, companies like Swiftmile offer docking stations that also charge scooters.</p>
<p>But what about a solution that works across brands? Paris aims to find out.</p>
<p>The city is testing universal charging infrastructure for electric scooters in a pilot project that will kick off in the second quarter of this year. DUCKT, which <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6773179827798200322/">was awarded the pilot</a>, will install 150 dock and charge points that can be plugged into bus stations and street lighting to provide the power source.</p>
<p>DUCKT was one of 15 companies that were named <a href="https://urbanlab.parisandco.paris/QIU3">Urban Innovation District winners</a>. Each winner is testing a different urban project in the 13th arrondissement. The competition, which is run by Paris &amp; Co.&#8217;s urban innovation lab, includes pilots focused on food waste, rainwater collection, revegetation and waterproofing as well as several mobility projects. Ezymob will test a mobile app that helps visually impaired people navigate public transit, Mobilypod is launching a subscription-based cargo bike service and bike shelters and the LaCroix Lab is piloting 4SafeMobilities, a system designed to streamline traffic at intersections and pedestrian crossings.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, Porsche is taking its electrification ambitions to two wheels. The German automaker unveiled this week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/porsche-unveils-two-new-electric-bikes-alongside-the-taycan-gran-turismo/"> two electric bikes</a> alongside the global debut of the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo, the latest variant to its EV flagship. These bikes cost between $8,000 and more than $10,000 — prices one might expect from the luxury performance brand.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Forget the &#8220;deal of the week.&#8221; How about we take a stroll down memory lane and look at all the deals of 2020? CB Insights, released March 3 its <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/mobility-trends-2020/">State of Mobility report</a> that looks at 2020 investment data and trends surrounding all things transportation.</p>
<p>The upshot: The COVID-19 pandemic did help push total funding down 5% year-over-year to $27.19 billion, although CB Insights saw recovery in the second half of the year. There were 522 deals, a 21% drop from the previous year.</p>
<p>Total funding only tells part of the story though. If 2020 will be known for anything — aside from the whole global pandemic thing — it&#8217;ll be for the incredible number of SPAC deals across auto and mobility. There were 107 exits last year with 22 of them from startups going public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition, or &#8220;blank check&#8221; company. Having trouble gauging if that&#8217;s a big deal? Here&#8217;s some help: there were five auto and mobility SPACs between 2015 and 2019. Five. Electric vehicle companies and those with technology that supports EVs made up 68% of those SPAC deals in 2020.</p>
<p>The SPAC spree isn&#8217;t stopping either with Joby Aviation, Hellbiz and Otonomo are just a few that have reached merger agreements and will go public in 2021.</p>
<p>Electric vehicle tech and autonomous vehicle tech both reached peaks in 2020. EV tech companies raised $12.8 billion across 193 deals, while AVs brought in $7.3 billion across 105 deals, according to CB Insights. It&#8217;s worth noting that the AV industry appears to be maturing — at least in a funding perspective — with the average deal size rising 16.8% from the previous year to $104 million.</p>
<p>Connected car tech and auto commerce both saw dips in funding last year. For the second straight year, connected car tech saw a drop in funding and total number of deals. Funding plummeted 52% to $1 billion in 2020 compared to the previous year. CB Insights said the drop is because connectivity solutions have been widely adopted and investors have shifted their attention and money to other areas of auto tech such as electrification and autonomy.</p>
<p>Perhaps to no one&#8217;s surprise, bike and scooter companies saw funding rise 52% year-over-year to $2.4 billion in 2020. That&#8217;s still below funding seen in those heady days of 2017 and 2018 when scooters won over the hearts and minds of investors. Scooter and bike companies raked in $3.2 billion in 2017 and $4.9 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>And finally, funding to shared mobility companies (MaaS) fell 20% in 2020 to $6.3 billion across 116 deals.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aero</strong>, a startup backed by Garrett Camp&#8217;s startup studio Expa, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/aero-series-a/">raised $20 millio</a>n in Series A funding round led by Keyframe Capital, with Keyframe’s chief investment officer John Rapaport joining the Aero board. Cyrus Capital Partners and Expa also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Boom Supersonic</strong>, the aerospace startup building supersonic jets, landed a strategic investment from American Express Ventures. The funds will be used for the development of the company&#8217;s flagship product, the supersonic airliner Overture.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Fluid Truck</strong>,  a Denver-based app-based platform that lets users make short-term rentals of commercial vehicles, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/fluid-truck-the-zipcar-of-commercial-trucks-raises-63m-to-take-on-rental-giants/">raised $63 million in a Series A funding round</a>. The truck sharing platform is aimed at mid-mile and last-mile delivery companies, which use it to remotely manage an on-demand rental fleet via web or mobile app. Private equity firm Bison Capital led the round, with participation from Ingka Investments (part of Ingka Group, the main Ikea retailer), Sumitomo Corporation of Americas and Fluid Vehicle Owners.</p>
<p><strong>Instacart</strong>, the n-demand grocery delivery platform, raised $265 million in funding from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and others. The new funding pushed the company&#8217;s valuation to $39 billion &#8212; more than double its $17.7 billion valuation when it raised $200 million just six months ago.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Darrell Etherington writes</a>: What&#8217;s behind the massive increase in the value investors are willing to ascribe to the business? Put simply, the pandemic. Last year, Instacart announced three separate raises, including a $225 million round in June, followed by a $100 million round in July. The rapid sequence of venture capital injections were likely designed to fuel growth as demand for grocery delivery services surged while people attempted to quarantine or generally spend less time frequenting high-traffic social environments like grocery stores.</p>
<p><strong>Loggi Tecnologia</strong>, the Brazilian delivery company backed by SoftBank and Microsoft Corp., raised 1.15 billion reais ($205 million) in a round led by CapSur Capital, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/softbank-backed-loggi-valued-near-2-billion-in-funding-round?srnd=deals&amp;sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. The company is now valued close to $2 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Rollick</strong>, the online powersports, RV and boat buying marketplace, raised $8.5 million in a funding round that included investors Sandbox Insurtech Ventures, TechNexus Venture Collaborative, Dallas Venture Capital, Alumni Ventures, and London Technology Club. Existing investors LiveOak Venture Partners, Silverton Partners, Autotech Ventures, ManchesterStory, Anthem Venture Partners and Capital Factory also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Volocopter</strong>, a startup out of southern Germany that has been building and testing electric VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, raised €200 million (about $241 million) in a Series D round of funding. New investors include funds managed by BlackRock, global infrastructure company Atlantia SpA., Avala Capital; Tier 1 supplier Continental AG, Japan’s NTT via its venture capital arm, Tokyo Century and multiple family offices.. Volocopter also said that all of its existing investors — a list that includes Geely, Daimler, DB Schenker, Intel Capital, btov Partners, Team Europe and Klocke Holding and more — also contributed to the round.</p>
<p>Alongside its aircraft, Volocopter has also been building a business case in which its vessels will be used in a taxi-style fleet in urban areas. CEO Florian Reuter told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flying-taxi-startup-volocopter-picks-up-another-241m-says-service-is-now-two-years-out/">TechCrunch editor Ingrid Lunden</a> that live services are now two years out for the two vehicle models it has been developing.</p>

<p>Policy: it&#8217;s what for dinner.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying out a new, semi-regular section in the newsletter that will cover notable legislative activity around electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, public transit and personal mobility.</p>
<p>This week, let&#8217;s head on over to California, where State Sen. Dave Min introduced a bill that would require all autonomous vehicles to also be zero emission by 2025. The bill was sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group says it doesn&#8217;t want to see future means of transportation married to the technology of the past. Proponents point out the potential for AVs to either help or hurt attempts to cut emissions.</p>
<p>While the amendment is in line with the state&#8217;s goals to reduce emissions, it also adds a wrinkle to the plans of any AV developer that doesn&#8217;t currently use electric vehicles. Cruise and Zoox, for instance, only use electric vehicles. AV giant Waymo and numerous others use a mix of vehicles, notably the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan.</p>
<p>As Rebecca Bellan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/california-bill-would-require-all-self-driving-vehicles-to-be-zero-emission-by-2025/">notes in her article</a>, this proposed bill is in its infancy stages, so there are plenty of opportunities for it to be quashed.</p>
<p>The responses from the industry offered up the kind of political neutrality that aims to placate everyone. My interpretation of the various comments and statements — both on record and more informal on background chatter — is that work will soon begin to modify the language of the proposed bill to be more accommodating to the industry while hanging onto its original intent. That might mean pushing the deadline, adding hybrids and creating an exception for long-haul trucks.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, over in the land of passenger electric vehicles, work is underway to pass laws that would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/ev-rivals-tesla-rivian-unite-to-target-direct-sales-legislation/">allow direct sales</a> in at least eight states. Passage of such legislation would clear the way for EV giants like Tesla, along with newcomers Lucid and Rivian, which have yet to bring a vehicle to market, to sell directly to consumers.</p>
<p>Tesla, Rivian and other EV entrants are working together to pass these laws. Industry alliances are not unheard of on issues in which all the parties stand to benefit. Tesla&#8217;s cooperation is notable because it would end its monopoly on direct sales in some states.</p>

<p>Here are a few other stories that are worth sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Aston Martin</strong> CEO Tobias Moers&#8217; <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/why-aston-martins-ceo-confident-turnround-will-succeed?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FEuropeNews+%28Automotive+News+Europe+News+Feed%29">interview</a> with Automotive News Europe is a complementary side dish to Tamara Warren&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/the-aston-martin-dbx-is-a-tale-of-two-vehicles/">review of the DBX</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Postmates X</strong>, the robotics division of the on-demand delivery startup that Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion, has officially spun out as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">independent company called Serve Robotics</a>. (Y&#8217;all might recall I previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/uber-planning-to-spin-out-postmates-delivery-robot-arm/">reported that a deal</a> was being shopped to investors.)</p>
<p>Serve Robotics raised seed funding in a round led by venture capital firm Neo. Other investors included Uber as well as Lee Jacobs and Cyan Banister&#8217;s Long Journey Ventures, Western Technology Investment, Scott Banister, Farhad Mohit and Postmates co-founders Bastian Lehmann and Sean Plaice.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> is closing its forums and launching a new <a href="https://engage.tesla.com/articles/14-welcome-tesla-engagement-platform">social media platform</a> called the Tesla Engagement Platform. The move has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/tesla-has-closed-its-forums-to-launch-a-social-platform-and-fans-are-not-happy/">raised the ire</a> of a community of its most ardent supporters.</p>
<p><strong>Tortoise</strong> landed another deal, this time with Albertsons Companies, the grocery giant that owns Safeway and Jewel-Osco. Albertson said it has launched a pilot program that will test grocery delivery using remote-controlled delivery robots developed Tortoise. The pilot will start at two Safeway locations in Northern California, although Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko said if successful, he expects the pilot to continue to scale to other stores in the state and possibly throughout the West Coast.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota Motor</strong> said it plans to sell 500 billion yen ($4.7 billion) in <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/34860933.html">&#8220;Woven Planet Bonds&#8221;</a> to fund a variety of <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">renewable energy</span> and transportation<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> projects, including  assisted mobility vehicles, and increased use of </span></p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen</strong> said it plans to launch an electric sedan in 2026. The company said that the vehicle, dubbed Project Trinity, will set &#8220;new standards&#8221; with its charging speed, battery range, and in other technology, <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35741685/vw-to-build-ev-trinity-2026/">Car and Driver reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Volvo Cars</strong> said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/volvo-to-sell-only-all-electric-vehicles-by-2030/">only make and sell all-electric vehicles</a> by 2030 as part of a broader transformation of the automaker that will include shifting sales online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://en.eatplanted.com">Planted</a>, a startup pursuing a unique method of creating a vegetarian chicken alternative, has raised an $18 million (CHF 17 million) Series A to expand its product offerings and international footprint. With new kebabs and pulled-style faux meats available and steak-like cuts in the (literal) pipeline, Planted has begun to set its sights outside central Europe.</p>
<p>The company was a spinout from ETH Zurich and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/planted-joins-the-meatless-meat-melee-with-its-pea-protein-chicken/">made its debut in 2019</a>, but has not rested on the success of its plain chicken recipe. Its approach, which relied on using pea protein and pea fiber extruded to recreate the fibrous structure of chicken for nearly 1:1 replacement in recipes, has proven to be adaptable for different styles and ingredients as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;For example our newly launched planted.pulled consists of sunflower, oat and yellow pea proteins, changing both structure and taste to resemble pulled pork rather than chicken. The great thing about the sunflower proteins, they are upcycled from sunflower oil production. Hence, we are establishing a circular economy approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I first wrote about Planted, its products were only being distributed through a handful of restaurants and grocery stores. Now the company has a presence in more than 3,000 retail locations across Switzerland, Germany and Austria, and works with restaurant and food service partners as well. No doubt this strong organic (so to speak) growth, and the growth of the meat alternative market in general, made raising money less of a chore.</p>
<p>The cash will be directed, as you might expect for a company at this stage, towards R&amp;D and further expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funding will be used to expand our tech stack, to commercialize our prime cuts that are currently produced at lab scale,&#8221; said Jenny. &#8220;On the manufacturing side we look to significantly increase our current capacity of half a ton per hour to serve the increasing demand coming from international markets, first in neighboring countries and then further into Europe and overseas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will further invest in our structuring and fermentation platforms. Combining structuring technologies with the biochemical toolboxes of natural microorganisms will allow <span lang="en-US">u</span>s to create ultimately new products with transformative character &#8211; all clean, natural, healthy and tasty,&#8221; said co-founder <span lang="en-US">Lukas Böni in a press release.<br />
</span></p>
<p>No doubt this all will also help lower the price, a goal from the beginning but only possible by scaling up.</p>

<p>As other companies in this space also raise money (incidentally, rather large amounts of it) and expand to other markets, competition will be fierce — but Planted seems to be specializing in a few food types that aren&#8217;t as commonly found, at least in the U.S., where sausages, ground &#8220;beef&#8221; and &#8220;chicken&#8221; nuggets have been the leading forms of meat alternatives.</p>
<p>No word on when Planted products will make it to American tables, but Jenny&#8217;s &#8220;overseas&#8221; suggests it is at least a possibility fairly soon.</p>
<p>The funding round was co-led by Vorwerk Ventures and Blue Horizon Ventures, with participation from Swiss football (soccer) player Yann Sommer and several previous investors.</p>
