					<description><![CDATA[CEO Andrew Ng says industries should adopt a data-centric approach to building AI, which provides a more efficient way for manufacturers to teach an AI model what to do.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just over a year after launching, <a href="https://landing.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landing AI</a> secured a $57 million round of Series A funding to continue building tools that enable manufacturers to more easily and quickly build and deploy artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>The company, started by former Google and Baidu AI guru Andrew Ng, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/landing-ai-launches-new-visual-inspection-platform-for-manufacturers/">developed LandingLens</a>, a visual inspection tool that applies AI and deep learning to find product defects faster and more accurately.</p>
<p>Ng says industries should adopt a data-centric approach to building AI, which provides a more efficient way for manufacturers to teach an AI model what to do, using no code/low code capabilities, which include just a few mouse clicks to build advanced AI models in less than a day.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230233" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We kicked off the data-centric AI movement and are quite pleased that other companies have started talking about it,” he told TechCrunch. “In manufacturing, every factory does something different, so the problem becomes how we can help 10,000 manufacturers build 10,000 different models without having to hire a lot of manpower.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230236" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230236" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230236" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?w=680" alt="Andrew Ng, Landing AI" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230236" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Ng, founder and CEO. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Landing AI</p></div></p>
<p>AI is expected to create $13 trillion of realized value to the world’s economy by 2030, <a href="https://internetofbusiness.com/a-i-2030-13-trillion-boost-to-economy-but-deep-disparity-mckinsey/#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20(AI)%20could,from%20management%20consulting%20firm%2C%20McKinsey." target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a McKinsey study</a>. Ng says not much of that is realized yet, as it remains challenging to build different AI models.</p>
<p>He believes Landing AI has cracked the code for building these models, and raised the Series A round after seeing product market fit and wanted to be able to scale the team to make the product better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McRock Capital, an investment firm focused on the industrial Internet of Things, led the investment and was joined by Insight Partners, Taiwania Capital, Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), Intel Capital, Samsung Catalyst Fund, Far Eastern Group’s DRIVE Catalyst, Walsin Lihwa and AI Fund.</p>
<p>Landing AI has made strides in building its product, but Ng said the company is still in the early stages of the data-centric AI movement and wants to make additional progress and innovate on some technology that is still missing.</p>
<p>For example, while previously building a facial recognition system with 350 million images, he found that AI technology invented for that many images does not work as well to find defects. Part of the data-centric movement is to develop tools to help domain experts by utilizing less than 50 images to provide a clearer example of what is a defect.</p>
<p>“We’ve reached a point where it is working and we are eager to scale everything,” Ng said. “We’ve been fascinated for years on how to crack the recipe and take AI to other industries, and we are finally getting there with data-centric AI.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://notabene.id/">Notabene</a>, a New York, NY-based crypto compliance SaaS startup, has raised $10.2 million in a Series A funding round co-led by F-Prime Capital and Jump Capital. The latest investment brings Notabene’s valuation to $45 million.</p>
<p>New investors include crypto exchanges <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/african-crypto-usage-spurs-luno-as-customers-reach-7m/">Luno</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/with-investors-expecting-a-latin-american-cryptocurrency-boom-mexicos-bitso-raises-62-million/">Bitso</a>, who were Notabene’s customers prior to the fundraise, as well as the venture capital arms of Blockfi and Gemini Frontier Fund. Illuminate Financial, CMT Digital, Fenbushi Capital and ComplyAdvantage CEO Charlie Delingpole also participated as new backers in the Series A, joining existing investors including Castle Island Ventures and Green Visor Capital. Notabene raised a $1.76 million seed round in October 2020, six months after the company was founded.</p>
<p>Notabene’s software helps its 50-plus customers, many of which are crypto exchanges, comply with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) “travel rule” imposed in 2019. The travel rule requires crypto exchanges in FATF member countries to exchange customer-identifying information for transfers above $1,000 to ensure compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. FATF <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf">issued new guidance</a> around the travel rule in October, clarifying the specifics around what exchanges need to do in order to comply.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230151" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Notabene fills a need from exchanges for technology that enables this transfer of information between parties in a transaction while preserving user privacy. The identify-verification process requires anonymous wallet addresses on the blockchain to be linked to real-world customers. Notabene CEO Pelle Brændgaard told TechCrunch that it is crucial to ensure this information is only seen by the parties involved in the transaction and Notabene itself.</p>
<p>Brændgaard added that beyond ensuring compliance, the identity-verification services Notabene provides also help build trust between consumers transacting in crypto, who want to ensure they are transacting with the correct counterparty and avoiding the risk of fraud.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the proceeds from the funding round to scale its technology to support an influx of new customers.</p>
<p>Of 25 crypto exchanges who responded to a survey by investor <a href="https://jumpcap.com/">Jump Capital</a>, 90% said they plan to use Notabene for travel rule compliance, Peter Johnson, a Jump Capital partner who is joining Notabene’s board of directors, told TechCrunch. Johnson said Jump’s investment was motivated, in part, by “overwhelming market feedback” that Notabene’s product was solving a crucial issue for the crypto industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notabene’s biggest competitors are industry working groups implementing centralized protocols for compliance. The Travel Rule Protocol (TRP) working group, which counts banks including Fidelity Investments and Standard Chartered among its members, is one of the most notable. Under such centralized protocols, member institutions and exchanges share data, and their users can easily transact with one another in a compliant manner.</p>
<p>Brændgaard said that these groups can foster exclusion, given their membership is largely composed of U.S.-based exchanges.</p>
<p>“We have a few companies that are in Nigeria, for example, and Nigeria doesn&#8217;t have a regulatory framework for crypto. So if you have a gatekeeper that goes in and says, &#8216;we only expect fully regulated companies,&#8217; that means that they&#8217;re automatically out,” Brændgaard said of centralized groups like the TRP. “It doesn&#8217;t matter if they have built up a good, strong, serious, well-respected compliance function over the years.”</p>
<p>Notabene’s founding team and many of its early employees came from decentralized identity startup <a href="https://www.uport.me/">UPort</a>, Brændgaard said. He said he hopes Notabene’s decentralized framework, informed by the work they did at UPort, can build trust across exchanges without limiting membership.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For Them intends to launch up to five products in the next year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://forthem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Them</a> announced $2 million in pre-seed funding as it launches its first two products for the queer community: a breathable binder and multi-use intimacy serum.</p>
<p>Chloe Freeman, an actor, producer and entrepreneur started the company last year after completing an entrepreneur-in-residence program at pre-hype. They previously founded a production company, Boycott Entertainment, that raised more than $1 million to date for underrepresented creators</p>
<p>Freeman, a queer, non-binary person of color, told TechCrunch they didn’t see any wellness products that spoke to them or their peers, but rather to the majority of cisgender people.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230197" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“As someone who didn’t fit that bucket, I went looking for my unique wellness product,” they said. “I wanted to dig in and see how to change the narrative.”</p>
<p>That was particularly true with For Them’s first product, a chest binder to help reduce gender dysphoria. Freeman asked peers about their experiences and then went out and bought all of the binders they could find and “was shocked” at how uncomfortable the binders were — the itchy fabric and the synthetic materials — and aimed to make a better one, they said.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Resolute Ventures and includes Yes VC, Animo Ventures, Gaingels Spark Fund and a group of over 10 individual investors including Toyin Ajayi, co-founder and president of Cityblock Health; Lindsay Ullman, co-founder of Umbrella; Ashley Mayer, former Glossier executive; and Jackie Rice, co-founder, Tribe AI.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to create additional products, to continue building its community and for talent acquisition. Freeman intends to create an equally diverse team as the community For Them aims to serve.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This is a huge opportunity to work with an underserved community that needs products that speak to them,” Freeman added.</p>
<p>In addition to the binder and Fluid intimacy serum, which has CBD oil, they intend to build two or three additional products. The company’s product pipeline will be community-driven. Freeman’s strategy is to gather ideas from For Them’s community and produce what they need. The community sits on Discord currently, which Freeman said provides anonymity, especially when speaking about personal problems.</p>

<p>For Them has 800 people on the waiting list for the binder, which Freeman said was deliberate so that the company was able to adequately serve them within the next month. Once the company makes it through that list, more customers will be able to purchase products.</p>
<p>Melanie Travis, founder of swimwear company Andie Swim, is one of For Them’s advisors and board members and said now was a “great time to be starting something” and is looking forward to seeing what works and what the company can create.</p>
<p>At this stage, Travis said investment is mostly about the founder and finds Freeman to be “ a smart, remarkable person who is passionate about the purpose and the category.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes founders come up against a brick wall, and you are looking at the founder’s ability to just bust through that brick wall, and I saw all of that in Chloe,” she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As some of the most popular cryptocurrencies reach all-time-highs, plenty of new users and decentralized app developers are embracing the Ethereum network and quickly discovering that the blockchain remains a pretty crowded place to do business. Ethereum&#8217;s insufficient network volume limits have led to slow transactions and prohibitively pricey fees, but it&#8217;s a familiar problem for longtime developers in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>What is new is the wider availability of so-called Ethereum &#8220;rollup&#8221; scaling solutions. These developer products reduce the traffic on the central Ethereum blockchain by offloading the hard work of processing transactions to efficient secondary chains that record data of transaction batches to the main Ethereum network. What this means functionally is that developers can earn the benefits of speedier and cheaper transactions without having to lose the security of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://matter-labs.io/">Matter Labs</a> is one of a handful of blockchain startups building out a sophisticated rollup product, but the team believes that their solution <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a> is destined to beat out the competition. The startup tells TechCrunch it has just closed a $50 million Series B investment led by a16z Crypto just months after closing a Series A led by Union Square Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230246" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ethereum scaling is a serious business with just a few major players; a16z Crypto already backed one this year, leading the February Series A of developer Optimism. In August, Lightspeed backed Offchain Labs, maker of Arbitrum &#8212; another Ethereum scaling solution with a lot of developer interest. Both developers are building a type of rollup called an &#8220;optimistic rollup,&#8221; Matter Labs is building a similar product called a &#8220;ZK rollup&#8221; that takes a notably different approach leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to scale transactions in a manner that&#8217;s fundamentally more secure but is also much more computationally intense.</p>

<p>The differences between the two are fairly technical, but they essentially differ in the way that the legitimacy of the transactions inside the rollups are determined. Blockchains work by various nodes across a network reaching a consensus for what the verified history of transactions on said network looks like. With optimistic rollups, Ethereum treats the bundled transactions as legitimate by default, while withholding withdrawals for several days to allow participants in the network time to prove if the batch was fraudulent and should be rejected. Meanwhile ZK rollups leverage complex mathematical proofs which allow the Ethereum network to quickly verify and accept the legitimacy of a given transaction batch.</p>
<p>Matter Labs isn&#8217;t the only group building a ZK rollup product, but their primary advantage is that they&#8217;ve already deep in testing a solution to help Ethereum developers not only process transactions inside zkSync but also operate smart contracts based on the Solidity programming language natively inside of the product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It has tended to be the case historically that zk-based scaling solutions forced developers to learn a new programming language,&#8221; a16z Crypto general partner Ali Yahya tells TechCrunch. &#8220;[Matter Labs] has succeeded in building a compiler for Solidity that takes down normal smart contracts that run on Ethereum to a zero-knowledge proof so that they can be used with [zkSync].&#8221;</p>
<p>In the short-term there are some clear advantages for optimistic rollups, chief of which is that many of them are already publicly available to developers with wide capabilities. While zkSync is already live on the Ethereum mainnet, mainnet support for smart contracts won&#8217;t arrive until early next year, the company says. Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski expects ZK rollups to reign supreme soon enough though, an opinion notably shared by Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin who wrote in a January<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html"> blog post</a> that &#8220;in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see a world where optimistic rollups remain in the very near term,&#8221; Gluchowski tells TechCrunch. &#8220;If crypto becomes as successful as the visionaries picture it &#8212; that all the world&#8217;s digital economy lives on blockchains &#8212; then it has to use zero-knowledge proofs. We simply don&#8217;t have any other technology that can support this massive scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>The <strong>Specialty Equipment Market Association</strong> trade show, which we know as <strong>SEMA</strong>, has long been the place to go to see quirky and flashy modifications to vehicles. This year, a major shift occurred that reflects what is happening across the country. I wasn&#8217;t able to attend this year, but folks I spoke to said they have never seen so many gas-to-electric conversions of sports cars, vintage hot rods and the like.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230331" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, there was also a number of automakers displaying their new electrified vehicles, including the Ford F-100 Eluminator concept truck. We care about this concept because it showcases something that Ford is actually going to sell. The automaker is selling (available online or at a local dealer through Ford Performance Parts) the Eluminator electric crate motor. The motor comes from the Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition and produces 281 horsepower and 317 lb.-ft. of torque.</p>

<p><strong>Lime</strong> closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/lime-raises-523-million-as-it-prepares-to-go-public/">$523 million round</a> made up of convertible debt and term loan financing, the next step as the company prepares to go public next year, according to CEO <strong>Wayne Ting</strong>. The largest chunk of the round is convertible note, which means it will convert to shares when Lime goes public, something Ting says the company will do next year, but he didn&#8217;t say when or how. About $20M of that total funding will go towards the company&#8217;s decarbonization efforts. Among many initiatives that Lime put forth in time for COP26 is the company&#8217;s goal to get 80% of its manufacturing and supply chain partners to set their own carbon emissions goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Bird</strong>, one of Lime&#8217;s biggest competitors, went public via the old SPAC route on Friday.  Shares of Bird closed basically flat at $8.40. Bird plans to use the money from the IPO to expand existing operations and launch in new cities. After Bird&#8217;s shareholders voted for the merger earlier this week, shares of the SPAC, <strong>Switchback II Corporation</strong>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/">sunk more than 20%</a> before recovering.</p>
<p>Singapore-based <strong>Neuron Mobility</strong> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/e-scooter-company-neuron-trials-1500-scooters-that-can-detect-and-correct-unsafe-riding/">updating its N3 scooters</a> with a new OS and additional onboard sensors to help it detect and correct dangerous or inconsiderate riding. A lot of companies have come out with some form of tech angled at offering the rider assistance in not driving like a jerk (Spin, Voi, Bird, Superpedestrian and Helbiz to name a few&#8230;), but they haven&#8217;t all delivered on that promise &#8220;at scale,&#8221; whatever that means. Neuron will be trialing about 1,500 of these upgraded scooters in Australia, Canada and the UK over the next six months.</p>
<p>European micromobility company <strong>Dott</strong> became one of the latest operators to integrate with Google Maps. Dott&#8217;s e-scooters and e-bikes will show up on the app in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain and the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Helbiz</strong> launched a fleet of 250 e-scooters in Sacramento, California after securing a one-year permit.</p>
<p>The UK and <strong>Beam</strong> launched a partnership in Australia and New Zealand to raise awareness of electric mobility in order to help reduce transport-fueled carbon emissions. They&#8217;re offering incentives in the form of ride credits to those who have yet to use a form of electric mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Gojek</strong>, Indonesian mobility and on-demand platform, and <strong>Gogoro</strong>, a Taiwanese micromobility battery swapping platform company, announced a partnership to electrify two-wheel transportation in Indonesia. The two, along with Indonesian national energy company Pertamina, are starting a battery swapping and Gogoro Smartscooter pilot scheme in Jakarta.</p>
<p><strong>PeopleForBike</strong> and <strong>Call2Recycle</strong> have teamed up to create the first industry-wide electric bicycle battery recycling program in the United States. The hope is to unite the sector under one battery recycling solution.</p>

<p>I wanted to turn your attention to an autonomous vehicle company that seems to be able to raise abundant amounts of capital and still remain under the radar.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about <strong>Nuro</strong>, the autonomous delivery company founded in 2016. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/">raised $600 million</a> in a fundraising round led by new investor Tiger Global Management. Google was another new investor in this round.</p>
<p>The funding has pushed Nuro&#8217;s valuation to about $8.6 billion &#8212; or some 72% higher than a year ago &#8212; according to people who spoke to me on condition on anonymity. A group of mostly existing investors joined the Series D round, including Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, China-based venture firm Gaorong Capital, grocery retailer Kroger, SoftBank Vision Fund 1, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Woven Capital, a venture arm of Toyota subsidiary Woven Planet.</p>
<p>Much of it will be spent on commercializing and scaling the production of its third-generation vehicle at a new facility in Southern Nevada. Construction on its manufacturing facility will begin in December and is expected to be completed in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>42dot</strong>, a South Korea-based autonomous transportation-as-a-service startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/korean-autonomous-driving-startup-42dot-bags-88-5m-series-a-to-support-its-growth/">raised $88.5 million</a> (104 billion WON) in a Series A round of funding that included participation from new investors like Shinhan Financial Group, Lotte Rental, Lotte Ventures, STIC Ventures, We Ventures, DA Value Investment and others.</p>
<p><strong> Autobrains</strong>, an Israeli-based company that develops AI technology for assisted and autonomous driving, <a href="https://autobrains.ai/">raised $101 million</a> in Series C funding round led by Temasek. Additional participants in the round include new investors Knorr-Bremse AG, VinFast and existing investor BMW and strategic partner, Continental.</p>
<p><strong>Breadfast</strong>, an online grocery delivery company that wants to become a regional leader in the sector, raised $26 million in Series A financing from lead investors Vostok New Ventures and Endure Capital. JAM Fund (led by Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen), YC Continuity Fund, a large unnamed Saudi-based fund, Shorooq Partners, 4DX Ventures and logistics giant Flexport also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Delimobil</strong>, Russian car-sharing company, decided to postpone its initial public offering due to market conditions, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-delimobil-ipo/russian-car-sharing-firm-delimobil-says-it-has-postponed-ipo-idUSKBN2HP26L">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Momenta</strong>, an autonomous vehicle developer from China, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/momenta-500-million/">raised another $500 million</a> that was added to its Series C round. The funding comes two months since it announced a $300 million investment from General Motors. This latest injection of capital brings the total of the startup&#8217;s Series C to over $1 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Opibus</strong>, a Swedish-Kenyan EV conversion company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ev-conversion-startup-opibus-raises-7-5m-to-start-bus-and-motorcycle-mass-production/">raised $7.5 million</a> in pre series A round. The startup raised $5 million in equity and $2.5 million in grants in a round led by Silicon Valley fund At One Ventures, backed by Factor[e] Ventures and pan-African VC firm Ambo Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> hopes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/electric-vehicle-maker-rivian-seeks-to-raise-8-4-billion-in-ipo/">raise up $8.4 billion</a> in its initial public offering, according to a regulatory filing posted this past week. The Amazon-backed company said in the filing that it plans to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also have an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares. If underwriters exercise that option, Rivian would raise as much as $9.6 billion.</p>
<p>Based on the number of outstanding shares, that would put its market valuation at about $53 billion. If employee stock options and other restricted shares are considered, Rivian&#8217;s valuation could be as high as $60 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Spartan Radar</strong>, a biomimetic radar company, closed $15 million in a Series A round led by Prime Movers Lab. Additional investors include 8VC and Mac VC. The round follows a $10 million raise earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>Scale AI</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/scale-ai-acquires-siasearch-to-give-companies-the-same-data-engine-superpowers-that-tesla-has/">acquired SiaSearch</a>, a spinout of European venture studio Merantix that has built a data management platform that acts as a search engine for petabyte-scale data captured by advanced driving assistance and automated driving systems.</p>
<p><strong>Zepto</strong>, a new Indian-based grocery delivery startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/31/indias-zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-founded-by-two-19-year-old-stanford-dropouts-raises-60-million/">raised $60 million</a> in a round led by Glade Brook Capital. Nexus, Y Combinator, Global Founders Capital, as well as angel investors Lachy Groom, Neeraj Arora and Manik Gupta also participated in the round, which values Zepto at $225 million.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note from Kirsten</strong>: After the newsletter was &#8220;put to bed,&#8221; Congress passed President Biden&#8217;s infrastructure bill, mostly along party lines. Expect more details on that next week.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s talk briefly about the <strong>Hertz-Tesla</strong> deal. I know, I can hear you groaning already. One of the things that both Tesla played up was that Hertz is paying sticker price for the 100,000 Teslas it ordered (apparently without a contract, though that&#8217;s another story).</p>
<p>But they likely didn&#8217;t pay full price. In fact, Turo&#8217;s VP of government relations, Lou Bertuca, told me he was 100% certain that Hertz didn&#8217;t pay sticker price, thanks to a tax loophole that allows rental car companies to avoid paying sales tax. He told me that each year states lose out on around $4 billion in taxes due to this loophole.</p>
<p>The sales tax exemption was designed for car resellers, but car rental companies have also been able to benefit from this &#8216;sale for resale exemption.&#8217; &#8220;They&#8217;re buying something tax-free and making lots of money by renting it out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Anytime a car rental company says they&#8217;re paying the same rate as everybody else, the only thing you need to keep in mind is they&#8217;re not paying the sales tax that everybody else is paying, whether they&#8217;re buying a Tesla or Ford.&#8221; (TechCrunch reached out to Hertz for comment.)</p>
<p>Around five or six states are currently reconsidering this loophole, Bertuca said. Of course, Turo, a peer-to-peer marketplace for car rental, has its own dog in this fight. And it&#8217;s important to note that state and local governments can levy taxes on rental car companies that peer-to-peer rental companies (like Turo) are exempt from &#8212; here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/rental-companies-battle-car-sharing-services-over-taxes">good run-down</a> on that battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>In other news, <strong>Canada</strong> said it would &#8220;respond appropriately&#8221; should the U.S. pass the proposed increase for consumer tax incentives for electric vehicles. The country&#8217;s Innovation and Industry Minister <strong>Francois-Philippe Champagne</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-canada-would-respond-us-tax-credits-american-built-evs-minister-2021-11-04/">told Reuters</a> that the proposal &#8212; which would provide an additional $4,500 for EVs made in the U.S. and in union shops and $500 for U.S.-made batteries &#8212; would run contrary to the USMCA trade agreement we have with Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>He joins a growing chorus of foreign auto and auto parts manufacturers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/toyota-honda-urge-congress-to-reject-expanded-tax-incentive-that-would-benefit-ford-gm-stellantis/">including Toyota and Honda</a>, who are opposing the additional funds.</p>
<p>I listened to a <a href="https://apma.ca/2021/10/29/what-buy-american-means-for-canadas-auto-sector/">pretty interesting interview</a> with <strong>Flavio Volpe</strong>, president of Canada&#8217;s Automotive Parts Manufacturers&#8217; Association, who made the case that &#8216;American-made&#8217; is ultimately a nice political slogan that doesn&#8217;t accurately reflect dynamics on the ground. He noted that $9 billion worth of auto parts are exported from Michigan for assembly in Ontario &#8212; parts that would go into cars that would be excluded from the additional incentive, should it pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really in our business, we operate as if there&#8217;s no border, because there hasn&#8217;t been,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If you have a spare 20 minutes, I encourage you to listen to the entire interview. It definitely made me think about the automotive supply chain in a new way.</p>

<p>Just a quick little note that I&#8217;ve been meaning to share. Remember Starsky Robotics? This was the self-driving trucks startup that shut down in March 2020 as competition and consolidation in the industry heated up.</p>
<p>Co-founder and former CEO Stefan Seltz-Axmacher is back with a stealth startup focused on robotics and autonomy, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanseltzaxmacher/">according to his profile in LinkedIn</a>. Next to it, he states &#8220;More info soon!&#8221;</p>

<h3>ADAS</h3>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> voluntarily recalled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/tesla-recalls-11704-vehicles-after-identifying-full-self-driving-beta-software-error/">nearly 11,704 vehicles</a> after identifying a software error that could cause a false forward-collision warning or unexpected activation of the automatic emergency brake system, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration said.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong> was busy this week. The company held an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/cruise-lays-out-its-plan-for-how-it-will-make-robotaxis-a-reality/"> &#8220;Under the Hood&#8221; event</a> that was meant, besides a recruiting activity, to lay out its technical and development road map. CTO and co-founder <strong>Kyle Vogt</strong> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmvZBiWYkFQ">YouTube video</a> of his driverless ride and late Friday the company filed an application for the CPUC Driverless Deployment Permit, as well as the accompanying required Passenger Safety Plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cruise has hit another important milestone today as the first company to apply for the final state permit required to launch an autonomous ride-hail service in California. Our accompanying Passenger Safety Plan outlines the safety and accessibility measures passengers can expect from start to finish in our AVs &#8212;- a critical facet of our overall, holistic approach to safety at Cruise,&#8221; Prashanthi Raman, head of global government affairs at Cruise, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p><strong>Embark</strong> announced a partnership with Luminar to equip its truck fleet with Luminar&#8217;s long-range radar. Embark says this partnership will help the company as it tries to achieve commercial deployment and delivery of its 14,200 non-binding truck reservations in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Loyola Marymount University</strong> and its dining platform have partnered with autonomous robot delivery company Kiwibot to deliver meals across the university campus.</p>
<p><strong>Waymo</strong> announced plans to manually drive its vehicles to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/waymo-self-driving-vehicles-are-headed-to-nyc-for-a-mapping-operation/">map areas of New York City</a> and then use all of that data to advance its technology.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong> confirmed that reservations for the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-reservations-surpass-160000/">surpassed 160,000</a>, less than six months after its debut. But remember, refundable $100 pre-orders are not the same as purchases! Let&#8217;s see how many that the leap this coming spring.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Group</strong> has spent the last week delivering its Air electric vehicle to customers. The company also opened up its 11th store (it calls them &#8220;studios) in Washington DC.</p>
<p><strong>Nikola Corp.</strong>, the electric truck developer, is in talks with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/nikola-sets-aside-125-million-to-settle-with-sec/">pay a $125 million</a> civil penalty as part of an ongoing probe by the regulator into whether the company mislead investors.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong>, the electric automaker that recently filed for an IPO, was sued by a former sales and marketing vice president for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/rivian-hit-with-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-that-alleges-toxic-bro-culture/">alleged gender discrimination</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Laura Schwab, a former sales and marketing executive who had a long employment history with Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin before joining Rivian in November 2020, was fired after reporting gender discrimination to the company&#8217;s human resources department.</p>
<h3>In-car tech and sensors</h3>
<p><strong>BMW</strong> is going to ship some models without touchscreen functionality because of the global chip shortage, according to BMW enthusiast forum <a href="https://www.bimmerfest.com/threads/major-option-restriction-announcement.1420312/">Bimmerfest</a>. The infotainment system will still work, but BMW has removed touch functionality from the central display.</p>
<p><strong>Kneron</strong> launched its first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/kneron-releases-its-first-automotive-grade-chip-for-adas-and-av-systems/">automotive-grade chip</a> &#8212; fueled by funds from Foxconn, Alibaba, Sequoia, Horizons Ventures and Qualcomm &#8212; that it says could revolutionize the path to vehicle autonomy.</p>
<p><strong>Velodyne Lidar</strong> named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/theodore-tewksbury-to-take-over-as-velodyne-ceo/">Theodore Tewksbury as its new CEO</a>, the most recent in a string of changes to Velodyne&#8217;s C-suite since the beginning of this year. Tewksbury was the CEO of Eta Compute, a company that develops edge vision sensors. As you might recall, the company has been without a CEO for several months, after Velodyne announced the departure of Anand Gopalan in July.</p>
<h3>Ride-hailing</h3>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> posted earnings this week.</p>
<p>Lyft kicked things off with news that it reached <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/lyft-reports-adjusted-profitability-as-revenue-per-rider-rises/">adjusted profitability</a> as riders returned to the U.S. ride-hailing company&#8217;s service. Lyft reported revenues of $864.4 million in the third quarter, a 73% pop from the $499.7 million in the same year-ago period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uber squeaked out $8 million worth of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/uber-squeaks-tiny-adjusted-profit-in-q3-despite-2-4b-net-loss/">adjusted EBITDA</a> &#8212; a very modified profit metric &#8212; while still posting net losses of more than $2 billion. Uber&#8217;s gross bookings (or the value of all goods and services that flowed through its platform) totaled $23.1 billion, up 57% on a year-over-year basis. That figure translated to revenues of $4.8 billion, up 72% compared to the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>To be clear, while adjusted EBITDA is one metric of profitability it&#8217;s not the grown-up GAAP profitability. Still, it&#8217;s a noteworthy milestone for these businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sneaker fit startup, <a href="https://neatsy.ai/">Neatsy.ai</a>, has snagged $1 million in seed funding after a b2b pivot. Investors in the round include Cabra VC, Flyer One VC and some unnamed business angels.</p>
<p>The US startup, which was founded back in March 2019 by Artem Semyanov (the former head of the machine learning team at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/prisma-labs-raises-6-7m-for-its-ai-powered-approach-to-visual-editing/">Prism Labs</a>), is now fully focused on selling its fit-tech to e-tailers via an SDK.</p>
<p>Neasty&#8217;s approach relies on 3D scanning technology found in the iPhone X or later (aka, the TruthDepth camera for FaceID) &#8212; so (currently) it only works for a subset of iOS users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230412" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The AI has also only been trained to provide personalized fit recommendations for a handful of sneaker brands at this stage: Namely <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nike, Jordan, Converse, Adidas, Reebok, Yeezy, Puma, New Balance, Asics, Under Armor and Vans.</span></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s eyeing expanding its fit recommendations with the seed funding.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4TUI95yW8w"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/neatsy-wants-to-reduce-sneaker-returns-with-3d-foot-scans/">Neatsy wants to reduce sneaker returns with 3D foot scans</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Neatsy wants to reduce sneaker returns with 3D foot scans&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/neatsy-wants-to-reduce-sneaker-returns-with-3d-foot-scans/embed/#?secret=4TUI95yW8w" data-secret="4TUI95yW8w" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For those who can tap into its tool, Neatsy claims the tech measures the foot with an accuracy of 1-2 millimetres (it also flags that all scanning takes place on the user&#8217;s device itself to maintain privacy).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For its b2b mode</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">l, Neasty is monetizing SDK usage based on the number of users &#8212; setting a price per Monthly Active User.</span></p>
<p>And for e-tailers it touts an average drop of 39% in shoe returns as online shoppers are able to get a virtual gauge on the best fit and so will be able to pick a better sized pair of kicks for their feet &#8212; which it also claims translates into a 20% increase in ARPU (or an additional $0.5/month per user).</p>
<p>So far it has two ecommerce marketplaces/fashion industry enterprises signed up to use its tech &#8212; driving its annual revenue (ARR) to hit $120k over the past year.</p>
<p>It also slates a number of ongoing pilots that it&#8217;s hoping will convert into paying customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the paying clients are currently in Europe, we also see great potential in the further rollout to European markets&#8230; as Germany, the UK, France are home for great sportswear and fashion companies, as well as for large online fashion marketplaces. As well as thousands of SMB shops and brands for whom we are developing an entry-tier product,&#8221; says Semyanov.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also looking at the US market, as we currently have several brands testing our tech (yet for free) but we are optimistic here. Probably you remember Nike was announcing the launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/with-new-fit-technology-nike-calls-itself-a-tech-company/">Nike Fit app a couple of years</a> ago but somehow it never saw the light of day. We would be happy to help them with our tech (kidding, or not).&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as pushing to sign up more e-tailers, Neasty plans to use the seed funding to dial up its product development. On that front, Semyanov says it&#8217;s looking to diversify the range of supported footwear &#8212; to include formal shoes and children&#8217;s footwear.</p>
<p>He says it&#8217;s also trying to hone its AI to be able to pick up on specific foot conditions &#8212; such as detecting flat feet and hyperpronation.</p>
<p>Launching versions of the tech for the web and Android is also on the cards, as 3D depth cameras have proliferated over the past few years &#8212; with a number of Android smartphone also packing this kind of camera hardware (such as Samsung&#8217;s DepthVision tech).</p>
<p>The seed fund will also go on simplifying the product integration process and building a customer success team, per Semyanov.</p>
<p>Asked about potential orthopaedics use-cases, Semyanov says Neasty got interested in how the 3D measurements could help with conditions like Pronation/Supination after being contacted by the NFL&#8217;s San Francisco 49ers last year.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;[The 49ers were] interested in whether we could test the newcomers of pronation and supination, because it’s extremely important for future players. Turns out that Pronation is the main factor in injuries in running sports. We were unable to help SF49ers at the time, and never thought of this feature before. We started looking into the topic and after some testing and research we concluded that we actually could make it work,&#8221; he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;If you look at the feet from the side, you could distinguish whether it is pronated or supinated, and we &#8216;look&#8217; at the feet with the camera measuring depth and distance therefore we could teach the algorithm to identify that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is for sure going to be one of a few next developments for Neatsy’s product,&#8221; Semyanov adds. &#8220;We are currently consulting with the orthopediologist and it seems that this is a huge problem not only for professional sportsmen but for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smartphone cameras are already powering plenty of activity (and investor activity) in the digital health space &#8212; with a number of startups focused on using camera-based tracking to help with musculoskeletal disorders for example (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/kaia-health-grabs-75m-on-surging-interest-in-its-virtual-therapies-for-chronic-pain-and-copd/">Kaia Health</a>).</p>
<p>Returning to retail use-cases, Semyanov says Neatsy.ai is also considering expanding to support fit for specialist kit such as ski and snowboard equipment &#8212; given that ski shoes tend to be pricey (&#8220;and it’s always painful for people to misunderstand the size&#8221;).</p>
<p>But in the near term he says the focus will be on adding fit recommendations for kids&#8217; shoes, given the size/fit issue can be especially tough for little growing feet.</p>
<p>It does also have ecommerce-related ambitions beyond feet too &#8212; if it can get 3D-scanning to work for other retail use-cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always say that in the future all the sizes or size charts will become obsolete, and only ‘Your Size’ will exist for each customer. With the help of our algorithm, it is gonna happen with the shoes and we’ll see if it could be applied to clothes and eyewear as well,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.jumo.world/">JUMO</a>, a South Africa- and London-based company that offers financial services to entrepreneurs and businesses in emerging markets, has raised $120 million in a new round of funding led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company. The company is now valued at $400 million, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/emerging-markets-loan-start-up-jumo-gets-120m-lift-pzvdcwwmt">according</a> to The Times.</p>
<p>The round, which marks Fidelity’s first investment in an African company, also saw the participation from fintech giant Visa and London-based investment management firm Kingsway Capital. It is also coming a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/south-african-fintech-startup-jumo-raises-second-50m-vc-round/">raising $55 million</a> in a similar unnamed financing round.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In total, JUMO has raised more than $200 million in equity and debt rounds from backers such as Brook Asset Management, Finnfund, Proparco, Leapfrog and Goldman Sachs since founder and CEO <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/andrew-watkins-ball-32451996">Andrew Watkins-Ball</a> launched the company in 2015.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech, which refers to itself as a banking-as-a-service platform, says it uses AI to power financial services, particularly lending in emerging markets where over 1.7 billion people do not have basic access to financial services, 42% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are unbanked and only 11% of adults are under credit bureau coverage in Africa.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To meet these constraining needs in both markets, JUMO offers core products around savings, credit to customers and businesses, as well as infrastructure to banks, fintechs and eMoney operators. Some partners include MTN, Airtel, Tigo, Ecobank, Absa, Letshego, Mansa Bank and Telenor.</p>
<p>When JUMO raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/jumo-raises-52m-led-by-goldman/">its $52 million</a> in 2018, it opened an office in Singapore to enter Asia, but the company seems to have closed shop there based on information from its statement. Presently, the fintech only states Cape Town, Nairobi, Porto and London as its primary operational and tech hubs.</p>
<p>In terms of active operational markets, though, the fintech is present in six African markets &#8212; Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Ivory Coast and South Asian country Pakistan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, JUMO has served loans worth over $3.5 billion to more than 18 million customers across these markets, granting up to 120 million individual loans.</p>
<p>According to the current number of eMoney subscribers on its platform with access to loans, JUMO says it has an opportunity to disburse $29 billion a year. The company adds that this number can grow to $40 billion when it expands to Nigeria and Cameroon in 2022.</p>
<p>The company’s operational costs also strengthen this assertion. JUMO claims to have lowered its costs to $1/customer per year, which gives it some advantage to scale efficiently across a total addressable market of 150 million customers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;South African fintech startup Jumo raises second $50M+ VC round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/south-african-fintech-startup-jumo-raises-second-50m-vc-round/embed/#?secret=cxH0p4NlT8" data-secret="cxH0p4NlT8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity participation in JUMO’s round continues a growing list of first-time US investors who have made their first checks in African tech this year, especially fintech. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Avenir Growth Capital’s co-lead round in Flutterwave</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/">SoftBank’s backing of Opay</a> come to mind.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s exciting to be part of the wave of US capital being invested in payments and fintech on the continent – there are some great businesses being built and we are proud to play a role supporting capital providers to reach customers with great products,” said Watkins-Ball in a statement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The founder says JUMO is focused on making it easier for capital providers to reach new customers at affordable prices. The six-year-old company also wants to help banks make “predictable returns” by providing a full range of infrastructure and services from core banking to underwriting, KYC (know your customer) and fraud detection services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2019, the total bank capital and assets under management deployed on JUMO’s platform has increased to 160%, which signifies the platform’s importance to these financial institutions.</p>
<p>Asides from the expansion into Nigeria and Cameroon, JUMO says it will use the investment to improve and increase the number of financial products it offers to small and medium businesses. It also plans to provide longer-term lending options for merchants and bigger businesses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“JUMO’s lending platform is highly attractive in its ability to scale across markets and drive financial inclusion by creating access to credit for consumers and small businesses,” said Melissa McSherry, the global head of Risk and Identity Services at Visa in a statement. “We are excited about our investment in JUMO and are looking forward to accelerating adoption of JUMO’s platform across markets and delivering on Visa’s mission of helping individuals, businesses, and economies to thrive.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">South Korean firms <a href="https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/about-us/business-overview/">Samsung Electronics</a> and <a href="https://www.skhynix.com/">SK Hynix</a> will disclose some semiconductor data to the U.S. government, the South Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a <a href="https://www.moef.go.kr/nw/nes/detailNesDtaView.do?searchBbsId1=MOSFBBS_000000000028&amp;searchNttId1=MOSF_000000000057293&amp;menuNo=4010100">statement</a> released on Sunday by the finance ministry, South Korea-based chipmakers are preparing for a “voluntary submission” to hand over their internal data to the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Samsung and SK Hynix, however, will not provide any sensitive information to protect trade secrets as they submit the data to Washington, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/south-korean-chip-firms-omit-detailed-data-response-us-request-sources-2021-11-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Reuters said</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. Local media also <a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/1017991.html">reported</a> that the world’s two largest memory chipmakers would “partially comply” with Washington. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230353" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The U.S. Department of Commerce asked global semiconductor manufacturers and automakers on 23 September to “voluntarily” fill out a questionnaire about the supply chain pertaining to their chip inventory, sales, orders, customers’ information and more. They have to submit it by a Nov. 8 deadline.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We have other tools in our toolbox that require them to give us data. I hope we don’t get there. But if we have to, we will” if companies did not respond to the voluntary request, U.S Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-commerce-chief-aggressive-action-chips-shortage-needed-2021-09-23/">an interview</a> with Reuters in September. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Raimondo said that the goal of its voluntary request for information is to increase transparency to identify bottlenecks in the global supply chain and predict challenges amid a global semiconductor shortage. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The global chip shortage has harmed several sectors, including cars, computers, phones, and appliances. In April, global tech and automobile executives had </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a meeting </span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">at the White House to discuss solutions for the worldwide chip shortage. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There seems to be no other choice for semiconductor companies but to abide by the request, according to industry sources who wished to remain anonymous. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Korean chipmakers have discussed the data submission issue with the South Korean government, as per the Ministry of Economy and Finance statement.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The South Korean government will strengthen the semiconductor supply chain partnership with the U.S. and continue close communications with the U.S. counterpart after the deadline on 8 November, the South Korean finance ministry said. </span></p>
<p>In October, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker, said it had already <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-07/tsmc-withholds-customer-specific-data-in-answering-u-s-request">submitted</a> its answers to the U.S. <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4302207">without including</a> customers&#8217; detailed information.</p>
<p>Samsung and SK Hynix did not respond to requests for comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BrightChamps, an Indian edtech startup that is attempting to bridge the learning gap left by K12 schools, said on Monday it has raised $51 million in a new financing round and $63 million since launching a year ago as the Goa-headquartered firm looks to expand its footprints in over 10 nations.</p>
<p>The startup, which is valued at nearly $500 million in the new financing round led by Premji Invest (the private investment office of technology billionaire Azim Premji), teaches kids programming and other skills in over 10 markets including several in Southeast Asia, as well as the U.S., and Canada, <a href="https://brightchamps.com">BrightChamps</a> co-founder and chief executive Ravi Bhushan told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Bhushan, who was homeschooled and previously served as the chief technology and product officer at property portal PropTiger, said schools across the world are failing to teach kids several important life skills. &#8220;It&#8217;s not an India problem. Schools across the globe are teaching kids how to change the style of text in Microsoft Word in the name of technology,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230320" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup &#8212; which has amassed over a hundred thousand registered students, and achieved profitability &#8212; is &#8220;building a &#8216;weapon of mass instruction&#8217; and is leading the disruptive wave which will make India one of the largest exporters of transformative digital education,&#8221; said Deborah Quazo, Managing partner at GSV Ventures, in a statement. TechCrunch reported in July that BrightChamps was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">engaging with investors</a> to raise money at over $500 million valuation.</p>
<p>Over a thousand teachers across the globe have joined BrightChamps to teach kids, Bhushan said. &#8220;Children have the option to learn skills in any local language they prefer,&#8221; he said, adding that the startup is working to expand its offerings. It will soon add financial literacy to its curriculum, he said.</p>
<p>Bhushan said the startup&#8217;s growth has been completely organic so far and it has not used any money raised from the investors. &#8220;We are growing solely with the money we have earned from our customers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>BrightChamps has been one of the most talked startups in India in the past one year and has already been approached by one of the largest edtech giants in the country with a buyout offer, TechCrunch has learned.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which spoke for the first time last week after TechCrunch approached it to confirm the funding round, said it intended to announce its offerings and earlier financing round last year, but decided against it because it didn&#8217;t want to celebrate a milestone at a time when the home nation was trying to fight the pandemic.</p>
<p>Bhushan declined to comment on any acquisition offer BrightChamps has received, but said he is building the startup with a very long-term vision and is not looking to make short-term transactions. &#8220;Education, as you can tell, has been my passion since the childhood. I am here to build an iconic brand,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a significant whitespace in the category in which BrightChamps operates, he said, when asked how the startup plans to deploy the fresh funds. &#8220;One area is the potential of kids learning from each other. We have done experiments around it. So we are going to launch a peer-to-peer experience,&#8221; he said, adding that eventually the startup wants to build a platform like Stack Overflow for kids. &#8220;We are also looking to host olympiads and tech hackathons,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>BrightChamps is also exploring opportunities to acquire some firms that share its mission and sensibilities, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In less than a year after inception Brightchamps has established itself as one of the fastest growing Ed tech companies in the markets that it serves . Leveraging Human Resources globally to deliver personalised experiences, along with an unique ability to hyper differentiate learning pathways, Brightchamps is on the path to proving that the power of data and learning can be combined for differentiated outcomes,” said T Kurien, Managing Partner of Premji Invest, in a statement.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is in the fight for its life, but it won&#8217;t be the regulatory pressure that will kill it. Zuckerberg is leaning heavily on “metaverse” as a lifeboat to save a declining user base. He has long known that the future of Facebook is rooted in owning a major hardware platform.</p>
<p>Facebook’s brand pivot to “Meta” last week week is the third inning of a multibillion dollar game of balance sheet roulette. Let&#8217;s see if consumers adopt and make it a reality — all of Meta/Facebook is at stake.</p>
<p>As an investor in VR and AR since 2016, I find it cautiously encouraging to hear all the talk of “metaverse” on trending business channels today. Could this really be the time for VR?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The most valuable companies in the world own the metal on which their software applications run: Apple and Microsoft have had their fingers in the hardware pie for years, and even Google was able to build a robust OS business with Android. Facebook’s billion-dollar acquisition of Oculus in 2014 more than showed Zuck’s hand, though it would be another seven years until the pivot actually happened.</p>
<p>In the years directly after the Oculus acquisition, there was a flurry of investment in VR across the industry. Hardware platforms from Google, Microsoft, Sony, HTC, Steam and others were announced with great fanfare, though these investments were largely scrapped or defunded a few years later, leaving a dearth of VR hardware platform options.</p>
<p>This is when Facebook struck. It upped its investment in the Oculus/Reality Labs platform, innovating to create high-quality mobile VR hardware devices, started seeding game developers with capital and voraciously acquired the most engaging games on their platform. Taking a developer ecosystem approach through acquisition is a long-play investment to solve the cold-start content problem that all of these VR platforms faced.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg started with gaming, because it&#8217;s the earliest category of high-engagement consumer excitement and growth, thus turning up the temperature on consumer comfortability in a headset. Next, Zuck is moving VR/AR into the enterprise to drive hands-on, 3D collaboration by remote teams to a distributed workforce readied through the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lucky or good, he is known as a prescient strategist. He has displayed excellent strategy in response to market movements and timing, not all of which he controlled.</p>
<p>The “metaverse” already exists in Fortnite and Roblox. Zuck is betting we want fully immersive experiences through head-worn computers and can drive an older user base.</p>
<p>If Facebook’s acquisition history is a guide, Zuckerberg’s strategy will find success, though Facebook’s most successful acquisitions, including WhatsApp and Instagram, were already proven social successes at the time they were acquired. Going all in on the “metaverse” is creating a new platform and paradigm that has been woefully slow to find adoption despite multiple hype cycles over 30 years of excitement.</p>
<p>Given the balance sheet, this will likely work — but today, it’s still a master stroke of strategy and opportunity existing in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Like every industry or craft, diplomacy — a world once dominated by protocol and platitudes, maps and chaps — has already been hugely disrupted by digital technology.</p>
<p>Also like many professions, the most visible impact has been on the tools: better kit, better comms (internal and external), faster pace.

<p>Ten years ago this fall, I was posted as Her Majesty&#8217;s envoy to Lebanon. At 36, I was young for the role. The Arab Spring was firing up young people across the region and I wondered if technological change could transform the way statecraft engaged with people. I began experimenting with what we started to call (after a few clunky options like &#8220;Twiplomacy&#8221;) &#8220;digital diplomacy.&#8221; A decade on, digital diplomacy has already moved through several phases — three in fact — and stands on the threshold of a fourth. Much has been achieved. But if it is to succeed in putting more streetcraft into statecraft, we must take into account what we did right and wrong.</p>
<p>The first phase was a brave new world. With its 21st-century statecraft program under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the U.S. State Department led a period of excitement and optimism about the way that diplomats could use the new tools of communication and connection. For the ambassadors of that era who genuinely adopted and adapted, these were heady times. The rules from capitals were loose: One minister told me that he didn’t care what I tried as long as it stayed out of the U.K. media. Many of us were able to proceed until apprehended. There were plenty of mistakes. And risks: The smartphone I tweeted relentlessly from was also the device that terrorists used to track my movements.</p>
<p>But this was a period when we could surprise people with a desire to connect, engage and show some humility. It seemed possible to imagine that social media would open up societies and promote real agency and freedom. One British ambassador drank so much of the Kool-Aid that he even suggested that the most powerful weapon in the Middle East was the smartphone. I was wrong about that, so far.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The second phase was the institutionalization of digital diplomacy. We started to create structures around the wider dialogue between the old emperors and the new. Worried by the implications for geopolitics of the pace of technological change, I left the U.K. government to try to make the case for the urgency of this effort. After my 2017 <a href="https://www.unitednetworks.ae/">report</a> on the United Nations, the U.N. launched an effort for Big Tech and government to talk <em>to</em> rather than <em>past</em> each other. Both the U.N.’s High Level Panel and the Global Tech Panel were genuine and effective attempts to translate between those disrupting global politics, economics and society and those nominally still in charge, an alternative to trying to summon the Zuckerbergs before parliamentary or congressional committees. In <a href="https://tomfletcher.global/publications/details/8">&#8220;The Naked Diplomat,&#8221;</a> I had proposed that countries should appoint &#8220;tech ambassadors.&#8221; The Danes went for it, with success, challenging the tech companies to engage with states in a veritable dialogue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, foreign ministries adjusted to social media far more quickly than to any previous technology. Having been one of only four U.K. ambassadors on Twitter in 2011, within a few years all but four were, with some like John Casson in Egypt amassing over <a href="https://twitter.com/johncassonuk?lang=en">one million followers</a>. For a profession without many ways to assess impact, there was real willingness to experiment with social media. I spoke at over 20 conferences of ambassadors, urging colleagues to give it a try, show the human behind the handle and engage (rather than transmit). I used to tell them it was like the largest diplomatic reception they could imagine: Don’t stand at the margins, say nothing or bellow across the room. Yes, there were risks. But the biggest risks were not to be in the conversation.</p>
<p>As more adopted this approach, foreign ministries faced new trade-offs over agility versus confidentiality of their communication. My 2016 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-fco-report">review</a> of the Foreign Office recommended a pivot toward the former: Perhaps Sir Kim Darroch, the outstanding U.K. ambassador driven out by former President Trump over his leaked cables, might subsequently have disagreed. But we are now reliant on that ability to communicate at speed.</p>
<p>Diplomacy over the last two years would have been unimaginable without Zoom and WhatsApp. For a profession that used to do everything to minimize direct contacts between leaders, diplomats were quick to embrace videoconferencing once the tech made it a serious option. The pandemic drove summits and conferences online, saving enormous amounts of carbon with little obvious negative impact on the outcomes.</p>
<p>The third phase overlapped with the second: the empire struck back. Authoritarian governments found new ways to use digital technology to suppress freedom. Trump exploited Twitter to fire up xenophobia, prejudice and insurrection. More creatively he also used it — as at home — to court potential allies and to pressure diplomatic opponents. Meanwhile, Russia’s Vladimir Putin weaponized the internet against democracy and built troll factories. Twitter mobs made it harder to share the nuance of complex diplomatic positions, let alone use social media to reach compromise and common ground. Polarization was clickbait and the center did not hold. Governments realized that cyber was the new battleground and started to think in terms of defense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Big Tech grew, morphing in some cases into entities more powerful and sometimes more reactionary than governments. Mischievously I had wondered aloud in 2013 whether we should ask Google to be on the U.N. Security Council. Google might now ask why it should bother. While Big Tech grew and flexed its muscles, it quietly recruited the talent, depriving governments of human capital as well as taxes. Symbolically, and perhaps inevitably, the (excellent) first Danish tech ambassador was poached by Microsoft and Britain’s Liberal Democrat leader was poached by Facebook. As the legal arms race intensified, the EU’s titanic clashes with Big Tech over data or incitement were a long way from the idealism of the brave new world phase, when we genuinely believed that we could solve more problems together.</p>
<p>Where does this leave us today? I am now more of a realist about technology and diplomacy, but I remain an optimistic one. We can still crack challenges together, including the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>. But to do so, governments must be more honest about what they can’t do alone. Tech needs more patience to stick with slower moving and often clumsy states, and more honesty about where it has become part of the problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, diplomats can continue to use technology to make them more effective: My research group at New York University worked on wearable technology to help a diplomat read a room; a Diplopedia to do a better job of conserving diplomatic records; and intelligent and transparent use of sentiment mining to better understand public opinion. I stand by the hypothesis that the more oversight the public has of issues of war, the more peaceful government policy will be. Perhaps one of the most exciting areas for diplomacy will be the potential to combine it with the latest advances in collective psychology and social media to make peace between societies rather than between states, and between nations and their histories.</p>
<p>The next phase of digital diplomacy should also see work on the next great peace processes: with the planet, with Big Tech, between young and old, between hosts and migrant communities, and ultimately maybe with technology itself. I think digital diplomacy can help us deliver better outcomes on each of those.</p>
<p>Finally, this next phase of digital diplomacy will see diplomats returning to the basics of the craft. We’ll need a more focused effort to develop citizen diplomats, equipped with vital diplomatic skills like empathy and emotional intelligence: Education is therefore upstream diplomacy. As <a href="https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2021/10/29/how-to-save-multilateralism/">I’ve proposed elsewhere</a>, we’ll need an old school pen and paper effort to rewrite the global rules for protection of our freedoms in an online world. We’ll need embassies to escape from the confines of buildings and return to their original mission as groups of people sent to connect. And we’ll need diplomats who can still do what Edward Murrow called the &#8220;last three feet,&#8221; that crucial human connection that will be the last diplomatic skill to be automated.</p>
<p>That is an exciting and urgent agenda. If diplomacy did not exist we would need to invent it. But now we need to <em>reinvent</em> it. And that is too important to leave to diplomats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">H2O.ai &#8212; a startup that has developed an open-source framework as well as proprietary apps that make it easier for any kind of enterprise to build and operate artificial intelligence-based services &#8212; has seen a surge of interest as AI applications have become more ubiquitous, and enterprises beyond tech companies want to get in on the action. Now, it has raised $100 million to fuel its growth, a round of funding that values H2O.ai at $1.7 billion post-money ($1.6 billion pre-money).</p>
<p>This is a Series E round, and it&#8217;s being led by a strategic backer, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), which has been a customer of the startup and will be using the backing to kick off a deeper partnership between the two to build new services. Others in the round include Goldman Sachs, Pivot Investment Partners, Crane Venture Partners and Celesta Capital. Further plans for the funding include building more products for H2O.ai as a whole, and hiring more talent to continue expanding the company&#8217;s H2O AI Hybrid Cloud platform.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a customer has led a round as a strategic backer: in 2019, Goldman Sachs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/h20-ai-announces-72-5m-series-d-led-by-goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led the company&#8217;s Series D of $72.5 million</a>. As a sign of how the company has been growing, and the general appetite for what it does, H2O&#8217;s valuation has leapfrogged since that last round, when it was valued at $400 million, per <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/55882-36/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. Mountain View-based H2O.ai has raised $246.5 million to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230290" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The fact that both of the last rounds have been led by big banks that are also customers of H2O.ai&#8217;s speaks a lot to where the opportunity has been for the startup. Sri Ambati, the founder and CEO (who previously was also a co-founder of Platfora, which was acquired by Workday), told me over email that about 40% of the company&#8217;s revenues currently come from the very wide and all-encompassing world of financial services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Retail banking, credit cards, payments &#8212; almost every payment system from PayPal to MasterCard are customers of H2O,&#8221; he said. On the equities side, companies power fixed income, asset management, and mortgage backed security services using H2O&#8217;s technology, with MarketAxess, Franklin Templeton, and BNY Mellon also &#8220;strong&#8221; customers, he said.</p>
<p>That is also seeing a growing complement of business from other verticals, he added: Unilever, Reckitt P&amp;G are among those in consumer goods; UPS is one of its users in logistics and delivery; Chipotle is among those in food services; and he said that AT&amp;T &#8220;is one of our largest customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Covid-19 has had a role to play here, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Manufacturing became a fast-growing vertical due to supply chain disruption and demand sensing,&#8221; he said of the pandemic. &#8220;We launched H2O AI Health to help our hospitals and providers, payers like Aetna and pharma customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, H2O.ai is also now breaking ground into working more with other tech companies that want to build more AI into their own workflows to in turn provide services to their own customers. &#8220;Our latest wins are in vertical clouds and SaaS ISVs,&#8221; Ambati said.</p>
<p>The company has offered an open source component to its services, which it calls simply <a href="https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H2O</a>, from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/09/h2o-ai-raises-20m-for-its-open-source-machine-learning-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earliest days</a>, and that is now used by over 20,000 enterprises. Part of the reason for that is its flexibility: H2O.ai says that its open source framework works both on top of existing big data infrastructure, on bare metal or on top of existing Hadoop, Spark or Kubernetes clusters and is able to ingest data directly from HDFS, Spark, S3, Azure Data Lake or any other data source into it’s in-memory distributed key-value store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our open source platform gives freedom and ability for customers to build their own AI centers of competence and excellence,&#8221; Ambati said of the open source tools. &#8220;We are like the Tenzing Sherpas of the AI mountains helping our customers to traverse and conquer AI peaks.&#8221;</p>
<p>That framework can be used by engineers to build customized applications, while H2O.ai&#8217;s proprietary tools provide more completed applications in areas like fraud detection, churn prediction, anomaly detection, price optimization and credit scoring &#8212; areas that can benefit from the ingestion of massive amounts of data in order to gain better insights into what might happen next: these sit either as a complement to what human analysts and data scientists might be able to unearth, or potentially, in some cases, as a replacement for the more basic work they might do. In all, there are currently some 45 applications in all.</p>
<p>The plan, Ambati said, is to over time build out more of these, which will reside in &#8220;app stores&#8221; in specific verticals offering a range of its proprietary, pre-built tools particular to the demands of each of them.</p>
<p>The trend fueling H2O.ai&#8217;s growth has been gaining momentum for several years now.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for the world of enterprise IT: used well, tools like machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision can speed up productivity, or even open up completely new areas of opportunity for an organization. Over time, it can save companies billions of dollars in operational and other costs.</p>
<p>One big issue, however, is that in many cases, organizations might lack the internal teams to build or carry through projects that use AI, and that&#8217;s before considering the fact that as needs and parameters evolve all of that infrastructure will need updating, too. Technology touches everything in an enterprise these days, but not every enterprise is a tech company.</p>
<p>H2O.ai is not the first or only startup that has aimed to fill this gap in the market, although it seems to have managed its task a little more successfully than others.</p>
<p>Notably, Element.AI out of Canada was built out on the back of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/13/element-ai-raises-151m-on-a-600-700m-valuation-to-help-companies-build-and-run-ai-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large amount of funding and buy-in</a> from big tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia also to address the idea of democratizing AI for the wider world of enterprises that might lack the resources to build and run AI tools themselves, but could very much benefit from them before their businesses simply get cannibalized by the many AI-fuelled tech companies moving into their spaces. It had a strong focus on integration (it was a little like an Accenture for AI services) but never managed to make a big enough jump from concept to business and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/servicenow-is-acquiring-element-ai-the-canadian-startup-building-ai-services-for-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually acquired</a>, in 2020, by ServiceNow to complement its own efforts to build tools for businesses.</p>
<p>Ambati said that only about 10% of H2O.ai&#8217;s business is in the area of services, with the remainder, 90%, coming from its products, as an explanation for why one startup&#8217;s approach worked while another did not.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is easy to get lured by services in data science and AI,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Being true to our product maker culture and yet building deep customer empathy and listening is critical to success. Customers experience our maker culture and become makers themselves. We are continuously making our software easier (democratizing) low-code, reusable recipes and automation through AI Cloud and building data pipelines, AI AppStores and delivering AI as a service that our customers can use to improve their customer experiences, brands and communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big difference &#8212; we are raising a forest, not just a tree. H2O AI Cloud, H2O Wave our low-code Application Development, H2O AI AppStores, Marketplace and H2O-3 Open Source ML are at the core of AI Applications and software already and we are partnering with customers and their ecosystem of partners and developers.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a play, and business, resonating well with investors, too,</p>
<p>“Commonwealth Bank has a significant asset in the millions of data points collected every day. AI already has helped us to improve our customer experience, however, we know there is untapped potential to do more,&#8221; said Matt Comyn, CEO of CBA, in a statement. &#8220;The investment in and strategic partnership with H2O.ai extends our leadership in artificial intelligence and ultimately boosts the bank’s ability to offer leading digital propositions and reimagined products and services to customers.&#8221; Dr. Andrew McMullan, chief data and analytics officer at CBA, will join the H2O.ai board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>Indiegogo, an early startup that capitalized on the crowdfunding movement, will begin more closely screening crowdfunding campaigns on its platform,<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22757421/indiegogo-crowdfunding-campaign-screening-fraud-gofundme"> it announced this week.</a></p>
<p>The Verge says that the company created an internal review board to oversee and evaluate the riskiest campaigns on its platform, as determined by its community of backers. This board can ban owners from launching campaigns or just enforce broader terms of service to ensure legitimacy. The startup also made an alliance with its chief rival, crowdfunding platform GoFundMe, to create a new entity for best practices and to remove bad actors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230164" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here’s a key excerpt from the story by <a href="https://twitter.com/SocialKimLy">Kim Lyons</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Candidly, we have not always lived up to our backers’ expectations,” said Will Haines, vice president of product and customer trust at Indiegogo. When the company launched in 2008, there were few restrictions on would-be entrepreneurs seeking to raise money from like-minded backers. But Haines says that “open” isn’t what the crowdfunding community really wants now, more than a decade later.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to lie, I was a little surprised this didn’t get more attention on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1455937547268288512">despite my best efforts)</a>. While I’m not in the business of theorizing why that was, I do have the luxury of asking people questions about their thoughts, retweets be damned. My immediate question for folks was, &#8220;What does Indiegogo’s new stance mean for the broader crowdfunding market?&#8221; After all, the ecosystem is built on access, optionality and turning scrappy ideas into actual products. So, I crowdsourced some thoughts!</p>
<p>Republic, a crowdfunding platform that recently raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/republic-may-build-a-secondary-exchange-for-digital-securities-fueled-by-150-million-in-new-funding/">$150 million Series B</a>, isn’t a direct competitor because it focuses more on equity crowdfunding campaigns versus Indiegogo’s specialty of rewards-based and donation-based crowdfunding. Chief of Staff Kyle McCormick says this makes his company “a very different beast.”</p>
<p>“Even though we may share users with platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, we&#8217;re going after a different part of that user&#8217;s wallet — their investable assets on which they hope to make a return. Not checking for fraud (at a bare minimum) would be deeply negligent,” he said. Republic may be forced to have a more moderated platform due to its focus, but McCormick said that the company is “far from the most curated player” in the space.</p>
<p>As a result, a majority of companies raising through Republic already have momentum, either through venture capital money or accelerator signal, before they try to crowdfund. McCormick admitted that there are still challenges with this model: “How do we deliver quality in a scalable way? How do we support venture-backed companies without mirroring gender and race biases in venture capital? All things we think about everyday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Sahil Lavingia built Gumroad to become an online platform for creators to buy and sell digital goods. Lavingia, who raised money for Gumroad through Republic, said that “manually reviewing each creator goes against the ethos that undergirds the excitement behind the creator economy and speeds up the transition to Web 3.0 — neither of which benefit Indiegogo.”</p>
<p>“The creator economy is about enabling a new set of artists and entrepreneurs to gain access to capital they were historically unable to get,” he said. “But perhaps there are unseen forces at play here, forcing their hand. The forces could be fear of failure. My colleague Brian Heater, who interviewed Indiegogo CEO Andy Yang months ago, pushed the executive on failure or shoddy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/indiegogos-ceo-on-how-crowdfunding-navigated-the-pandemic/">campaigns that let down users.</a> Yang hinted that more trust and safety measures were to come.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve had our number of failures on our site, of campaigns that haven’t fulfilled or just, the campaigns have ghosted their backers, and we own up to that. Over the last two years, that’s been a major focus for us, of what can we do from a trust and safety perspective. It starts with education, making sure that the backers understand that crowdfunding is not shopping. It’s very visible on our checkout site, but again, Amazon and other companies have trained people, just click a button and I’m going to get it in two hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>The argument in favor of Indiegogo’s new constraints are thus that lack of moderation has burned users in the past, and since it’s hard to launch a project, why not hold everyone to a higher bar?</p>
<p>An early-stage entrepreneur thinks that the move to have more guardrails around campaigns is ultimately a quality assurance and traffic push. If the only campaigns that make it to the site, eventually, are ones that are aggressively pre-vetted, Indiegogo is creating a signal to consumers. It could create hype around select ideas and help those reach their funding goals. “To me, this isn’t about ‘risk,’ it&#8217;s about consumers not getting overwhelmed by optionality,” they said over DMs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my question led to more questions around how moderation can lead to less accessibility, the importance of quality assurance with modern investors, and, ugh, how Web 3.0 fits into all of this (send study guides my way). It seems fair to think of Indiegogo’s move, while not revolutionary just yet, as yet another signal that people are rethinking the way we invest and exchange money.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about new funding data for female founders, a very Chipper startup you need to know about and the economics of neobanks.

<p>New PitchBook data shows that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback/">gender gap in startup fundraising is closing</a>, slowly. Female-founded companies raised $40.4 billion across 2,661 deals through the first three quarters of 2021, almost doubling 2019’s total of $23.7 billion and over 10 times 2011’s total of $3.6 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>While funding for female founders is far from even and far from fair, the uptick in funding comes after a disappointing decline in 2020. The contrast makes the growth even more newsworthy, and I’d say it’s due to a change in who gets to be a decision-maker when writing checks. We talk more about tailwinds and our broader thoughts on the numbers in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/three-quarters-of-record-breaking-funding-for-female-founders-is-a-win/">the latest episode of Equity.</a></p>

<p>Chipper Cash! The fintech company, one of the most valuable private startups in Africa, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/chipper-cash-gets-2b-valuation-with-150m-extension-round-led-by-ftx/">recently valued at over $2 billion </a>for its money-moving services. Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX led the round. The investor said that they think Chipper will “make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.”</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> The startup recently landed a partnership with Twitter to help support the social media platform’s new Tip Jar integration — joining established companies like PayPal, Patreon, GoFundMe, Cash App and Venmo. Chipper Cash is also making strides outside of Africa, giving people from Europe the ability to send money to its other markets.</p>

<p>Nubank, a notorious neobank that we’ve been tracking for years, filed its F-1 this past week. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">Alex and I dissected the numbers</a> behind the massive consumer-focused fintech. And there was some solid, efficient evidence to pore over.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> The fresh metrics could prove that neobanks are finally moving off their investing phase — spending a lot of money to eventually make a lot of money — and into a more stable, recurring revenue world. Other consumer banking IPOs in the pipeline include PicPay, which filed for a $100 million IPO on the Nasdaq in April and Chime, which raised a $750 million Series G in August and is reportedly going public by March 2022 at a valuation between $35 billion to $45 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229922" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3><strong>Google Play to allow support for alternative billing systems in South Korea</strong></h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">Following the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">passage </a>of the so-called “anti-Google law” in South Korea, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/google-play-to-support-alternative-billing-systems-in-south-korea-following-new-law/">says it will comply with the new mandate</a> by giving Android app developers on Google Play the ability to offer alternative payment systems alongside Google’s own. The legislation represents the first time a government has been able to force app stores to open up to third-party payment systems for in-app purchases — a change that could impact both app stores’ revenues, as developers look to skirt the tech giants’ commissions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229071" style="width: 508px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229071" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?w=498" alt="" width="498" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png 1172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=110,150 110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=220,300 220w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=768,1048 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=498,680 498w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=1125,1536 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/example-south-korea-iap-1.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229071" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post </a>this week, Google says developers in South Korea will be able to add an alternative in-app billing system in addition to Google Play’s billing system for their mobile and tablet users in the country. At checkout, users will be able to choose which billing system they want to use for their purchase. Details for developers about how to implement the third-party billing systems will be provided in the weeks ahead, Google said.</p>
<p>The situation in South Korea is interesting as something of a bellwether for how Apple and Google will behave if required by a country to change their app store businesses to promote better competition. In Apple&#8217;s case,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the company is claiming</a> its current policies are already in compliance based on how the law is written, and has not yet made any changes to its policies related to the matter.</p>
<h3>Facebook skirts Apple&#8217;s fees with creator subscriptions</h3>
<p>Facebook is challenging Apple by avoiding App Store fees. The social network this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">introduced a new feature</a> that allows creators to share custom subscription links, giving them a way to collect direct payments from fans and make money from their work. When a fan signs up through the link, the creator keeps all the money, minus only taxes. As the links are on the web, these subscriptions aren&#8217;t being processed through Apple&#8217;s in-app payments system &#8212; which could be in possible violation of App Store policies.</p>
<p>But Facebook believes that these links are compliant because it&#8217;s the creators who are generating the revenue, not Facebook itself. Plus, the company isn&#8217;t removing the ability for users to sign up for a creator subscription through the native in-app payments system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230006" style="width: 636px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230006" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230006" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-11.59.34-AM.jpg?w=626" alt="" width="626" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-11.59.34-AM.jpg 1336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-11.59.34-AM.jpg?resize=138,150 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-11.59.34-AM.jpg?resize=276,300 276w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-11.59.34-AM.jpg?resize=768,835 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-11.59.34-AM.jpg?resize=626,680 626w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-11.59.34-AM.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230006" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>This would also be in line with the recent decision in the Epic Games lawsuit, where the court ruled that Apple can&#8217;t stop developers from adding links to alternative payment systems inside their apps alongside Apple&#8217;s own. Currently, Apple is in the process of asking the court to not enforce the deadline on compliance with its decision, as the case is now under appeal by both parties.</p>
<p>Facebook may be correct that it&#8217;s not breaking the rules, so long as it&#8217;s not taking a cut of transactions. Clubhouse earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">launched a similar payments feature</a> that allowed users to virtually tip their favorite creators. Because creators kept all the revenue (minus only the card processing fee), Apple did not intervene.</p>
<p>But further down the road, Facebook could find a way to capture some of that subscription revenue &#8212; either by a cut of the payment itself, or via the payment processing fees with Novi, or even both. The company&#8217;s digital wallet platform Novi has only so far launched <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/facebook-novi-wallet">limited support</a> for cross-border payments between the U.S. and Guatemala (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/facebook-scales-back-its-crypto-ambitions-once-again/">has been criticized</a> for failing to live up to its original crypto ambitions). But Novi&#8217;s long-term plan is to monetize by offering lower fees than credit and debit cards, compared with traditional providers. Facebook could easily get Novi in front of creators, if it chose. First, however, it has to get its foot in the door and start the payment flow without being blocked by Apple. (Facebook said it won&#8217;t collect any fees through 2023.)</p>
<p>Facebook and Apple have been critical of each other&#8217;s business models, with Facebook accusing Apple of using its privacy changes as cover to allow itself to carve out a place for itself in the digital advertising business where Facebook and Google lead. CEO Mark Zuckerberg made no bones about the fact that Facebook believes Apple&#8217;s commissions are bad for creators, saying: &#8220;As we build for the metaverse, we’re focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work,&#8221; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/posts/10114044739955341/">Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post.</a> “The 30% fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that, so we’re updating our Subscriptions product so now creators can earn more.&#8221;</p>
<h3><strong>Apple rails against sideloading</strong></h3>
<p>Apple’s head of software engineering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/apple-craig-federighi-side-loading-apps-web-summit-keynote/">Craig Federighi gave a keynote address </a>at the Web Summit 2021 conference this week where he spoke out against the idea of &#8220;sideloading&#8221; apps &#8212; meaning, simply, installing an app outside of Apple&#8217;s App Store. The speech was given in response to the EU&#8217;s draft <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0842&amp;from=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> that proposes Apple open up iPhone to third-party app stores. He argued Apple&#8217;s position on the matter, which is that sideloading will put users&#8217; privacy and security at risk and that Apple&#8217;s App Store&#8217;s vetting process will better protect users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of creating choice, it would open up a Pandora’s box of unreviewed malware-ridden software and deny everyone the option of iPhone&#8217;s secure approach,&#8221; he said. At one point <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/apple-terms-sideloading-apps-cybercriminal-s-best-friend-in-push-against-draft-eu-policy-11636125401996.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he called apps installed from the web</a>, &#8220;a cybercriminal&#8217;s best friend,&#8221; and painted a picture of how compromised devices could become networks, and malware could threaten government systems, public utilities and enterprises.</p>
<p>Apple is, to some extent, correct that allowing users to download apps from the web could weaken the current state of iPhone security. But, by comparison, Google&#8217;s Android already offers sideloading &#8212; and it hasn&#8217;t so far toppled governments! &#8212; even if Android users face more malware issues than their iPhone counterparts. But one issue with Apple&#8217;s response is that it blurs the lines between third-party app stores and other forms of sideloading where users install directly from a website. Presumably, a competitive app store would be incentivized to keep its marketplace safe in order to attract and retain its own users. A random app hosted on some website is not the same thing at all.</p>
<p>Apple knows the real threat isn&#8217;t to security &#8212; after all, the majority of Android users don&#8217;t sideload &#8212; it&#8217;s to its reputation and business model. Customers hitting up the Epic Games Store for downloads or maybe a Facebook Game Store would cut into its revenues significantly. And every time new malware was discovered &#8220;sideloaded&#8221; onto iPhones, Apple would take a PR hit that would make its platform seem just as vulnerable as Android, losing an advantage it has today over its rival due to being more locked down.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Apple has spoken out against sideloading so publicly. CEO Tim Cook already said something similar in June. Apple also recently published <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps_A_Threat_Analysis_of_Sideloading.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 31-page document laying out its position in detail</a>.</p>

<p>Twelve years after the franchise debuted on Facebook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/zynga-farmville-3-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zynga has introduced Farmville 3</a> on iOS, Android and Mac M1 desktops. The new imagining of the game for mobile devices evolves Farmville into more of a &#8220;metaverse,&#8221; the company claims, allowing players to not just harvest crops, but also nurture animals and participate in continuously updated new activities like hot air balloon rides or pig races, among other things.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the very first time I thought of FarmVille, I thought that could be the beginning of the metaverse where you could start with a square plot of dirt and build that into a persistent connected world. That was my original vision for Zynga and social gaming,&#8221; said Zynga founder Mark Pincus. The game will generate revenue through in-app purchases and ads, aiming for $100 million in annual revenue over the next five years.</p>

<p>Alternative mobile browser Firefox <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/firefox-brings-you-a-new-homepage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shipped</a> its latest release for iOS and Android with an update aimed at helping users address common issues — like the visual clutter of having too many open tabs or needing to pick up where you left off the last time the app was closed, among other things. The changes are a part of the Firefox Beta, which introduced a new homepage that will now serve as a re-entry point to the mobile web, says the browser’s maker, Mozilla. The changes could make Firefox more competitive with default options on mobile devices, like Apple’s Safari or Google’s Chrome. Among the new features are a &#8220;Jump back in&#8221; section for returning to internet research, easy access to saved searches, and other recent tabs &#8212; the latter of which are archived to reduce clutter, but still accessible as needed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Happy Saturday, everyone. We have a metric <em>mountain</em> of things to get through today. Below you’ll find notes on a fascinating startup round in the consumer fintech market, notes from the low-code world thanks to an earnings day interview with Appian CEO Matt Calkins, and quick hits on IPOs, Kidas’ venture capital round, a public building and NFTs. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>How one startup is shaking up the consumer trading boom</h2>
<p>Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">rode a wave of consumer interest</a> in investing and trading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">all the way to the public markets</a>. Despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">some recent setbacks</a>, the company remains evidence of how much interest there is in the market not only to buy stocks but also to make more exotic options trades.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230088" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s the latter that we’re talking about today. <a href="https://www.optionsai.com/">Options AI</a>, a distributed startup with ties to Chicago has raised a $4.1 million Seed round. I’ve known the company for some time as I go back with a member of its founding team but haven’t had a chance to write much about it.</p>
<p>Now that it raised capital from three lead investors — Akuna Capital, Miami International Holdings and Optiver Principal Strategic Investments — and others it fits into our remit.</p>
<p>Essentially options are complicated, and many folks approaching the trading varietal lack the tooling and sophistication to make good choices when they dive in. If you doubt me there, ask your trading friends about their options strategy. It will be an illustrative conversation.</p>
<p>Options AI has built a tool that allows traders better <em>see</em> trades before they execute them and make better choices when it comes to multileg options and the like. It’s a pretty neat tool, and as someone who has long had a loose comprehension of how options trading works and is priced, it helped me grok.</p>
<p>But better charting is only a bit of why Options AI has held my interest. The other reason is that it is <em>charging</em> for trades. The startup has a flat $5 trade cost, which means it is swimming against the free-trading push that Robinhood, Webull and others have pursued in recent years.</p>
<p>Today Options AI works with equity options but told The Exchange that it may add crypto and futures options in time. The company describes its current moment as poking its head out from where it has been building and testing, content that its early traction and user data indicates that it is onto something. Certainly its new investors agree.</p>
<p>A data point on options before we go. <em>Why</em> are major consumer trading platforms so interested in options trading? Because it is lucrative as all hell. For example, options trading generated $64 million <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf">for Robinhood in Q3 2021</a>. Equity trading brought in my $50 million. It’s a big business.</p>
<p>And with a flat-fee and PFOF revenues, Options AI could be in a pretty attractive market position if it can get enough folks to show up. Who is the startup&#8217;s target user? I reckon someone who has gotten into trading but wants slightly more specialized tooling. And Robinhood’s numbers indicate that there could be quite a few of those users out there.</p>
<p>More when we squeeze Options AI for trading growth data.</p>
<h2>Shaking up the SaaS pricing market</h2>
<p>Mostly TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/more-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-pricing/">explored the SaaS pricing debate</a> through the lens of <em>subscription</em> versus <em>on-demand</em> or <em>usage-based</em> pricing schemes. This is a good window through which to view market evolution as many startups today are born as APIs for which on-demand pricing simply makes more sense. And there’s some SaaS fatigue out in the market as well.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://appian.com/">Appian</a>, which is doing something a little different. I caught up with the company’s CEO Matt Calkins this week after his <a href="https://investors.appian.com/news-releases/news-release-details/appian-announces-third-quarter-2021-financial-results">company’s earnings call</a>, expecting to chat mostly about the low-code market, process automation and process mining. We did talk about those things — Appian operates a connected set of software that allows customers to mine their processes for things to automate, helping them design and then automate as needed — but we wound up talking about pricing.</p>
<p>Appian has put together something called <em>unlimited</em> pricing, which is a sort of SaaS with an open-ended cap on use. SaaS is often priced per seat or per application, but Calkins et al. are trying something that feels like a mix of what’s good about SaaS and on-demand. Or more simply, by charging a flat rate for a year’s service and not limiting use, the company is effectively daring customers to use lots of Appian’s service and get stuck in with its platform.</p>
<p>Calkins was unnaturally clear for a public company CEO that the unlimited plan may offer some customers what works out to a very good deal. Saying that he likes to “innovate” on pricing, Calkins argued that while its unlimited pricing model could lead to a customer building a bunch of stuff using Appian tech and perhaps paying less than they might through a different pricing mechanism, it was just the cost for getting them to go all-in on using its tech.</p>
<p>At which point Appian will have a long-term customer that it can generate high-margin top line from. Not a bad trade.</p>
<h2>IPO Roundup</h2>
<p>Golly gee did we want IPOs and gosh darn have they not come. A roundup:</p>
<ul>
<li>HashiCorp filed to go public, our dig into its numbers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">can be found here</a>.</li>
<li>AllBirds priced its DTC IPO above range, and then ran up more points when it began trading. Pricing notes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/allbirds-prices-ipo-above-range-putting-more-points-on-the-board-for-dtc-startups/">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/allbirds-flotation-should-help-the-market-sort-the-value-of-tech-enabled-ipos/">financial coverage here</a>.</li>
<li>NerdWallet priced its IPO midrange, before trading higher. It has given up some ground since, but still had a cracking debut. Financial coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/nerdwallets-ipo-proves-you-can-write-your-way-to-a-unicorn-valuation/">here</a>. (And shoutout to former TechCruncher <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reelfeed/">Felicia Shivakumar,</a> who once took a shot on your current scribe launching a video show for TC and is a very excellent human, but also now works for NerdWallet!)</li>
<li>Nubank filed to go public, our first look at some of its economics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">can be found here</a>.</li>
<li>The Bird SPAC deal completed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/">and it didn’t have the <em>best</em> first day</a>.</li>
<li>And, finally, Backblaze <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/backblazes-ipo-a-test-for-smaller-tech-concerns/">set first pricing notes for its own IPO</a>, which we found fascinating given the company’s old-school revenue scale.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Various, sundry</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kidas.net">Kidas</a> ran into my eyeline this week, the startup works with parents to help keep kids safe in online gaming environments. It just raised $2 million, adding to its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kidas/company_financials">modest fundraising record</a>. The company told The Exchange that it “unlocks new information for parents they otherwise wouldn’t have and this helps them to better connect with their kids over something they love.”</li>
<li>I will never be <em>stoked</em> about anything that gives authority more purview over underlings’ digital activities, but given the spiraling number of communications methods in the gaming world, parents are going to want some oversight.</li>
<li>Notably the startup says that its tooling doesn’t interfere with gameplay, so it doesn’t trigger anti-cheat software, which really, <em>really </em>matters.</li>
<li>More on the company later, but it’s based in Philly, which I dug.</li>
<li><a href="https://therealdeal.com/2021/11/03/interested-in-investing-in-a-single-building-this-harlem-property-could-be-your-chance/">Building goes public</a>: Not in our IPO section, but a startup I’ve been passively tracking called <a href="https://www.lex-markets.com/">LEX Capital Markets</a> just took a single building public. The company has a really neat model. Worth peeking at.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/bring-on-the-low-cost-nfts/">extending our recent NFT coverage</a>, Mythical <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/04/mythical-raises-150m-at-1-25b-valuation-for-playable-nft-game-platform/">just raised $150 million</a> for its NFT-infused game. Perhaps that’s where the NFT wind is heading.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week&#8217;s top story is located at the crossroads of growth marketing and software development.</p>
<p>Usage-based pricing (UBP) for SaaS services is becoming more popular as companies of every type automate their processes, but one important result of the shift is that companies that adopt UBP see a return on their customer acquisition costs much sooner than the competition.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s coverage of software development includes articles about Battery Venture&#8217;s State of the OpenCloud report, how developers can make the most of iOS 15.0 updates and an interview with Appetiser, who we found through our TechCrunch Experts <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">survey</a>. As for growth marketing, I reached out to several marketers we&#8217;ve interviewed in the past to find out how they&#8217;re preparing for this year&#8217;s holiday season.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229971" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Software consulting</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/were-still-just-scratching-the-surface-of-the-clouds-potential/">(TechCrunch+) We’re still just scratching the surface of the cloud’s potential:</a> TechCrunch&#8217;s own Ron Miller and Alex Wilhelm do a deep dive of the State of the OpenCloud report from Battery Ventures. Ron and Alex write, &#8220;Battery believes that the cloud market could eventually be worth $1 trillion. When you consider that the vast majority of work, development and computing will be done in the cloud at some point, the investment group’s round-number projection may prove modest.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/make-the-most-of-ios-15s-updates-to-the-app-store/">(TechCrunch+) Make the most of iOS 15’s updates to the App Store:</a> Ilia Kukharev, head of ASO at AppFollow, tells us how software developers can use iOS 15.0 updates to their advantage. Kukharev says, &#8220;If an internal event is planned in the app (for example, a live broadcast), it is now possible to promote it in App Store Connect any time before the event. After review approval, the event card will be shown in search results as well as on the app page.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/appetisers-co-founders-discuss-building-client-relationships-and-getting-to-mvp/">Appetiser’s co-founders discuss building client relationships and getting to MVP:</a> Anna had a chance to interview Appetiser&#8217;s co-founders Jamie Shostak and Michael MacRae. They discussed how Appetiser came to be, how they also work with clients on growth, and more. MacRae says, &#8220;When we build your team at Appetiser, it will be your team! Join standups, ideate with your team, discuss challenges or even have one-on-ones. We replicated the structure of successful startups with in-house teams, and then we rebuilt it in an agency form.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Growth marketing</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/more-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-pricing/">(TechCrunch+) Why more SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based pricing:</a> Anna spoke with OpenView&#8217;s operating partner, Kyle Poyar, about OpenView&#8217;s 2021 State of Usage-Based Pricing Report and shares the highlights of their conversation with us. Anna says, &#8220;The survey also looks into how companies that adopt flexible pricing models perform compared to their counterparts, and how it impacts them more broadly.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/the-holiday-shopping-season-is-coming-how-are-growth-marketers-preparing/">(TechCrunch+): The holiday shopping season is coming: How are growth marketers preparing?:</a> Miranda Halpern chatted with several marketers that we&#8217;ve come to know through our TechCrunch Experts project about how they&#8217;re preparing for holiday campaigns this year while facing the pandemic, supply chain issues, and more. &#8220;To maximize order flow and meet customer expectations, Dick said her company moved up its campaign start dates by 2-3 weeks and plans to lean more heavily on SMS and email campaigns than in the past.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Politeness doesn’t really amount to much when you’re programmed to get from point A to point B. But if robots are going to play an increased role in human society, questions arise around how precisely they’ll get along with the rest of us.</p>
<p>“Robots will live in our world soon enough and they really need to learn how to communicate with us on human terms,” MIT CSAIL research scientist Boris Katz said in a statement tied to <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=3HZLte8gMYS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new research paper.</a> “They need to understand when it is time for them to help and when it is time for them to see what they can do to prevent something from happening.”</p>
<p>The team calls the paper, “the first very serious attempt for understanding what it means for humans and machines to interact socially.” The validity of such a claim may be up for dispute; the problem it’s attempting to solve in a very early stage is no doubt one roboticists will increasingly consider as robots begin to play an outsized role in our lives.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230189" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Researchers conducted tests in a simulated environment, to develop what they deemed “realistic and predictable” interactions between robots. In the simulation, one robot watches another perform a task, attempts to determine the goal and then either attempts to help or hamper it in that task.</p>
<p>“We have opened a new mathematical framework for how you model social interaction between two agents,” fellow project lead Ravi Tejwani said in a statement. “If you are a robot, and you want to go to location X, and I am another robot and I see that you are trying to go to location X, I can cooperate by helping you get to location X faster. That might mean moving X closer to you, finding another better X, or taking whatever action you had to take at X. Our formulation allows the plan to discover the ‘how’; we specify the ‘what’ in terms of what social interactions mean mathematically.”</p>
<p>The model is currently a relatively simple 2D simulation. The team is working to move toward a 3D version, while adding a neural network-based robot planner to increase the speed with which the robots learn from these actions.</p>

		Dhruv Ghulati founded one of the first global startups tackling online misinformation and is one of the first machine learning scientists to research automated fact-checking. He holds degrees in economics and computer science from the London School of Economics and University College London.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. election, I set out to build a product that could tackle the scourge of fake news online. My initial hypothesis was simple: build a semi-automated fact-checking algorithm that could automatically highlight any false or dubious claim and suggest the best-quality contextual facts for it. Our thesis was clear, if perhaps utopian: If technology could drive people to seek truth, facts, statistics and data to make their decisions, we could build an online discourse of reason and rationality instead of hyperbole.</p>
<p>After five years of <a href="https://medium.com/factmata/3-stage-plan-e2f9f06bdd62">hard work</a>, Factmata has had some successes. But for this space to truly thrive, there are a great deal of barriers, from economic to technological, that still must be overcome.</p>
<h2>Key challenges</h2>
<p>We quickly realized that automated fact-checking represents an extremely hard research problem. The first challenge was defining just what facts we were checking. Next, it was thinking about how we could build and maintain up-to-date databases of facts that would allow us to assess the accuracy of given claims. For example, the commonly-used <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a> knowledge base was an obvious option, but it updates too slowly to check claims about rapidly changing events.<br />

<p>We also discovered that being a for-profit fact-checking company was an obstacle. Most journalism and fact-checking networks are nonprofit, and social media platforms prefer working with nonprofits in order to avoid accusations of bias.</p>
<p>Beyond these factors, building a business that can rate what is &#8220;good&#8221; is inherently complex and nuanced. Definitions are endlessly debatable. For example, what people called &#8220;fake news&#8221; often turned out to be extreme hyperpartisanship, and what people proclaimed &#8220;misinformation&#8221; were really contrarian opinions.</p>
<p>Thus, we concluded that detecting what was &#8220;bad&#8221; (toxic, obscene, threatening or hateful) was a much easier route from a business standpoint. Specifically, we decided to detect &#8220;gray area&#8221; harmful text — content that a platform is not sure should be removed but needs additional context. To achieve this, we built an API that scores the harmfulness of comments, posts and news articles for their level of hyperpartisanship, controversiality, objectivity, hatefulness and 15 other signals.</p>
<p>We realized that there was value in tracking all the claims evolving online about relevant corporate issues. Thus, beyond our API we built a SaaS platform that tracks rumors and &#8220;narratives&#8221; evolving in any topic, whether it is about a brand’s products, a government policy or COVID-19 vaccines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If this sounds complicated, that’s because it is. One of the biggest lessons we learned was just how little $1 million in seed funding goes in this space. Training data around validated hate speech and false claims is no ordinary labeling task — it requires subject-matter expertise and precise deliberations, neither of which comes cheaply.</p>
<p>In fact, building the tools we needed — including multiple browser extensions, website demos, a data labeling platform, a social news commenting platform and live real-time dashboards of our AI’s output — was akin to building several new startups all at the same time.</p>
<p>Complicating things further, finding product-market fit was a very hard journey. After many years of building, Factmata has shifted to brand safety and brand reputation. We sell our technology to online advertising platforms looking to clean up their ad inventory, brands looking for reputation management and optimization, and smaller scale platforms looking for content moderation. It took us a long time to reach this business model, but in the last year we have finally seen multiple customers sign up for trials and contracts every month, and we are on target for $1 million in recurring revenues by mid-2022.</p>
<h2>What needs to be done</h2>
<p>Our journey demonstrates the high number of barriers to building a socially impactful business in the media space. As long as virality and drawing eyeballs are the metrics for the online advertising, search engines and newsfeeds, change will be hard. And small firms can’t do it on their own; they will need both regulatory and financial support.</p>
<p>Regulators need to step up and start enacting strong laws. Facebook and Twitter have taken massive strides, but the online advertising systems are far behind and emerging platforms have no incentive to evolve differently. Right now, there is no incentive for companies to moderate their platforms of any speech that isn’t illegal — reputational damage or fear of user churn are not enough. Even the most ardent supporters of free speech, as I am, recognize the need to create financial incentives and bans so that platforms really take action and start spending money to reduce harmful content and promote ecosystem health.</p>
<p>What would an alternative look like? Bad content will always exist, but we can create a system that promotes better content.</p>
<p>As flawed as they may be, algorithms have a big role to play; they have the potential to automatically assess online content for its &#8220;goodness,&#8221; or quality. These &#8220;quality scores&#8221; could be the basis to create new social media platforms that aren’t ad based at all but used to promote (and pay for) content that is beneficial to society.</p>
<p>Given the scope of the problem, it will take immense resources to build these new scoring algorithms — even the most innovative startups will struggle without tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in funding. It will require multiple companies and nonprofits, all providing different versions that can embed in people’s newsfeeds.</p>
<p>Government can help in several ways. First, it should define the rules around &#8220;quality&#8221;; firms trying to solve this problem shouldn’t be expected to make up their own policies.</p>
<p>Government should also provide funding. Government funding would allow these companies to avoid watering down their goals. It would also encourage firms to make their technologies open to public scrutiny and create transparency around flaws and biases. The technologies could even be encouraged to be released to the public for free and available use, and ultimately provided for public benefit.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to embrace emerging technologies. There have been positive strides by the platforms to invest seriously in the deep technology required to do content moderation effectively and sustainably. The ad industry, four years on, has also made progress adopting new brand safety algorithms such as Factmata’s, that of the Global Disinformation Index and Newsguard.</p>
<p>Although initially a skeptic, I am also optimistic about the potential of cryptocurrency and token economics to present a new way of funding and encouraging good quality, fact-checked media to prevail and distribute at scale. For example, &#8220;experts&#8221; in tokenized systems can be encouraged to fact-check claims and efficiently scale data labeling for AI content moderation systems without firms needing large upfront investments to pay for labeling.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the original vision I set out for Factmata, as the technological component of a fact-based world, will ever be realized. But I am proud that we gave it a shot and am hopeful that our experiences can help others chart a healthier direction in the ongoing battle against misinformation and disinformation.</p>

Me too. The answer is that to get to that point is much more work than folks may have thought. Cruise is turning to simulators and custom silicon for its own efforts. Let’s hope they have cracked it. I hate driving.</li>

Once an oddity, many startups today are working on and with code that is open for all. HashiCorp has ridden the trend all the way to an IPO filing, which we were more than excited to read.</li>

Helion Energy just raised $500 million for its efforts to pull energy from fusion reactions, with another $1.7 billion in the offing if it can hit certain milestones. The question, TechCrunch notes, is whether the company can yank more power from its fusion tech than it takes to operate. Let’s see.</li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/lime-raises-523-million-as-it-prepares-to-go-public/"><strong>Lime raises pre-IPO round:</strong></a> Now that Bird is a public company, it only seems fitting that its former archrival Lime is also prepping its own public offering. The green-branded scooter and e-bike company just locked in $523 million in new funding, including $418 million of convertible debt. Let’s see if Lime can <em>scoot</em> its way to an IPO in short order.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/momenta-500-million/"><strong>More money for self-driving tech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Speaking of nine-figure rounds for things that move, Momenta has just added $500 million to its own coffers. The autonomous driving tech company from China had previously raised $300 million in a round that it just extended. That’s a lot of duckets. At this point I am curious if we’ve seen north of $100 billion invested privately to tackle this particular technology challenge.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/dji-mavic-3-best-drone-price-msrp-2199/"><strong>New DJI drone is good, expensive:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Drone tech has taken leaps and bounds in recent years, improving across nearly all strata that we care about. Our own Matt Burns confirms as much in his review of the new DJI Mavic 3. Sadly it costs north of $2,000, so will fly far from the hands of most consumers.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/an-inclusive-new-d2c-beauty-platform-secures-3-million-in-funding-and-a-supercharged-offline-strategy/"><strong>Thirteen Lune raises $3M, partners with major American retailer:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The beauty market is big business, and Thirteen Lune is taking its direct-to-consumer beauty platform to the masses with a partnership with Target. That deal made TechCrunch sit up and take note of the company’s funding and progress.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/milkrun-lands-new-capital-to-deliver-farm-fresh-groceries/"><strong>Today in good startup names, we present MilkRun:</strong></a> Regardless of if you buy milk by the gallon, or the <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/local/article/CNN-segment-Twitter-losing-it-Texas-milk-16592454.php">dozens of gallons</a>, we all eat and drink each day. MilkRun wants to feed you with its “subscription service delivering weekly grocery staples sourced from small, local farms,” TechCrunch reports. Now flush with a $6 million Series A, the startup is hoping to extend its growth that saw it bolster revenues by 15x in 2020.</li>

<h2>The holiday shopping season is coming: How are growth marketers preparing?</h2>
<p>With only three weeks left to the start of the holiday shopping season, Miranda Halpern checked in with several growth marketers to find out how they&#8217;re advising their clients to prepare for supply chain disruptions.</p>
<p>Cargo ships are stacked up outside ports, and empty shipping containers are in short supply, as are the truck drivers who would take them to market. This is not the time for doing business as usual.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A former upstart Instagram rival is suing Meta, formerly known as Facebook, over allegations that the company violated antitrust laws by cloning a competing product and ultimately killing its business.</p>
<p>The app, Phhhoto, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/15/phhhoto-is-an-addictive-albeit-poorly-named-gif-style-photo-app/">launched in 2014,</a> inviting users to create and share short GIF-like videos. If that sounds familiar, that&#8217;s because the same functionality was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/22/instagram-boomerang/">popularized in Boomerang</a>, an app made by Instagram. That feature is now integrated into Instagram&#8217;s core app experience.</p>
<p>The newly filed lawsuit, embedded below, alleges that Facebook&#8217;s behavior violated antitrust laws by cutting off the app&#8217;s access to its social graph, slow-walking a proposed relationship and then eventually releasing its own copy of Phhhoto&#8217;s core feature: the seconds-long looping video.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230141" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Menlo Park-based lawyer Gary Reback will represent Phhhoto in the suit. Reback is best known for his involvement in setting the stage for the federal government&#8217;s successful antitrust case against Microsoft, which ultimately didn&#8217;t split up the tech giant but did force the company to open up some aspects of its computing business — consequences that continue to reverberate in the tech industry today.</p>
<p>Reback argues that Phhhoto&#8217;s experience underlines why it&#8217;s detrimental to the market when a massive tech company buys out its competition and starts running those businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;The record here demonstrates that Facebook would have partnered with Phhhoto and launched to prominence this great new social network that would have competed with Instagram,&#8221; Reback said. He highlighted the unusually hands-on approach that Facebook&#8217;s top leadership took with the nascent competitor.</p>
<p>Phhhoto climbed the iOS app charts after its launch, eventually boasting 3.7 monthly active users at its peak popularity. As the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/30/phhhoto-tops-1-million-users/">hot new social app attracted attention</a>, Facebook executives took interest — including Mark Zuckerberg.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;On or about August 8, 2014, Zuckerberg downloaded and installed the app onto his phone, entered the phone number of his device into the Phhhoto app, created a personal account, and posted a profile picture of himself (reproduced below) to his new Phhhoto account,&#8221; the suit reads.</p>
<p>The suit includes receipts — namely, Zuckerberg&#8217;s own selfie, taken as he was testing the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230181" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230181" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-12.08.02-PM.png?w=650" alt="Zuckerberg Phhhoto selfie" width="650" height="672" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-12.08.02-PM.png 650w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-12.08.02-PM.png?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-12.08.02-PM.png?resize=290,300 290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-12.08.02-PM.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-12.08.02-PM.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230181" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Phhhoto</p></div></p>
<p>Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, who led Instagram at the time, also downloaded the app and explored its features. According to the lawsuit, Facebook began courting Phhhoto, offering partnership opportunities that it later reneged on:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; Hurren, then Facebook’s Strategic Partnerships Manager, reached out to Phhhoto, asserting that Phhhoto was &#8220;really awesome.&#8221; Hurren first offered to incorporate Phhhoto’s technology into the Facebook Messenger service. When Phhhoto declined, Hurren offered to incorporate Phhhoto’s content into Facebook’s users’ Newsfeeds. Phhhoto invested heavily in this project, but ultimately Hurren did not move forward, citing internal “legal conversations” that “hung” the project up.</p></blockquote>
<p>After the relationship failed to materialize, the suit alleges that Facebook took a number of actions meant to drive it out of business, including removing pre-populated Instagram hashtags that indicate where content on the app originated. Instagram also cut Phhhoto off from its social graph, blocking the perceived competitor&#8217;s users from connecting with their Instagram friends in the app.</p>

<p>Phhhoto&#8217;s demise had some dramatic moments: On October 22, 2015, the same day the company was set to launch an Android version of its app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/22/instagram-boomerang/">Instagram launched Boomerang</a>. The suit identifies Boomerang product manager John Barnett as an &#8220;active Phhhoto user.&#8221; At the time of launch, TechCrunch noted that Boomerang appeared &#8220;suspiciously similar&#8221; to Phhhoto.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that Boomerang was the culmination of Facebook&#8217;s anticompetitive effort, effectively killing the smaller company with a copycat app that reproduced Phhhoto&#8217;s innovations &#8220;feature-by-feature.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the suit, Phhhoto wasn&#8217;t even aware of the extent of Facebook&#8217;s aggressive behavior against other competitors at the time, learning more after the UK Parliament released a<a href="https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Note-by-Chair-and-selected-documents-ordered-from-Six4Three.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> trove of the company&#8217;s internal documents in late 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Phhhoto wasn&#8217;t afraid to speak out about Facebook&#8217;s moves as this all went down. &#8220;We watched Systrom and his product team quietly using Phhhoto almost a year before Boomerang was released,&#8221; Phhhoto co-founder Champ Bennett <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/phhhoto-shuts-down/">told TechCrunch in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>After the app shut down, Bennett said that it &#8220;wasn’t a surprise at all&#8221; to see Instagram launch its own clone.</p>
