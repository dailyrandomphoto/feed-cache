										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2021/09/20/news-consumption-across-social-media-in-2021/">report</a> from Pew Research finds that around a third of U.S. adults continue to get their news regularly from Facebook, though the exact percentage has slipped from 36% in 2020 to 31% in 2021. This drop reflects an overall slight decline in the number of Americans who say they get their news from any social media platform &#8212; a percentage that also fell by 5 percentage points year-over-year, going from 53% in 2020 to a little under 48%, Pew&#8217;s study found.</p>
<p>By definition, &#8220;regularly&#8221; here means the survey respondents said they get their news either &#8220;often&#8221; or &#8220;sometimes,&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;rarely,&#8221; &#8220;never,&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t get digital news.&#8221;</p>
<p>The change comes at a time when tech companies have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/18/more-americans-now-say-government-should-take-steps-to-restrict-false-information-online-than-in-2018/">come under heavy scrutiny</a> for allowing misinformation to spread across their platforms, Pew notes. That criticism has ramped up over the course of the pandemic, leading to vaccine hesitancy and refusal, which in turn has led to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/cdc-study-shows-unvaccinated-people-are-29-times-more-likely-to-be-hospitalized-with-covid.html">worsened</a> health outcomes for many Americans who consumed the misleading information.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, the percentage of Americans who regularly get their news from various social media sites hasn&#8217;t changed too much over the past year, demonstrating how much a part of people&#8217;s daily news habits these sites have become.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205332" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205332" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2205332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="491" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png 840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=768,554 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=680,491 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pew Research</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the one-third of U.S. adults who regularly get their news on Facebook, 22% say they regularly get news on YouTube. Twitter and Instagram are regular news sources for 13% and 11% of Americans, respectively.</p>
<p>However, many of the sites have seen small declines as a regular source of news among their own users, says Pew. This is a different measurement compared with the much smaller percentage of U.S. adults who use the sites for news, as it speaks to how the sites&#8217; own user bases may perceive them. In a way, it&#8217;s a measurement of the shifting news consumption behaviors of the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/">often younger social media user</a>, more specifically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, 55% of Twitter users regularly get news from its platform, compared with 59% last year. Meanwhile, Reddit users&#8217; use of the site for news dropped from 42% to 39% in 2021. YouTube fell from 32% to 30%, and Snapchat fell from 19% to 16%. Instagram is roughly the same, at 28% in 2020 to 27% in 2021.</p>
<p>Only one social media platform grew as a news source during this time: TikTok.</p>
<p>In 2020, 22% of the short-form video platform&#8217;s users said they regularly got their news there, compared with an increased 29% in 2021.</p>
<p>Overall, though, most of these sites have very little traction with the wider adult population in the U.S. Fewer than 1 in 10 Americans regularly get their news from Reddit (7%), TikTok (6%), LinkedIn (4%), Snapchat (4%), WhatsApp (3%) or Twitch (1%).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205333" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205333" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2205333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?w=392" alt="" width="392" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=392,680 392w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205333" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pew Research</p></div></p>
<p>There are demographic differences between who uses which sites, as well.</p>
<p>White adults tend to turn to Facebook and Reddit for news (60% and 54%, respectively). Black and Hispanic adults make up significant proportions of the regular news consumers on Instagram (20% and 33%, respectively.) Younger adults tend to turn to Snapchat and TikTok, while the majority of news consumers on LinkedIn have four-year college degrees.</p>
<p>Of course, Pew&#8217;s latest survey, conducted from July 26 to Aug. 8, 2021, is based on self-reported data. That means people&#8217;s answers are based on how the users perceive their own usage of these various sites for newsgathering. This can produce different results compared with real-world measurements of how often users visited the sites to read news. Some users may underestimate their usage and others may overestimate it.</p>
<p>People may also not fully understand the ramifications of reading news on social media, where headlines and posts are often molded into inflammatory clickbait in order to entice engagement in the form of reactions and comments. This, in turn, may encourage strong reactions &#8212; but not necessarily from those worth listening to. In recent Pew studies, it found that social media news consumers tended to be <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/07/30/americans-who-mainly-get-their-news-on-social-media-are-less-engaged-less-knowledgeable/">less knowledgeable</a> about the facts on key news topics, like elections or Covid-19. And social media consumers were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/study-u-s-adults-who-mostly-rely-on-social-media-for-news-are-less-informed-exposed-to-more-conspiracies/">more frequently exposed to fringe conspiracies</a> (which is pretty apparent to anyone reading the comments!)</p>
<p>For the current study, the full sample size was 11,178 respondents, and the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 1.4 percentage points.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Australian growth marketing agency Ammo encourages startups to develop a minimum viable brand and provides services to make sure that their marketing efforts are correctly calibrated.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you are the founder of a young startup, it is always very hard to gauge the right amount of effort to dedicate to marketing. Botch it and you risk looking unprofessional. Hire a traditional agency and you might be wasting time and money.</p>
<p>Australian growth marketing agency <a href="https://www.ammo.marketing/">Ammo</a>, in contrast, wants to make sure that its clients aren&#8217;t overinvesting nor underinvesting. Geared toward tech startups, it boasts that it has &#8220;supercharged the growth of over 200 innovative businesses,&#8221; from fintech and SaaS to hardware.</p>
<p>Ammo is based in Perth and an active member of Western Australia&#8217;s startup community, where it is &#8220;very highly regarded,&#8221; in the words of the survey respondent who recommended it to TechCrunch. But if that person decided to work with Ammo, they said it&#8217;s because &#8220;their results spoke.&#8221; (If you have growth marketing agencies or freelancers to recommend, please <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">fill out our survey</a>!)</p>
<p>After reading this, we reached out to Ammo&#8217;s director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/camsinclair1/">Cam Sinclair</a> for insights on early-stage brand development, marketing readiness and more. Check out our interview below:</p>

<p><b>Can you give us an overview of Ammo?</b></p>
<p><b>Cam Sinclair: </b>Ammo is a growth marketing team based in Perth, Western Australia. We work with startups and innovative businesses to help them set and reach their growth goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>We’ve been in this community for seven years now, and have a small, lean team from a variety of backgrounds — none of which are traditional marketing.</p>
<p>As a nerdy kid I loved tech and was fascinated by how business works. I always knew I wanted to find some way to help founders and innovators get their great ideas out into the world. After working in political campaigns, I realized that many of the skillsets overlapped with what startups need: moving fast, being lean, communicating well, being adaptable and staying flexible.</p>
<p>That inspired me to grow an &#8220;anti-agency&#8221; where startup founders could genuinely feel like they had someone on their team who understood their challenges and the risks they were taking.</p>
<p><b>How do you collaborate with startups?</b></p>
<p>Our services cater to every stage of the founder journey. When you’re starting, you’ll need a brand, strategy and the marketing infrastructure to reach early customers. As you’re growing, you’ll need ongoing marketing campaigns and automation that bolsters your funnel. As you’re maturing, you’ll need the broader reach that PR and ongoing strategic advice provides.</p>
<p>We like to keep engagements as flexible as possible because startups are always discovering new marketing opportunities or customer needs. Some relationships are ongoing, others are quick projects completed in a week. Our long-term relationships start with a growth strategy workshop, where we identify a north star metric so that everyone is pulling in the same direction from day one.</p>
<p>Our workshops help startup teams design a customer journey using the pirate metrics framework and turn that into a clear, step-by-step action plan which they can implement or outsource.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p><b>There&#8217;s a survey on your site that encourages companies to check whether they are &#8220;ready for growth marketing.&#8221; What are the high-level points that make a company ready?</b></p>
<p>It’s really about having a small number of early fanatical customers — evangelists. Many people call it product-market-fit, but it’s really customer fit.</p>
<p>There is little point in lighting a rocket under a startup to grow and reach a wide audience without a clear, confident direction. Sure, you might get somewhere fast, but where are you going?</p>
<p>We’ve made the mistake of taking on clients who were too early for growth, so we know how important it is to say &#8220;no&#8221; when it’s not a good fit. We can direct all the traffic in the world to your website, but without customer fit you&#8217;ll be fighting for every sale.</p>
<p>Startups need to get a few things right to be primed for growth. Not every startup will be ready for what we can do for them. We’re focused on our own customer fit too.</p>
<p><b>For one-on-one work, who are your typical clients? </b></p>
<p>Our most successful relationships are with startups who have already established customer fit and are looking to grow quickly. We work with B2B and B2C SaaS companies, as well as more traditional businesses who are looking to disrupt the way things are done in their industry.</p>
<p>We’ve grown startups in Australia and abroad, including neuroscience startup Humm, based in Berkeley, California. We worked with them to identify early customers and preorder channels while they were gathering initial investment, build a learning/experimenting system within the team as they grew and, more recently, provide advisory at a strategic level.</p>

<p><b>What mistakes do you help startups avoid when it comes to branding? </b></p>
<p>After working with over 230 startups, we know what works and what doesn’t. Our clients work with us because they know we can help them avoid the pitfalls that inexperienced founders regularly fall into and make the most of the tight budgets that startups run on.</p>
<p>Marketing agencies are taking money that startups don’t have to build brand identities that startups don’t need. We would much prefer to see those resources invested into building their product and talking to their customers.</p>
<p>That said, it’s important for a landing page or slide deck to be believable to customers, investors and partners — and when startups underinvest in their branding, people are less likely to hand over their attention, email address and money.</p>
<p>For example, some clients often don’t even have suitable logo files or a wide enough color palette to create websites that effectively convert people into customers. If someone can’t clearly see your “sign-up” button when they land on your website because everything on your website is blue, it doesn’t matter how good your product or service is.</p>
<p><b>Can you explain why you <a href="https://www.ammo.marketing/mvb">advise startups</a> to create a &#8220;minimum viable brand&#8221;? </b></p>
<p>The temptation in the startup world is to use a freelancer through an online marketplace (or even worse — letting an overenthusiastic employee create a logo in PowerPoint). But this usually results in a surface-level logo design without any consideration for how it might develop over time or fit within a larger brand identity.</p>
<p>Other startups might work with an agency to create a brand identity, and this can lead to brand overkill — stationery kits, photography, lofty mission statements and endless meetings. None of which pre-seed startups need yet. This process wastes time and money better spent elsewhere and traps pivoting startups with an expensive brand that can’t evolve as they do.</p>
<p>We take branding processes used by world-class agencies and distill it down to the core parts of the brand you need right now. This leads to a minimum viable brand identity that’s built to grow and created with the expectation that it will change as your startup does. It’s inspired by lean methodology and the minimum viable product (MVP) — it’s built to challenge assumptions and catch the attention of customers without overinvesting.</p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s the process you follow to help startups develop their minimum viable brand?</b></p>
<p>Initially we help them come up with a name.</p>
<p>Naming is important so we generally invest time into this part to avoid changing it in the future if possible. We want to make sure it meets the basic principles of distinctiveness, brevity, appropriateness, easy spelling and pronunciation, likeability, extendibility and protectability (based on Marty Neumeier’s branding-in-business book <a href="https://www.martyneumeier.com/zag">Zag</a>).</p>
<p>From there we design a logo. A good logomark (the “icon” part of the logo) is generally figurative and not literal. It should be scalable, simple and work in multiple environments including single color black or white. The logo is then complemented with brand color selections, fonts and simple imagery direction to create a basic but useful brand guide.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we believe your startup’s brand guidelines should be available publicly online, rather than in a PDF hidden in a folder on your Dropbox. Somewhere that you can direct your team members and partners to so you can ensure everyone can maintain brand consistency.</p>
<p><b>How does Ammo compare to having an in-house CMO?</b></p>
<p>Like a CMO, we’re strategic. But unlike a CMO, we have experience with hundreds of startups across dozens of industries — we can pull insights and lessons from unexpected places when we’re working with clients.</p>
<p>While we align closely with commercial goals like an in-house CMO, we also know the importance for startups to move quickly. That’s why everyone at Ammo rolls up their sleeves and gets things done for our clients.</p>
<p>We don’t have the mindset of taking months to develop an annual marketing strategy, we want to help our clients get in front of customers quickly, collect valuable data along the way and stay nimble to adapt when they need it.</p>
<p><b>How do you and your clients measure your impact?</b></p>
<p>At Ammo, we don’t measure time, we measure outcomes. At the start of every project we define what success looks like with the client. Every client is different, and we’re responsive to that. We check back in with ongoing clients in monthly meetings to see how we’re tracking toward the success metric we agreed on, adjusting as necessary.</p>
<p>All of this is measured through quantitative analytics, qualitative feedback from customers and gut instinct.</p>
<p>In the past we have described our role as making ourselves obsolete — that our clients would grow large enough to be able to hire their own in-house marketing team. Today we still retain many of these client relationships in different ways, by providing more strategic advice. Those long-term relationships are the greatest indication to us that we’ve had a valuable impact.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The global pandemic has heightened our understanding and sense of importance of our own health and the fragility of healthcare systems around the world. We’ve all come to realize how archaic many of our health processes are, and that, if we really want to, we can move at lightning speed. This is already leading to a massive acceleration in both the investment and application of artificial intelligence in the health and medical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Modern medicine in the 20th century benefited from unprec­edented scientific breakthroughs, resulting in improvements in every as­pect of healthcare. As a result, human life expectancy increased from 31 years in 1900 to 72 years in 2017. Today, I believe we are on the cusp of another healthcare revolution — one driven by artificial intelligence (AI). Advances in AI will usher in the era of modern medicine in truth.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Over the coming decades, we can expect medical diagnosis to evolve from an AI tool that provides analysis of options to an AI assistant that recommends treatments.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Digitization enables powerful AI</h2>
<p>The healthcare sector is seeing massive digitization of everything from patient records and radiology data to wearable computing and multiomics. This will redefine healthcare as a data-driven industry, and when that happens, it will leverage the power of AI — its ability to continuously improve with more data.</p>
<p>When there is enough data, AI can do a much more accurate job of diagnosis and treatment than human doctors by absorbing and checking billions of cases and outcomes. AI can take into account everyone’s data to personalize treatment accordingly, or keep up with a massive number of new drugs, treatments and studies. Doing all of this well is beyond human capabilities.</p>
<h2>AI-powered diagnosis</h2>
<p>I anticipate diagnostic AI will surpass all but the best doctors in the next 20 years. Studies have shown that AI trained on sizable data can outperform physicians in several areas of medical diagnosis regarding brain tumors, eye disease, breast cancer, skin cancer and lung cancer. Further trials are needed, but as these technologies are deployed and more data is gathered, the AI stands to outclass doctors.</p>
<p>We will eventually see diagnostic AI for general practitioners, one disease at a time, to gradually cover all diagnoses. Over time, AI may become capable of acting as your general practitioner or family doctor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors said Monday it will <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/sep/0920-bolt.html">replace battery modules</a> in recalled Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV vehicles as soon as next month now that supplier LG Chem has restarted production of cells at two Michigan factories.</p>
<p>Replacement modules, which are made up of lithium-ion battery cells, will begin shipping to dealers as soon as mid-October, the company said. Chevy Bolt EV owners will be able to bring their vehicles to the dealership, where the old modules will be swapped out for new ones.</p>
<p>GM halted production of Chevy Bolt EV and EUVs in August due to a battery pack shortage related to the widespread safety recall of the two electric vehicles. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-another-two-weeks/">production downtime</a> has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-through-mid-october/">extended twice</a> since then. Battery packs in EVs are comprised of modules.</p>
<p>The recall, which includes all Chevy Bolt EV and EUV models made since 2017, was issued after the automaker discovered two manufacturing defects in the battery cell — a torn anode tab and folded separator — that could increase the risk of fire. The fire risk prompted GM to recommend Bolt owners set the vehicle to a 90% state of charge limitation, avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of range and charge the vehicle more frequently. GM still recommends owners park their Bolt EV and EUVs outside immediately after charging and to not leave vehicles charging indoors overnight.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="voPXQijb7w"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-through-mid-october/">GM extends Chevy Bolt EV production shutdown through mid-October</a></p></blockquote>

<p>LG has new manufacturing processes in place and has worked with GM to improve its quality assurance programs to provide confidence in its batteries moving forward. GM said the battery supplier will institute these new processes in other facilities that supply cells to the automaker.</p>
<p>Doug Parks, GM&#8217;s executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, noted in a statement that resuming battery module production is a first step. However, GM&#8217;s Chevy Bolt EV problem is not entirely solved. The company must complete the replacement process for all recalled Bolts and assuage owners that the vehicles are safe to charge and park.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM is counting on a new advanced diagnostic software package to help. The company said it will launch the software package, which will need to be installed by dealers, in the next 60 days. The diagnostic software is designed to detect specific abnormalities that might indicate a damaged battery in Bolt EVs and EUVs by monitoring the battery performance.</p>
<p>The software will alert customers of any anomalies, according to GM, which said customers will be able to return to a 100% state of charge once all diagnostic processes are complete.</p>
<p>GM, which aims to add 30 new EVs to its global lineup by 2030, also must secure the battery cells it needs to power these vehicles. LG is its primary and longtime partner in this endeavor. Parks said GM will &#8220;continue to work aggressively with LG to obtain additional battery supply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-is-now-available-to-download/">release of iOS 15</a> should be a major event for mobile operating systems. And yet, this year, there’s no breakthrough feature or overarching theme that makes this release stand out. Apple has focused on quality-of-life updates as well as new features for its own apps.</p>
<p>The result is a solid update that is not going to be controversial. Some people are going to take advantage of the new Focus feature. They’ll spend a lot of time customizing their phone to make it as personal as possible. Other people are just going to miss or dismiss the new features.</p>
<p>This year’s update is also a bit different because you don’t have to update to iOS 15. If you’re fine with iOS 14, Apple won’t force you to make the jump to iOS 15. You’ll still receive security patches. Some people will simply dismiss iOS 15 altogether.</p>
<p>It seems like a small change, but it actually says a lot about the current state of iOS. Apple considers iOS as a mature platform. Just like you don’t have to update your Mac to the latest version of macOS if you don’t want to, you can now update at your own pace.</p>
<p>Also, iOS should be considered as a mature platform for app developers, so iOS 15 adoption will be slower than usual as people won’t necessarily update to iOS 15 right away. Apps should potentially work on older iOS versions for longer.</p>
<p>Of course, users will &#8220;update&#8221; to a new version of iOS when they buy a new iPhone and replace their old iPhone. But Apple has people who pre-ordered the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> and will get iOS 15.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205238" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205238" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2205238" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205238" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<h2>Focusing on you instead of your phone</h2>
<p>One of the biggest changes in iOS 15 is the ability to change your Focus from Control Center. It’s a surprisingly powerful feature with a lot of options and tweaks. I would say it doesn’t feel like an Apple feature.</p>
<p>But it’s definitely one of the most interesting features of iOS 15. Chances are you spend a lot of time with your phone, and your device requires a lot of attention from you. With this new feature, it reverses the balance and puts you back in charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do Not Disturb&#8221; users are already quite familiar with the idea that you can silence notifications when you don’t want them. If you want to keep using &#8220;moon mode&#8221; with iOS 15, you don’t have to change anything.</p>
<p>But you can now create additional Focuses. By default, Apple suggests a few Focuses — Work, Sleep, Driving, Fitness, Gaming, Mindfulness, Personal and Reading. Each Focus is customizable to your needs and you can create new Focuses from scratch.</p>
<p>When you turn on a specific Focus, it basically blocks notifications by default. You can then add people and apps so that notifications from those people and apps still go through. App developers can also mark a notification as time sensitive so that it always goes through. I hope they won’t abuse that feature.</p>
<p>There are three more settings that you can activate. First, you can optionally share that your notifications are currently silenced in Messages and compatible third-party apps. Second, you can hide home screen pages altogether. Third, you can hide notifications from the lock screen and hide badges from the home screen.</p>
<p>Focus gets particularly interesting when you realize that you can couple specific Focuses with automation features. For instance, you can automatically turn on &#8220;Sleep&#8221; at night or you can automatically turn on &#8220;Work&#8221; when you arrive at work.</p>
<p>Power users will also have a lot of fun setting up a Focus and pairing it with a Shortcut. For instance, you could use Shortcuts to open the Clock app when you turn on Sleep mode. You get it, this new feature has a lot of depth and beta users have just started scratching the surface.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205240" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205240" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2205240" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205240" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<h2>Update all apps</h2>
<p>With iOS 15, Apple has improved nearly all the default apps. Some additions are definitely nice improvements. Others have been a bit more controversial.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apple-walks-back-controversial-safari-changes-with-ios-15-beta-6-update/">the controversial one</a>: <strong>Safari</strong>’s design has been updated. But what you saw at WWDC in June doesn’t look at all like what’s shipping today. Essentially, Apple has listened to feedback and changed the user interface of its web browser during the summer.</p>
<p>By default, the address bar is now at the bottom of the screen, right above the row of buttons that let you open bookmarks, share the current page or go to the previous page. I think it works better. But if you really don’t want the address bar at the bottom, you can move it back to the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Other than that, Safari changes are all good improvements. For instance, the browser now supports traditional web extensions. It’s going to be interesting to see if popular Google Chrome extensions eventually come to Safari. Another nice new feature is the ability to create tab groups and find your tab groups from your other devices.</p>
<p><strong>FaceTime</strong> has become a versatile video-conferencing service. You can now create links, share them with friends and add them to calendar invites. For the first time, people who don’t own an Apple device will be able to join FaceTime calls from a web browser. There’s also a new Zoom view… I mean, grid view.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the big new FaceTime feature is not ready for prime time just yet. SharePlay, the feature that lets you sync audio and video playback with your friends, is going to be released later this Fall.</p>
<p>The <strong>Weather</strong> app has also been redesigned. It is now packed with a lot more information, such as precipitation maps, next-hour precipitation notifications and a new UV index. It has become a solid alternative to third-party weather apps. I still use <a href="https://bjango.com/ios/snowflake/">Snowflake</a>, but differences are smaller and smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Messages</strong> is now better integrated with other Apple apps. Whenever someone sends you an article, a photo album, a podcast or a song, you’ll see those recommendations in Apple’s other apps — Apple News, Photos, Apple Podcasts, Apple Music, etc. Once again, this is a nice addition in my testings but it’s not going to change the way you use your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Maps</strong> is getting better and better, especially if you live in San Francisco. If you haven’t used it in a few years, I encourage you to try it again. It’s now a solid alternative to Google Maps.</p>
<p>Some cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and London, are receiving new detailed maps with 3D buildings, bus lanes, sidewalks and more. It feels like navigating a video game given how detailed it is. The app has also been redesigned with new place cards, a new driving user interface and settings in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Photos</strong> is also receiving a bunch of improvements. Every year, the company is refining Memories. I’m not sure a ton of people are using this feature, but it’s better than before. There is now more information if you swipe on a photo as well, such as the shutter speed and lens that were used.</p>
<p>But the biggest change to your photo library is that you can now search for text in your photo; iOS is scanning your photos to find text and save it for Spotlight searches.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can now point your camera at text and select text from there. It is incredibly convenient if you’re looking for the restaurant address on the menu and want to share it with a friend or if you’re traveling and you want to translate some text.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205244" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205244" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2205244" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205244" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<p>There are a ton of small changes that make iOS 15 better than iOS 14. Let me list some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a compatible home key, hotel key, office key or ID card, you can now add all of those to the Wallet app.</li>
<li>You can share some health data with someone else. It can be useful if you’re living far away from your loved ones or if you want to update your healthcare team.</li>
<li>If you pay for iCloud, you’re now an iCloud+ user. In addition to storage, you get additional features: iCloud Private Relay, which is available as a beta feature, lets you browse the web with increased privacy; Hide My Email lets you create randomly generated email addresses to create new accounts around the web.</li>
<li>Similarly, if your family is using iCloud for their email addresses, you can now set up a personal domain name and set it up in iCloud.</li>
<li>iOS uses on-device speech recognition, which means you can dictate text much faster.</li>
<li>But that’s not all, iOS processes some Siri requests on your device directly, which means that you can start a timer, set an alarm or change the music instantly. It has changed the way I use Siri.</li>
<li>You can add an account recovery contact in case you get locked out of your iCloud account. This is important to convince more people to use two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Talking about two-factor authentication, Apple’s built-in password manager called &#8220;Passwords&#8221; can now save 2FA details and auto-fill 2FA fields. It works pretty much like 2FA in 1Password.</li>
<li>You can set up a legacy person for your Apple ID. I encourage you to look at that feature carefully. I’ve talked with several persons who couldn’t get their loved one’s photos after they passed away because Apple couldn’t just hand out the photos.</li>
<li>Apple has added tags to Reminders and Notes. You can also @-mention people in Notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the list of changes in iOS 15 is quite long. But it’s up to you to decide whether you want to update to iOS 15. When Apple added cut, copy and paste with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS_3">iPhone OS 3</a>, it was an obvious decision. I personally like the new features and it was worth updating. And I hope this review can help you decide whether to update or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The decreasing cost of launch and a slew of other tech innovations have brought about a renaissance in geospatial intelligence, with multiple startups aiming to capture higher-quality and more frequent images of Earth than have ever before been available.</p>
<p>Most of these startups, however, are focused on using satellites to collect data. Not so for <a href="https://nearspacelabs.com/">Near Space Labs</a>, a four-year-old company that instead aims to gather geospatial intelligence from the stratosphere, using small autonomous wind-powered robots attached to weather balloons. The company has named its platform “Swifty,” and each one is capable of reaching altitudes between 60,000 and 85,000 feet and capturing 400-1,000 square kilometers of imagery per flight.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2017 by Rema Matevosyan, Ignasi Lluch and Albert Caubet. Matevosyan, who is an applied mathematician by training and previously worked as a programmer, did her masters in Moscow. There, she started doing research in systems engineering for aerospace systems and also flew weather balloons to test aerospace hardware. “It clicked that we can fly balloons commercially and deliver a much better experience to customers than from any other alternative,” she told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Four years after launch, the company has closed a $13 million Series A round led by Crosslink Capital, with participation from Toyota Ventures and existing investors Leadout Capital and Wireframe Ventures. Near Space Labs also announced that Crosslink partner Phil Boyer has joined its board.</p>
<p>Near Space, which is headquartered in Brooklyn and Barcelona, Spain, is primarily focused on urbanized areas where change happens very rapidly. The robotic devices that attach to the balloons are manufactured at the company’s workshop in Brooklyn, which are then shipped to launch sites across the country. The company’s CTO and chief engineer are both based in Barcelona, so the hardware R&amp;D takes place over there, Matevosyan explained.</p>
<p>The company currently has eight Swifies in operation. It sells the data it collects and has developed an API through which customers can access the data via a subscription model. The company doesn’t need to have specific launch sites &#8212; Matevosyan said Swifties can launch from “anywhere at any time” &#8212; but the company does work in concert with the Federal Aviation Administration and air traffic control.</p>

<p>The main value proposition of the Swifty as opposed to the satellite, according to Matevosyan, is the resolution: From the stratosphere, the company can collect “resolutions that are 50 times better than what you would get from a satellite,” she said. “We are able to provide persistent and near real-time coverage of areas of interest that change very quickly, including large metro areas.” Plus, she said Near Space can iterate it’s technology quickly using Swifties’ “plug-and-play” model, whereas it’s not so easy to add a new sensor to a satellite fleet that’s already in orbit.</p>

<p>Near Space has booked more than 540 flights through 2022. While customers pay for the flights, the data generated from each trip is non-exclusive, so the data can be sold again and again. Looking ahead, the company will be using the funds to expand its geographical footprint and bring on a bunch of new hires. The goal, according to Matevosyan, is to democratize access to geospatial intelligence &#8212; not just for customers, but on the developer side, too. “We believe in diverse, equal and inclusive opportunities in aerospace and Earth imaging,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The effects of a warming planet, from frequent and extreme flooding to hurricanes and drought, has prompted activists and governments to take action. It’s also spurred a growing number of entrepreneurs to launch technology startups focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>At the center of this activity are the venture capitalists deciding which startup — and tech — has the best chance to decarbonize the planet while providing returns. Unlike other categories, climate tech is particularly complex because it spans so many different industries. Investors might be meeting with a founder trying to develop a plant-based fabric on a Monday and one who claims to have developed cutting-edge carbon capture technology on Tuesday.</p>
<p>TechCrunch is excited to announce that Carmichael Roberts, who co‐leads the investment committee at Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and Sean O’Sullivan, managing general partner at SOSV, will join me on our virtual stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. The virtual conference kicks off September 21 and runs through September 23.</p>
<p>Roberts and O&#8217;Sullivan will dig into what climate tech means — and what it doesn&#8217;t — their investing approach, the hottest and most promising technology within this sector and the risk of not getting it right.</p>
<p>The pair have the expertise to weigh in. Roberts is also co-founder and managing partner of Material Impact, a fund that builds resilient technology companies developing products to solve real‐world problems using innovative materials. Before he became an investor, Roberts  co‐founded several ventures, in which he served as president and CEO or chairman. He also worked in business development at GelTex Pharmaceuticals, acquired by Genzyme for $1.3 billion, and in new product and business development at Dow Chemical (formerly Union Carbide Corporation).</p>
<p>Before Sullivan joined SOSV, one of the most active venture investors in the world, he founded MapInfo. The company grew to a $200 million revenue public company with more than 1,000 employees, and popularized street mapping on computers. He also founded NetCentric, is credited as the co-creator of the term &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; and co-founded Dial2Do.</p>
<p>The panel is just one of many investment-focused discussions we&#8217;ll be having at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt 2021</a>. But as moderator, this is the one I look most forward to!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://fivetran.com">Fivetran</a>, the data connectivity startup, had a big day today. For starters it announced a $565 million investment on a $5.6 billion valuation, but it didn&#8217;t stop there. It also announced its second acquisition this year, snagging HVR, a data integration competitor that had raised more than $50 million, for $700 million in cash and stock.</p>
<p>The company last raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/fivetran-snares-100m-series-c-on-1-2b-valuation-for-data-connectivity-solution/">a $100 million Series C</a> on a $1.2 billion valuation, increasing the valuation by over 5x. As with that Series C, Andreessen Horowitz was back leading the round, with participation from other double dippers General Catalyst, CEAS Investments, Matrix Partners and other unnamed firms or individuals. New investors ICONIQ Capital, D1 Capital Partners and YC Continuity also came along for the ride. The company reports it has now raised $730 million.</p>
<p>The HVR acquisition represents a hefty investment for the startup, grabbing a company for a price that is almost equal to all the money it has raised to date, but it provides a way to expand its market quickly by buying a competitor. Earlier this year Fivetran acquired <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210624005275/en/Fivetran-Introduces-Breakthrough-for-Database-Replication">Teleport Data</a> as it continues to add functionality and customers via acquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisition — a cash and stock deal valued at $700 million — strengthens Fivetran’s market position as one of the data integration leaders for all industries and all customer types,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>While that may smack of corporate marketing-speak, there is some truth to it, as pulling data from multiple sources, sometimes in siloed legacy systems, is a huge challenge for companies, and both Fivetran and HVR have developed tools to provide the pipes to connect various data sources and put it to work across a business.</p>
<p>Data is central to a number of modern enterprise practices, including customer experience management, which takes advantage of customer data to deliver customized experiences based on what you know about them, and data is the main fuel for machine learning models, which use it to understand and learn how a process works. Fivetran and HVR provide the nuts and bolts infrastructure to move the data around to where it&#8217;s needed, connecting to various applications like Salesforce, Box or Airtable, databases like Postgres SQL or data repositories like Snowflake or Databricks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whether bigger is better remains to be seen, but Fivetran is betting that it will be in this case as it makes its way along the startup journey. The transaction has been approved by both companies&#8217; boards. The deal is still subject to standard regulatory approval, but Fivetran is expecting it to close in October.</p>

<h3>Disrupt Stage</h3>
<p><strong>Saving the World</strong></p>
<p><em>COVID-19 changed everything. It not only threatened our individual health and well-being, but it also shook industries and economies across the globe. And the same could be said about the COVID-19 vaccines. Hear from BioNTech co-founder and CEO Ugur Sahin on the process of rapidly developing the world’s most sought-after vaccine, alongside Pfizer, and the long-term potential of mRNA-based therapies. Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield Fund will join Sahin to discuss what’s next for startups in this rapidly evolving industry.</em></p>
<h3>Extra Crunch Stage</h3>
<p><strong>How to Ditch Traditional Fundraising</strong></p>
<p><em>In 2021, venture capital has never been more plentiful, but some founders still can’t break into networks or have found that traditional fundraising isn’t the best route for their business. Fortunately, alternative fundraising techniques are gathering steam as founders find paths to raise cash that diverge from the startup success stories of the past. Join the discussion with Pipe’s Harry Hurst, Accel’s Arun Mathew and Clearco’s Michele Romanow.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Breakout Session</h3>
<p><strong>Demo Derby — How startups are disrupting the status quo with innovative data analytics, AI and modern app development</strong></p>
<p><em>Startups need to move quickly and focus limited resources on areas where they can differentiate. In this fast-paced session, learn from startups and Google experts how you can leverage Google technologies to serve customers better and get to market more quickly.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/toast-raises-ipo-price-range-providing-a-monday-bump-to-fintech-valuations/">examined</a> the new IPO price range for Toast. The U.S. software-and-fintech company moved its valuation materially higher in anticipation of pricing tomorrow after the bell and trading on Wednesday. It was not alone in doing so.</p>
<p>Freshworks is also targeting a higher IPO price range, it disclosed today in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001544522/000162828021018866/freshworkss-1a3.htm">fresh SEC filing</a>. The customer-service-focused software firm now expects to charge between $32 and $34 per share in its debut, up from the $28 to $32 per-share range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">that it initially disclosed</a>.</p>
<p>Doing some back-of-the-envelope math, Freshworks&#8217; IPO valuation could just pass the $10 billion mark, calculated on a fully diluted basis. Its simple IPO valuations, while rising, are lower than that figure.</p>
<p>Mathing that out, Freshworks expects to have 284,283,200 shares outstanding when public, inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option, but not inclusive of vested shares present in RSUs or options. At its new IPO price range, Freshworks would be worth between $9.1 billion and $9.7 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Toast will have to post pretty damn strong growth numbers for it to keep its multiple up. But the market appears willing to take that risk.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. technology unicorn Toast filed a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001650164/000119312521276664/d166297ds1a.htm">new S-1 document</a> this morning detailing a higher IPO price range for its shares. The more expensive range indicates that Toast may be worth more in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/toast-looks-toward-18b-valuation-in-upcoming-ipo/">its debut than it initially expected</a>, a bullish sign for technology companies more broadly.</p>
<p>Toast&#8217;s rising valuation may provide a boon to two different subsectors of technology: software and fintech. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">restaurant-focused Toast</a> sells software on a recurring basis (SaaS) to restaurants while also providing financial technology solutions. And while it is best known as a software company that dabbles in hardware, Boston-based Toast generates the bulk of its aggregate top line from financial services.</p>
<p>Software revenues are valuable thanks to their high margins and recurring structure. Toast&#8217;s financial-services revenues, by contrast, are largely transaction-based and sport lower gross margins. The company&#8217;s IPO price, then, could help the private markets more fairly price startups offering their own blend of software-and-fintech incomes.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;vertical SaaS&#8221; model, in which startups build software tailored to one particular industry or another, has become a somewhat two-part business effort; many startups today are pursuing both the sale of software along with fintech revenues. Toast&#8217;s IPO, then, could operate as a bellwether of sorts for a host of startups.</p>
<p>To see Toast raise its range, therefore, got our eyebrows up. Let&#8217;s talk money.</p>
<h2>Toast&#8217;s new IPO range</h2>
<p>From a previous range of $30 to $33, Toast now expects to price its IPO between $34 and $36.</p>
<p>Toast now expects its IPO price to clear its previous upper-end guidance at the low end of its new range. That&#8217;s bullish &#8212; and indicative of a thus-far receptive market for the company&#8217;s equity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase efforts to play hardball with the Securities and Exchange Commission didn&#8217;t last too long. The cryptocurrency exchange had garnered the ire of the regulatory commission over its plans to launch a crypto lending product, with the SEC sending the company a Wells notice which indicated that the agency would sue Coinbase if they launched their crypto lending product called Lend.</p>
<p>Less than a couple weeks after publishing a defiant blog post titled &#8220;<span class="ax"><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009">The SEC has told us it wants to sue us over Lend. We don’t know why.</a>&#8221; the company quietly announced over the weekend that it will not be launching the Lend product after all.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0TChIPNjPb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/sec-wants-to-regulate-coinbases-crypto-yield-product-coinbase-disagrees/">SEC wants to regulate Coinbase’s crypto yield product, Coinbase disagrees</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SEC wants to regulate Coinbase’s crypto yield product, Coinbase disagrees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/sec-wants-to-regulate-coinbases-crypto-yield-product-coinbase-disagrees/embed/#?secret=0TChIPNjPb" data-secret="0TChIPNjPb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On Friday, the company quietly added an update to its <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/sign-up-to-earn-4-apy-on-usd-coin-with-coinbase-cdad79e5f5eb">launch post for Lend</a>, detailing in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="eea5" class="ez bw eb bm b fa fb fc fd fe ff fg fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq">As we continue our work to seek regulatory clarity for the crypto industry as a whole, we’ve made the difficult decision not to launch the USDC APY program announced below. We have also discontinued the waitlist for this program as we turn our work to what comes next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="ez bw eb bm b fa fb fc fd fe ff fg fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq">Lend was far from an anomaly in the crypto exchange world; investors can find similar functionality in platforms like Gemini, which allow users to lend their crypto holdings back to the exchange for the promise of earning interest rates that are much, much higher than traditional savings accounts offer. Coinbase planned to launch the Lend product with the functionality for users to stake the stablecoin USDC and earn (<em>as a starting rate</em>) 4% APY.</p>
<p>The SEC, which has long complained about the limited resources at its disposal, has pursued a limited set of cases against crypto products but doesn&#8217;t seem to have been quite comfortable with the fact that users were essentially forfeiting custody of their coins to Coinbase and its partners. They also indicated to Coinbase that the Lend product did indeed involve a security. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Coinbase, which has made the fact that it coordinates closely with the regulatory bodies part of its brand, had been trying to take things slowly while sticking to their belief that the product wasn&#8217;t security-related.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ Millions of crypto holders have been earning yield on their assets over the last few years. It makes sense, if you want to lend out your funds, you can earn a return. Everyone seems happy.</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439333176070153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The SEC told us they consider Lend to involve a security, but wouldn’t say why or how they’d reached that conclusion. Rather than get discouraged, we chose to continue taking things slowly. In June, we announced our Lend program publicly and opened a waitlist but did not set a public launch date. But once again, we got no explanation from the SEC. Instead, they opened a formal investigation,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#8221; a recent Coinbase company blog post read.</span></p>
<p>The big question is what this means for the other crypto exchanges and whether this act signals the start of a more aggressive streak for SEC chief Gary Gensler&#8217;s commission in the crypto world, especially in regards to DeFi mechanics.</p>
<p>Coinbase stock was dropping in intraday trading Monday, alongside a significant pullback in the price of bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has just released the final version of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/">iOS 15</a>, the next major version of the operating system for the iPhone. It is a free download and it works with the iPhone 6s or later, both generations of iPhone SE and the most recent iPod touch model (iPad users will also be able to update to <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-15/">iPadOS 15</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-8/">watchOS 8</a> today).</p>
<p>The biggest change of iOS 15 is a new Focus mode. In addition to “Do not disturb,” you can configure various modes — you can choose apps and people you want notifications from and change your focus depending on what you’re doing. For instance, you can create a Work mode, a Sleep mode, a Workout mode, etc.</p>
<p>There are many new features across the board, such as a new Weather app, updated maps in Apple Maps, an improved version of FaceTime, and more. Safari also has a brand-new look.</p>
<p>The new version of iOS also scans your photos for text. Called Live Text, this feature lets you highlight, copy and paste text in photos. It could be a nice accessibility feature as well; iOS is going to leverage that info for Spotlight. You can search for text in your photos directly in Spotlight and it’ll pull out relevant photos. These features are handled on-device directly.</p>
<p>Paid iCloud users have been upgraded to iCloud+. In addition to more storage, iCloud+ subscribers get a handful of new features. iCloud Private Relay, which is available as a beta feature, lets you browse the web with increased privacy. Hide My Email lets you create randomly generated email addresses to create new accounts around the web. ICloud email users can also switch to a personal domain name.</p>
<p>The update is currently rolling out and is available both over-the-air in the Settings app, and by plugging your device to your computer for a wired update. But first, back up your device. Make sure your iCloud backup is up to date by opening the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad and tapping on your account information at the top and then on your device name. Additionally, you can also plug your iOS device to your computer to do a manual backup in Finder or iTunes for Windows (or do both, really).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Don’t forget to encrypt your backup in iTunes. It is much safer if somebody hacks your computer. And encrypted backups include saved passwords and health data. This way, you don’t have to reconnect to all your online accounts.</p>
<p>Once this is done, you should go to the Settings app, then &#8220;General&#8221; and then &#8220;Software Update.&#8221; You should see &#8220;Update Requested…&#8221; It will then automatically start downloading once the download is available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The crypto space has matured so much in so little time, but even amid a blockbuster year, it&#8217;s still facing down the existential risk of aggressive regulation from U.S. agencies.</p>
<p>All the while, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has been tirelessly building out a major crypto arm dedicated to ensuring that the firm will be an institutional powerhouse in the world of cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance and broader &#8220;Web3&#8221; technologies for years to come. Its early network of investments power much of the crypto world&#8217;s earliest success stories, but the firm has bigger ambitions yet. The firm&#8217;s efforts here are co-led by General Partner Katie Haun &#8212; who was once a federal prosecutor tackling fraud and cyber crime alongside top government agencies.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to have Haun join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt this year (September 21-23)</a>, where we&#8217;ll be asking her about all things crypto regulation and what the firm hopes to accomplish with its new, massive $2.2 billion crypto fund. Beyond the firm&#8217;s aggressive fund sizes and rapid deal-making in the crypto space, the firm&#8217;s partners &#8212; including Haun &#8212; have been among the most vocal about the potentially transformative nature of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>This has gotten more attention in 2021 when currencies have surged, fallen and surged again, minting more and more crypto millionaires while sucking in retail investors clamoring to get a piece of the hot space. It&#8217;s also been a year where the crypto space&#8217;s diversity has emerged with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) gaining attention, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) catching global attention and decentralized finance (DeFi) threatening to upend financial institutions.</p>
<p>Haun serves on the boards of Coinbase and OpenSea. Coinbase went public this year and delivered one of the firm&#8217;s biggest payouts ever, while OpenSea is the dominant platform in the ever-shifting and ever-surging world of NFTs. Both companies are facing controversies on their quest toward crypto greatness. This month, Coinbase detailed that the SEC plans to sue it over the company&#8217;s upcoming lending feature. Meanwhile, OpenSea is grappling with the resignation of a highly visible executive who was discovered to be abusing company information to trade NFTs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a controversial space with plenty of money to be had, and Andreessen Horowitz has made a lot of it.</p>
<p>We look forward to chatting with Haun, alongside a whole host of amazing speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=rrpost">Disrupt</a>, including Canva CEO Melanie Perkins, actor-entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds</a> and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The show is coming up fast. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Get your ticket now</a> for less than $100 before the price increases tonight &#8212; and we’ll see you soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six-year-old Bangalore-based fintech Razorpay, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">valued at $3 billion in a financing round in April</a> this year, has courted one more high-profile investor: Salesforce Ventures.</p>
<p>Razorpay said on Monday it has received a &#8220;strategic investment&#8221; from the venture arm of the American enterprise giant. The investment will help the startup &#8220;further strengthen its presence in the business banking space,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The two firms didn&#8217;t disclose the size of the investment, but the Sequoia Capital India-backed startup said the deal will &#8220;make an impactful contribution to the industry and drive adoption and financial growth for underserved small businesses in the next twelve months.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://razorpay.com">Razorpay</a> accepts, processes and disburses money online for small businesses and enterprises — essentially everything Stripe does in the U.S. and several other developed markets. But the Indian startup’s offering goes much further than that: in recent years, Razorpay has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/razorpay-credit-card-current-account-neo-bank/">launched a neobanking platform</a> to issue corporate credit cards, and it also offers businesses working capital.</p>
<p>With the global giant Stripe still nowhere in the Indian picture, Razorpay has grown to become the clear market leader and has started to expand to the Southeast Asian market.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Razorpay, we want to make further strides on the idea of investing in India’s digital future and building an intelligent payment and banking infrastructure for the new-world. We are delighted to associate with Salesforce Ventures and Salesforce more broadly in India,&#8221; said Harshil Mathur, co-founder and chief executive of the fintech startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am certain that this investment, along with support from our existing investors, will help build an ecosystem for a hassle-free, easy-to-integrate payments and banking experience. We also hope to expand, build new products and deliver this experience to businesses in South East Asian countries too.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Monday&#8217;s deal is Salesforce Ventures&#8217; second investment in the Indian startup ecosystem. The firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/salesforce-leads-15-million-investment-round-in-indian-hr-tech-platform-darwinbox/">led a $15 million Series C</a> financing round in Hyderabad-headquartered Darwinbox earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The journey towards a &#8216;less-cash&#8217; economy has been accelerated with the pandemic. The rapid growth in digital payments over the last year has opened doors for technology innovation and Razorpay has been emerging as the company of choice for a lot of e-commerce businesses,&#8221; said Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairperson and chief executive of Salesforce India, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to support Razorpay in their journey to revolutionize digital finance not only in India, but globally as well,&#8221; added Bhattacharya, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/salesforce-hires-former-banker-arundhati-bhattacharya-as-chairperson-and-ceo-of-india-business/">joined the firm last year</a>.</p>
<p>The Indian startup, which became a unicorn a year ago, said it has witnessed a 40-45% month-on-month growth in recent months. The startup is currently in the market to raise a new financing round and is negotiating a considerably larger valuation bump over the current value, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Scores of corporate giants, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, have started to chase strategic investments in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market. Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/microsoft-confirms-investment-in-indias-oyo-in-a-multi-year-strategic-deal-to-co-develop-travel-and-hospitality-products/">inked a strategic deal</a> with Indian budget hotel chain Oyo, they confirmed this month.</p>
<p>India has produced a record 27 unicorns this year so far, up from 11 last year, as many high-profile global investors, including Tiger Global, Falcon Edge Capital, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Coatue Management, increase the pace of their investments in the South Asian market. And the list continues to grow: a16z is in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/andreessen-horowitz-a16z-first-india-investment/">advanced stages to back Indian crypto startup CoinSwitch Kuber</a>, TechCrunch reported last week.</p>

The web version of the app can detect when someone is underexposed due to bad lighting. Meet will then increase the brightness so it&#8217;s easier to see your cohorts and perhaps make your feed clearer if you have a terrible webcam.</p>
<p>The low-light mode hit the Google Meet iOS and Android mobile apps <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/04/video-conference-anywhere-with-low.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>last year</ins></a>. It uses AI to examine light levels and tweak the brightness. There&#8217;s no admin control for the feature, though users will be able to <a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9302964?ref_topic=7294099" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>switch it off</ins></a> — Google says having it enabled might slow down your device.</p>

Google is rolling it out to Rapid Release domains starting today and Scheduled Release domains on October 4th. The rollout will take up to 15 days in both cases, so by mid-October, bad webcam feeds could be a thing of the past on Meet calls.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">September arrived in the blink of an eye, and October 27 — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=groupdiscountpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=groupdiscountpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> to be precise — is hot on its heels. Now’s the time to gather your team and strategize how you’ll cover the day-long event to make as many connections and discover as many opportunities as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take advantage of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=groupdiscountpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=groupdiscountpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the early-bird group discount</a>. When you buy passes for four or more people, you pay just $45 each — that’s $30 off each pass. Sweet!</p>
<p>Don’t dilly-dally or shillyshally. The early-bird price <strong>expires on October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Your pass may be discounted, but you’ll get the full TC Sessions experience — all the speakers, demos, networking and breakout sessions. Plus, video-on-demand means you can catch up later on anything you miss, when it fits your schedule.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/announcing-the-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-saas/">the event agenda</a> or read more about just some of the many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/check-out-whos-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-2021/">people and companies</a> coming to TC Sessions: SaaS. <strong>Note:</strong> We’re adding new speakers and presentations to the event agenda every week, and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#333d7903-8740-45ee-a389-8e0332035e57">sign up here for updates</a>.</p>
<p>As a team, you can cover more ground. Tune in to a main-stage panel discussion while one colleague dives into a breakout session and another sets up a 1:1 product demo or taps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/expand-your-saas-empire-network-with-crunchmatch-at-tc-sessions-saas-2021/">CrunchMatch</a> to connect with potential investors. You might go faster alone, but you’ll go further together.</p>
<p>You can bet the industry’s top experts will be in the virtual house covering both the benefits and challenges of SaaS: the Next Generation. Here are just two examples:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>SaaS Security, Today and Tomorrow:</strong> Enterprises face a constant stream of threats, from nation states to cybercriminals and corporate insiders. After a year where billions worked from home and the cloud reigned supreme, startups and corporations alike can’t afford to stay off the security pulse. Edna Conway, vice president, chief security &amp; risk officer, Azure, Microsoft, and Olivia Rose, CISO, VP of IT &amp; security, Amplitude, discuss what SaaS startups need to know about security now, and in the future.</li>
<li><strong>How Startups are Turning Data into Software Gold:</strong> The era of big data is behind us. Today’s leading SaaS startups are working with data instead of merely fighting to help customers collect information. Jenn Knight (AgentSync), Barr Moses (Monte Carlo) and Dan Wright (DataRobot), leaders of three data-focused startups, will discuss how today’s SaaS companies leverage data to build new companies, attack new problems and, of course, scale like mad.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Bzaar, a business-to-business cross-border marketplace, is connecting retailers with over 50 export-ready manufacturers in India.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small businesses in the U.S. now have a new way to source home and lifestyle goods from new manufacturers. <a href="https://www.bzaar.com/">Bzaar</a>, a business-to-business cross-border marketplace, is connecting retailers with over 50 export-ready manufacturers in India.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based company announced Monday that it raised $4 million in seed funding, led by Canaan Partners, and including angel investors Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal, PhonePe founders Sameer Nigam and Rahul Chari, Addition founder Lee Fixel and Helion Ventures co-founder Ashish Gupta.</p>
<p>Nishant Verman and Prasanth Nair co-founded Bzaar in 2020 and consider their company to be like a “fair without borders,” Verman put it. Prior to founding Bzaar, Verman was at Bangalore-based Flipkart until it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/walmart-confirms-16b-flipkart-investment-giving-it-77-in-indias-e-commerce-leader/">acquired by Walmart in 2018</a>. He then was at Canaan Partners in the U.S.</p>
<p>“We think the next 10 years of global trade will be different from the last 100 years,” he added. “That’s why we think this business needs to exist.”</p>
<p>Traditionally, small U.S. buyers did not have feet on the ground in manufacturing hubs, like China, to manage shipments of goods in the same way that large retailers did. Then Alibaba came along in the late 1990s and began acting as a gatekeeper for cross-border purchases, Verman said. <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china#:~:text=U.S.%20goods%20imports%20from%20China,U.S.%20goods%20imports%20in%202019.">U.S. goods imports from China</a> totaled $451.7 billion in 2019, while <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/south-central-asia/india">U.S. goods imports from India</a> in 2019 were $87.4 billion.</p>

<p>Small buyers could buy home and lifestyle goods, but it was typically through the same sellers, and there was not often a unique selection, nor were goods available handmade or using organic materials, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Bzaar, small buyers can purchase over 10,000 wholesale goods on its marketplace from other countries like India and Southeast Asia. The company guarantees products arrive within two weeks and manage all of the packaging logistics and buyer protection.</p>
<p>Verman and Nair launched the marketplace in April and had thousands users in three continents purchasing from the platform within six months. Meanwhile, products on Bzaar are up to 50% cheaper than domestic U.S. platforms, while SKU selection is growing doubling every month, Verman said.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to invest in marketing to get in front of buyers and invest on its technology to advance its cataloging feature so that goods pass through customs seamlessly. Wanting to provide new features for its small business customers, Verman also intends to create a credit feature to enable buyers to pay in installments or up to 90 days later.</p>
<p>“We feel this is a once-in-a-lifetime shift in how global trade works,” he added. “You need the right team in place to do this because the problem is quite complex to take products from a small town in Vietnam to Nashville. With our infrastructure in place, the good news is there are already shops and buyers, and we are stitching them together to give buyers a seamless experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Applications networking company F5 has announced it’s acquiring Threat Stack, a Boston-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloud-security/">cloud security</a> and compliance startup, for $68 million.</p>
<p>The deal, which comes months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/f5-snags-volterra-multi-cloud-management-startup-for-500m/">F5 bought multi-cloud management startup Volterra for $500 million</a>, sees the 25-year-old company looking to bolster its cloud security portfolio as applications become a growing focus for cybercriminals. Businesses lose more than $100 billion a year to attacks targeting digital experiences, F5 says, and these experiences are increasingly powered by applications distributed across multiple environments and interconnected through APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/threat-stack">Threat Stack</a>, which was founded in November 2012 and has since amassed more than $70 million across six funding rounds, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/threat-stack-secures-45-million-investment-with-spotlight-shining-brightly-on-security/">$45 million Series C round led by F-Prime Capital Partners and Eight Roads Ventures</a>, specializes in cloud security for applications and provides customers with real-time threat detection for cloud infrastructure and workloads. Unlike many cloud security tools that kick in after an intrusion, Threat Stack takes a more proactive approach, alerting organizations to all known vulnerabilities and providing a report on the holes that need to be plugged.</p>
<p>The startup’s intrusion detection platform, the Threat Stack Cloud Security Platform, works across cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud and containerized environments, and is perhaps best known for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/slack/">Slack</a> integration that alerts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/devops/">DevOps</a> teams to security concerns in real time. Threat Stack has a number of big-name customers, according to its website, including Glassdoor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ping-identity/">Ping Identity</a> and Proofpoint.</p>
<p>F5 says that integrating its application and API protection solutions with Threat Stack’s cloud security capabilities and expertise will enhance visibility across application infrastructure and workloads, making it easier for customers to adopt consistent security in any cloud.</p>
<p>“Applications are the backbone of today’s modern businesses, and protecting them is mission-critical for our customers,” said Haiyan Song, EVP of Security at F5. “Threat Stack brings technology and talent that will strengthen F5’s security capabilities and further our adaptive applications vision with broader cloud observability and actionable security insights for customers.”</p>
<p>The acquisition, which is expected to close in F5&#8217;s first-quarter fiscal year 2022, is subject to closing conditions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The GitLab debut is set to make a lot of funds material coin.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Picking up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/">where we left off Friday</a>, let&#8217;s spend some more time in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653482/000162828021018818/gitlab-sx1.htm#i359e99a49d03416a83f04e786aaaf108_61">the GitLab IPO filing</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be an IPO week, mind; Toast and Freshworks are set to price Tuesday after the close of trading and begin to float on Wednesday. Expect final notes on the value of each and reports on how they trade when they do. The Exchange will also try to get on calls with the CEOs. But because it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> week, things are going to be a little chaotic.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But that&#8217;s tomorrow. This morning, we&#8217;re digging back into developer toolkit GitLab and its impending IPO. Let&#8217;s start with a dive into the venture capital players that are going to make out in its public offering. And for the sake of having fun on a Monday, we&#8217;ll look back at the GitHub-Microsoft deal. The former CTO of GitHub dropped some interesting data on the company&#8217;s historical results that we can use to back into what the deal would be worth today if it happened.</p>

And we&#8217;ll close with an examination of GitLab&#8217;s quarterly data to see if a more narrow view of the company&#8217;s operating results tells us anything useful. Let&#8217;s have some fun!</p>
<h2>GitLab&#8217;s rich list</h2>
<p>As a private company, GitLab raised huge sums of capital &#8212; more than $400 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gitlab-com/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>. The capital came in increasingly large chunks from the company&#8217;s seed rounds back in 2015 through its late 2019 Series E.</p>
<p>Khosla Ventures led the company&#8217;s early rounds before GV, Goldman Sachs and ICONIQ Capital took the baton.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those names are the ones we can spy on in the company&#8217;s major shareholder list. From the GitLab S-1 filing, what follows are share counts and percentage ownership stakes for the company&#8217;s investors that own more than 5% of its stock:</p>
<ul>
<li>August Capital: 14,931,200 Class B shares, or 11.1% of that equity class.</li>
<li>GV: 8,888,776 Class B shares, or 6.6% of that equity class.</li>
<li>ICONIQ: 15,472,204 Class B shares, or 11.6% of that equity class.</li>
<li>ICONIQ: 1,150,784 Class A shares, or 100% of that equity class (to be diluted in IPO).</li>
<li>Khosla: 19,028,320 Class B shares, or 14.1% of that equity class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that GitLab was valued at $6 billion earlier this year in a secondary transaction, the percentages above convert to huge sums. August Capital, for example, at that price point, is set to reap north of $600 million. That&#8217;s bigger than the entire fund from which it snagged ownership, the firm&#8217;s $450 million Fund VII.</p>
