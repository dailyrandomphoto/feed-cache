										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has enjoyed unrivaled reach in India for years. By mid-2019, the Facebook-owned app had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/whatsapp-india-users-400-million/">amassed over 400 million users in the country</a>. Its closest app rival at the time was YouTube, which, according to the company’s own statement and data from mobile insight firm App Annie, had about 260 million users in India then.</p>
<p>Things have changed dramatically since.</p>
<p>In the month of December, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had 425 million monthly active users on Android phones and tablets in India, according to App Annie, the data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch. In comparison, WhatsApp had 422 million monthly active users on Android in India last month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Factoring in the traction both these apps have garnered on iOS devices, WhatsApp still assumes a lead in India with 459 million active users<sup>1</sup>, but YouTube is not too far behind with 452 million users.</p>
<p>With China keeping its doors closed to U.S. tech giants, India emerged as the top market for Silicon Valley and Chinese companies looking to continue their growth in the last decade. India had about 50 million internet users in 2010, but it ended the decade with more than 600 million. Google and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> played their part to make this happen.</p>
<p>In the last four years, both Google and Facebook have invested in ways to bring the internet to people who are offline in India, a country of nearly 1.4 billion people. Google kickstarted a project to bring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/google-says-over-8-million-people-use-its-free-wifi-service-at-railway-stations-in-india/">Wi-Fi to 400 railway stations</a> in the country and planned to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/google-station-indonesia/">extend this program to other public places</a>. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/17/save-free-basics/?_ga=2.76173149.954111183.1610362407-37075995.1609086401">launched Free Basics in India</a>, and then &#8212; after the program was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/08/india-blocks-facebook-freebasics-net-neutrality/">banned in the country</a> &#8212; it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/facebooks-express-wi-fi-launches-commercially-in-india/">launched Express Wi-Fi</a>.</p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook, which identify India as their biggest market by users, have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">scaled down on their connectivity efforts</a> in recent years after India&#8217;s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, took it upon himself to bring the country online. After he succeeded, both the companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">bought multibillion-dollar</a> stakes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">in his firm</a>, Jio Platforms, which has amassed over 400 million subscribers.</p>
<p>Jio Platforms&#8217; cut-rate mobile data tariff has allowed hundreds of millions of people in India, where much of the online user base was previously too conscious about how much data they spent on the internet, to consume, worry-free, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/09/netflixs-biggest-competition-isnt-sleep-its-youtube/">hours of content on YouTube</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/tiktok-education-edutok-india/">other video platforms</a> in recent years. This growth might explain why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">Google is doubling down</a> on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">short-video apps</a>.</p>
<p>The new figures shared with TechCrunch illustrate a number of other findings about the Indian market. Even as WhatsApp’s growth has slowed<sup>2</sup> in India, it continues to enjoy an unprecedented loyalty among its users.</p>
<p>More than 95% of WhatsApp’s monthly active users in India use the app each day, and nearly its entire user base checks the app at least once a week. In comparison, three-fourths of YouTube’s monthly active users in India are also its daily active users.</p>
<p>The data also showed that Google’s eponymous app as well as Chrome &#8212; both of which, like YouTube, ship pre-installed<sup>3</sup> on most Android smartphones &#8212; has also surpassed over 400 million monthly active users in India in recent months. Facebook&#8217;s app, in comparison, had about 325 million monthly active users in India last month.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, a Google spokesperson pointed TechCrunch to <a href="https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital/youtube-reaches-over-325-million-18-viewers-in-india/78906708">a report from Comscore last year</a>, which estimated that YouTube had about 325 million monthly unique users in India in May 2020.</p>
<p>A separate report by research firm Media Partners Asia on Monday estimated that YouTube commanded 43% of the revenue generated in the online video market in India last year (about $1.4 billion). Disney+ Hotstar assumed 16% of the market, while Netflix had 14%.</p>

<hr />
<h5><em><sup>1 For simplicity, I have not factored in the traction WhatsApp Business and YouTube Kids apps have received in India. WhatsApp and YouTube also maintain apps on KaiOS, which powers JioPhone feature handsets in India. At last count &#8212; which was a long time ago &#8212; more than 40 million JioPhone handsets had shipped in India. TechCrunch could not determine the inroads any app has made on this platform. Additionally, the figures of YouTube on Android (phones and tablets) and iOS (iPhone and iPad) will likely have an overlap. The same is not true of WhatsApp, which restricts one phone number to one account. So if I have WhatsApp installed on an iPhone with my primary phone number, I can&#8217;t use WhatsApp with the same number on an Android phone &#8212; at least not concurrently.</sup></em></h5>
<h5><em><sup>2 WhatsApp Business appears to be growing fine, having amassed over 50 million users in India. And some caveats from No. 1 also apply here.</sup></em></h5>
<h5><em><sup>3 Users still have to engage with the app for App Annie and other mobile insight firms to count them as active. So while pre-installing the app provides Google an unprecedented distribution, their apps still have to win over users.</sup></em></h5>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of last week&#8217;s violence at the U.S. Capitol, Facebook today announced it will be taking additional steps to removing content referencing the phrase &#8220;stop the steal&#8221; on its platform. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election#:~:text=Stop%20the%20Steal%20is%20a,former%20vice%20president%20Joe%20Biden.">phrase</a> is associated with the right-wing campaign that falsely alleges the democratic U.S. elections have been rigged and aims to keep Trump in power by any means necessary, including now, violent insurrection. Facebook had previously removed some of the original Stop the Steal groups in November, and says it has continued to remove Pages, groups and events that violate its policies, including calls for violence.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">previously reported,</a> Facebook had also began to block election conspiracy hashtags back in November 2020, including #sharpiegate and #stopthesteal. Searches for those would not return groups or posts, as result.</p>
<p>However, the cleanup effort was not as widespread or as ongoing as Facebook would have you believe. As of the time of writing, we&#8217;re aware of several active Facebook Groups that are still literally called &#8220;stop the steal,&#8221; for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook says its decision to take this further action has to do with the increased calls for violence in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been allowing robust conversations related to the election outcome and that will continue,&#8221; explained Facebook in an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/">announcement</a> co-authored by Facebook VP of Integrity, Guy Rosen, and Monika Bickert, VP Global Policy Management. &#8220;But with continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the U.S. presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday’s violence in D.C., we’re taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration,&#8221; the blog post read.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may take some time to scale up our enforcement of this new step but we have already removed a significant number of posts,&#8221; the authors noted.</p>
<p>The company clearly wants to distance itself from being thought of as one of the platforms was used by the organizers of the U.S. Capitol riot. In fact, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4kbd5KqbIM&amp;amp;ab_channel=Reuters">interview</a> with Reuters on Monday that the riot <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/sandberg-says-us-capitol-riot-was-not-organized-on-facebook.html">was &#8220;largely organized&#8221; on other internet services</a>, not Facebook. She said that Facebook had taken down content from fringe groups, like QAnon, as well as Proud Boys and Stop the Steal groups, and anything that was talking about violence.</p>
<p>Facebook is not the only mainstream social platform actively removing content that violates its terms as the ramifications of social media&#8217;s more permissive policies have now resulted in violent protests and an attempted coup, as well as people&#8217;s deaths.</p>
<p>Several social media companies have also now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">removed</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">Trump</a> from their platforms, as Congress weighs impeachment for his incitement of violence. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">app</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">stores</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">web services provider</a> for the alternative social network Parler have also now given it the boot for the hate speech and calls for violence it hosted, as well.</p>
<p>Facebook says it will continue to staff its Integrity Operations Center on a 24/7 basis at least through January 22 in order to monitor and respond to threats in real time. This time frame is likely because the FBI now is warning of plans for armed protests in all 50 state capitals and Washington in the days leading up to President-Elect Joe Biden&#8217;s inauguration on Jan. 20, according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-01-11/fbi-warns-of-plans-for-nationwide-armed-protests-next-week">a report this morning from the AP.</a> This is why Facebook&#8217;s Integrity Operations Center will need to be highly available during these days.</p>
<p>The Center had already been active ahead of Georgia&#8217;s runoff elections and Congress&#8217;s counting of the Electoral College votes. Its operations were extended due the Capitol protests, Facebook says.</p>
<p>The company notes, too, it will continue to work with law enforcement to remove content, disable accounts and respond to legal requests for user data.</p>

	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Of the Inc. 5000 companies, <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/currents/three-facts-you-probably-didnt-know-about-and-venture-capital-and-entrepreneurship/">only</a> 6.5% raised money from VCs and 7.7% raised from angels. Where else can fast-growing companies get funding?</p>
<p>More and more startups are pursuing <a href="http://teten.com/rbi">revenue-based VCs</a>, but it&#8217;s not a good fit for everyone. A new category of investors has emerged offering a hybrid between VC and revenue-based investment (RBI), which we call “flexible VC.&#8221;</p>
<p>From RBI, flexible VCs borrow the ability to reap meaningful returns without demanding founders build for an exit. From traditional equity VC, flexible VC borrows the option to pursue and reap the rewards of an outsized exit. Every flexible VC structure allows founders to access immediate risk capital while preserving exit, growth trajectory and ownership optionality.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Before raising capital, we encourage founders to dig into the nuances between different flexible VC structures.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Our categorization is not a technical one. Rather, we want to accommodate the wide variety of instruments currently offered by flexible VC investors, detailed below. As two fund managers employing flexible VC, we think it is a healthy addition to the ecosystem and will yield more predictable and stable healthy returns for investors.</p>
<h2>Flexible VC 101: Equity meets revenue share</h2>
<p>This is currently the most common investment structure: The flexible VC investor purchases either equity ownership, or a convertible right to equity, and a right to regularly scheduled payments based on a percentage of revenues.</p>
<p>By tying payments to actual revenues, founders and investors remain aligned around the company’s real-time performance, good or bad.</p>
<p>“Too often, investment structures force the management team to make decisions between misaligned growth and investment (return) objectives. This structure allows for alignment on the front end, and real-time flexibility for performance metrics,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samirasalman/">Samira Salman</a>, a family office investor and advisor.</p>
<p>Payments are commonly delayed for a grace period of 12-36 months. John Berger, director of Operations and Impact Solutions at <a href="https://toniic.com/">Toniic</a>, observed that this has clear investor benefits: “The grace period became a feature because it benefits investors in regions like the U.S. where there can be tax differences between short- and long-term gains. It has moved from its origins as a tax benefit and can be viewed as a feature that benefits founders.” After the grace period, the return payments begin, often lasting until a return cap is hit, such as 2-5 times the original investment.</p>
<p>To account for these revenue share payments, the investor’s ownership (or convertible right to ownership) is simultaneously reduced. Once the return cap is reached, the investor is typically left with a residual stake — a fraction of the pre-revenue share ownership. At any point, should the founder wish to pursue a traditional equity VC round, or get bought, the revenue share is paused, and the investor’s then-current ownership converts to equate to a traditional equity VC investor.</p>
<h2>Flexible VC 102: Variations</h2>
<p>Flexible VCs have created structures based on other company performance metrics than revenues, such as profits or founder salaries. These different company performance metrics provide a slight variation in how the investor and founder relationship is defined. For example, profit-sharing structures ensure payments do not begin until the company is profitable, though likely delaying returns to the investor and complicating payment calculations.</p>
<p>Similarly, when flexible VC structures are based off of the founder’s own compensation (often via salary or dividends), investors are specifically tying their returns to the financial success of the founder. This translates less directly to company performance compared to a revenue or profit share, but offers uniquely personal alignment. These variations in founder alignment allow flexible VCs to specialize in the types of companies they work with.</p>
<h2>The state of flexible VC</h2>
<p>In all these cases, capital is provided to fuel forecasted growth without creating a commitment to a particular vision for future funding rounds, exit goals and associated blitzscaling. The founder retains full control over whether they want to optimize for hypergrowth (usually at the expense of profitability) or for organic, profitable growth. Flexible VC opens up a new risk capital option for bootstrappers, minorities, family-owned and countless other founder segments left out by the traditional funding landscape.</p>
<p>A range of small VCs are deploying with flexible VC structures, but we believe the total amount of AUM deployed with this strategy is well under $50 million. Similar to the explosion of seed funds in the past decade, we (and some <a href="https://medium.com/blue-future-partners/the-rise-of-challenger-vcs-what-lps-need-to-know-about-this-new-bet-in-early-stage-venture-109348d33a9e">limited partners too</a>) believe these Flexible VCs are on the forefront of what will become a major segment of the venture ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Flexible VC versus other venture capital models</h2>
<p>Flexible VC investors offer founders some of the same advantages as equity VCs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aligned incentives.</strong> Whether it is a breakout success or complete failure and loss of capital, investors are along for the ride. When the company hits potholes, flexible VC investors usually don’t have the nuclear options of firing management and/or doing a recapitalization. Their only option is to work with management to try to fix the problems.</li>
<li><strong>Few strings attached.</strong> Founders have autonomy to spend the funds in whatever way they like.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term alignment.</strong> Many flexible VCs retain a small residual stake in the company after the return cap is reached, driving alignment well beyond the horizon of the revenue share, similar to the long-term orientation of equity VC.</li>
<li><strong>Seed-stage compatible. </strong>Like traditional equity VC investors, flexible VCs accommodate early-stage investment risk within their portfolios better than a traditional RBI funder.</li>
<li><strong>Eligible for favorable treatment under qualified small business stock exemption, if structured as equity. </strong>This applies if the investment converts into common stock; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/how-to-build-or-invest-in-a-startup-without-paying-capital-gains-tax/">details</a> are beyond this essay’s scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flexible VCs also offer investors some of the same advantages as RBI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear return expectations.</strong> The return cap is a stated multiple of the investment, typically 2x-5x.</li>
<li><strong>Early liquidity. </strong>Equity VC is a “get rich slow” business. Flexible VC creates early liquidity that can be either reinvested or distributed to LPs.</li>
<li><strong>Improved financial management.</strong> All parties want the company to be able to afford the payment obligations and, ideally, deliver a quick return. As a result, unfounded hockey-stick graphs and unicorn promises give way to financial fluency, realistic expectations, frank conversations about what a business can credibly achieve and transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability is prioritized.</strong> The revenue that is going to grow the company immediately is the same revenue that is going to get investors to their return cap. If the company is profitable, the revenue share becomes increasingly affordable. This drives an earlier focus on profitability than is typical for a company backed by traditional equity VC.</li>
<li><strong>Founder retains control.</strong> Flexible VCs typically purchase nonvoting common stock, if they purchase stock (one even <a href="https://www.indie.vc/notes/2021">assigns their voting rights to the founders</a>). This keeps the founder in the driver’s seat of the company.</li>
<li><strong>Attractive to women and underrepresented founders.</strong> See <a href="https://teten.com/blog/2019/08/20/why-are-revenue-based-vcs-investing-in-so-many-women-underrepresented-founders/">Why Are Revenue-Based Investors Investing in Women &amp; Diverse Entrepreneurs?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Flexible VC also offers some unique advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Straightforward equity interface.</strong> If an equity round is needed to fund breakout growth beyond what the flexible VC funds, the mechanics of including a flexible VC in an equity VC round are predetermined and simple.</li>
<li><strong>Prepared for blitzscaling, but neither required nor expected.</strong> <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/04/blitzscaling">Blitzscaling</a> typically means prioritizing user growth over revenue growth and revenue growth over profitability. Tim O’Reilly, CEO, O’Reilly Media, <a href="https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/">argues</a>, “Blitzscaling isn’t really a recipe for success but rather survivorship bias masquerading as a strategy.” With flexible VC, not every company is expected to achieve breakout growth, but that possibility is accounted for up front.</li>
<li><strong>Particular application in impact capital.</strong> Our research has found that impact investors appear to be particularly interested in flexible VC. An impact investor typically needs some economic return to function, but doesn’t necessarily want the company as a whole to exit, given exits often have a negative impact on the company’s founding mission. Flexible VC allows impact VCs to thread this needle.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, nothing is cost-free. The unique disadvantages of flexible VC include:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy, a community built around buying hot sneakers and related items that are increasingly hard to acquire at retail, raised $2M in a round that closed late last year. SoleSavy is a group of communities that is currently mostly hosted on Slack. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://solesavy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/dp16?lang=en">Dejan Pralica</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/justdoit604">Justin Dusanj</a> founded the company in 2018 as a paid community for collectors and enthusiasts seeking pairs that were getting snapped up by bots or resellers. Pralica previously co-founded Kicks Deals, a sneaker shipping site focused on less than retail pricing and Dusanj is the former Director of Operations at New Age Sports, a Nike retailer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy’s $2M party raise includes investment from <a href="https://www.panache.vc/">Panache Ventures,</a> Jason Calacanis’ <a href="https://launch.co/">LAUNCH</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak">Turner Novak</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bnarasin?lang=en">Ben Narasin</a>, Morning Brew&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/businessbarista">Alex Liberman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/austin_rief">Austin Rief</a>, <a href="http://tinycapital.com/">Tiny Capital</a>, Wesley Pentz (yes, <a href="https://twitter.com/diplo">Diplo</a>), Matthew Hauri aka <a href="https://twitter.com/yunggravy">Yung Gravy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/invoker">Ryan Holmes</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rohamg">Roham Gharegozlou</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/bedrock-capital/">Bedrock Capital</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy has built an engaged community (several communities, really) around the ebb and flow of the sneakerhead consumer universe (SCU). I just coined that, by the way, please make it a thing. The SCU is an interesting place filled with fascinating characters and behaviors. Every once in a while it pokes its head into the mainstream, whether via a </span><a href="https://shiftermagazine.com/film/sneakerheadz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a hot shoe release or a </span><a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/south-florida-social-media-personality-benjamin-kickz-arrested-on-robbery-charges/#:~:text=(WSVN)%20%2D%20A%20young%20man,been%20arrested%20on%20robbery%20charges.&amp;text=Kapelushnik%20has%20been%20arrested%20and,Miami%2DDade%20after%20posting%20bond."><span style="font-weight: 400;">stron-garm robbery attempt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2021, I believe that we will see more of this world breaking out of its box into the larger consumer consciousness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trends that are leading us to this place are varied, but some of them have been front and center during the pandemic, as a decade’s worth of consumer behavioral change has occurred in the space of a few months. You only have to look at how hard it was to get a PS5 or Xbox One X or a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1306595714097491974?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the holiday season, and how many services, Twitter accounts and monitor groups rose up to try to help people do that to see what the future of shopping looks like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I joked about not being able to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1326291738772738048?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy butter without a bot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s not far from the truth &#8212; nearly every category of goods has had its own shortages over the last year. But the mother of all limited goods category for decades now has been sneakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every release is hotly anticipated and eagerly purchased by people looking for the latest shoe. The massive increase in interest in the sneaker as the marquee desirable item and the unwillingness of the biggest manufacturers to lose the hype halo has led to each drop being harder to get than the last. Second-market startups like StockX and GOAT have sprung up to facilitate those who don’t mind paying 30%-200% premiums on each release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution for many lies in the countless ‘cook groups’ that help buyers anticipate demand and stock for each drop and plan to purchase them on release date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy’s function is ostensibly to do just that: help regular enthusiasts to strategize and execute the release day cop. But beyond that, Pralica says that the group has come to be about the community of people around those shoes more than the purchase itself. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2094799" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png" alt="" width="1024" height="655" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png 3358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=1536,983 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=2048,1310 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy is at its heart a slack group (a series of groups actually that act as cohorts, leading people through the tiers of community that the team has built) with rooms that help people to understand what’s happening in sneakers, get the releases and commiserate around the culture. Pralica says that they’ve built that community out slowly (the waitlist for the group grows by 400 people per day) in order to maintain a positive atmosphere and to properly onboard new people to the group. They also have an app that drives push notifications and a podcast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That positive community vibe is what Pralica says is SoleSavy’s long-term focus and differentiating factor that keeps the 4,000 members across the US and Canada interacting with the group on a nearly daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been in a dozen or so different groups focused on buying large quantities of each release to re-sell over the years and many of them are, at best, rowdy and at worst toxic. That’s an environment that SoleSavy wanted to stay away from, says Pralica. Instead, SoleSavy tries to court those who want to buy and wear the shoes, trade them and yes, maybe even resell personal pairs eventually to obtain and wear another grail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though cook groups have been the ‘core’ of the Discord and Slack-based communities in the sneaker world, other iterations have been booming too. Entrepreneurial communities based in the same hustle principles like Tyler Blake’s </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/only-resolution-45651741"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In This Economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and fanbase-focused groups around popular streamers </span><a href="https://disboard.org/servers/tag/streamers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top the Disboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And bets on social token </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/crypto-driven-marketplace-zora-raises-2m-to-build-a-sustainable-creator-economy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outfits like Zora</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also focused on community as the glue that holds together a user base. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community is the future of all commerce, whether you’re looking for a specific product (see the huge </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TheSiteSupply"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PS5 monitors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or want to steep yourself in a particular universe of product interest (the SCU). The trends that I’ve been seeing all point to 2021 being the year that community-driven purchasing breaks out of the underbelly of fandom and becomes officially “a thing”.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-12.57.41-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2094801" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-12.57.41-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-12.57.41-PM.png 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-12.57.41-PM.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-12.57.41-PM.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-12.57.41-PM.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-12.57.41-PM.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-12.57.41-PM.png?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-12.57.41-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy has been experimenting with a variety of ways to keep the community knit going including live chats, get togethers and even a handsome custom community-designed Jordan 1. These efforts have driven the previously bootstrapped company to some impressive early numbers. Pralica says that SoleSavy is currently profitable, with $1.5M ARR on $33 monthly subscriptions plus affiliate revenue and that their DAUs are at 90% &#8212; an engagement number that would make any retailer salivate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the funding closed (very) late last year I thought that this would be a great kick off story for the year ahead. Though SoleSavy seems to have a really compelling story and a great growth curve, I think they’re at the tip of a very large trend, one that we will see continue to build throughout the year. </span></p>

<p>In <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ubnt/account-notification?ubiquiti-20201101">a short email to customers</a> on Monday, the tech company said it became aware of unauthorized access to its systems hosted by a third-party cloud provider. Ubiquiti didn&#8217;t name the cloud company, when the breach happened, or what caused the security incident. A company spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>But the company confirmed that it &#8220;cannot be certain&#8221; that customer data had not been exposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This data may include your name, email address, and the one-way encrypted password to your account,&#8221; said the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ubnt/account-notification?ubiquiti-20201101">email to customers</a>. &#8220;The data may also include your address and phone number if you have provided that to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the email says passwords are scrambled, the company says users should update their passwords and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-two-factor/">enable two-factor authentication</a>, which makes it harder for hackers from taking the stolen passwords and using them to break into accounts.</p>
<p>Ubiquiti account users can remotely access and manage their routers and devices from the web.</p>
<p>The networking company quickly followed its email with a post on its community pages confirming that the email was authentic, after <a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/possibly-breach/55bc757a-9caf-4889-a2c4-9ad5d8af75ce?page=1">several complained</a> that the email sent to customers included typos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a full day into <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 2021, and it seems that smart glasses are very much shaping up as a trend. I wrote about a pair of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/lenovo-launches-ar-glasses-for-enterprise/">AR glasses from Lenovo</a> aimed at business applications yesterday, and a few other companies have popped up in the meantime, with various levels of “smartness” included.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vuzix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vuzix">Vuzix’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> latest models are still several months away, but they seem to be one of the more promising we’ve seen at the show thus far. The company is best known for its business-focused solutions &#8212; that, after all, is where all the money is &#8212; at least until someone offers a really profound breakthrough in the consumer category.</p>
<p>These probably aren’t that (if I had to guess, I’d look more closely at offerings from bigger consumer electronics companies), but they do seem like a step in the right direction, in terms of an offering that bakes augmented reality into a presentable form factor. It seems like AR glasses that look like regular eyeglasses is the right hook here. There are clearly differentiating factors here, but the next-gen glasses look a lot closer to standard eyewear than what we’ve seen in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>That’s due in no small part to a partnership with Jade Bird Display, which will help commercialize the Chinese company’s microLED tech. Jade Bird describes it thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>JBD offers active matrix inorganic microLED display chips and panels with wavelength ranging from UV to visible to IR. The pixel pitch ranges from 400 dpi to 10,000 dpi with a varity of resolutions. With high brightness, high EQE, high reliability, these panels are ideal for AR, VR, HUD, projector, weapon sights, 3D printing, microscope, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>The module, which projects a monochrome stereoscopic image, is roughly the size of a pencil eraser, according to Vuzix’s description. The company says the glasses will be available in a number of configurations, including Wi-Fi and optional LTE. All will feature stereo speakers and noise-canceling mics.</p>
<p>No word on price, but Vuzix says they should hit the market this summer.</p>

<p>Snap confirmed the news to TechCrunch and said the acquisition will result in four <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/streetcred" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="streetcred">StreetCred <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> team members — including co-founders Randy Meech and Diana Shkolnikov — joining the company, where they&#8217;ll be working on map and location-related products.</p>
<p>A big component of that strategy is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snap-map/">the Snap Map</a>, which allows users to view public snaps from a given area and to share their location with friends. Last summer, the Snap Map was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/snapchat-redesigns-its-app-with-new-action-bar/">added to Snapchat&#8217;s main navigation bar</a>, and the company <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/Q2’20-Earnings-Release_Final_7.21.20-(2).pdf">announced</a> that the product was reaching 200 million users every month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, Snapchat has been adding other products that tie into a user&#8217;s locations, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/snapchat-boosts-its-ar-platform-with-voice-search-local-lenses-and-snapml/">Local Lenses</a>, which allow developers to create geography-specific augmented reality lenses that interact with physical locations.</p>

<p>Meech and Shkolnikov should be bringing plenty of mapping experience to Snap — Meech was formerly CEO at Samsung&#8217;s open mapping subsidiary Mapzen, and before that the senior vice president of local and mapping products at TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company AOL (subsequently rebranded as Verizon Media). Shkolnikov, meanwhile, is the former engineering director at Mapzen.</p>
<p>StreetCred had raised $1 million in seed funding from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bowery-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bowery-capital">Bowery Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Notation Capital. When I spoke to Meech in 2018, he said his goal was to &#8220;open up and decentralize&#8221; location data by building a blockchain-based marketplace where users are rewarded for helping to collect that data.</p>
<p>While the financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the existing StreetCred platform will be shut down as part of the deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mapping the ocean&#8217;s floor is a surprisingly vital enterprise, which helps with a range of activities including shipping, coastal protection, and deep-sea resource gathering. It&#8217;s also a very costly and time-consuming activity, which can be demanding and dangerous for those involved. <a href="https://www.saildrone.com">Saildrone</a> is a startup focused on building out autonomous exploratory vessels that can do lots of mapping, while making very little impact on the environment in which they operate, and without requiring any crew on board at all.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/saildrone" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="saildrone">Saildrone&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> newest robotic ocean explorer is the Surveyor, its largest vessel at 72-feet long. The Surveyor can spend up to 12 months at a stretch out at sea, and draws its power from wind (hence the large sail-like structure, which is not actually used like the sail on a sailboat) and the sun (via the solar panels dotting its above-water surfaces). Its sensor instrumentation includes sonar that can map down to 7,000 meters (around 22,000 feet). That&#8217;s not quite as deep as some of the deepest parts of the world&#8217;s oceans, but it&#8217;s plenty deep enough to cover the average depth of around 12,100 feet.</p>
<p>As Saildrone notes, we&#8217;ve only actually mapped around 20% of the Earth&#8217;s oceans to date – meaning we know less about it than we do the surface of Mars or the Moon. Saildrone has already been contributing to better understanding this last great frontier with its 23-foot Explorer model, which has already accumulated 500,000 nautical miles of travel on its autonomous sea voyages. The larger vessel will help not only with seafloor mapping, but also with a new DNA sample collection effort using sensors developed the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/university-of-new-hampshire" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="university-of-new-hampshire">University of New Hampshire <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, to better understand the genetic makeup of various lifeforms that occupy the water column in more parts of the sea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, is scaling up its autonomous vehicle program and plans to launch test fleets in at least four more cities over the next several months, including Detroit, Paris, Shanghai and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Mobileye president and CEO Amnon Shashua said Monday during the virtual 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tech trade show that if the company can receive regulatory approval it will also begin testing on public roads in New York City.</p>
<p>The expansion announcement, along with details about a new lidar System on Chip product that is under development and will come to market in 2025, illustrates Mobileye&#8217;s ambitions to commercialize automated vehicle technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The selection of the cities and countries is based on two factors: customers and the regulatory environment, according to Jack Weast, a senior principal engineer at Intel and the vice president of Automated Vehicle Standards at Mobileye.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we put our cars in the U.S. in Detroit, rather than Silicon Valley because all major OEMs are in Detroit,&#8221; Weast said in an interview Monday, adding that Peugeot Renault are in Paris and Toyota and Nissan are in Japan. &#8220;The selection of the cities had a lot to do with putting the vehicles near our customers so that they would all have the opportunity to experience the technology firsthand because we expect our OEM customers to continue to be an important part of our business going forward even, even as we supply a complete self driving system.&#8221;</p>
<p>A test fleet is already on the road in Detroit, according to the company. Mobileye launched its first test fleet in Jerusalem in 2018 and added one in Munich in 2020.</p>
<p>Mobileye is taking a three-pronged strategy to developing and deploying automated vehicle technology that combines a full self-driving stack — that includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology — with its REM mapping system and a <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy. Mobileye’s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into nearly 1 million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support ADAS and autonomous driving systems. Shashua said Mobileye&#8217;s technology can now map the world automatically with nearly 8 million kilometers tracked daily and nearly 1 billion kilometers completed to date. </span></p>
<p>This strategy will allow the company to efficiently launch and operate commercial robotaxi services as well as bring the technology to consumer passenger vehicles by 2025, Shashua said Monday.</p>
<p>Mobileye has long dominated a specific niche in the automotive world as a developer of computer vision sensor systems that help prevent collisions. In 2018, the company expanded its focus beyond being a mere supplier to becoming a robotaxi operator; now it&#8217;s aiming to bring autonomous vehicle technology to passenger cars by augmenting its computer vision technology with the new lidar SoC it is developing with Intel.</p>
<p>Mobileye has already partnered with Luminar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/">supply lidar for its robotaxis</a>. However, Mobileye revealed more about the lidar SoC that it says will be ready for passenger vehicles by 2025. Shashua nor Weast would say if it planned to end its partnership with Luminar once its own lidar SoC is ready for the market.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobileye taps Luminar to supply lidar for its robotaxi fleet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/embed/#?secret=Y44JqlhA4D" data-secret="Y44JqlhA4D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The lidar, which will use Intel’s specialized silicon photonics fab, is notable because Mobileye is known for its camera-based technology. And yet it&#8217;s not backing away from that camera-first approach. Shashua explained Mobileye believes the best technological and business approach is to develop a camera-first system and use the lidar and radar as add-ons for redundancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is that you have this camera subsystem,&#8221; Shashua said. &#8220;Since it&#8217;s camera based, it&#8217;s at a consumer price level. So now you have scalable thinking. And this scalable thinking is really the cure for sustaining for a long time until level four becomes ubiquitous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shashua pointed to its long-term high-volume agreement for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/mobileye-signs-driver-assistance-deal-with-geely-one-of-chinas-largest-privately-held-auto-makers/">advanced driver-assistance systems</a> with Geely Auto as an example of how a camera-first approach could later be adapted. The lidar and radar can be added on to support greater automation capabilities once the market is ready.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the vaccination campaign to counter COVID-19 gets underway (albeit with a rocky start), a number of companies are attempting to support its rollout in a variety of ways.<a href="https://healthvana.com"> Healthvana</a>, a health tech startup that began with a specific focus on providing patient information digitally for individuals living with HIV, is helping Los Angeles County roll out mobile vaccination records for COVID-19 using Apple&#8217;s Wallet technology. A cursory appraisal of the implementation of this tech might lead one to believe it&#8217;s about providing individuals with easy proof of vaccination &#8212; but the tech, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/healthvana" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="healthvana">Healthvana, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are focused on informing individuals to ensure they participate in their own healthcare programs, not providing an immunity pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;I generally consider most of healthcare to look and feel like Windows 95,&#8221; Healthvana CEO and founder Ramin Bastani said. &#8220;We look and feel like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Why is that important? Because patients can engage in things they understand, it&#8217;s easier for them to communicate in the way they&#8217;re used to communicating, and that ends up leading them to better health outcomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bastani points out that they began the company by focusing this approach to patient education and communication on HIV, and demonstrated that using their software led to patients being 7.4 times more likely to show up for their next follow-up appointment versus patients who received follow-up information and appointment notices via traditional methods. The company has built their tooling and their approach around not only producing better health for individuals, but also on reducing costs for healthcare providers by eliminating the need for a lot of the work that goes into clearing up misunderstandings, and essentially hounding patients to follow-up, which can significantly dig into clinician and care staff hours.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re actually also reducing the cost to healthcare providers, because you don&#8217;t have 1,000 people calling you asking what are their results, and saying &#8216;I don&#8217;t understand, I can&#8217;t log in, I don&#8217;t know what it means to be SARS nonreactive,&#8217; or all those things we address through simplicity,&#8221; Bastani said. &#8220;That&#8217;s made a huge difference. Overall, I think the key to all healthcare is going to be to be able to get patients to pay attention, and take action to things around their health.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the goal of Healthvana&#8217;s partnership with LA County on COVID-19 immunization records, too &#8212; taking vitally important action to ensure the successful rollout of its vaccination program. All approved COVID-19 vaccines to date require a two-course treatment, including one initial inoculation followed by a booster to be administered sometime later. Keeping LA county residents informed about their COVID-19 inoculation, and when they&#8217;re due for a second dose, is the primary purpose of the partnership, and benefits from Healthvana&#8217;s experience in improving patient follow-up activities. But the app is also providing users with information about COVID-19 care, and, most usefully, prevention and ways to slow the spread.</p>
<p>While Bastani stresses that Healthvana is, in the end, just &#8220;the last mile&#8221; for message delivery, and that there are many other layers involved in determining the right steps for proper care and prevention, the way in which they provide actionable info has already proven a big boon to one key measure: contact tracing. In select municipalities, Healthvana will also prompt users who&#8217;ve tested positive to anonymously notify close contacts directly from their device, which will provide those individuals with both free testing options and information resources.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple and Google release sample code, UI and detailed policies for COVID-19 exposure-notification apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/apple-and-google-release-sample-code-and-detailed-policies-for-covid-19-exposure-notification-apps/embed/#?secret=F19rh3oxoM" data-secret="F19rh3oxoM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Just us doing this in the greater Los Angeles area for less than two months, 12,000+ people have been notified that they&#8217;ve been exposed,&#8221; Bastani said. &#8220;Each of them likely lives with other people and families &#8212; this is how you can help slow the spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrast that with the relatively slow uptake of the exposure notification tools built into iOS and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> devices via recent software updates provided by Google and Apple working in a rare collaboration. While the technology that underlies it is sound, and focused on user privacy, its usage numbers thus far are far from earthshaking; only 388 people have sent alerts through Virginia&#8217;s app-based on the exposure notification framework in three months since its launch, for instance.</p>
<p>Healthvana&#8217;s focus on timely and relevant delivery of information, offered to users in ways they&#8217;re mostly likely to understand and engage with, is already showing its ability to have an impact on COVID-19 and its community transmission. The startup is already in talks to launch similar programs elsewhere in the country, and that could help improve national vaccination outcomes, and how people handle COVID-19 once they have it, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alternative social media apps, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sgrouples" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sgrouples">MeWe, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CloutHub and other privacy-focused rivals to big tech, are topping the app stores following Trump&#8217;s ban from mainstream social platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">Twitter</a> and the more recent removal of conservative social app Parler from both the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">App Store</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google Play</a>. In the days since the Parler ban, &#8220;free speech&#8221;-favoring social networks are seeing notable numbers of new downloads at a quick pace, data shows.</p>
<p>Next-generation social network MeWe, founded in May 2012, is one of those that&#8217;s seeing the largest bump in new installs.</p>
<p>The app has been steadily growing in the days since the U.S. Presidential Elections and the related increases in moderation of misinformation by larger platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Mainstream social networks enforced their policies and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">even created new ones</a> to moderate content shared by Trump and his allies &#8212; including their baseless claims of election fraud that have not be substantiated by U.S. courts, despite dozens of lawsuits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To date, MeWe has seen over 16 million global lifetime installs, according data from app intelligence firm <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a>. However, since Wednesday of last week, the app has been downloaded nearly 200,000 times worldwide. A majority of those new downloads are coming from U.S. users, who accounted for nearly 143,000 installs.</p>
<p>Largely, those users came to MeWe following <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ban from app stores. Apple gave Parler the boot late on Saturday, and MeWe popped in the charts as a result. Saturday through Sunday alone, MeWe gained 110,200+ new installs in the U.S.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ixoz1K4KLY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly looms</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly looms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/embed/#?secret=ixoz1K4KLY" data-secret="ixoz1K4KLY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company told us it has seen 1 million new members sign up in the last 72 hours and now adds over 20,000 new members per hour.</p>
<p>Because app stores&#8217; Top Charts reflect not just total downloads but also the velocity of those new installs, MeWe has gained a position in the top 10 very quickly due to recent trends.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, MeWe ranked No. 7 in the U.S. App Store&#8217;s Top Overall free charts. It&#8217;s already moving up today.</p>
<p>This is remarkable growth for the alternative social app, given that as recently as October the app was not ranked on the App Store&#8217;s Top Charts at all. (Being unranked means that the app is so far down on the charts, it&#8217;s lower than rank No. 1,500 &#8212; so its rank is basically untrackable.) MeWe did, however, chart in the Social Networking category at some points during this time.</p>

<p>Another app benefitting from recent events, including the Parler ban, is the relative newcomer, <a href="https://www.clouthub.com/home">CloutHub</a>.</p>
<p>The app was launched in January 2019 and claims to be a social network for &#8220;social, civic, and political networking&#8221; with a free speech angle. Its website says it wants to give &#8220;everyone a platform to have their voice heard.&#8221;</p>

(CloutHub may be struggling with the surge of new users, as we found sign-ups and logins are often timing out). The app as of now ranks No. 11 on the U.S. App Store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094685" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094685" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2094685 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094685" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Store screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Two other apps that have moved into the top charts are cases of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://mashable.com/article/confused-and-looking-for-parler-parlor-app-wins/">Mashable recently reported</a>, an app called &#8220;Parlor&#8221; is being mistaken for the now-banned &#8220;Parler&#8221; app. Its report cited Sensor Tower data that said &#8220;Parlor&#8221; has seen as many as 40,000 downloads in December alone.</p>
<p>Apptopia says the social chat app, founded in May 2011, has seen 8.6 million lifetime global installs. But from Wednesday through Sunday, it gained 115,846 new users &#8212; many who were likely looking for &#8220;Parler.&#8221; Of those, 99,220+ arrived on either Saturday or Sunday, just as the Parler ban was beginning to roll out. Even though Apple didn&#8217;t take action on Parler until later on Saturday, users may have come across &#8220;Parlor&#8221; by searching for it by this alternative spelling.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, &#8220;Parlor&#8221; became the No. 4 Top App Overall on iOS in the U.S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an app called &#8220;Gab News&#8221; &#8212; which is actually just a local news app for the Georgetown area &#8212; is also gaining ground. This is because it&#8217;s mistaken for the long since banned app &#8220;Gab,&#8221; which ex-Parler users are suggesting as an alternative. Apple had declined to host Gab back in 2016, citing its pornographic content and <a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html">later, due to its policies against hosting apps that include hate speech</a>. Though Gab was able to launch on Google Play in 2017, the app was quickly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-app-store-gab-ban-hate-speech-2017-8">removed</a> from there as well, also for hate speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gab News,&#8221; however, is currently ranking No. 44 on the App Store&#8217;s Top Free Apps Chart in the U.S., as of the time of writing. (Download data was not immediately available.)</p>
<p>Then there is Rumble, a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90574842/what-is-rumble-meet-the-video-platform-trumps-supporters-are-flocking-to">conservative alternative</a> to YouTube. The app has gained 2.4 million total global installs since its January 2020 launch, per Apptopia&#8217;s estimates. Since Wednesday, that included 91,916 new downloads, 73,700+ of which were in the U.S. It has also climbed to No. 78 on the U.S. App Store, up from No. 1,484 on December 19, 2020.</p>
<p>The Parler ban is not the only thing triggering these shifts, to be clear.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2094695" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="394" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg 2758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1187 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a general backlash underway against big tech, which many on both sides feel have become too powerful.</p>
<p>Governments have been examining the business models and practices of companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook over the past year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/">in markets around the world</a> with an eye on antitrust action. Facebook and Google are also being scrutinized by users for their privacy practices &#8212; especially as Apple is now forcing companies to add privacy labels to all apps that disclose what they do with user data.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="S2FrBFAIQJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/">From the US to China, Korea, India and Europe, antitrust action against tech is gaining serious momentum</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;From the US to China, Korea, India and Europe, antitrust action against tech is gaining serious momentum&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/embed/#?secret=S2FrBFAIQJ" data-secret="S2FrBFAIQJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As a result, some people were turning to alternative networking apps not just because they&#8217;re conservative, but because they valued privacy. As a result, encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Telegram are booming in recent days, as is the privacy-focused search engine, DuckDuckGo, a Google.com alternative.</p>
<p>These apps have also picked up steam over the past week. Signal is now No. 1 on the U.S. App Store, Telegram is No. 2, and DuckDuckGo is No. 8. This is rapid growth. Around mid-October 2020, these apps were ranked No. 618, 79, and 715, respectively, Apptopia says. DuckDuckGo also told us it&#8217;s seen 62% year-over-year growth between 2019 and 2020 and has become the No. 2 search engine in the U.S., U.K., Canada., and Australia.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s also worth noting that some users may be seeking out private messaging platforms in the wake of the U.S. Capitol riots, now that the FBI has begun to arrest insurgents. Signal has gained nearly 325,000 new installs since Thursday and Telegram gained 330,600+, for example.</p>
<p>This rapid shift to alternative social and messaging networks is indication of how difficult it may be in the weeks ahead for app stores to enforce their policies. Though the platforms typically crack down on apps hosting hate speech and those allowing incitement of violence, they tend to move slowly than the crowd downloading the next alternative app.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the apps that become popular may struggle with moderation. We&#8217;ve already come across examples of both extreme hate speech and calls for assassination on MeWe, for instance. even though the company&#8217;s public statements say it investigates and removes this sort of content. (MeWe has been asked to comment).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what the future for these free speech, alternative apps may hold, as platform providers such as Amazon (AWS) are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">now also declining to host them</a>, and payment providers, like Stripe, which just <a href="https://apptopia.com/">cut ties with the Trump campaign</a>, may decline to process future online payments. That could leave the networks to ultimately scramble for private funding to build their own infrastructure and stay afloat, as well as to seek out alternative distribution systems, like the web or even sideloading, to reach their users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has sued <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> after the beleaguered conservative social media site was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">expelled from AWS</a>, filing a fanciful complaint alleging the internet giant took it out for political reasons — and in an antitrust conspiracy to benefit Twitter. But its own allegations, including breach of contract, are belied by evidence they supply alongside the suit.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, filed today in the U.S. Western District Court, Parler complains that &#8220;AWS’s decision to effectively terminate Parler’s account is apparently motivated by political animus. It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DY5bmd3x6n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">Amazon Web Services gives Parler 24-hour notice that it will suspend services to the company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon Web Services gives Parler 24-hour notice that it will suspend services to the company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/embed/#?secret=DY5bmd3x6n" data-secret="DY5bmd3x6n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Regarding the &#8220;political animus,&#8221; it is difficult to speak to Parler&#8217;s reasoning, since that argument is supported nowhere in the suit — it simply is never referred to again.</p>
<p>There is the suggestion that Amazon has shown more tolerance for offending content on Twitter than on Parler, but this isn&#8217;t well substantiated. For instance, the suit notes that &#8220;Hang Mike Pence&#8221; trended on Friday the 8th, without noting that much of this volume was, as any user of Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=hang%20mike%20pence">can see by searching</a>, people decrying this phrase as having been chanted by the rioters in the Capitol two days prior.</p>
<p>By way of contrast, one Parler post cited by Amazon says that &#8220;we need to start systematicly [sic] assasinating [sic] #liberal leaders, liberal activists, #blm leaders and supporters,&#8221; and so on. As TechCrunch has been monitoring Parler conversations, we can say that this is far from an isolated example of this rhetoric.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wmYhvLWwM9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">Parler reportedly removed posts by Trump affiliate Lin Wood calling for execution of VP Mike Pence</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler reportedly removed posts by Trump affiliate Lin Wood calling for execution of VP Mike Pence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/embed/#?secret=wmYhvLWwM9" data-secret="wmYhvLWwM9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The antitrust argument suggests a conspiracy by Amazon to protect and advance the interests of Twitter. Specifically, the argument is that because Twitter is a major customer of AWS, and Parler is a threat to Twitter, Amazon wanted to take Parler out of the picture.</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the context of Parler’s looming threat to Twitter and the fact that the Twitter ban might not long muzzle the President if he switched to Parler, potentially bringing tens of millions of followers with him, AWS moved to shut down Parler.</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument is not convincing for several reasons, but the most obvious one is that Parler was at the time also an AWS customer. If people are going from one customer to another, why would Amazon care at all, let alone enough to interfere to the point of legal and ethical dubiety?</p>
<p>The lawsuit also accuses Amazon of leaking the email communicating Parler&#8217;s imminent suspension to reporters before it was sent to administrators at the site. (It also says that Amazon &#8220;sought to defame&#8221; Parler, though defamation is not part of the legal complaint. Parler seems to be using this term rather loosely.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="J0I0JnUFUx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">The deplatforming of President Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The deplatforming of President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/embed/#?secret=J0I0JnUFUx" data-secret="J0I0JnUFUx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lastly Parler says Amazon is in breach of contract, having not given the 30 days warning stipulated in the terms of service. The exception is if a &#8220;material breach remains uncured for a period of 30 days&#8221; after notice. As Parler explains it:</p>
<blockquote><p>On January 8, 2021, AWS brought concerns to Parler about user content that encouraged violence. Parler addressed them, and then AWS said it was “okay” with Parler.</p>
<p>The next day, January 9, 2021, AWS brought more “bad” content to Parler and Parler took down all of that content by the evening.</p>
<p>Thus, there was no uncured material breach of the Agreement for 30 days, as required for termination.</p></blockquote>
<p>But in the email attached as evidence to the lawsuit — literally exhibit A — Amazon makes it clear the issues have been ongoing for longer than that (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Over the past several weeks</strong>, we’ve reported 98 examples to Parler of posts that clearly encourage and incite violence&#8230; You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency&#8230; It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">the rest of the letter here</a>, but it&#8217;s obvious that Amazon is not simply saying that a few days of violations are the cause of Parler&#8217;s being kicked off the service.</p>
<p>Parler asks a judge for a Temporary Restraining Order that would restore its access to AWS while the rest of the case is argued, and for damages to be specified at trial.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Amazon has provided the following statement regarding the lawsuit:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no merit to these claims. AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow. However, it is clear that there is significant content on Parler that encourages and incites violence against others, and that Parler is unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which is a violation of our terms of service. We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sharp repricing is steep in percentage terms, with the bottom end of Affirm&#8217;s range rising a little more than 24% and the top end gaining a smaller 16%.</p>
<p>For Affirm, the news means a larger IPO fundraising haul and a confirmation from public investors that its model, its economics, its business performance and its relationship with Peloton are incredibly valuable.</p>

The company was valued at around $2.9 billion in a 2019 round and raised more capital at a higher $19.93 per-share price in September of 2020; the company&#8217;s IPO price range is now more than double what the company was worth less than half a year ago.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s calculate Affirm&#8217;s new simple and diluted new valuation ranges, and contrast those with its recent revenues to get a handle regarding how close to software numbers the startup can get its revenue multiple.</p>
<h2>Inside the math</h2>
<p>Very little has changed in Affirm&#8217;s S-1 filings when it comes to share counts. Today&#8217;s new S-1/A filing does include a note concerning around 18,824 shares, but past that it appears that most things are holding steady.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has hired Roy Austin to become its first-ever VP of Civil Rights and Deputy General Counsel to create a new civil rights organization within the company, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/roy-austin-facebook-vp-civil-rights/">Facebook announced today</a>. Austin is set to start on January 19 and will be based in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Austin most recently served as a civil rights lawyer at Harris, Wiltshire &amp; Grannis LLP. Prior to that, Austin co-authored a report on big data and civil rights and worked with President Barack Obama&#8217;s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am excited to join Facebook at this moment when there is a national and global awakening happening around civil rights,&#8221; Austin said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2094669" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094669" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094669 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Roy-Austin-headshot-1-e1610389889326.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="226" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094669" class="wp-caption-text">Roy Austin, Facebook&#8217;s new VP of Civil Rights. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook </p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Technology plays a role in nearly every part of our lives, and it’s important that it be used to overcome the historic discrimination and hate which so many underrepresented groups have faced, rather than to exacerbate it. I could not pass up the opportunity to join a company whose products are used by so many and which impacts the civil rights and liberties of billions of people, in order to help steer a better way forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear what the goals or responsibilities of the civil rights organization within Facebook will be, but we&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook for more information. In the meantime, here&#8217;s what Facebook&#8217;s Chief General Counsel Jennifer Newstead said on the company blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am delighted to welcome Roy to Facebook as our VP of Civil Rights. Roy has proved throughout his career that he is a passionate and principled advocate for civil rights — whether it is in the courtroom or the White House. I know he will bring the same wisdom, integrity and dedication to Facebook. It’s hard to imagine anyone better qualified to help us strengthen and advance civil rights on our platform and in our company.</p></blockquote>
<p>In July, former ACLU director Laura W. Murphy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/facebook-civil-rights-audit/">released the results of the multiyear investigation and civil rights audit of Facebook</a>. The report highlights some progress, such as Facebook changing its policy on discriminatory housing and employment ads, expanding its voter suppression policies and having more frequent meetings with civil rights leaders. But the auditors still raised a number of concerns, many of which pertained to the 2020 U.S. election and President Trump.</p>
<p>In light of a pro-Trump mob storming the U.S. Capitol last week,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/"> Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg blocked Trump</a> from both Facebook and Instagram at least through the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before the pandemic, edtech companies went decades without raising financing due to lack of interest from generalist venture capitalists. Now, more than a year since COVID-19 began, the sector is showing signs of maturation, from first profits to unicorns, potential IPOs and a rush of talent.</p>
<p>Momentum in mind, cross-border venture capital firm <a href="https://www.superchargerventures.com/">SuperCharger Ventures</a> is launching a debut accelerator exclusively for early-stage edtech founders. The 12-week accelerator, which kicks off today, is being held virtually, with six startups in the debut cohort.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this isn’t the firms’ first time doing an accelerator. SuperCharger has led three cohorts of startups through a fintech-focused accelerator. The pivot from one booming category to another boils down to a simple dynamic, says SuperCharger Ventures co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbarberis/">Janos Barberis</a>: banks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Banks just don’t have the space or the bandwidth to start dealing with innovation right now,” Barberis said. The co-founder thinks that COVID-19 created a supply and demand unevenness between fintech services and banks, and as many branches struggle to stay open, “the first thing banks cut is innovation.”</p>
<p>So, the firm is hopping to edtech, and taking a key lesson with it from its fintech experience: the importance of B2B and recurring revenue streams.</p>
<p>“The corporate angle? It’s sticky, healthy and revenue driven,” Barberis said. “It’s healthy income, and I think right now investors are willing to pay for that healthy income.”</p>
<p>Financially, Barberis&#8217; argument is hard to disagree with. But when you look at some of the biggest edtech unicorns in this current moment, many are B2C, including Quizlet, Course Hero and ApplyBoard. It’s because in education, it sometimes can be easier to sell to the end-user than dealing with highly fragmented institutions &#8212; at least in the United States.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5cSXb5VGVm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/4-edtech-ceos-peer-into-the-industrys-future/">4 edtech CEOs peer into the industry&#8217;s future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 edtech CEOs peer into the industry&#8217;s future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/4-edtech-ceos-peer-into-the-industrys-future/embed/#?secret=5cSXb5VGVm" data-secret="5cSXb5VGVm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, B2B businesses have the biggest potential for reach, and we’re seeing consumer businesses turn COVID-19 demand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools/">into enterprise deals</a>. There’s also hope to be found internationally, which can sometimes have a less fragmented market of institutions, says Barberis.</p>
<p>Beyond B2B sales, cohort startups must be focused on expanding into European and Asian markets.</p>
<p>Barberis sees opportunity in those markets, minus China, because both appear to have gaps in edtech. In Europe, he says there’s a high demand for corporate digital learning from universities, and in Asia, he thinks that investor education is necessary so bets can be placed in countries beyond simply China. On one end there is demand, and on the other end there is opportunity to generate demand.</p>
<p>He leaves out China from the Asian market expansion because he thinks that the country, like the United States, is too saturated with companies right now.</p>
<p>The programming fits the normal accelerator model, with information tailored explicitly to the world of education, such as how to partner with an education institution or shorten sales cycles (as so much of edtech B2B sales happens during the summer months).</p>
<p>The firm doesn’t give any capital, but takes between 1-2% of equity in return for its services, which it estimates cost between $75,000 and $100,000 in “value.” SuperCharger culminates with a Demo Day, and companies in aggregate plan to raise between $15 to $20 million in venture capital.</p>
<p>Other firms have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/what-the-new-vc-show-and-tell-means-for-signaling-risk/">similarly created accelerator programs</a> during the pandemic to help with deal flow and stay competitive in the always-hot seed space, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/nextview-ventures-is-launching-a-remote-accelerator-for-startups/">NextView Ventures.</a></p>

<p>This isn’t SuperCharger Ventures’ first time doing an accelerator. The firm held three fintech-focused accelerators in the past, graduating 49 companies. The pivot from one booming sector to another comes from fintech saturation, says Barberis.</p>

The Mumbai-based startup has been rapidly iterating on technology that lets users play a physical chess game with opponents across the globe, including the arrival of the new modular gaming system, Swap.</p>
<p>Today at CES, it announced the upcoming arrival of a new rollable system, adding a level of portability to its offering. Obviously you lose some of the magic here — the self-moving pieces have been sacrificed in order to bring a board that can be rolled up and stashed in a backpack for easier transport. That effect was a big part of what made the tech so eye-catching in the first place.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094651" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094651" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2094651" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094651" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Square Off</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The system will still take advantage of Square Off’s existing AI and connected technologies, allowing people to play globally against competitors. Between the continued inability to congregate in-person and the rise in interest in chess in the wake of Netflix’s wildly popular &#8220;The Queen’s Gambit,&#8221; this seems like an opportune time for the startup to launch a new product.</p>
<p>Unlike past offerings, the company won’t be going through a crowdfunding site to launch this one. Square Off expects to bring the product to market around March, priced at $199.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 2021, <a href="https://www.bmw.com/en/index.html">BMW</a> today provided us with <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0323708EN/bmw-announces-the-future-of-the-display-and-operating-system-bmw-idrive-at-the-ces-2021">a first glimpse</a> of the future of its iDrive system, 20 years after it first launched in the 2001 7 Series. Today&#8217;s announcement mostly focuses on the past, with a look back at the history of BMW&#8217;s infotainment platform, but the company did provide a bit more context and images of the new system that will make its official debut on the sizable displays in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">upcoming iX</a> soon.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re looking at a refreshed and more colorful design here. Based on what we can glance from the materials that BMW did make available, current BMW drivers shouldn&#8217;t have too high a learning curve as the overall layout still looks familiar.</p>
<p>Despite the addition of BMW&#8217;s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/bmw-launches-a-personal-voice-assistant-for-its-cars/#:~:text=At%20TechCrunch%20Disrupt%20SF%202018,it%20any%20name%20you%20want.">personal voice assistant</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/bmws-magical-gesture-control-finally-makes-sense-as-touchscreens-take-over-cars/">gestures</a> in recent updates, the iDrive knob in the center console isn&#8217;t going away, though it looks like it will be getting some design tweaks, too. Clearly, though, BMW isn&#8217;t planning to do away with physical controls anytime soon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2094548" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094548" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2094548" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg 2250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411053-lowRes.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094548" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>The overall philosophy behind the update, BMW says, is to offer a system that is better able to utilize the potential of a connected car in order to &#8220;make the mobility experience even safer, even more comfortable and convenient, and even richer in variety.&#8221;</p>
<p>The argument here is that the car, thanks to its myriad of sensors and connectivity, now often has access to far more information than the driver. That, BMW says, has influenced the new iDrive&#8217;s design, but the company isn&#8217;t quite ready to delve into any details yet, it seems. Based on what we can glance from the materials that BMW did make available, though, current BMW drivers won&#8217;t have too high a learning curve as the overall layout still looks somewhat familiar.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094626" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411055-lowRes.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094626" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2094626" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411055-lowRes.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411055-lowRes.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411055-lowRes.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411055-lowRes.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411055-lowRes.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411055-lowRes.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P90411055-lowRes.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094626" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The next generation of BMW iDrive takes the burgeoning relationship between a BMW and its driver to a new level,&#8221; the company writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;The new system neatly bridges the gap between analogue and digital technology. And this, in turn, heralds another paradigm shift, as the number of available functions in a car and their complexity continue along a constant upward curve.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pollen-robotics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pollen-robotics">Pollen Robotics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> turned heads at last year’s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. After all, a humanoid robot will do that on the show floor (even if it’s only half of one). The French startup is back for this year’s show (insofar as anyone is really back for the show), with some key updates to its robot, Reachy.</p>
<p>The biggest news this time out is the addition of teleoperation functionality using a virtual reality setup. Using a VR headset, a remote operator is capable of viewing video through the robot’s two face cameras. VR controllers are used to manipulate the robot’s arms for pick and place operations. The functionality can be used for, among other things, training the robot to perform tasks.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRWna6mEMv0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reachy is notable for being an open-source robotics platform. The $17,000 bot is potentially suitable for robotics research, including prototyping one’s own technology. As evidenced by last year’s event, it’s also a fun presentation robot, fulfilling a similar function as, say, Softbank’s Pepper. It’s not, however, going to be taking over any manufacturing jobs any time soon.</p>

<p>The robot’s software is built on the popular open-source robotics operating system, ROS 2. The on-board computer and cameras have both been upgraded since the company first showed off the robot roughly this time last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After rallying to record-setting prices, recapturing the attention of the public and becoming once-again the topic du jour, cryptocurrencies are losing ground today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, peaked at more than $41,000 apiece on January 8. Today after shedding a little over 23% in the last 24 hours, one bitcoin is now worth around $31,800.</p>
<p>Similarly, ether, the token associated with the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ethereum-0ded" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ethereum-0ded">Ethereum <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> blockchain, peaked at a little over $1,300 on January 10. Today, after losing an even sharper 29% in the last 24 hours, ether tokens are worth around $960 apiece.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coins remain far above recent prices, with bitcoin setting new all-time highs this month and ether nearly reaching its early 2018 all-time highs. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, a data platform tracking the cryptocurrency market that was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binances-coinmarketcap-acquisition-is-a-bet-that-crypto-really-is-for-the-masses">purchased by the Binance exchange in 2020</a>, reports that the value of all cryptocurrencies has fallen by just over 22% in the last day to $832.4 billion.</p>
<p>Whether the recent declines, or the fact that cryptos were very recently worth north of $1 trillion in aggregate is bigger news will be determined by your perspective on the asset class.</p>
<p>For startups focused on the digital token market, however, it&#8217;s been a heady start to the year. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coinbase">Coinbase, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an American cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">filed to go public in late 2020</a>. The recent rally in the price of bitcoin, for example, has led to record trading volumes for the coin. That could translate into lucrative incomes for Coinbase and its rivals.</p>
<p>If so, the venture capital market could warm to companies in the space, opening wallets to crypto projects that may have been closed since 2017.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embattled social media platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">Parler is offline</a> after Apple, Google and Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">pulled the plug</a> on the site after the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol last week that left five people dead.</p>
<p>But while the site is gone (for now), millions of posts published to the site since the riot are not.</p>
<p>A lone hacker scraped millions of posts, videos and photos published to the site after the riot but before the site <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">went offline on Monday</a>, preserving a huge trove of potential evidence for law enforcement investigating the attempted insurrection by many who allegedly <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/fast-thinking-how-the-capitol-riot-was-coordinated-online/">used the platform to plan and coordinate</a> the breach of the Capitol.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The hacker and internet archivist, who goes by the online handle <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby">@donk_enby</a>, scraped the social network and uploaded <a href="https://archive.org/details/parler-com?sort=-addeddate">copies to the Internet Archive</a>, which hosts old and historical versions of web pages.</p>
<p>In a tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1348281461435207680">@donk_enby</a> said she scraped data from Parler that included deleted and private posts, and the videos contained &#8220;all associated metadata.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="es" dir="ltr">metadata such as <a href="https://t.co/f5y6AzZ3km">https://t.co/f5y6AzZ3km</a> <a href="https://t.co/95cXeCbZo6">pic.twitter.com/95cXeCbZo6</a></p>
<p>&mdash; crash override (@donk_enby) <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1348294151712944128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Metadata is information about a file — such as when it was made and on what device. This information is usually embedded in the file itself. The scraped videos from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> appear to also include the precise location data of where the videos were taken. That metadata could be a gold mine of evidence for authorities investigating the Capitol riot, which may tie some rioters to their Parler accounts or help police unmask rioters based on their location data.</p>
<p>Most web services remove metadata <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/slack-strips-location-data/">when you upload your photos and videos</a>, but Parler apparently didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Parler quickly became the social network of choice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">after President Trump was deplatformed</a> from Twitter and Facebook for inciting the riot on January 6. But the tech giants said Parler violated their rules by not having a content moderation policy &#8212; which is what drew many users to the site.</p>
<p>Many of the posts made calls to &#8220;burn down [Washington] D.C.,&#8221; while others called for violence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">and the execution</a> of Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
<p>Already several rioters have been arrested and charged with breaking into the Capitol building. Many of the rioters weren&#8217;t wearing masks (the pandemic notwithstanding), making it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/trump-mob-tech-arrests/">easier for them</a> to be identified. But thanks to Parler&#8217;s own security blunder, many more could soon face an unwelcome knock at the door.</p>
