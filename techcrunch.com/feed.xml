										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drone delivery startup Zipline, a company that got its start delivering medical supplies across Africa, has raised $250 million in new funding. This latest round has vaulted the company’s valuation to $2.75 billion and will fuel further expansion of its logistics networks in Africa and the United States.</p>
<p>Zipline made a name for itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/09/zipline-raises-25-million-to-deliver-medical-supplies-by-drone/">first in Rwanda</a> and then in Ghana, where it delivered blood, vaccines, life-saving medications and other essential supplies using autonomous electric drones. The company, which started work on drone delivery in 2013, is vertically integrated – meaning it designs and manufactures the unmanned drones, the logistics software, and the accompanying launch and landing system. Zipline CEO Keller Rinaudo told TechCrunch that this was more by necessity than design, noting that when the company first started developing its drone tech, it quickly realized that off-the-shelf components weren’t reliable or didn’t integrate well.</p>
<p>“Over time Zipline has had to basically rip every single thing out of the system, whether it was the flight computer [. . .] or the battery pack, or the aircraft itself. And we&#8217;ve had to build every single one of those things completely from scratch.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rinaudo stressed that Zipline doesn’t think of itself as a drone company, but rather an instant logistics provider. And while the company iteratively improves its autonomous drone model, much of its successes over the past five years have been related to building out its logistics network. After what Rinaudo described as a challenging first year of operations in Rwanda in 2016, the company has since partnered with logistics company UPS in that East African country, the Toyota Group in Japan, and it’s started working with Nigeria’s Kaduna and Cross River States. Here in the United States, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/zipline-begins-us-medical-delivery-with-uav-program-honed-in-africa/">partnered with Novant Health</a> to deliver medical equipment and personal protective gear in North Carolina and, notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/walmart-expands-drone-delivery-tests-to-arkansas-with-new-zipline-partnership/">with retail giant Walmart</a> delivering health and wellness products.</p>
<p>Unlike many companies that suffered during the pandemic, for Zipline there was an obvious opportunity to further accelerate its operations – not only delivering personal protective equipment but also COVID-19 vaccines. The company said it is planning to deliver 2.4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Zipline sees an additional opportunity in delivering healthcare items, such as pharmaceutical prescriptions, directly to people’s homes. “[Hospitals] really see instant logistics as the other half of telepresence,” Rinaudo said. &#8220;If you can have someone quickly pull out their phone and talk to a doctor, then the other half of the equation is, can we get you what you need?”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171766" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171766" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171766" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png 1143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171766" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zipline</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s currently working with the Federal Aviation Administration to move from operating under an emergency waiver – granted by regulators during the pandemic – to a full commercial operating certification. One advantage Zipline may have over competitors in the FAA’s certification process is that it has many thousands of hours of safe flight data to show that it’s system is sound. It would be the first drone delivery company to receive such a certification.</p>
<p>In the long run, Zipline may start to focus on other industries, but for now it’s laser focused on healthcare, Rinaudo said. He noted that in the last few months alone the company has signed service contracts for five new distribution centers in Nigeria and four in Ghana, as well as “multiple new service contracts” with hospital systems in the United States. This latest funding round, led by Baillie Gifford and with support from returning investors Temasek and Katalyst Ventures, and new investors Fidelity, Intercorp, Emerging Capital Partners and Reinvest Capital, will be used to build out the infrastructure for these new contracts.</p>
<p>Rinaudo said the aim is for Zipline to serve the majority of single-family detached homes across the United States over the coming three years or so.</p>
<p>“The fact that so many big companies like Toyota and Walmart are starting to make big bets in this instant logistics space, I think is a pretty clear sign that people realize this is coming,” Rinaudo said. “There&#8217;s a tidal wave of transformation coming. The exciting thing about it is that it&#8217;s going to totally transform the way that healthcare systems work, it&#8217;s going to totally transform the way that economic systems work, and it&#8217;s going to make it possible for logistics to serve people equally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://gusto.com/">Gusto</a>, a unicorn that sells payroll and benefits management software, announced that it will now offer part of its service via an API to external platforms. The new product, dubbed Gusto Embedded Payroll, will allow vertical SaaS companies to provide payroll support to their own customers.</p>
<p>The move to provide elements of its service through other firms&#8217; offerings could bolster Gusto&#8217;s growth rate; for partner platforms the ability to provide payroll services may make their overall offering more attractive to small businesses.</p>
<p>According to Gusto co-founder and chief product officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerlondon">Tomer London</a>, vertical SaaS companies are offering effectively a &#8220;business in a box&#8221; service today, making the addition of payroll to their own services a somewhat obvious move, as paying workers is a key element of running a company. Indeed, for many companies payroll is their largest expense.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the same interview, Gusto co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuareeves/">Josh Reeves</a> indicated that more of Gusto&#8217;s services could become accessible via externally facing APIs over time. Gusto was built using internal APIs to connect abstracted front and backends, London told TechCrunch, so much of Gusto could eventually become accessible by third-party developers without infinite lift by the company.</p>
<p>That Gusto, formerly ZenPayroll, is starting with payroll services is not a huge surprise given its history. What it adds next is a more interesting question. The company has raised hundreds of millions of dollars while private, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/smb-payroll-startup-gusto-raises-200m-series-d-plans-rd-expansion-to-nyc/">including $200 million in 2019</a>. Gusto was last valued at $3.8 billion in 2019, according to <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NLhyFQKiwJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/smb-payroll-startup-gusto-raises-200m-series-d-plans-rd-expansion-to-nyc/">SMB payroll startup Gusto raises $200M Series D, plans R&#038;D expansion to NYC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SMB payroll startup Gusto raises $200M Series D, plans R&#038;D expansion to NYC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/smb-payroll-startup-gusto-raises-200m-series-d-plans-rd-expansion-to-nyc/embed/#?secret=NLhyFQKiwJ" data-secret="NLhyFQKiwJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The move to offer elements of the unicorn&#8217;s core service package to other companies via a programming hook was not a snap decision, the co-founders told TechCrunch. Instead, it was something that was discussed over a multi-year period while Gusto waited for the right market timing. The rise of vertical SaaS provided the correct moment in the company&#8217;s view. Which seems reasonable, frankly. An example will help explain why.</p>
<p>One early Gusto partner for its embedded payroll offering is Squire, a startup that TechCrunch has covered extensively. Squire is a vertical SaaS shop that makes software for barber shops. It raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/barbershop-management-platform-squire-raises-8-million-series-a-round/">$8 million in 2019</a>, $27 million in early 2020 and another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">$45 million later in the year</a>.</p>
<p>The company is a good example of the <em>build targeted software for a particular industry</em> model (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/wunderite-raises-3m-to-build-software-for-indie-insurance-agencies/">here&#8217;s a recent startup example</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/atlantas-singleops-raises-6m-for-its-outdoor-care-focused-software-business/">and another</a>). By implementing Gusto&#8217;s new embedded payroll service, Squire can offer its current and future customers a more complete digital application to help them run their IRL businesses. And Gusto will be able to drive more revenue from the same code it already uses to power its original offering.</p>
<p>The move by Gusto to open more of its service to other companies while also offering its traditional product fits neatly into a rising trend that TechCrunch has observed regarding more and more startups offering their service not via a managed service, but instead through an API. Gusto is not a young company in startup terms, but the adaptation of its service tracks with what we&#8217;re seeing from other technology upstarts.</p>
<p>According to the co-founders, its embedded payroll service will sport similar economics to its main offering. Gusto proper, Reeves told TechCrunch, grew 50% last year.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha </a>brought on <a href="https://twitter.com/yayalexisgay">Alexis Gay,</a> a former operator at Patreon who now makes her living as comedian and <a href="https://redcircle.com/shows/non-technical">podcast host</a>, to talk about the creator economy &#8212; including our disdain for that horrid phrasing.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Gay gave us an honest look into the life of creator <em>helper</em> turned creator <em>actual</em>, admitting that her current job path wasn&#8217;t possible in 2018. Somewhere, somehow, a VC in the distance heard that admittance as an opportunity to back a creator economy startup.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gay&#8217;s experience at Patreon, and why she left. Alex had some thoughts on the theme. It appears that growing list of creator-focused tools could increase the vapor pressure of folks who write, talk, art, and otherwise create, regarding their present-day employment.</li>
<li>Why one size doesn&#8217;t fit all when it comes to the diverse world of folks engaged in creative work. We also dipped our toes into the issue of indie creators needing to be CEOs as well as artists.</li>
<li>We chatted on Vibely, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/vibely-seed/">a startup that wants to make interactions with creators ~ multi-directional~ </a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">and what it says about scaling time.</span></li>
<li>We also got into what an average day looks like for a full-time creator-comedian-podcaster, why she&#8217;s annoyed with how creators are discussed by founders and investors, and the tooling she hopes to see in the future.</li>
<li>And, well, we had to ask her if she&#8217;s starting a rolling fund too.</li>
</ul>
<p>All told, if you care about the economics of the creative world and want to add some nuance to your theories about it, it&#8217;s a fun episode.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With a lot of us spending more time at home these days, home improvement has continued to be a booming market. Now, one of the big players in that space &#8212; <a href="https://www.servicetitan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ServiceTitan</a>, which builds software that today is used by over 100,000 contractors to manage their work &#8212; is getting a little bigger.</p>
<p>The company &#8212; which also works with contractors that work on business properties &#8212; is acquiring <a href="https://www.youraspire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aspire Software</a>, a software provider specifically for commercial landscapers. Along with that, ServiceTitan is announcing another $200 million in funding, a Series G that values that company at $9.5 billion.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by a new backer, Thoma Bravo, with other unnamed existing investors participating. (That list includes Sequoia, Tiger Global, Dragoneer, T. <span class="xn-person">Rowe Price, </span>Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and ICONIQ Capital.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Los Angeles-based ServiceTitan is not disclosing the financial terms of the deal, but it comes on the heels of the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/with-an-arr-topping-250-million-las-vertical-saas-superstar-servicetitan-is-now-worth-8-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $500 million only in March</a> (when it was valued at $8.3 billion) &#8212; money that it earmarked at the time for acquisitions.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan also confirmed that this is its biggest acquisition yet, which roughly puts this deal in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Aspire will stay based in Missouri to build out the company further from there.</p>
<p>Aspire itself has some 50,000 customers and sees $4 billion in annualized transactions on its platform across areas like landscaping, snow and ice management, and construction. It has never disclosed a valuation, nor how much money it has raised. The St Louis, MO company was previously backed by growth equity firm Mainsail Partners.</p>
<p>The deal underscores not just how much scale and opportunity remains in building technology to serve the home services space, but also what might be a consolidating trend within that, where a smaller number of companies are building technology for contractors and others in the space working across a number of adjacent and related verticals.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan is already bringing in annual recurring revenues of $250 million &#8212; a figure it shared in March and hasn&#8217;t updated &#8212; and as of that month, it had grown 50% over the preceding year. Part of that growth is based on simply more usage of and demand for its software, but part of it also has to do with the company expanding what it covers.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan got its start in residential plumbing, HVAC and electrical &#8212; the areas where the the two founders Ara Mahdessian (CEO) and Vahe Kuzoyan (president) went first because they knew them best from their own family businesses &#8212; but expanded into areas like garage door, chimney and other areas, as well as commercial property, on its own steam.</p>
<p>In other markets like landscaping or pest control, the expertise is more specialized, however, so it makes sense to make acquisitions in those areas to bring in that software, and teams to manage and build it, to further diversify the company. (ServicePro, a pest control company, was acquired in February.)</p>
<p>ServiceTitan said that its contractor customers have made more than $20 billion in transactions in the last year, but with the wider industry of contracting repair and maintenance services estimated to be worth $1 trillion, there is obviously a lot more potential. Hence expanding the range of areas covered in the industry.</p>
<p>“Both Aspire and ServiceTitan were born out of a desire to improve the lives of contractors who work tirelessly to serve their communities, but who have historically been underserved by technology,” said Mahdessian in a statement. “Mark and his team at Aspire have more than 500 years of combined experience in the commercial landscaping industry. Just like we built ServiceTitan to solve the problems our fathers faced, it’s that first-hand industry knowledge that has enabled Aspire to build the most powerful software in the industry with the highest customer satisfaction.”</p>
<p>Thoma Bravo has been making some prolific moves to take majority positions in a number of older tech companies in recent weeks (see <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/thoma-bravo-take-qad-inc-private-2-bln-2021-06-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAD</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proofpoint</a> and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/talend-to-be-acquired-by-thoma-bravo-in-a-2-4-billion-transaction-301244507.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talend</a> for three examples among others). This, however, is a growth investment that is coming as many wonder when and if ServiceTitan might go public.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll hopefully get a chance to ask Mahdessian about that later but in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/with-an-arr-topping-250-million-las-vertical-saas-superstar-servicetitan-is-now-worth-8-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March</a> he hinted that an IPO might come later this year or latest by the end of 2022, depending on market conditions. This Series G round implies perhaps stretching to the later part of that timeframe.</p>
<p>“As the fastest-growing software solution for the trades with an unrelenting focus on customer success, ServiceTitan is poised to extend its leadership and capture increased market share as the industry exceeds $1 trillion globally,” said Robert (Tre) Sayle, a partner at Thoma Bravo, in a statement. “ServiceTitan’s expansion into landscaping, a more than $100 billion market in the US alone, is an important step on its path to provide all home and commercial tradesmen with the tools they need to grow and manage a successful business. We are excited to partner with ServiceTitan and to leverage our software and operational expertise to accelerate the company’s growth and build upon its strong momentum.”</p>
<p>There are a number of companies playing in the wider home services market that speak to the opportunity ahead. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/thumbtack-home-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thumbtack</a> are digging deeper into home management, providing a bridge to contractors to fill out the work needed (and also providing them with the software to do so), while companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobber</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/bigchange-raises-102m-for-a-platform-to-help-manage-service-fleets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BigChange</a>, which have also raised recently, are also looking to build better software to manage individual and fleets of contractors and their fleets.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan, the biggest of the software players now, is likely going to continue making more deals to grow its own empire, but it added that it will also be using the funding to expand more organically, with investments into customer service, R&amp;D, and to hire more people across the board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Pittsburgh Strip District, once home to Industrial Age giants Alcoa, Heinz, U.S. Steel and Westinghouse, has evolved over the past decade into a technology and robotics hub, and notably, a testbed of autonomous vehicles.  That activity has more recently spilled out beyond Smallman Street, so-called Robotics Row, past the confines of the Strip District and Lower Lawrenceville and into adjoining neighborhoods to the north and south.</p>
<p>And while, Argo AI, Aurora Innovation (as well as its newly acquired addition Uber ATG) and Motional are the most visible examples of autonomous vehicle testing and development in the city, numerous other AV startups have popped up in the past six years — each one betting that its application will provide the quickest path to commercialization.</p>
<p>Locomation, a startup founded in 2018 that is working on autonomous trucks, is one of them. The co-founders, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">who met at the National Robotics Engineering Center, an operating unit within Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute, believe the smoothest, fastest route to autonomous trucks is to use a human-guided convoy system first. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Locomation contends that autonomous trucks that can operate without a human safety driver behind the wheel will happen eventually and after considerable validation. But until then, the company is pitching a convoy system, in which a lead driver pilots a truck and another truck follows it autonomously. The autonomous one will also have a driver, but that individual will be resting and is considered a passenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided that we needed to expose the (autonomous) system to the real world in a safe and profitable way,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Çetin Meriçli told TechCrunch in a recent interview, adding that is how the idea of human-guided autonomous driving came about. &#8220;We are still building a Level 4 system with an extremely narrow operational design domain that can drive itself and it doesn&#8217;t require a driver in the seat as long as there is a human driven lead track right in front of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Locomation&#8217;s starting point is a two-driver, two-truck system for long haul routes. When the lead driver is in place, the following driver is resting in the other vehicle. Both trucks are equipped with a self-driving system so they can periodically swap positions.  However, Meriçli noted that while the lead driver is operating the vehicle, the autonomous system is only assisting the person.</p>

<hr />
<p>&#8220;There is some automation there, but we don&#8217;t think it is a good idea to automate the lead truck so much that the lead driver can actually become complacent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Keeping the driver engaged enough and at the same time trying to reduce the cognitive load as much as possible is a very delicate balance to hit there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The drivers then take over manual driving once they leave the interstate.</p>
<p>The next phase is what Locomation calls the drone follower system designed for shorter haul routes of 250 miles or less. This system involves one driver and two trucks, one lead and one following behind autonomously.</p>
<p>These two human guided convoy concepts will help the company progress to an autonomous system in which trucks operate without humans between hubs on an interstate and then eventually to dock to dock, which would include non-interstate roads.</p>
<p>Locomation has a contract to equip 1,120 Wilson Logistics trucks with its autonomous relay convoy technology over the next five years. The first trucks are expected to be delivered in 2022. The company recently signed an eight-year agreement to supply PGT Trucking with the systems for 1,000 trucks.</p>
<p>Today, Locomation is in test mode, although it has hauled some freight. That means safety drivers are always behind the wheel. Eventually, it will transition to a commercial operation, which Meriçli said the company is aiming to launch in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>To reach that goal, Locomation is doing what some many others are aiming for: raising money, recruiting talent and expanding. Locomation, which currently operates across the Alleghany River from Pittsburgh&#8217;s Strip District, will soon move to larger facility in the Tech Forge section.</p>
<p>Mericli said there are at least two dozen startups working on autonomous vehicle technology in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of them are really little hole in the wall operations, maybe a couple of folks,&#8221; Mericli said. &#8221; Many of them are actually the second generation or third generation; they started their careers in one of these larger companies, worked there for a number of years, identified a few pain points and either got frustrated with the slow progress or got bit by the entrepreneurship bug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not quite like Silicon Valley, just yet,&#8221; Mericli said, adding that it is getting closer to that West Coast hub of tech. &#8220;What I see here, which was not the case a couple of years ago, is that now there are some role models, some success stories, some big achievers, like the Argos and Auroras of the world. Hopefully, Locomation is climbing those ladders too. Now young people and new entrepreneurs coming out of the CMU ecosystem, the way they are thinking about their business and their aspirations, it&#8217;s getting closer to the Silicon Valley mindset.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My husband and I are both U.S. permanent residents. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Given what we’ve gone through this past year being isolated from loved ones during the pandemic, we’d like to bring my parents and my sister to the U.S. to be close to our family and help out with our children. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is that possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Symbiotic in Sunnyvale</strong></p>
<p>Dear Symbiotic,</p>
<p>Thanks for your question! Yes, it’s possible to bring your parents and sister to the United States! We have a lot of clients like you who are looking to reunite with their families. My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, and I discussed in a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/077-immigration-for-children-and-dependents/">podcast episode</a> what U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents should know about bringing family members to the United States. In that episode, we also discuss certificates of citizenship for individuals who are U.S. citizens born abroad.</p>
<p>As always, I suggest you consult with an experienced immigration attorney in petitioning for green cards for your parents and sister. An immigration attorney can also discuss alternative immigration options for your sister.</p>

<p><strong>Who can I sponsor as a permanent resident? As a U.S. citizen?</strong></p>
<p>U.S. permanent residents — or green card holders — can only sponsor a spouse or unmarried children for a green card. But if you have lived in the U.S. for at least five years as a green card holder, you are eligible to become a U.S. citizen. U.S. citizens who are at least 21 years old can sponsor a broader list of family members for green cards: parents, spouses, children and stepchildren, brothers and sisters.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online electric micromobility dealership </span><a href="https://www.ridepanda.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridepanda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has announced a raise of $3.75 million that the startup will use to build out its</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">engineering, product and design teams to boost its e-commerce and B2B solutions. The company also wants to double down on strategic partnerships with delivery fleets and businesses offering employees commuter benefits if they purchase an electric vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, e-bike and e-scooter sales skyrocketed. A </span><a href="https://www.bicycleassociation.org.uk/mds-2020-covid-impact-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bicycle Association report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailing the impact of COVID-19 on the U.K. cycling economy from January to October 2020 revealed sales of e-bikes more than doubled. Between April and September, they saw a 92% YoY rise in sales. </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2020/bike-technology-transformation.html/#endnote-sup-59"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte has predicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that in 2023, e-bike sales will top 40 million units worldwide, generating over $22 billion. In a market increasingly favorable to electric micromobility options, Ridepanda’s business could lead sales of electric bikes, scooters and mopeds for both consumers and fleets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“60% of in-car trips take place within zero to five miles, and we think there is a better way to go,” CEO and co-founder of Ridepanda, Chinmay Malaviya, told TechCrunch. “Electric cars is one solution, but we think that our vehicles are cheaper, a lot more accessible, more affordable, more practical, better for traffic congestion, easy to store, easy to park, easy to charge, environmentally friendly and a lot more fun because of the added health benefits.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lime and Scoot veterans have built Ridepanda, a one-stop micromobility marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/lime-and-scoot-veterans-have-built-ridepanda-a-one-stop-micromobility-marketplace/embed/#?secret=baKrwvl8dW" data-secret="baKrwvl8dW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridepanda, which is based in San Francisco but ships to 48 U.S. states, offers a suite of light electric vehicles, from Segway-Ninebot e-scooters to Aventon e-bikes to Niu e-mopeds. The company would not reveal how many vehicles it’s sold since its founding in 2019, but Malaviya told TechCrunch it’s a four-digit number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CTO Charlie Depman says e-bikes are the most popular, directly followed by scooters. Mopeds still have some room for growth, but Depman suspects part of the reason for the lower sales in that category are ongoing pandemic-related, supply-chain issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridepanda vets each vehicle on its site upfront, ensuring all parts are high quality and easy to repair and replace, something that’s very useful if you’ve ever had the frustrating experience of taking your malfunctioning e-scooter to a traditional bike shop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a user comes to Ridepanda’s site, they can use the refined recommendation engine which helps customers choose the right vehicle for their particular use case, whether that’s commuting in the city or leisure rides in the suburbs and everything in between. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A fifth of our customers don’t know what type of vehicle they want when they come to our site,” Depman told TechCrunch. “We give you a ranked set of recommendations for your use case and feature preferences, and you’ll be taken to the vehicle page where we show you more about our dealership and offer maintenance plans, roadside assistance, et cetera to make ownership easy. Basically it’s as easy as it is to own a car, but a lot of this infrastructure isn’t in place for light electric vehicle ownership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vehicles are mailed directly to the customer, who can choose to assemble it or have a trained technician come to the house for home assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s this hands-on approach that the company wants to improve with the fresh funding, specifically automating the post-purchase fulfillment process and building out after sales service in the form of its PandaCare app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“PandaCare has been our flagship dealership offering that has all of the maintenance and roadside assistance and extended warranty,” said Depman. “So ideally this app would entail having access to all those services and being able to call a mechanic to come work on your vehicle. It could also notify you about doing preventative maintenance, or notify us about doing preventative maintenance, so we can help extend the vehicle&#8217;s lifetime.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridepanda is also working on creating a more personalized geographic approach on the product side. Laws and regulations around these vehicles differ from state to state, as do potential rebates and purchase incentives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Representative Earl Blumenauer of Oregon introduced the </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would give a 30% refundable tax credit on the purchase of a new e-bike. The bill hasn’t yet made its way through Congress, but if it passes, and there’s good reason to think it might, Ridepanda hopes to be able to help facilitate the corresponding rise in sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malaviya said Ridepanda is also partnering with the county of San Mateo’s utility provider Peninsula Clean Energy to roll out local e-bike rebates, helping low income communities access them at the point of purchase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very excited to see how we can play a role as a tech partner, as well as a choice platform for consumers in terms of integrating and making it very seamless and easy for folks to take advantage of these rebates and subsidies out there,” said Malaviya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $3.75 million round, which is an extension of the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/lime-and-scoot-veterans-have-built-ridepanda-a-one-stop-micromobility-marketplace/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company’s seed funding last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is led by Porsche Ventures, Yamaha and Proeza Ventures, with participation from angel investor Toby Sun, co-founder of Lime, and Silicon Valley VC General Catalyst, according to Malaviya. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot we can gain from these partnerships,” said Malaviya. “From Yamaha, how do you manage dealerships to supply chains to even actually getting access to the bikes and mopeds? Same with Porsche. They also released a high-end e-bike and we’re excited to also work with them in accessing dealerships and the product, and also the branding piece. And Proeza, we’re pretty excited for all the supply chain expertise we can gain. What is also key about these folks is Porshe’s HQ is in Germany, Yamaha in Japan and Proeza in Latin America. As we look to go outside of the U.S., this could be very helpful.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ro, a direct-to-consumer virtual care company, has scooped up Kit, an at-home diagnostics company with an array of customizable products, from finger prick blood tests to weight measurement tools. The price was undisclosed.</p>
<p>Ro co-founder Zachariah Reitano said that he first approached Kit as a potential customer, hoping to integrate its quality testing into its platform. Him and Kit’s co-founders, Philip Fung and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-salazar-0236621/">Erik Salazar</a>, bonded over shared missions to become a vertically-integrated primary care platform, as well as the current issues that stop consumers from accessing care. The synergy eventually drove Ro to scoop up the 17-month old business.</p>
<p>Kit partners with health insurers, clinical trials, self-insured employers and telehealth platforms to create customizable at-home diagnostic tests. It essentially serves as a white-label solution for physicians, giving them an ordering portal for them to request and tweak the tests that can eventually be delivered to consumers. The company’s in-network approach comes as a contrast to Ro’s vision of direct-to-consumer healthcare, so it will be key to see how Kit customers are impacted by the transaction and if You can bring down prices to hit consumer-friendly benchmarks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reitano stressed Kit’s consumer-friendly UX. Consumers will receive a Kit box on their doorstep, with steps to download the Kit app so they can get step-by-step guidance on how to self-administer their test. There’s other bits within the box, such as a hand warmer to increase blood flow or a piece of foam to practice on (instead of skin).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172062" style="width: 832px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172062" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2172062" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kit-boxes.png" alt="" width="822" height="714" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kit-boxes.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kit-boxes.png?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kit-boxes.png?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kit-boxes.png?resize=768,668 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kit-boxes.png?resize=680,591 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kit-boxes.png?resize=1536,1335 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kit-boxes.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172062" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ro/Kit</p></div></p>
<p>“When I first used Kit, I genuinely felt like I was living in the future,&#8221; Reitano said. “And that doesn&#8217;t happen very frequently.” He declined to name specific competitors, but said that other at-home diagnostic companies have “processes that feel very antiquated” with pamphlets and confusing instructions. Two of the leading players in the at-home testing space are <a href="https://www.everlywell.com/">Everlywell</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/letsgetchecked-raises-71-million-as-covid-19-epidemic-makes-home-testing-increasingly-vital/">LetsGetChecked,</a> which both have raised hundreds of millions in venture capital. Kit raised only a $3.3 million seed round before getting acquired, with investments from Expa, Sherpalo Ventures, South Park Commons, Slow Ventures and Village Global, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kit-com/company_financials">per Crunchbase. </a></p>
<p>“There&#8217;s a fragmentation of care, fragmentation of data and providers aren&#8217;t kept in the loop,” Reitano said. “And we have so much work to do, but Kit is such an important and essential piece in that infrastructure to again bring more and more of a patient&#8217;s care under the same roof.”</p>
<p>As part of the acquisition, Ro has added its first lab to its brand. It will now have access to Kit’s CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited lab, which it owns and operates in San Francisco, CA.</p>
<p>Ro’s acquisition of Kit is its third acquisition in the past 12 months. In December 2020, it acquired Workpath, an in-home care API that allows it to send professionals to a patient’s home or conduct diagnostic tests &#8211; which will eventually be broadened by Kit’s product. In May 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Ro bought Modern Fertility for north of $225 million</a>, which will help it add fertility testing and proactive, reproductive health services to its women’s health offerings. Modern Fertility offers a $129 hormone test for consumers to take at home, a product that will jive with Kit’s host of services.</p>
<p>Becoming a mass consolidator in the digital health space was a hope, not an expectation, says Reitano. From a technical perspective, Ro is now juggling the integration of three startups into its service -with perhaps even more acquisitions on the way. Naturally, the company could face friction when trying to integrate new and existing customers without breaking service &#8211; and it could similarly find that lowering costs of high quality, high touch products like diagnostics may not be as possible as generic drugs.</p>
<p>Still, Reitano thinks that the big opportunity for any company that joins his company is that Ro has scale, with millions of patients across 50 states. Scale can reduce costs, and in this case, supercharge an 16-month old company into a brand that is most recently <a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/ro-snags-500m-series-d-at-5b-valuation#:~:text=The%20new%20funding%20values%20the,July%2C%20according%20to%20PitchBook%20data.'">valued at $5 billion.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh off the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/relativity-space-launches-its-valuation-to-4-2b-with-650m-in-new-funding/">$650 million Series E</a> funding round, 3D printed rocket startup Relativity Space is now preparing to increase production capacity by a factor of ten, with the opening of a 1 million square-foot factory headquarters in Long Beach, California.</p>
<p>Relativity’s current factory, a 150,000 square-foot facility also in Long Beach, will remain in production. That factory will continue to focus on the company’s first rocket, the expendable Terran 1 that&#8217;s designed for smaller payloads. The new facility is aimed at building out the development and production of Terran R, Relativity’s heavy-lift, fully-reusable two stage rocket. Neither rocket has seen orbit yet, but Relativity aims to launch Terran 1 at the end of 2021 and Terran R as early as 2024.</p>
<p>Along with the factory opening, which is slated for January 2022, the company is also planning a hiring push – Relativity hopes to add at least 200 employees by the end of this year, CEO Tim Ellis told TechCrunch. The new facility has a labor force capacity of over 2,000, so “we’re certainly going to get into the thousands [of new hires] as we’re launching Terran One and then kicking off Terran R development as well,” Ellis said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2171155" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171155" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171155" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Relativity-HQ_View-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Relativity-HQ_View-2.jpg 4800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Relativity-HQ_View-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Relativity-HQ_View-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Relativity-HQ_View-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Relativity-HQ_View-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Relativity-HQ_View-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Relativity-HQ_View-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Relativity-HQ_View-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171155" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.relativityspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relativity Space <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The company’s proprietary 3D printers, Stargate, can print either of the company’s two rockets. But they’re capable of much more than that – theoretically, at least. The Terran R is reusable, so the company will likely need to manufacture far fewer rockets than what the massive new facility will be capable of producing. So that begs the question: what are all those printers going to make?</p>
<p>Ellis alluded to other possibilities. “While it&#8217;s building Terran R, and doing Terran R development initially, certainly over time we&#8217;ll be able to continually upgrade and reconfigure this factory of the future to be able to build whatever else in aerospace that we&#8217;d go into next,” he said. But he stayed mum on exactly what that might look like.</p>
<p>“We will actually have a lot of extra print capacity over time, because we&#8217;ll be reusing Terran R. So at that point, we&#8217;ll have a ton of printers with a bunch of free time. You could imagine what one does, once you have that capability, you just keep diving into the next product to disrupt.”</p>
<p>In addition to the Stargate printers, the space will also house customized DMLS metal printers, a metallurgical laboratory, machine shop, and a mission control center. In the mission control center, true to its name, engineers and mission operators will be able to monitor and manage launches that take place in Cape Canaveral, Florida or Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.</p>
<p>Relativity is leasing the space “for a long period of time” from property owner Goodman Group, Ellis said. The site was previously being used by Boeing to manufacture C-17 cargo military planes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As enterprises and carriers gear up for operating and scaling IoT services and monitoring the activity of their devices, machines and more globally, a startup that is building technology to make this easier and cheaper to implement is announcing some funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://flolive.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FloLive</a>, which has built a cloud-based solution to stitch together private, local cellular networks to create private global IoT 5G networks for its customers, has raised $15.5 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its service, both through investing and building out its tech stack, upgrading its network to 5G where it&#8217;s being used, and building a global SIM2Cloud offering in partnership with an as-yet unnamed global cloud provider.</p>
<p>Intel Capital, the investment arm of the chip giant, is leading the investment, with Qualcomm Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital, 83North and Saban Ventures also participating. Intel, Qualcomm and Dell are all strategic backers here: the three work with carriers and enterprises to power and manage services and devices, and this will give them potentially a better way of integrating a much more flexible, global technology and network to provision those services more seamlessly across different geographies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is an extension to a <a href="https://flolive.net/flolive-announces-21-5-million-series-b-funding-round-and-appointment-of-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$21.5 million round</a> that London-based FloLive raised last year, bringing the total for the Series B to $37 million. From what we understand, the startup is also now working on its Series C.</p>
<p>As we move towards more ubiquitous 5G networks and services that use them, the challenge in the market that FloLive is addressing is a critical one to get right.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, enterprises and carriers that are building networks for managing IoT and other connected devices face a scaling issue. Typically, IoT networks to cover services like these are built on national or even more localized footprints, making it a challenge &#8212; if not completely impossible &#8212; to control or monitor devices in a global network in a centralized way.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look on high level at tier one networks, you see two main things,&#8221; Nir Shalom, FloLive&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview. &#8220;These networks are built for local footprints, and they are mainly built for consumers. What we do is different in that we think about the global, not local, footprint; and our data networks are for IoT, not only people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course there are some carriers that might look at building their own networks to rival this, but they will often lack the scaled use cases to do so, and may in any case work with providers like FloLive to build these anyway. The bigger picture is that there are 900 larger mobile network operators globally, Shalom said, and the majority of that group is far from being able to do this themselves.</p>
<p>FloLive&#8217;s approach to fixing this is not to build completely new infrastructure, but to stitch together networks from different localities and to run them as a single network. It does this by way of its software-defined connectivity built and implemented in the cloud, which stitches together not just 5G networks but whatever cellular technology happens to be in use (eg 4G, 3G or even 2G) in a particular locale.</p>
<p>FloLive&#8217;s tech lives in the core network, where it builds a private radio access network that it can integrate with carriers and their capacity in different markets, while then managing the network for customers as a single service.</p>
<p>This is somewhat similar to what you might get with a enterprise virtual private network except that this is focused specifically on the kinds of use cases that might use connected objects &#8212; FloLive cites manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and utilities as four areas &#8212; rather than laptops for employees.</p>
<p>The resulting network, however, also becomes a viable alternative for companies that might otherwise use a VPN for connectivity, too, as well as carriers themselves needing to extend their network for a customer. In addition to its IoT focused core network, it also provides business support systems for IoT, device management, and solutions targeted for specific verticals. FloLive supports devices that use SIM or eSIM or &#8220;softSIM&#8221; technology to connect to networks. That&#8217;s one part that likely interested those strategic investors as it allows for significantly easier integration.</p>
<p>“We are truly excited about floLIVE’s unique cloud-native approach to IoT connectivity,” said David Johnson, MD at Intel Capital, in a statement. “Cloud-native architectures bring efficiency, scalability and flexibility which are important for IoT services. In addition, floLIVE’s cloud-based core can provide consistency of features across many independent private and public networks. We look forward to the expansion of floLIVE’s products and services enabled by this investment.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to note the round is $15.5 million, not $15 million.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For a glimpse of the security and privacy dystopia the UK government has in store for its highly regulated &#8216;British Internet&#8217;, look no further than <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/private-and-public-channels-improve-the-safety-of-your-online-platform">guidance</a> put out by the Department of Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) yesterday &#8212; aimed at social media platforms and private messaging services &#8212; which includes the suggestion that the latter should &#8220;prevent&#8217; the use of end-to-end encryption on &#8220;child accounts&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, the UK government is saying: &#8216;No end-to-end encryption for our kids please, they&#8217;re British&#8217;.</p>
<p>And while this is merely guidance for now, the chill is real &#8212; because legislation is already on the table.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Online Safety Bill was published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">back in May</a>, with Boris Johnson&#8217;s government setting out a sweeping plan to force platforms to regulate user generated content by imposing a legal duty to protect users from illegal (or merely just &#8220;harmful&#8221;) content.</p>
<p>The bill controversially bundles up requirements to report illegal stuff like child sexual exploitation content to law enforcement with far fuzzier mandates that platforms take action against a range of much-harder-to-define &#8216;harms&#8217; (from cyber bullying to romance scams).</p>
<p>The end result looks like a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Except the &#8216;nut&#8217; that could get smashed to pieces in this ministerial vice is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">UK Internet users&#8217; digital security and privacy</a>. (Not to mention any UK startups and digital businesses that aren&#8217;t on board with mass-surveillance-as-a-service.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the danger if the government follows through on its wonky idea that &#8212; on the Internet &#8212; &#8216;safety&#8217; means security must be replaced with blanket surveillance in order to &#8216;keep kids safe&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Online Safety Bill is not the first wonky tech policy plan the UK has come up with. An earlier bid to force adult content providers to age verify users was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/uk-quietly-ditches-porn-age-checks-in-favor-of-wider-online-harms-rules/">dropped in 2019</a>, having been widely criticized as unworkable as well as a massive privacy intrusion and security risk.</p>
<p>However, at the time, the government said it was only abandoning the &#8216;porn blocks&#8217; measure because it was planning to bring forward &#8220;the most comprehensive approach possible to protecting children&#8221;. Hence the Online Safety Bill now stepping forward to push platforms to remove robust encryption in the name of &#8216;protecting children&#8217;.</p>
<p>Age verification technologies &#8212; and all sorts of content monitoring solutions (surveillance tech, doubtless badged as &#8216;safety&#8217; tech) &#8212; also look likely to proliferate as a consequence of this approach.</p>
<p>Pushing platforms to proactively police speech and surveil usage in the hopes of preventing an ill-defined grab-bag of &#8216;harms&#8217; &#8212; or, from the platforms&#8217; perspective, to avoid the risk of eye-watering fines from the regulator if it decides they&#8217;ve failed in this &#8216;duty of care&#8217; &#8212; also obviously conjures up a nightmare scenario for online freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Aka: &#8216;Watch what you type, even in the privacy of your private messaging app, because the UK Internet safety thought police are watching/might block you&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>Privacy rights for UK minors appear to be first on the chopping block, via what DCMS&#8217; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/private-and-public-channels-improve-the-safety-of-your-online-platform">guidance</a> refers to as &#8220;practical steps to manage the risk of online harm if your online platform allows people to interact, and to share text and other content&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, pretty much, if your online platform has any kind of communication layer at all then.</p>
<p>Letting kids have their own safe spaces to express themselves is apparently incompatible with ministers&#8217; populist desire to brand the UK &#8216;the safest place to go online in the world&#8217;, as they like to spin it.</p>
<p>How exactly the UK will achieve safety online if government zealots force service providers to strip away robust security (e2e encryption) &#8212; torching the standard of data protection and privacy wrapping Brits&#8217; personal information &#8212; is quite the burning question.</p>
<p>Albeit, it&#8217;s not one the UK government seems to have considered for even a split second.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve known for a long time that one of government’s goals for the Online Safety Bill is the restriction, if not the outright criminalisation, of the use of end-to-end encryption,&#8221; said <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2020/12/31/2021_tech_prediction/">Heather Burns</a>, a policy manager for the digital rights organization Open Rights Group (ORG), one of many vocal critics of the government&#8217;s approach &#8212; discussing the wider implications of the policy push with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recent messaging strategies promoted by government and the media have openly sought to associate end-to-end encryption with child abuse, and to imply that companies which use it are aiding and abetting child exploitation. So DCMS’s newly-published guidance advising the voluntary removal of encryption from children’s accounts is a precursor to it becoming a likely legal requirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s also part of government’s drive, again as part of the Online Safety Bill, to require all services to implement mandatory age verification on all users, for all content or applications, in order to identify child users, in order to withhold encryption from them, thanks to aggressive lobbying from the age verification industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>That ministerial rhetoric around the Online Safety Bill is heavy on tub-thumping emotional appeals (to &#8216;protect our children from online nasties&#8217;) and low on sequential logic or technological coherence is not a surprise: Successive Conservative governments have, after all, had a massive bee in their bonnets about e2e encryption &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/13/clearly-an-idiot/">dating back to the David Cameron years</a>.</p>
<p>Back then ministers were typically taking aim at strong encryption on counter-terrorism grounds, arguing the tech is bad because it prevents law enforcement from catching terrorists. (And they went on to pass <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption/">beefed up surveillance laws which also include powers to limit the use of robust encryption</a>.)</p>
<p>However, under more recent PMs Theresa May and Boris Johnson, the child protection rhetoric has stepped up too &#8212; to the point where messaging channels are now being actively encouraged not to use e2e encryption altogether.</p>
<p>Next stop: State-sanctioned commercial mass surveillance. And massive risks for all UK Internet users subject to this anti-security, anti-privacy &#8216;safety&#8217; regime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite government’s claim that the Bill will make the UK &#8216;the safest place in the world to be online&#8217;, restricting or criminalising encryption will actually make the UK an unsafe place for any company to do business,&#8221; warned Burns. &#8220;We will all need to resort to VPNs and foreign services, as happens in places like China, in order to keep our data safe. It’s likely that many essential services will block UK customers, or leave the UK altogether, rather than be compelled to act as a privatised nanny state over insecure data flows.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a section of the DCMS guidance entitled &#8220;protect children by limiting functionality&#8221;, the government department literally suggests that &#8220;private channels&#8221; (i.e. services like messaging apps) &#8220;prevent end-to-end encryption for child accounts&#8221;. And since accurately age identifying online users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users/">remains a challenge</a> it follows that in-scope services may simply decide it&#8217;s less legally risky if they don&#8217;t use e2e at all.</p>
<p>DCMS&#8217;s guidance also follows up with an entirely bolded paragraph &#8212; in which the government then makes a point of highlighting e2e encryption as a &#8220;risk&#8221; to users, <em>generally</em> &#8212; and, therefore by implication, to future compliance with the forthcoming Online Safety legislation&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>End-to-end encryption makes it more difficult for you to identify illegal and harmful content occurring on private channels. You should consider the risks this might pose to your users</strong>,&#8221; the UK government writes, emphasis its.</p>
<p>Whether anything can stop this self-destructive policy train now it&#8217;s left the Downing Street station is unclear. Johnson has a whopping majority in parliament &#8212; and years left before he has to call a general election.</p>
<p>The only thing that could derail the most harmful elements of the Online Safety Bill is if the UK public wakes up to the dangers it poses to everyone&#8217;s security and privacy &#8212; and if enough MPs take notice and push for amendments.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/mps-encryption-keeps-your-constituents-safe/">ORG</a>, along with some 30 other digital and humans rights groups, called on MPs to do just that and &#8220;help keep constituents&#8217; data safe by protecting e2e encryption from legislative threats&#8221; &#8212; warning that this<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;basic and essential&#8221; security protocol is at risk from clauses in the bill that</span> introduce requirements for companies to scan private and personal messages for evidence of criminal wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Zero access encryption is seen by the UK government as a blocker to such scanning.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to do this, the use of end-to-end encryption is likely to be defined as a violation of the law,&#8221; the ORG also warned. &#8220;And companies operating in the UK who want to continue to defend user privacy through end-to-end encryption could, under the draft Bill, be threatened with partial shutdowns, being blocked from the UK, or even personal arrests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We call on Parliament to ensure that end-to-end encryption must not be threatened or undermined by the Online Safety Bill, and that services utilising strong encryption are left out of the Bill’s content monitoring and filtering requirements,&#8221; it added in the <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/mps-encryption-keeps-your-constituents-safe/">online appeal</a>.</p>
<p>DMCS has been contacted with questions on the logic of the government&#8217;s policy toward e2e encryption.</p>
<p>In a statement yesterday, the digital minister Caroline Dinenage said: “We’re helping businesses get their safety standards up to scratch before our new online harms laws are introduced and also making sure they are protecting children and users right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want businesses of all sizes to step up to a gold standard of safety online and this advice will help them to do so.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2020 lots of workloads shifted to the cloud due to the pandemic, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that figuring out how to migrate those workloads got any easier. <a href="https://www.device42.com/">Device42</a>, a startup that helps companies understand their infrastructure, has a new product that is designed to analyze your infrastructure and make recommendations about the most cost-effective way to migrate to the cloud.</p>
<p>Raj Jalan, CEO and co-founder, says that the tool uses machine learning to help discover the best configuration, and supports four cloud vendors including AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle plus VMware running on AWS.</p>
<p>&#8220;The [new tool] that&#8217;s coming out is a multi-cloud migration and recommendation [engine]. Basically, with machine learning what we have done is in addition to our discovery tool [&#8230;] is we can constantly update based on your existing utilization of your resources, what it is going to cost you to run these resources across each of these multiple clouds,&#8221; Jalan explained.</p>
<p>This capability builds on the company&#8217;s core competency, which is providing a map of resources wherever they exist along with the dependencies that exist across the infrastructure, something that&#8217;s extremely hard for organizations to understand. &#8220;Our focus is on hybrid IT discovery and dependency mapping, [whether the] infrastructure is on prem, in colocation facilities or in the cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That helps Device42 customers see how all of the different pieces of infrastructure including applications work together. &#8220;You can&#8217;t find a tool that does everything together, and also gives you a very deep discovery where you can go from the physical layer all the way to the logical layer, and see things like, &#8216;this is where my storage sits on this web server…&#8217;,&#8221; Jalan said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this isn&#8217;t about managing resources or making any changes to allocation. It&#8217;s about understanding your entire infrastructure wherever it lives and how the different parts fit together, while the newest piece finds the most cost-effective way to migrate to the cloud it from its current location.</p>
<p>The company has been around since 2012, has around 100 employees. It has raised around $38 million including a $34 million Series A in 2019. It hasn&#8217;t required a ton of outside investment as Jalan reports they are cash flow positive with &#8220;decent growth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many startups pledging to reinvent the mortgage process that it’s hard to keep up. But for anyone who has had to go through the process of applying for one, it’s clear that there’s plenty of room for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest startup to raise venture money with the goal of making the process “smarter and faster” is one that was founded by a pair of executives that spent years at real estate giant Zillow. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is very early stage &#8212; so early stage that it is only launching operations in conjunction with announcing it has just raised $70 million in seed funding. That’s a massive seed round by any standards (the third-largest in the U.S., according to Crunchbase), but especially for the real estate tech space (perhaps the largest ever).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ribbit Capital led the financing, which also included participation from DST Global, NFX and Zigg Capital.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Zillow executives Greg Schwartz and Carey Armstrong founded Stamford, CT-based Tomo in the fall of 2020 to take on big banks when it comes to providing mortgages to consumers. CEO Schwartz first joined Zillow in 2007, where he says he “built the sales and revenue operations from the ground up.” Armstrong, who serves as Tomo’s chief revenue officer, previously led business strategy, product strategy and core operations for Zillow’s $1 billion buyer services business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching today in Seattle, Dallas and Houston, Tomo says it will do things like issue fully underwritten pre-approvals “within hours, not days” and guarantee on-time closing. This is particularly important in competitive markets with multiple buyers making offers on homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use data to get homebuyers to closing in as little as 21 days, which they say is less than half of the </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/closing-on-a-house"><span style="font-weight: 400;">industry average of 47 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, on top of all that, it claims it will offer “the lowest rates in the industry” with “customer-obsessed service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that besides having founders that have years of experience at a company with a reach like Zillow’s, they also aim to be different from other competitors in the space in that they are strictly focused on the buyer. For example, it won’t do any refinancing for existing homeowners but focus strictly on helping buyers secure new mortgage loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The big banks have never made more money, yet an experience with their mortgage business has never been worse,” Schwartz told TechCrunch. “And it&#8217;s because the incumbents have no reason to fundamentally change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s early days yet, only time will tell if Tomo can live up to its lofty goals. No doubt it has plenty of competition. In the past week alone, we’ve reported on two other digital mortgage startups raising significant funding rounds, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/lower-raises-100m-series-a-from-accel/">Lower</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/accept-inc-secures-90m-in-debt-equity/">Accept</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomo&#8217;s investors are clearly confident about its potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ribbit Capital’s Nick Huber said his firm had been connected to Schwartz and Armstrong prior to their even starting Tomo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we learned that the two of them were working together, we immediately knew that we had to be a part of the journey,” he said. “We gained the conviction to lead the seed round as the team shared more of their vision for the future of home buying, which is a broken experience that they deeply understand and have the insight and relationships to fix.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFX founder and general partner Pete Flint has known Schwartz and Armstrong under a different capacity. They were once rivals. Flint co-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded another online real estate giant, Trulia and was its CEO and chairman from its 2005 inception until it was </span><a href="http://zillowgroup.mediaroom.com/2015-02-17-Zillow-Completes-Acquisition-of-Trulia-for-2-5-Billion-in-Stock-Forms-Zillow-Group-Family-of-Brands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by Zillow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for $2.5 billion in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were initially competitors and then deep collaborators after the Trulia/Zillow merger,” Flint said. Once the pair formed Tomo, Flint says NFX “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had not seen a team that was so experienced and thoughtful about the entire real estate experience that was going after the mortgage and home buying opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the investment represents NFX’s largest initial investment to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are rethinking the entire software stack and building a modern fintech company, free of legacy constraints,” he added.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[MKT1 is a strategic marketing firm founded by experienced startup executives that is everything but a marketing agency. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mkt1.co/">MKT1</a> is a strategic marketing firm founded by experienced startup executives that is everything but a marketing agency. It advises startups on marketing approaches, recruiting and mentoring workshops, with some angel syndicate investing as well. It also provides a job board, a <a href="https://mkt1.substack.com/">newsletter</a>, and workshops for marketers.</p>
<p>Founders Kathleen Estreich and Emily Kramer say they are responding to a few big trends in the startup world. These days, young companies are raising more capital than ever and facing increased pressure to maintain rapid growth, but founders are typically focused on technology and product problems. The result, as they have sometimes seen first-hand, is marketing coming in too early or too late to truly help a startup grow. Instead, Kramer and Estreich help companies make marketing a core part of how they execute from their early days.</p>
<p>Estreich, previously at Facebook, Box, Intercom and Scalyr, and Kramer, previously Ticktfly, Asana, Astro and Carta, were recommended to us through our survey seeking recommendations for top growth marketers in the startup industry. (If you have your own recommendation, please fill out the survey <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">here</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the interview below, they share more about how they recruit startup marketers and advise founders to approach marketing based on needs and several other issues that are critical for early-stage startups.</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re both accomplished marketers and have worked at big-name companies. What made you decide to leave that career and open your own marketing firm?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It was different for both of us. I was working in sales, and I left actually and had a baby. COVID hit and we were uncertain&#8230; Emily and I have known each other for several years, so she and I started talking over a year ago about what we were up to and what we were thinking about.  </span>One of the trends that we were seeing was a lot of the companies when we started were typical founders [focused on technology and product], and there was a gap around helping them go to market and helping them with marketing.</p>
<p>We started talking and realized that we love working with founders; we love working with early-stage companies. We wanted to do that full-time. So we started doing that fall of last year and it&#8217;s been awesome. We&#8217;ve gotten to work with a lot of interesting companies and we&#8217;re starting to see a lot of trends. Hiring is a huge, huge thing, and it’s figuring out who&#8217;s the right person, when do you hire them, how do you find them, and how do you hire them.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> It’s somewhat similar for me. I had been the first, or first-ish, marketer at TicketFly and then at Asana — I was a marketer there and built up a team to about 25 people. I really love building teams, and I like them at scale too. I love the puzzle that is building a marketing team with all of the different functions, whether its hiring or figuring out what to do strategically.</p>
<p>Then I joined a seed-funded company — again, because I love building — a company called Astro. I actually had this experience where they hired too senior, too early on the marketing side, which is also a mistake I see people making. While we were trying to find product-market fit, I realized I was probably too senior coming off my experience at Asana. I then went to Carta — but Carta was 300 people. We didn’t have marketing at all. They had stops and starts and had a large-scale organization, so I built that marketing team up — just much later [stage].</p>
<p>I ended up filing a lawsuit against Carta, that is fairly public, for discrimination on equal pay, retaliation, among other things <em>[Ed. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/cartas-former-marketing-vp-who-spearheaded-its-report-on-pay-inequality-is-suing-over-gender-discrimination/">TechCrunch coverage here</a>]</em>. After an experience like that, you start to re-evaluate things. So Kathleen and I started advising companies together and it&#8217;s become more than just advising. We help early companies build their marketing functions across the board.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You focus on SaaS companies. Is there a reason that you have that focus versus going broader?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> That&#8217;s been our experience. Since leaving Facebook, I worked at B2B SaaS companies, with different audiences and different stages, so that&#8217;s been my experience. I think there&#8217;s a huge opportunity for marketing and it is changing in the B2B SaaS world.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> While we do focus on SaaS marketing, I think our sweet spot is in modern marketing, and significantly, self-serve as well as a lot of developer marketing. We actually think that developer marketing is how all of our things should be. It focuses on adding value, and it focuses on treating people like humans.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve written extensively about how to think about marketing in the earliest stages of a company. So what are the biggest mistakes that you see founders still making in 2021?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> I would say either they go too early or too late with who they&#8217;re hiring. Or one of the things that we talked about is that your first marketers are actually your founders. They’re the ones who help tell your story and do your early marketing.</p>
<p>I think a big part of it is finding that right early team on, and one of the key insights that we’ve written about is that the first marketer should be really a <a href="https://mkt1.substack.com/p/marketing-org-chart">pi-shaped marketer</a>. It&#8217;s someone who has breadth and depth, who has experience with product marketing and growth marketing. It is your first marketing hire. Regardless of what you&#8217;re hiring them for, they do everything since you don’t have anyone else. They are the default of every aspect of marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> It’s not necessarily that you&#8217;re an expert in two areas instead of all the areas — product marketing, growth marketing, content marketing. So two of those areas, and normally, that is growth marketing and product marketing, based on what they need.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> When you’re thinking about going to market, some companies think that content is going to be the most important thing, so your first marketer should be pretty competent in it.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> I think the number-one thing that we look for, when we help companies with job descriptions and planning, is someone that is strategic and scrappy. But they also need to be able to set their own goals and figure out what to do, because the other trend that we see in marketing and marketing hires, is that founders will give marketers goals like “write 10 blog posts.”</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the goal. What are you trying to drive? Are you trying to drive web traffic, because it actually just disincentivizes me as a content person or as a marketer to write good content if I have to write 10 pieces. It instead drives 50,000 page views. I could go write one really amazing data study or well-researched piece that does all of that that drives way more than 10 shitty posts.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> You could do a smaller number of things better and get the same outcomes. So it&#8217;s really that balance of a bunch of things you could do. And one of the most common conversations Emily and I have with marketers right now is, “How do I prioritize? What should I do?”</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> “How do I set goals really about prioritization and how do I have my goals set in a way that is focused on these different activities?” Find that sweet spot of someone who still wants to get their hands dirty and wants to go early but can think strategically about what we are doing uniquely and how are we going to have an impact.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> People who have experience with your business model is another thing that we look at. So if you&#8217;re a top-down enterprise sales company, the marketing function in various fields are very different than if you&#8217;re bottom, inbound-driven. So hiring someone that matches what you think your go-to-market is going to look like, I think, is an important thing. It&#8217;s a different way of viewing the world, and if you compare companies, they might hire someone who has done one or the other. But you want someone who actually is new because that’s more important than almost the industry experience.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> Sometimes consumer stuff might be more similar to your business model. To amplify what Kathleen was saying about the industry, I think a lot of times I work with tech companies and they’re like we need people that have done fintech or finance. Now, you’re narrowing an already small pool for an early-stage marketing role to an even smaller pool. Getting a person that’s not too senior in their career, that&#8217;s full of ambition and can learn quickly is worth it versus them having the experience. Your company should have other people that are experts in the areas.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> So I think part of that, too, is a willingness and excitement around the audience. Similar to Emily, I&#8217;ve worked in marketing for very different audiences in my career. And part of it is like, am I excited about diving in and learning about this space?</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are the major trends that you&#8217;re seeing in marketer hiring right now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> Companies are going to marketers early on. One reason is that companies are in the larger rounds earlier than ever before. When you have more money to spend on go-to-market and marketing earlier, you&#8217;re bringing on marketers while earlier on.</p>
<p>Now some founders still aren’t. And they’re like, “Oh, we don’t need marketing.” But founders that really know that they need to differentiate how they&#8217;re doing distribution — which in my opinion would be a company that’s successful — are like, “Oh, we have more money to hire earlier on.” So there’s a shortage [of marketers], I think. I imagine that we will start to see turnover right after Labor Day, when some companies make people go back to the office.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;re keeping a very close eye on going back to the office.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> I think it’s harder than ever with early-stage marketing goals.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> There are many more companies that are starting earlier and getting funding, and then when you get that funding earlier, there&#8217;s pressure to grow earlier. You&#8217;re like, “OK, we need marketing help sooner.” And then the bigger companies are doing great, people are like, “I&#8217;m sitting on this large exit package — what&#8217;s my incentive to go?”</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> And I think there is starting to be a little less stigma on the job bouncing; people are like, “This isn&#8217;t great, I&#8217;m super lonely and I&#8217;m at home, I&#8217;m not being treated great. &#8230; I&#8217;m going to go somewhere else.” I think there&#8217;s also just more attrition in marketing roles than in other roles. Because to be the head of marketing you typically need to understand these different areas of marketing, and if you&#8217;re at a large company then you&#8217;re going to get siloed and you’re not going to learn these things and you&#8217;re going to stifle your career.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> Yeah, being clear about the benefits and the downsides of a big job is important. I&#8217;ve always appreciated this about companies that I&#8217;ve talked to, or about joining, that tell me everything so that when I get there, I’m not surprised. Because if you try and surprise me, I’m gonna find out anyway. To the extent that, you know, you could learn as much as you can without joining.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s important. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do on both sides, like help companies, you know, set these jobs up for success. And then on the marketer side, help them know what it’s actually going to be like and to the extent that we can do some sort of matching to help find good people for these companies that we think are good fits.</p>
<p><strong>In one of your Substack posts, you said that “marketing strategy needs to be a healthy mix of testing new things, scaling what works, and optimizing what’s already working. Setting goals is critical here.” How do you work with companies to ensure that their goals are appropriate for the stage that they’re at?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> There are things that we say “keep the lights on,” like traffic numbers, conversion numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> The steady state of marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> And then there are things that can cause step-change growth, if you measure to find them. If you&#8217;re measuring everything against the same measures/metrics, you&#8217;re never going to get there, because the tests are never going to perform as well as the stuff that has already been up and running.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s also about breaking up your goals. &#8220;Here are the big steps we’re taking and here are the step-change drivers that we hypothesize are a good idea and here’s how we&#8217;re going to test these things.&#8221; It&#8217;s the balancing of these quick wins and things that keep the lights on and long-term projects and how to bite off a little bit to test it.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> &#8220;What are we trying to do?&#8221; And then, &#8220;What&#8217;s the action plan we need to put together?&#8221; Other than that, &#8220;What can we do in the next three months?&#8221; And then, &#8220;What do we need to do and invest in the next several months?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> You know, this is why I always say there&#8217;s so many different things that you can do. And I don&#8217;t think founders realize how many things there are to do, because founders often think of marketing in a couple of pockets. They&#8217;re like, “Oh, it&#8217;s ads, PR.” But it’s a lot more than that; it’s many things that are going to drive growth, both short-term and long-term. That’s a very fast definition of marketing, but that&#8217;s basically what it is. But there&#8217;s so many different things to do.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re more than most agencies, you’re angel investors and advisers. Is that how you think about yourselves, are you an operator rather than a growth marketing agency?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> We&#8217;re not a marketing agency; we are strategic marketers. We’re going to recommend agencies that you should work with. Part of this is like, &#8220;Could we go be operator VCs? Could we go raise a fund?&#8221; Yeah, probably &#8230; we&#8217;re doing this as advising and investing. We actually treat a lot of what we’re doing like you would at a SaaS company. We realized everybody wants help with recruiting. So we iterated on some stuff [and] launched a <a href="https://pallet.xyz/list/mkt1-jobs/jobs">new job board</a>.</p>
<p>And then we do angel investing. We&#8217;re always interested in iterating on what we&#8217;re doing there. So yes, there&#8217;s a huge switch towards people raising money from operators who are definitely part of that shift. We want to help as many companies as [we can whose] values are mission-aligned. And we also want to elevate markers. &#8230; I&#8217;m a marketer. That&#8217;s what I do. It&#8217;s marketing.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a bad word and marketers are/aren’t angel investors, and marketers often get paid less and marketers are often thought of as second-class citizens in the company. So we want to elevate the role of marketing to and help other workers. As much as we want to help companies grow, we also want to help marketers. We&#8217;re still trying to figure out the best way to do all of those things.</p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> We started off like, “OK, what do we like to do? Where do we see the market?” We like helping founders sort of think through early-stage marketing jobs, as we could do that as advisers then, you know. What are the common themes that we&#8217;re seeing? Everyone needs help on recruiting: How can we help not just these companies, but generally as well, which is like the job board that we talked about.</p>
<p>And I think there is a need in the market, like we talked about at the beginning, where there are many companies that started earlier with technical founders dealing with exposure to a lot of the business side. Companies that have good marketing are going to be more successful. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re advising them, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re working with those marketers. That&#8217;s a main reason we started what we&#8217;re doing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.kikoff.com">Kikoff</a>, a personal finance platform aimed at helping consumers build credit, announced today that it has raised $30 million in a Series B round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The capital is in addition to the $12.5 million the startup raised across previously unannounced seed and Series A rounds, which were both led by Lightspeed Venture partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portage Ventures led Kickoff&#8217;s Series B, which included participation from Lightspeed, GGV, Coatue and Core Innovation Capital. Previous backers of the company include NBA star Steph Curry, Wex CEO Melissa Smith and Teresa Ressel, former CFO of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Cynthia Chen and CTO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christophe Chong co-founded the San Francisco-based company in late 2019 with the goal of helping consumers without a credit history establish one, and helping those with credit histories to continue building credit. The pair came from “low to moderate income” families, Chen said, and say they want to help others who also come from similar economic backgrounds. Chen grew up in Beijing before coming to the U.S. for college on a scholarship and says she was struck by the experience of her parents having to borrow money from family and friends in order to purchase a TV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, Chen did say that Kikoff has “hundreds of thousands” of customers after being out of beta for half a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kikoff’s product, the &#8220;Kikoff Credit Account,&#8221; is the first of a planned suite of offerings all aimed at improving consumers’ financial health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many Americans who don&#8217;t come from affluent families and have tons of student loan debt,” Chen said. “For them and so many others, we wanted to create a better way to build good credit than existing offers in the market.” While anyone can use its platform, Chen says the vast majority of its customers are millennials and GenZers as they are most in need of a way to build credit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Kikoff, the pair aim to give people not only a way to build a credit history, but also a way to increase consumer financial literacy. Rather than provide a debit or credit card that can be used anywhere, Kikoff restricts the use of its line of credit to an online store it’s created. Users can purchase things like e-books covering a variety of finance-related topics such as how to plan and budget, or profit from trading bitcoin. It also has a selection of courses that it has purchased resell rights for, covering topics such as personal finance education, or how to set up an e-commerce store or even how to learn Python programming skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When a consumer purchases something from our store, [that] item is going to help that person improve his or her financial habits or help him or her make money by making smarter investments, or setting up their small business or learning skills,” Chen told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also does not charge any interest on its credit line or fees for the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no cost of borrowing money,” she said. Instead, Kikoff collects revenue by taking the margin between the wholesale price for the items it sells in its store and the retail price that customers pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sign up, customers first apply for a $500 revolving line of credit that can be used for purchases at Kikoff’s online store. The company touts that within months, its customers “can become eligible for better interest rates, competitive credit cards and home mortgages,” among other things within a relatively short period of about 45 days. </span></p>
<p>Kikoff has intentionally worked to help its customers build credit in what Chen describes as &#8220;a very financially responsible way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why they are able to only use the product within our proprietary online store, and we have a number of affordable items in the store for them to purchase,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;So it is relatively easy for them to not overspend or make any kind of impulse purchase that they later cannot really afford to pay.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed Partner Ansaf Kareem said he could empathize with the experiences of Chen and Chong in having to create and build credit for the first time, “especially as immigrants and first-generation Americans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A credit score holds the keys to your financial future, yet so many Americans struggle with creating and building credit,” he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Adjacent products may let you check your credit score, but do not provide tools or guidance to improve it without charging fees or asking for a large up-front cash commitment,” he added. “Kikoff built a product that provides real value through a simple, no fee structure to initiate and build credit. And they are just getting started.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kikoff’s executive team certainly has an impressive background in fintech. Chen previously served as Figure’s Chief Risk Officer and she held senior executive roles at Capital One and OnDeck. Chong was former head of growth at Lime and led growth teams at Facebook and Square. Andrew Brix, Kikoff’s head of product was employee No. 15 at Credit Karma and served as its director of product management. He also was a senior product manager at E-Trade. Patrick Glover, head of marketing, worked at both Plaid and Square and Vinni Bala, head of operations, is former CMO and Chief Credit Officer at Deserve.</span></p>
<p>Other companies with similar goals that have raised venture funding as of late include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/">Tomo Credit</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/softbank-bets-big-on-a-digital-ellis-island/">Welcome Tech</a>, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://joinfightcamp.com">FightCamp</a>, an interactive at-home training system for boxing/kickboxing, is announcing this morning that it has raised a $90M round from a long list of investors, including quite the roster of famous fighters.</p>
<p>FightCamp pairs smart sensors (&#8220;punch trackers&#8221; worn under your boxing gloves) with a subscription-based stream of training videos. As you punch your way through a session, it&#8217;ll track things like punch count and speed over time. To oversimplify it a bit, think Peloton for punching.</p>
<p>The company tells me that this round was led by NEA and Connect Ventures — the latter a two-headed beast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/new-enterprise-associates-goes-to-hollywood-and-launches-a-venture-firm-with-caa/">made up of NEA and the Hollywood talent firm Creative Artists Agency</a>. Also investing: Supercell CEO Iikka Paananen, ClassPass CEO Fritz Lanman, Usher, and Katheryn Winnick (star of the TV series Vikings, not to mention a ridiculously accomplished martial artist.) Oh, and of course, a bunch of folks who are very well known for punching: Mike Tyson, Floyd Mayweather, Georges St-Pierre, and UFC heavyweight champ (and thrower of the world&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma/news-watch-when-francis-ngannou-created-world-record-hardest-punch">hardest punch,</a> no joke) Francis Ngannou.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While FightCamp is currently iOS only, that&#8217;ll hopefully change before too long; in a press release about the round, the company says it plans to put the funds toward international expansion, growing its subscription content library, and building an Android offering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171983" style="width: 362px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171983" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2171983" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fightcamp-app.png?w=352" alt="" width="352" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fightcamp-app.png 744w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fightcamp-app.png?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fightcamp-app.png?resize=155,300 155w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fightcamp-app.png?resize=352,680 352w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fightcamp-app.png?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171983" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FightCamp</p></div></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s kit costs anywhere from $439 &#8211; $1349, depending on what you need. $1219 gets you a free-standing punching bag, a mat to go beneath it, boxing gloves, and the punch trackers. Already have the rest of the gym gear, and just want the trackers? That drops the price down to $439. The monthly membership, meanwhile, costs $39.</p>
<p>FightCamp started its life in 2016 as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/18/heres-the-19th-batch-of-500-startups-companies/">&#8220;Hykso&#8221;</a>, focusing initially on the sale of the punch tracking hardware. As the company shifted focus to include subscription content in 2018, the &#8220;FightCamp&#8221; name took over; now it seems to be used almost exclusively.</p>
<p>The company tells me that they&#8217;d raised $8M before this round, bringing its total funding to $98M.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bgL5pMDktxA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Virgin Orbit is set to launch a payload that includes satellites it&#8217;s delivering for tis first commercial customers. The launch is set to happen sometime within a launch window that opens at 6 AM PT (9 AM ET) and continues through 8 AM PT (11 AM ET), taking off from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California.</p>
<p>This is the first mission following Virgin Orbit&#8217;s successful orbital demonstration launch in January, and also the first that the company will be live-streaming, providing never-before-seen views of its carrier aircraft and the mid-air launch of its LauncherOne two-stage rocket as they happen. Virgin Orbit&#8217;s launch system uses a modified 747 to carry its small rocket to a high altitude, where it releases the rocket from the aircraft&#8217;s wing, which then ignites its own engines and flies the rest of the way to its destination in low-Earth orbit (LEO).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Virgin&#8217;s approach is very different from the traditional vertical rocket launch employed by companies like SpaceX and Rocket Lab, and after years of testing and development, the company opened the door for commercial operations with its demonstration launch earlier this year. As it ramps operations, it&#8217;s hoping that its launch model will demonstrate flexibility, since it can launch from almost any traditional runway, while meeting all the needs of small satellite companies looking to get their spacecraft to LEO.</p>
<p>The launch livestream above is set to begin at around 5:30 AM PT (8:30 AM ET).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Istanbul in Turkey continues to prove itself as very fertile ground for casual gaming startups, which appear to be growing from small seedlings into sizable trees. In the latest development, <a href="https://dreamgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream Games</a> &#8212; a developer of mobile puzzle games &#8212; has raised $155 million in funding, a Series B that values the startup at $1 billion.</p>
<p>This is a massive leap for the company, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/istanbuls-dream-games-snaps-up-50m-and-launches-its-first-game-the-puzzle-based-royal-match/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $50 million</a> (the largest Series A in Turkey&#8217;s startup history) only 3.5 months ago. This latest round is being co-led by Index Ventures and Makers Fund, with Balderton Capital, IVP and Kora also participating. It also comes in the wake of a bigger set of deals in the world of gaming and developers in Turkey, the most prominent of which saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zynga acquire Peak Games for $1.8 billion</a>, amid other acquisitions. Dream is one of several startups in the region founded by alums from Peak.</p>
<p>The focus of the funding, and currently of Dream Games itself, is Royal Match, a puzzle game (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/royal-match/id1482155847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dreamgames.royalmatch&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>) that launched globally in March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The game has been a huge hit for Dream, with 6 million monthly active users and $20 million/month in revenues from in-game purchases (not ads), according to figures from AppAnnie. (A source close to the company confirmed the figures are accurate, but Dream did not disclose its revenue numbers or revenues directly.) This has catapulted it into the top-20 grossing games categories in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, the same echelon as much older and bigger titles like Candy Crush and Homescapes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funding will be used for heavy user acquisition in every channel and every geography,&#8221; Soner Aydemir, co-founder and CEO, Dream Games, told me in an interview. He said Asia would be a focus in that, specifically Japan, South Korea and China. &#8220;Our main target is to scale the game so that it becomes one of the biggest games in the global market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The world of mobile gaming has in many respects been a very cyclical and fickle one: today&#8217;s hot title becomes tomorrow&#8217;s has-been, while for developers, they can go through dozens of development processes and launches (and related costs) before they find a hit, if they find a hit. The role of app-install ads and other marketing tools to juice numbers has also been a problematic lever for growth: take away the costs of running those and often the house of cards falls apart.</p>
<p>Aydemir agrees, and while the company <em>will</em> be investing in those aforementioned in-game ads to encourage more downloads of Royal Match, he also said that this strategy can work, but only if the fundamentals of the game are solid, as is the case here.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don’t have good enough metrics, even with all the money in the world it’s impossible to scale,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But our LTV [lifetime value] is high, and so we think it can be scaled in a sustainable way because of the quality of the game. It always depends on the product.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to its huge growth, Dream has taken a very focused approach with Royal Match, working on it for years before finally releasing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spent so much time on tiny details, so many tests over several years to create the dynamics of the game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we also have a feel for it,&#8221; he added, referring to the team&#8217;s previous lives at Peak Games. &#8220;Our users really appreciate this approach.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For now, too, the focus will just one the one game, he said. Why not two, I asked?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We believe in Pixar’s approach,&#8221; Aydemir said. &#8220;When Pixar started, it was very low frequency, a movie every 2-3 years but eventually the rate increased. And it will be similar for us. This year we need to focus on Royal Match but if we can find a way to create other games, we will.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He added that the challenge &#8212; one that many startups know all too well &#8212; is that building a new product, in this case a new game, can take the focus away when you are a small team and also working on sustaining and maintaining a current game. &#8220;That is the most difficult and challenging part. If we can manage it we will be successful; otherwise we will fail because our business model is basically creating new IP.&#8221; He added that it&#8217;s likely that another game will be released out into the world at the beginning of next year.</span></p>
<p>The focus, in any case, was one of the selling points for its investors. “The Dream Games team’s deep genre insight, laser-focus on detail and team chemistry has helped create the early success of Royal Match,” said Michael Cheung, General Partner at Makers Fund, in a statement. “We&#8217;re excited to be on the journey with them as they grow Royal Match globally.”</p>
<p>In terms of monetization, Dream Games is pretty firmly in the camp of &#8220;no ads, just in-app purchases,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s really bad for user experience and we only care about user experience, so if you put ads in, it conflicts with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the struggles of building new while improving old product will of course get solved with this cash, and the subsequent hiring that Dream Games can do (and it&#8217;s doing a lot of that, judging by the careers section of its website). As more startups emerge out of the country &#8212; not just in gaming but also areas like e-commerce, where startups like Getir are for example making big waves in instant grocery delivery &#8212; it will be interesting to see how that bigger talent pool evolves.</p>
<p>“Since its launch in early March, Royal Match has become one of the top casual puzzle titles globally, driven by once in a decade retention metrics. It speaks to the sheer quality of the title that the Dream Games team has built and the flawless polish and execution across the board,” commented Stephane Kurgan, venture partner at Index Ventures and former COO of King. Index is also the backer of Roblox, Discord, King and Supercell, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise API security startup Noname Security has raised a $60 million Series B funding round, just six months after closing $25 million at Series A.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The round was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/insight-partners/">Insight Partners</a> with Next47, Forgepoint, and The Syndicate Group (TSG) also participating, and brings Noname’s total funding to $85 million since emerging from stealth in December 2020.</p>
<p>The startup, which currently has a 70-strong workforce and offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv, says it raised rapidly due to the fact the pandemic has fueled a growing dependence on APIs. Naturally, this proliferation of APIs has led to an increase in the number of API security incidents. Earlier this year, for example, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/experian/">Experian</a> API exposed the credit scores of nearly every American with one, and just weeks later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">a leaky Peloton API allowed anyone to grab users’ private account data</a> directly from the company&#8217;s servers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/facebook-phone-numbers-exposed/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/supreme-court-revives-linkedin-bid-to-protect-user-data-from-web-scrapers/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/echelon-leaky-api-riders-account-data/">Echelon</a>, and Clubhouse have also fallen victim to scraping attacks that abuse access to APIs to pull in data about users on their platforms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The need for API security was so strong and got super emphasized during the pandemic,&#8221; <span class="Apple-converted-space">Oz Golan, CEO of Noname, tells TechCrunch. &#8220;</span>We want to help organizations to leverage APIs securely, and we want to eliminate all of the API vulnerabilities out there. We don’t want another Experian incident.”</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley startup provides a holistic security platform that uses AI and machine learning to enable enterprises to see and secure managed and unmanaged APIs exposed by the organization, consumed by the organization, or used internally, thereby eliminating the API security blind spots. The majority of these flaws often go unnoticed for years, according to Noname, giving anyone who can find them unfettered access to an organization’s most sensitive operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even seasoned security professionals often have no idea how exposed their systems are,&#8221; Golan says.</p>
<p>In its six months since launch, the startup has amassed 40 technology, reseller, and channel partners, as well as &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of enterprise customers either in production or trialing the platform.</p>
<p>“Because of the huge traction that we have seen, we want to accelerate &#8211; expanding our sales team, marketing team, customer success, R&amp;D. Basically growth, growth, growth,” says Golan, who previously served as director of engineering at NSO Group.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Commenting on the funding round, Thomas Krane, principal at Insight Partners — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/13/cyber-security-training-platform-immersive-labs-closes-75m-series-c-led-by-insight-partners/">which recently led a $75m Series C funding round</a> in cybersecurity skills platform Immersive Labs — said: “The surging volume of APIs and the growing complexity of modern applications has led to an increase in cybersecurity obstacles. Noname came to market at just the right time with a fully realized, next-gen technology that’s making a big impact with global customers.”</p>
<p>API security is a hot ticket for investors right now. Last month, London-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/42crunch">42Crunch</a> raised a $17 million Series A, and just weeks later California-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/saltsecurity">Salt Security</a> closed a $70 million Series C — bringing the total amount of funding the company has raised in the last year to $120 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce marketplaces continue to play a major role in how consumers buy goods online and how retailers show off and sell goods to those consumers, accounting globally for <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/871/online-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47% of all e-commerce sales</a>. But today, one of the startups that has built technology to help retailers build and run more direct relationships &#8212; by way of zippy websites of their own &#8212; is announcing a big round of growth funding, a sign that the marketplace model is not for everyone, and that those catering to those retailers are finding traction.</p>
<p><a href="https://getshogun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shogun</a> &#8212; a platform to help e-commerce businesses of all sizes built on platforms like Shopify, Magento and BigCommerce easily design and run their own responsive storefronts &#8212; has raised $67.5 million. This Series C values Shogun at $575 million, a &#8220;nice markup&#8221; on its previous valuation, said Finbarr Taylor, the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, in an interview.</p>
<p>He added that the capital will be used both to continue building out its two main products &#8212; <a href="https://getshogun.com/page-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page Builder</a>, a drag-and-drop page builder for Shopify merchants; and <a href="https://getshogun.com/frontend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shogun Frontend</a>, an end-to-end headless commerce solution &#8212; as well as business development, and to build out new tech, specifically in areas like first-party data and personalization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to help companies build a destination where they can control the experience,&#8221; he said, comparing it to the physical world and the difference between Nike shoes sold at the brand&#8217;s own store versus at a big retailer like Walmart. &#8220;In a Nike store you can design an experience. In Walmart you cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Led by Insight Partners &#8212; a new investor in the startup &#8212; it also included Initialized Capital, Accel and VMG Partners. Accel led Shogun&#8217;s previous round &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$35 million Series B</a> &#8212; announced less than a year ago, in October 2020. The startup has now raised $114.5 million.</p>
<p>The hike in valuation, and the rapid succession of its fundraises, are two signs of how Shogun has been doing in the last eight months &#8212; a time when e-commerce has continued to perform strongly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Another is the company&#8217;s actual growth based on the idea of making front-end tools that used to be cost-prohibitive into something affordable for even the smallest merchant.</p>
<p>One of the selling points for Shogun up to now has been that pages and sites built on its platform run fast: a very key detail in the world of e-commerce where shopping cart abandonment is rife and often hinges on how long people have to wait for something to load.</p>
<p>Page Builder &#8212; the mass-market, drag-and-drop site builder for those creating sites on top of Shopify &#8212; is now used by around 20,000 business, Taylor said, ranging from small startups through to Fortune 500 companies, with customers including brands like K-Swiss, Leesa, Rumpl, BeardBrand, MVMT and Fila. He said that merchants collectively are seeing GMV (gross merchandise value, or total amount sold) in the &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221; through their sites.</p>
<p>(For a point of reference, Shogun told me it had 15,000 customers back in October; growing 5,000 in the last eight months is the same amount of growth as last year.)</p>
<p>Shogun&#8217;s newer product, Frontend, designed for mid-market to enterprise customers and positioned as a &#8220;headless&#8221; solution aimed more at web designers and others building more customized experiences, now has hundreds of customers and grew . &#8220;Apple&#8217;s site is beautiful, but it cost millions to make,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;We want anyone to be able to build those exceptional e-commerce experiences.&#8221; Frontend has grown 10x in the last year, Taylor said.</p>
<p>GMV across all of Shogun&#8217;s business grew by 255% in the last two years.</p>
<p>The rise of services like Shogun&#8217;s underscores a swing we have seen among e-commerce companies that are looking for a more autonomy and control in how they engage with customers. Sites like Amazon have long been seen as a way to tap into a large population of shoppers, as well as solid fulfillment and shipping infrastructure to store, package, distribute and deliver products.</p>
<p>There has even been a sharp rise in &#8220;roll-up&#8221; plays like Thrasio to help consolidate merchants on these platforms to leverage even better economies of scale on details like marketing, customer analytics and manufacturing, which marketplaces like Amazon do not (yet?) handle.</p>
<p>But none of that still replaces the ability to set your own destiny.</p>
<p>Now, the rise of services like Shopify, BigCommerce and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spryker</a> (also backed by Insight Partners) to help manage the backend; Stripe, PayPal and others to manage payments; and others like ShipBob to manage the logistics, have made it increasingly less difficult to build and run your own online experience. That takes on a stronger priority as your business grows, but even for smaller merchants, the idea of controlling your own customer experience is a compelling one.</p>
<p>Services like Shogun (and others like fit into that latter trend, such as Squarespace or Wix but also others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/duda-a-wordpress-rival-raises-50m-to-help-agencies-and-bigger-companies-build-better-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duda</a>), which give merchants the tools to build their own e-commerce experiences as they would like them to look, are the front ends for that strategy. Opting to take the &#8220;headless&#8221; commerce approach, apparently, is an <a href="https://www.yottaa.com/resources/2020-ecommerce-leaders-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing trend</a>.</p>
<p>And that individualism is also where Shogun plans to double down and build more tools for its users, Taylor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about direct relationships with customers,&#8221; he said, pointing out that newer changes in privacy regulation and cookies going away mean retailers can no longer rely on third-party platforms as they used to. &#8220;It&#8217;s about<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> first party relationships. The future is way more personalized shopping online.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That vision is also what interested investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our investment in Shogun underscores the market’s desire to see headless commerce become merchant-focused,&#8221; said Matt Gatto, managing director at Insight Ventures, in a statement. “More brands want to be able to build headless progressive web apps in a low-code environment. Those on the forefront of e-commerce want to enable web teams to build truly unique, memorable shopping experiences. Shogun is well positioned to make flexible frontends accessible to brands in a whole new way, and we’re excited to be a partner in this journey.”</p>
