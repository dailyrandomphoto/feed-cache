										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.didomi.io/">Didomi</a> has <a href="https://blog.didomi.io/en/didomi-series-b">raised</a> a $40 million Series B funding round led by Elephant and Breega. The company manages consent flows for web publishers and app developers. Didomi is already doing well in Europe with billions of consent interactions per month — it plans to expand to the U.S. with today’s funding round.</p>
<p>“Jawad, Raphaël and I have co-founded Didomi to make privacy easier for everyone and an obvious choice for companies. This fundraising is a major milestone on our journey to deliver on this mission,” co-founder and CEO Romain Gauthier said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We look forward to helping brands and publishers make customer journeys more transparent and trustworthy through a delightful consent and preferences management experience,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In recent years, many regulators have implemented new privacy-focused frameworks. You might think about GDPR in Europe for instance.</p>
<p>And if you live in a country that is affected by those changes, you are now well aware that you’ll get a consent popup or banner whenever you visit a new website or open an app for the first time.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say that these popups are “delightful” as the best consent popup is the one that doesn’t exist because the site you’re visiting doesn’t collect and share personal data. But that’s not always possible and there are different reasons why you may need to collect data — including on this current site techcrunch dot com.</p>
<p>In that case, a product like Didomi can be really helpful. Taking those consent flows seriously is extremely important as you don’t want to mess up the implementation and get fined. Didomi is a developer-focused consent platform that works across many different devices. You can configure your consent flow for a desktop website, a mobile website, a mobile app or a connected TV.</p>
<p>Having a unified solution also means that you don’t have to ask for permission over and over again. Didomi can store and synchronize preferences across devices. Everything is auditable in case regulators want to see how you’re collecting consent.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to make its product even more developer friendly with open APIs and open-source SDKs. It doesn’t mean that Didomi is for everyone as the company focuses on premium clients in particular. Clients include Rakuten, Orange, Giphy and Weight Watchers International.</p>
<p>The company will also hire more people with local marketing and sales teams for different markets. Didomi plans to open offices in Germany, Spain and the U.S.</p>
<p>At the same time, the landscape is quickly evolving. Web browsers are gradually blocking third-party trackers and Apple now even asks you if an app can track you at the operating system level. It’s going to be interesting to see how Didomi evolves with user expectations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">Ransomware</a> attacks, fueled by COVID-19 pandemic turbulence, have become a major money earner for cybercriminals, with the number of attacks rising in 2020.</p>
<p>These file-encrypting attacks have continued largely unabated this year, too. In the last few months alone we’ve witnessed the attack on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a> that forced the company to shut down its systems — and the gasoline supply — to much of the eastern seaboard, the hack on meat supplier JBS that abruptly halted its slaughterhouse operations around the world, and just this month a supply chain attack on IT vendor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">Kaseya that saw hundreds of downstream victims locked out</a> of their systems.</p>
<p>However, while ransomware attacks continue to make headlines, it’s near-impossible to understand their full impact, nor is it known whether taking certain decisions — such as paying the cybercriminals’ ransom demands — make a difference.</p>
<p>Jack Cable, a security architect at Krebs Stamos Group who previously worked for the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), is looking to solve that problem with the launch of a crowdsourced ransom payments tracking website, <a href="https://ransomwhe.re">Ransomwhere</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I was inspired to start Ransomwhere by Katie Nickels&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/likethecoins/status/1402248769123631104?s=20">tweet</a> that no one really knows the full impact of cybercrime, and especially ransomware,” Cable told TechCrunch. “After seeing that there&#8217;s currently no single place for public data on ransomware payments, and given that it&#8217;s not hard to track bitcoin transactions, I started hacking it together.”</p>
<p>The website keeps a running tally of ransoms paid out to cybercriminals in bitcoin, made possible thanks to the public record-keeping of transactions on the blockchain. As the site is crowdsourced, it incorporates data from self-reported incidents of ransomware attacks, which anyone can submit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> However, i</span>n order to make sure all reports are legitimate, each submission is required to take a screenshot of the ransomware payment demand, and every case is reviewed manually by Cable himself before being made publicly available. If an approved report’s authenticity is later called into question, it will be removed from the database.</p>
<p>The already-burgeoning database, which doesn’t include any personal or victim-identifying information, is available as a free download for the cybersecurity community and law enforcement officials, which Cable hopes will help give some much-needed public transparency about the current state of the problem.</p>
<p>“As we consider policy proposals to change the state of ransomware economics, we will need data to assess whether these actions are successful,&#8221; Cable said. “For law enforcement, as we saw with the Colonial Pipeline hack, law enforcement does have the ability to recover some payments, so it would be great if this can further aid their efforts.”</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the site is tracking a total of more than $32 million in ransom payments for 2021. The bulk of these payments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">have been made to the REvil</a>, the Russia-linked ransomware gang that took credit for the JBS and Kaseya hacks. The group has racked up more than $11 million in ransom payments this year, according to Ransomwhere, an amount that could increase dramatically if its recent demands for $70 million as part of the Kaseya attack are met.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Netwalker, one of the most popular ransomware-as-a-service offerings on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dark-web/">dark web</a>, comes in second with more than $6.3 million in payments for 2021, though Ransomwhere’s tally shows that the group has racked up the most ransom payments in total, with roughly $28 million to its name based on the site’s data.</p>
<p>RangarLocker, DarkSide, and Egregor round out Ransomwhere’s top five list — for now at least — having amassed sums of $4.6 million, $4.4 million, and $3.2 million, respectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Cable says that going forward, he’s exploring ways of partnering with companies in the security and blockchain analysis spaces in order to integrate data that they already have on ransomware actions. He’s also looking at ways to support other traceable cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, as well as at the potential to track downstream bitcoin addresses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It&#8217;ll never be possible to get the full picture — criminals who are using Monero will be near-impossible to track”, Cable says. &#8220;But I would like to get as complete of a picture as possible.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The venture capital market is racing ahead, foot on the gas, middle finger out the window, hair on fire. That’s our read of the Q2 2021 data released thus far concerning how much money venture capitalists deployed around the world during the second three months of the year.</p>
<p>Startups have never had it this good when it comes to accessing private-market funds.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The second quarter of 2021 was the biggest quarter for venture capital activity ever, measured by dollars invested. The wave of funding led to a quarterly record of new unicorns &#8212; startups that reach the $1 billion valuation threshold &#8212; born in the United States, Asia, Europe and Canada, according <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021">to CB Insights data</a> reviewed by The Exchange.</p>
<p>Data <a href="https://insight.factset.com/venture-capital-activity-skyrockets-in-the-first-half-of-2021">from FactSet</a> concerning the quarter agrees. The second quarter was a record-breaker in terms of dollars invested, even if total deal volume eased some from the first quarter’s tally.</p>
<p>The impact of the deluge of capital is what you’d expect: Round values are rising. Deals worth $100 million are setting records. Around the world, technology hubs are enjoying a flurry of high-priced deals that are enriching startups and providing them with capital at earlier stages that used to be reserved for IPOs and other seminal funding events.</p>

Next week, we’ll publish a host of geography-focused notes and reactions from investors and founders in the U.S. startup ecosystem, along with similar entries concerning the Asian and European startup markets.</p>
<p>Chatting with venture capitalists in recent months led us to expect strong second-quarter results; investors have spoken about ever-faster follow-on rounds and the explosion of high-priced, big-dollar deal-making from Tiger. SoftBank’s second vision fund is active. And there are myriad seed, early-stage, late-stage and crossover funds all competing with each other both inside and outside their normal investing stage bands in hopes of either accreting earlier, larger ownership than a bigger investing group might have in years past or working to defend early ownership past where earlier-stage firms used to exit stage left.</p>
<p>But enough words. Let’s get into the numbers. We’ll start with an overview of global results before diving into U.S. and Silicon Valley tallies, Europe and Asia&#8217;s performances, and new data concerning venture capital activity in Africa.</p>
<p>Buckle up.</p>
<h2>A monster quarter</h2>
<p>We’re pulling from a number of sources this morning, but for global data, we’re leaning on CB Insights, Crunchbase News and FactSet.</p>
<p>CB Insights has $156 billion on the books for global venture capital activity in the second quarter, up from $60.7 billion in Q2 2020. That’s a gain of 157% on a year-over-year basis. A FactSet chart indicates around $150 billion was raised in the second quarter, up a similar percentage from its year-ago result as what CB Insights counted.</p>
<p>For the first half of 2021, inclusive of the record second-quarter tally, the data is similarly shocking. Crunchbase News <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-h1-2021-monthly-recap/">counts $288 billion invested</a> during the first and second quarters of the year. CB Insights reckons the number of $292.4 billion. FactSet comes to a number that it describes as “over $280 billion.”</p>
<p>Those are all close enough for us, and they say the same thing: Global startups raised either as much, or very nearly as much, in the first two quarters of 2021 as they did in all of 2020.</p>
<p>As a reference point, Crunchbase News notes that the first half of 2021 crushed the second half of 2020 by $110 billion, in terms of global capital raised.</p>
<p>But what about round counts? Was all that capital concentrated in a few investments, or did the money flow freely to more startups than ever? Here, things get a little tricky. CB Insights data states that there were 7,751 startup deals in the second quarter, an all-time high. FactSet counts 5,400, far from its recorded record. At this juncture we’re seeing discrepancies in how different data-focused firms count; Alex was party to similar conversations during his time at Crunchbase and is sympathetic to the difficulty of deciding what to include and not in these types of surveys.</p>
<p>But even FactSet data indicates that the second quarter was the second-best three-month period for venture round counts since the start of 2019. No matter how you count, then, the data indicates lots of deals &#8212; and even more dollars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flashapp.com.br/">Flash</a>, a startup that has developed a flexible benefits platform for Brazilian companies and employees, has raised $22 million in a Series B round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>Monashees (which led Flash’s Series A), Global Founders Capital (who backed Flash’s seed round), Citius and Kauffman Fellows also participated in the financing.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by childhood friends Ricardo Salem, Guilherme Lane and Pedro Lane, Flash is out to revamp what it views as an antiquated way of offering benefits to employees in South America’s largest country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The São Paulo-based company has built a flexible benefit management app provided with a Mastercard in an effort to replace what has historically been provided in the form of “outdated, commoditized and mandatory” meal/food and transportation “vouchers.”</p>
<p>“Our first product was a reinvention of the voucher that by Brazilian labor law, was something of a mandatory benefit for all companies to give as part of compensation,” Salem said. “There are four traditional incumbents, owned by the banks, that held 95% of the market with very outdated products and fat margins, and exploitation all over.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, Flash took its offering a step further by giving companies a way to configure their benefits offering so employees can “choose and manage their benefits as they want” via Flash’s app marketplace and card, noted Salem.</p>
<p>The company must be doing something right.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Flash has grown its customer base to 4,000 companies, ranging from startups and SMEs to enterprises.</p>
<p>Last year, Flash grew “10x” by all metrics. It went from 10,000 employees to 100,000 using its platform. So far, this year that number has already swelled to 250,000. While the company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, Lane said the growth in customers is reflected in the company’s GMV. Flash has also grown from about 50 to 200 employees over the past 8 months.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the pandemic when companies were sending employees home and wanting to help them pay bills for electricity and utilities, there wasn’t any instrument to help them do so, Salem said.</p>
<p>“So we built one in our app, which leverages our wallet and it was able to read the bar or QR code of the utility provider,” he added. “It became a very popular benefit.”</p>
<p>Within that same wallet, Flash has built another product &#8212; an incentive and rewards platform..</p>
<p>Even with all its early success, Flash has just a 1% market share so believes “there’s plenty of room to grow.” And, it views itself as “much more of a horizontal play than a geographical play.”</p>
<p>“We’re solving other pain points for companies in Brazil now, and that’s our plan for the short term,” Lane said.</p>
<p>“In the beginning, we saw this as a very cool thing very modern tech companies wanted,” Salem said. “But last year proved that this is not just a midsize tech company product. This is for every employee from tech employees to blue collar workers to CEOs. Everyone has a flexible benefit need and different lifestyles and need a product adapted to all of those.”</p>
<p>Global Founders Capital’s Fabricio Pettena led Flash’s seed round back in 2019. He said he had been searching for disruption in the space for “a long time.”</p>
<p>“Since it is a big market in Brazil due to regulation, the incumbents really rip off restaurants and others,” Pettena told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He said he knew immediately he wanted to invest in Flash.</p>
<p>“Flash’s team actually took an active role in the regulation change that allowed for flexible benefits, instead of just playing passive,” he said. “When we first met, within 15 minutes, it was clear that, apart from a couple of details, we already shared a common vision for how this disruption would take place.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.frontier-jobs.com/">Frontier</a>, which bills itself as a “new kind of vertically integrated jobs marketplace” launches today with a $2.8 million investment round led by NFX in the U.S., and backed by London’s firstminute Capital, FJ Labs, Cyan Banister, Ilkka Pannanen, Alex Bouaziz, Liquid 2 and several other funds and angels.</p>
<p>Frontier’s schtick is that it pre-tests applicants, weeds out the best candidates, and then allows them to directly book interviews with the employers, thus saving time and money in the hiring process.</p>
<p>But Frontier isn’t going after complex roles here. It&#8217;s aimed at companies who need a high volume of low-skilled workers. Among its customers so far are Carrol’s (the largest franchisor of Burger King) and Concentrix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Elliot O’Connor, founder and CEO of Frontier said: “We believe the hiring experience is a fragmented workflow for both employer and jobseeker, which dramatically slows down the time-to-fill for positions and leads to rigid labor markets — something the world can’t afford right now. To fix hiring, a platform must own more of the hiring funnel than job platforms currently do, and use that position to redefine the experience.”</p>
<p>Elliot told me over a call that they are not using an algorithm in the AI sense of the word. It also removes unconscious bias by applying skill-based assessments: “We&#8217;re focused on high-volume, low-skilled workers, so for example, customer support or retail or warehouses. So we’re just assessing for things like typing speed, etc. No one&#8217;s going to look at the resume. It&#8217;s a rule-based system so that the company does get to set the rules themselves. There&#8217;s no AI.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: “We&#8217;ve gone and eaten up a lot of the different pieces of software that are out there and combined them into a single vertically integrated whole. So we&#8217;ve got a screening software that&#8217;s basically modular so every customer gets their own screening, according to their own criteria and the machine does it for them. So at the interviews they&#8217;re going to have qualified candidates.”</p>
<p>Pete Flint, NFX general partner, said: “Frontier is changing the entire talent-sourcing process by providing an on-demand experience that’s already present in so many parts of life. Shortening the window of finding work and making hires is creating substantial benefits across large segments of the labor market. The network effects embedded in Frontier’s product and business model make it completely different to the traditional incumbents.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage robotics fundraising is accelerating, with funding coming from boutiques to deep-pocketed venture capital firms. For founders, getting their idea from concept to company, or developing a minimum viable product, is daunting enough, but seeking an initial fundraising round brings a complexity that can be especially challenging to manage.</p>
<p>So how do robotics startups best approach fundraising and secure the financing to propel their company to the next level? There are five key areas to keep in mind about fundraising for robotics startups that founders must learn and practice.</p>
<h2>Understand the proper fit between your company’s scale and the fund’s scale</h2>
<p>Too often, founders court venture capitalists without understanding that the company they are founding might not be the right fit for VCs. Venture capital firms generally, and ones that invest in robotics specifically, look to invest in startups that have clearly identified potential to scale exponentially.</p>
<p>They are not geared toward backing entrepreneurs looking for an exit under $100 million that will only realize a handful of multiples for the investor. VCs are more likely looking to fund on a much larger scale — think a $1-billion-plus exit valuation — and back a company with the potential to deliver at least a 10x return.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Venture capital firms generally, and ones that invest in robotics specifically, look to invest in startups that have clearly identified potential to scale exponentially.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Usually, robotics companies are capital-intensive and require a robust revenue model compared to pure software startups, and this is not for every VC. In fact, venture capital is likened to “rocket fuel” that is dangerous if put into a car but perfect for a rocket ready to shoot for escape velocity. Smaller-scale ventures often do not interest VCs but might be perfect for angel investors.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Do your homework, manage expectations, and seek funding from investors working at a scale commensurate with your idea and comfortable with the unique needs of robotics companies.</p>
<h2>Consider capital sources that fit different companies and startups at different stages of its growth</h2>
<p>Now is a great time for starting a company, in part because there have never been more sources of financing available. Angel investors and venture capitalists are just a portion of what is available.</p>
<p>There is growing opportunity, especially for robotics and AI startups, in nondilutive capital, including from U.S. government sources such as Department of Energy and Department of Defense grants. There are loaded/nondilutive funding streams, such as convertible debt, available from financial institutions and angels.</p>
<p>Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, especially for hardware and robotics companies, have become popular in recent years. Some of these might be a better fit for your company at the current (or future) stage of your organizational growth cycle.</p>
<p>But some sophistication is warranted. Ask yourself what constraints or potential downsides come with the specific funding model you are considering/pursuing. Government grants, for instance, might drive the pace of development or push you toward certain customer-facing directions in ways that could be ill-suited to your company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">And just like that, it’s day two of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>! Yesterday not only flew by in a blur — it was also certifiably off the hook. We hope you came away with new information, actionable advice that you can implement in your business right away and that you connected with your peers and other startup folks for support and opportunities along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Pssst:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy a ticket</a> and tune in to today’s main event (see below).</p>
<p>We also hope you got a good night’s sleep because today is all about the pitch-off! Ten early-stage founders — hand-picked by the TechCrunch crew — will throw down in classic pitch-battle fashion in front of these highly experienced and definitely discerning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/announcing-the-early-stage-pitch-off-judges-2/">VC judges</a>: Ben Sun of Primary Venture Partners, Leah Solivan of Fuel Capital and Index Ventures’ Shardul Shah.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each startup team has only five minutes to pitch their company, business model and creative ideas — followed by a Q&amp;A from our esteemed judges. When the pitch dust settles, one winner will get a feature article on TechCrunch.com, a one-year free subscription to Extra Crunch and a complimentary Founder Pass to TechCrunch Disrupt this fall.</p>
<p>Whether you’re at Disrupt, Early Stage or a TC Session event, if you have a chance to see other founders pitch or watch VCs conduct a pitch deck teardown — take it. It’ll help you refine your own pitch.</p>
<blockquote><p>I walked away with a bunch of notes to reorganize my pitch deck, and I’ve watched the pitch deck teardown videos multiple times, including side by side with my pitch deck. It&#8217;s a lot of work, but it’s very rewarding because now I have a clear path. Disrupt was like an authoritative instruction manual for how to finish my pitch deck. — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> were on deck this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> on the recording and edit. Natasha will be back with us starting next week. So, it was old times on the show with just two of our team to vamp on the news. And oh <em>boy</em> was there a lot of news to get into. Like, loads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s going on with Didi?</strong> Didi&#8217;s woes have continued this week, with the company seeing its share price continue to fall. The Equity team&#8217;s view is that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/will-didis-regulatory-problems-make-it-harder-for-chinese-startups-to-go-public-in-the-us/">the era of Chinese companies listing in the United States is over</a>.</li>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s going on with facial recognition tech? </strong>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/anyvision-the-controversial-facial-recognition-startup-has-raised-235m-led-by-softbank-and-eldridge/">AnyVision raising a $235 million round</a>, Danny and Alex tangled over the future of privacy, and what counts as good enough when it comes to keeping ourselves to ourselves.</li>
<li><strong>Nextdoor is going public:</strong> Via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nextdoors-spac-investor-deck-paints-a-picture-of-sizable-scale-and-sticky-users/">a SPAC, mind</a>, but the transaction had our tongues wagging about its history, growth, and how hard it can be to build a social network.</li>
<li><strong>Dataminr buys WatchKeeper:</strong> In its first-ever acquisition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/dataminr-watchkeeper-acquisition/">Dataminr bought a smaller company</a> to help it better visualize the data it collects. It&#8217;s a neat deal, and especially fun given that Dataminr should go public sooner rather than later.</li>
<li><strong>Planet and Satellogic are going public:</strong> One week, two satellite SPACs. You can read more about Planet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/satellite-operator-planet-to-go-public-in-2-8b-spac-merger/">here</a>, and Satellogic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>FabricNano and Cloverly raise capital:</strong> Satellites had us into the concept of climate change, so we also dug into recent funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/fabricnano-raises-12-5m-to-help-scale-its-cell-free-fossil-fuel-alternative-technology/">rounds from FabricNano</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/cloverly-snags-2-1m-seed-to-continue-developing-api-to-measure-and-offset-carbon-usage/">and Cloverly</a>. It&#8217;s beyond neat to see for-profit companies tackle our warming planet.</li>
<li><strong>Two new venture capital funds:</strong> Acrylic has put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/acrylic-debut-crypto-fund/">together a $55 million fund for moonshot crypto work</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/renegade-partners-rolls-out-its-much-anticipated-debut-fund-with-100-million/">Renegade Partners has a $100 million fund</a> for early-and-mid-stage generalist investments.</li>
<li><strong>Mmhmm is big time:</strong> And then there was mmhmm. Which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/">now has $100 million more</a>, and some big plans. Our question is what will it do with the money. We&#8217;ll have to wait and find out, we suppose.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robots have a hard time improvising, and encountering an unusual surface or obstacle usually means an abrupt stop or hard fall. But researchers have created a new model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real time to any terrain it encounters, changing its gait on the fly to keep trucking when it hits sand, rocks, stairs and other sudden changes.</p>
<p>Although robotic movement can be versatile and exact, and robots can &#8220;learn&#8221; to climb steps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/05/these-humanoid-robots-can-autonomously-navigate-these-cinder-block-mazes-thanks-to-ihmc/">cross broken terrain</a> and so on, these behaviors are more like individual trained skills that the robot switches between. Although robots like Spot famously can spring back from being pushed or kicked, the system is really just working to correct a physical anomaly while pursuing an unchanged policy of walking. There are some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/09/this-robo-bug-can-improvise-its-walk-like-a-real-insect/">adaptive movement models</a>, but some are very specific (for instance this one based on real insect movements) and others take long enough to work that the robot will certainly have fallen by the time they take effect.</p>
<p>The team, from Facebook AI, UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University, call it Rapid Motor Adaptation. It came from the fact that humans and other animals are able to quickly, effectively and unconsciously change the way they walk to fit different circumstances.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Say you learn to walk and for the first time you go to the beach. Your foot sinks in, and to pull it out you have to apply more force. It feels weird, but in a few steps you&#8217;ll be walking naturally just as you do on hard ground. What&#8217;s the secret there?&#8221; asked senior researcher Jitendra Malik, who is affiliated with Facebook AI and UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Certainly if you&#8217;ve never encountered a beach before, but even later in life when you have, you aren&#8217;t entering some special &#8220;sand mode&#8221; that lets you walk on soft surfaces. The way you change your movement happens automatically and without any real understanding of the external environment.</p>

Of course the robot would not perceive any of this visually. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMU</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happening is your body responds to the differing physical conditions by sensing the differing consequences of those conditions on the body itself,&#8221; Malik explained — and the RMA system works in similar fashion. &#8220;When we walk in new conditions, in a very short time, half a second or less, we have made enough measurements that we are estimating what these conditions are, and we modify the walking policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The system was trained entirely in simulation, in a virtual version of the real world where the robot&#8217;s small brain (everything runs locally on the on-board limited compute unit) learned to maximize forward motion with minimum energy and avoid falling by immediately observing and responding to data coming in from its (virtual) joints, accelerometers and other physical sensors.</p>
<p>To punctuate the total internality of the RMA approach, Malik notes that the robot uses no visual input whatsoever. But people and animals with no vision can walk just fine, so why shouldn&#8217;t a robot? But since it&#8217;s impossible to estimate the &#8220;externalities&#8221; such as the exact friction coefficient of the sand or rocks it&#8217;s walking on, it simply keeps a close eye on itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not learn about sand, we learn about feet sinking,&#8221; said co-author Ashish Kumar, also from Berkeley.</p>
<p>Ultimately the system ends up having two parts: a main, always-running algorithm actually controlling the robot&#8217;s gait, and an adaptive algorithm running in parallel that monitors changes to the robot&#8217;s internal readings. When significant changes are detected, it analyzes them — the legs should be doing <em>this</em>, but they&#8217;re doing <em>this</em>, which means the situation is like <em>this</em> — and tells the main model how to adjust itself. From then on the robot only thinks in terms of how to move forward under these new conditions, effectively improvising a specialized gait.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175344" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RMA-examples.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175344" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175344 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RMA-examples.gif" alt="Footage of the robot not falling as it traverses various tough surfaces." width="800" height="346" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2175344" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMU</p></div></p>
<p>After training in simulation, it succeeded handsomely in the real world, as the news release describes it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The robot was able to walk on sand, mud, hiking trails, tall grass and a dirt pile without a single failure in all our trials. The robot successfully walked down stairs along a hiking trail in 70% of the trials. It successfully navigated a cement pile and a pile of pebbles in 80% of the trials despite never seeing the unstable or sinking ground, obstructive vegetation or stairs during training. It also maintained its height with a high success rate when moving with a 12 kg payload that amounted to 100% of its body weight.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ashish-kmr.github.io/rma-legged-robots/">You can see examples of many of these situations in videos here</a> or (very briefly) in the gif above.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Disney Imagineering’s Project Kiwi is a free-walking robot that will make you believe in Groot&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/embed/#?secret=hTI9S3TxAB" data-secret="hTI9S3TxAB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Malik gave a nod to the research of <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/karen-adolph.html">NYU professor Karen Adolph</a>, whose work has shown how adaptable and free-form the human process of learning how to walk is. The team&#8217;s instinct was that if you want a robot that can handle any situation, it has to learn adaptation from scratch, not have a variety of modes to choose from.</p>
<p>Just as you can&#8217;t build a smarter computer-vision system by exhaustively labeling and documenting every object and interaction (there will always be more), you can&#8217;t prepare a robot for a diverse and complex physical world with 10, 100, even thousands of special parameters for walking on gravel, mud, rubble, wet wood, etc. For that matter you may not even want to specify anything at all beyond the general idea of forward motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t pre-program the idea that it has for legs, or anything about the morphology of the robot,&#8221; said Kumar.</p>
<p>This means the basis of the system — not the fully trained one, which ultimately did mold itself to quadrupedal gaits — can potentially be applied not just to other legged robots, but entirely different domains of AI and robotics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legs of a robot are similar to the fingers of a hand; the way that legs interact with environments, fingers interact with objects,&#8221; noted co-author Deepak Pathak, of Carnegie Mellon University. &#8220;The basic idea can be applied to any robot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even further, Malik suggested, the pairing of basic and adaptive algorithms could work for other intelligent systems. Smart homes and municipal systems tend to rely on preexisting policies, but what if they adapted on the fly instead?</p>
<p>For now the team is simply presenting their initial findings in a paper at the <a href="https://roboticsconference.org/">Robotics: Science and Systems</a> conference and acknowledge that there is a great deal of follow-up research to do. For instance building an internal library of the improvised gaits as a sort of &#8220;medium-term&#8221; memory, or using vision to predict the necessity of initiating a new style of locomotion. But the RMA approach seems to be a promising new approach for an enduring challenge in robotics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new biometrics privacy ordinance has taken effect across New York City, putting new limits on what businesses can do with the biometric data they collect on their customers.</p>
<p>From Friday, businesses that collect biometric information — most commonly in the form of facial recognition and fingerprints — are required to conspicuously post notices and signs to customers at their doors explaining how their data will be collected. The ordinance applies to a wide range of businesses — retailers, stores, restaurants, and theaters, to name a few — which are also barred from selling, sharing, or otherwise profiting from the biometric information that they collect.</p>
<p>The move will give New Yorkers — and its millions of visitors each year — greater protections over how their biometric data is collected and used, while also serving to dissuade businesses from using technology that critics say is discriminatory and often doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Businesses can face stiff penalties for violating the law, but can escape fines if they fix the violation quickly.</p>
<p>The law is by no means perfect, as none of these laws ever are. For one, it doesn&#8217;t apply to government agencies, including the police. Of the businesses that the ordinance does cover, it exempts employees of those businesses, such as those required to clock in and out of work with a fingerprint. And the definition of what counts as a biometric will likely face challenges that could expand or narrow what is covered.</p>
<p>New York is the latest U.S. city to enact a biometric privacy law, after Portland, Oregon passed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/">a similar ordinance</a> last year. But the law falls short of stronger biometric privacy laws in effect.</p>
<p>Illinois, which has the Biometric Information Privacy Act, a law that grants residents the right to sue for any use of their biometric data without consent. Facebook this year settled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/facebook-illinois-class-action-bipa/">for $650 million</a> in a class-action suit that Illinois residents filed in 2015 after the social networking giant used facial recognition to tag users in photos without their permission.</p>
<p>Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the New York-based Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said the law is an &#8220;important step&#8221; to learn how New Yorkers are tracked by local businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;A false facial recognition match could mean having the NYPD called on you just for walking into a Rite Aid or Target,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. He also said that New York should go further by outlawing systems like facial recognition altogether, as some cities have done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online grocery startups around the world continue to pull in major investment, underscoring how much they have all grown especially in the last year of pandemic living. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.kurly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurly</a> &#8212; a startup in South Korea that provides next-day grocery delivery services across the country &#8212; has closed $200 million in funding, a Series F valuing the company at $2.2 billion, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>This means the company&#8217;s valuation has more than doubled in the last year. Last April, Kurly closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/korean-grocery-startup-kurly-raises-150m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series E of $150 million</a> at a $780 million valuation.</p>
<p>This latest round is being co-led by Aspex Management, DST Global, Sequoia Capital China and Hillhouse Capital &#8212; all previous backers of the company &#8212; with new investors Millennium Management and CJ Logistics Corporation also participating. CJ Logistics is a strategic backer: it has a deal in place with Kurly to help expand its overnight delivery service to more regions across South Korea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest funding comes right on the heels of a significant u-turn for the business in recent days.</p>
<p>Kurly had been planning an IPO in the U.S. later this year; instead it announced this week that it would instead seek to list in its home market instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurly had explored both overseas and domestic IPO options. After reviewing detailed conditions such as its business model and stock market conditions both at home and abroad, Kurly has decided to go ahead with an initial public offering in the Korean stock market,&#8221; it said in a statement to <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107080007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korea Economic Daily</a>.</p>
<p>Some have reported that Chinese transport giant <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/didi-slumps-after-china-regulators-order-stores-to-remove-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Didi&#8217;s rocky start as a public company</a> on the NYSE this month gave Kurly pause on the performance of Asian companies on U.S. exchanges at the moment. Others have reported that the company was <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/special/2021/05/175_308284.html?fl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing issues with some existing private backers</a> wanting to cash out, concerned over the company&#8217;s growth potential &#8212; which might have hastened an IPO while also put more pressure on the company to produce better returns.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting too that Coupang, Kurly&#8217;s much bigger rival, is traded in the U.S. market, on the NYSE after going public earlier this year. Its market cap is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CPNG?p=CPNG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently just under $70 billion</a> and so that might also invite unfavorable comparisons.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the shift, this latest round is an interesting signal to the market that investors are keen to continue supporting the company on the back of more market potential. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kurly said the funds will be used to build out its tech stack, talent recruitment, and to expand its coverage of its next-day services.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This funding round is a testament to Kurly’s contributions in transforming customer’s everyday habit of conducting grocery shopping at physical stores into a more convenient way of shopping online by offering a superior selection of products through its innovative delivery service,&#8221; said Seul-A Kim, also known as Sophie Kim, the CEO and founder of Kurly, in a statement. &#8220;The Company has also been successful in bringing merchandises to the customers at a reasonable price through service technology empowered by the use of its proprietary data analytics. We are delighted to have new capital which would allow us to further invest in logistics infrastructure, people and technology to continue to innovate mobile grocery market and improve lives of consumers, producers and workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has been growing at a strong pace, with $845 million in sales in 2020, up 124% over a year ago. It hasn&#8217;t disclosed whether it is profitable or what its operating margins are, but the theory is that &#8212; as with all e-commerce operations &#8212; as Kurly continues to scale its overnight delivery service, those margins will improve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to continue to support Market Kurly with our investment,&#8221; said Hermes Li, the founder and portfolio manager of Aspex Management, in a statement. &#8220;Korea is one of the fastest growing and largest e-commerce markets globally, and Kurly has been the leader in e-Commerce innovation. They have built a consumer centric brand focused on superior product quality and user experience. We believe there is significant potential ahead of Kurly from expansion into other consumer categories and new geographies. Aspex is looking forward to many years of growth with Kurly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online grocery delivery services have seen a massive surge of use and subsequent investor attention in the last year, fueled by people turning to e-commerce in the wake of social distancing to help contain the spread of Covid-19. That&#8217;s included a lot of funding for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/rohlik-raises-119m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-grow-its-2-hour-grocery-delivery-service-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large grocers</a> similar to Kurly, as well as smaller, &#8220;instant&#8221; essential grocery players targeting urban consumers, who have collectively raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> to scale their operations in what has quickly become a very crowded market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seed investment firm <a href="https://www.hummingbird.vc/">Hummingbird VC</a>, which previously invested in Deliveroo, Peak Games, MarkaVIP, and Kraken has a new Managing Partner. Firat Ileri, previously a Partner &#8211; who at 28 became one of Europe’s youngest VCs when he joined in 2012 &#8211; takes over from Founding Partner Barend Van den Brande, who will now take on a more strategic role at the firm.</p>
<p>Ileri grew up in Cyprus and went on to study electrical engineering, computer science, and operations research at MIT. At Hummingbird he has lead the firm&#8217;s first investments in Latin America and in South East Asia.</p>
<p>Ileri initially introduced the cofounders of Gram Games, led their first investment, and helped exit the company to Zynga for half a billion. He also led the sale process of Peak Games in 2020, which exited at $1.8Bn, making history as Turkey’s largest tech exit to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2010, Hummingbird is currently on its fourth fund of $200M, raised in Q4 2020, and says it invests from Europe to India, SEA, LATAM, Turkey and more recently in the US.<br />
 <br />
Firat most recently led Hummingbird’s first investments in engineering biology, investing in Billiontoone, the SF-based precision diagnostics company in the prenatal and liquid biopsy space, which has raised a $55M Series B round. It&#8217;s also invested in Kernal Biologics, an mRNA 2.0 therapeutics company focused on oncology.</p>
<p>Van den Brande said: “From the moment Firat joined us in the very early days of Hummingbird, he hit the ground running. His eye for unique and ambitious founding teams, and unparalleled expertise in Seed investing, persistence and really understanding what Early Stage companies need has made him an invaluable asset to Hummingbird and all of the founders we work with. I&#8217;m only pleased to have Firat take on the role and lead the Hummingbird family and portfolio for years to come.”</p>
<p>Ileri said the firm’s thesis was to invest in stand-out founders: “We&#8217;re spending much more time trying to understand who these people are and what makes them special. In a way, we&#8217;re looking for anomalies in people, and we believe that the best companies are created with nonlinear backgrounds. So, this is the thesis.”</p>
<p>He said the team has expanded to drive this vision: “We used to be a boutique fund, but we have the ambition to be more and especially to look for founders who have an independent mind and huge ambitions. To be able to find more companies we&#8217;ve gone more global, in order to have a better chance of finding these special stories.”</p>

		Uwe Horstmann is co-founder and partner of the Berlin-based venture capital firm <a href="https://www.project-a.com/">Project A Ventures</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The narrative suggests that Germany is lagging behind its European neighbors when it comes to <a href="https://www.kfw.de/KfW-Group/Newsroom/Latest-News/Pressemitteilungen-Details_608832.html">building a globally competitive venture capital market</a>. But I think that the next five years will be huge for the German venture capital sector, and that the signs for the future are very positive.</p>
<p>German startups raised €6.4 billion in 2020. That’s more than France, which came in at €5.7 billion. Another upside is that there is a healthy blend of local and international investment in the early-stage market. German funds dominate investments in German startups at the <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/investment-germany-austria-switzerland-2020/">seed and Series A stages</a>. As companies grow, overseas investment plays a huge part &#8212; <a href="https://www.kfw.de/PDF/Download-Center/Konzernthemen/Research/PDF-Dokumente-Studien-und-Materialien/KfW-Venture-Capital-Studie-2020.pdf">half of the deals exceeding $50 million funding rounds are led entirely by foreign investors</a>, while only 5% are run by German investors and 45% see a mix of foreign and domestic investors at the cap table.</p>
<p>I think this is where the German VC market needs to be right now. Great innovation is being sourced and backed by local funds. As these companies grow and become winners, they attract the best investors from around the globe, enabling the companies to internationalize from a German base, and the early-stage VCs reap the rewards and continue investing in local German talent. As the market matures, I am confident we will see more German VC money invested at the growth stages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And the outlook is favorable. The German market is thriving. Even the pandemic did little to impact this fundamentally positive trend for the technology sector.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The German market is thriving. Even the pandemic did little to impact this fundamentally positive trend for the technology sector.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In addition to the growing level of both local and international investment into German tech, policymakers have created better conditions for startups and VC funds to thrive in Germany.</p>
<p>The German Federal Government launched <a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Standardartikel/Topics/Financial_markets/Articles/2021-03-25-launch-of-the-zukunftsfonds.html">the €10 billion Future Fund</a> and has committed additional funds to the Deep Tech Future Fund. Not only does this immediately inject more capital into the market at the growth stage, but it also indicates that Germany is “open for business.” It sends a clear signal to the rest of the world that Germany understands the link between innovation and tangible improvements in society. It is a powerful and welcome indicator to funds from around the world.</p>
<p>Germany is incredibly attractive to tech talent, in addition to investors. More and more tech workers wish to <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/tech-workers-relocate-to-germany/">relocate to Germany</a>, with the welfare state providing a model for the future.</p>
<p>The long term looks good, too. Germany is famous the world over for its manufacturing and engineering sector. Germany is one of the few countries that still generates foreign trade surpluses through local production. Manufacturing and engineering are still yet to experience a massive leap in innovation. Therefore, German startups are extremely well positioned to benefit from the increasing activity in “Industry 4.0” innovation, with talent from Germany’s manufacturing heartland poised to blend with the ever-increasing pool of tech talent in Berlin and Munich.</p>
<h2>Share options and spinoffs are the Achilles’ heel of the German startup scene</h2>
<p>I think German VC and the tech market are due to take off and achieve new heights. However, there are two areas that need to be substantially improved: employee stock options and the regulations around spinoffs.</p>
<p>Germany is choking on its bureaucracy, and that threatens innovation. Tesla’s new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/business/tesla-german-gigafactory-delay.html">Gigafactory is the latest example</a> of how bureaucratic processes can slow everything down.</p>
<p>For startups in Germany, reforms on employee stock option plans (ESOP) are urgently needed for startup workers to benefit from the success of their companies and for the startup ecosystem to grow on its own.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/die-esop-reform-ist-so-gut-wie-gescheitert/">current bill</a> to offer better tax benefits does not reflect the needs of the industry. For example, tax relief is only available for employees in companies that are younger than 10 years. If an employee changes employers, they must pay tax on company shares beforehand, which poses a significant risk of bankruptcy. Because many startups are still not profitable after 10 years, taxes should only be due when an employee makes an actual profit from their holdings &#8212; when they sell the shares. In the end, startups simply won’t offer new ESOPs to their employees.</p>
<p>Another example: spinoffs. Germany has the <a href="https://www.epo.org/about-us/annual-reports-statistics/statistics/2019/statistics/patent-applications.html#tab2">highest number of patent applications in Europe</a>. However, startups often are not able to turn innovative technology into product-market fit. Spinoffs from the leading German research institutes have had a hard time gaining a foothold because they have been imposed with high institutional fixed and license costs when spinning off. Here, Germany needs to be more flexible and give startups the space and funding they need.</p>
<p>Lower the fixed costs and the enormous bureaucracy founders face when spinning off. Investors have to render more operational and organizational support for researchers-turned-founders. Furthermore, VCs must have the courage to invest more in innovative ideas and technologies that may take a bit longer to thrive. BioNTech is the best example of how this pays off in the long run.</p>
<h2>More German unicorns?</h2>
<p>As it stands, 2021 has already seen numerous new unicorns from Germany &#8212; with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/">Personio</a>, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/mambu-110m-raise-unicorn/">Mambu</a>, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/sennder-latest-european-unicorn/">Sennder</a>, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/gorillas-raises-e245m-unicorn/">Gorillas</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/">Trade Republic</a> achieving billion-dollar valuations &#8212; and there are almost certainly more to come.</p>
<p>If regulators finally cut through the red tape around stock options and spinoffs, the German tech and VC industry will achieve new heights. I look forward to positive changes and an entire roster of German unicorns being minted in the years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Temasek and an affiliate of Warburg Pincus are investing $500 million in Indian ride-hailing giant Ola, the Bangalore-headquartered startup said in a short statement Friday. Ola co-founder and chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal is also participating in the new investment, the startup said.</p>
<p>This is the first time SoftBank-backed Ola, which leads the market in India, has raised money since its Series J financing round two years ago, according to records on insight platform Tracxn. Ola said in a statement that the investment comes &#8220;ahead of IPO&#8221; &#8212; but didn&#8217;t elaborate. (The startup has since said it hasn&#8217;t finalized the timing of its IPO.)</p>
<p>Ola, Temasek, and Warburg Pincus didn&#8217;t share how the new investment valued the ride-hailing startup, which competes with Uber in India. Ola was valued at under $5 billion in its previous financing round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EV business Ola Electric, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/ola-ev-business-ola-electric-mobility/">span out of Ola in 2019</a>, is also in the market to raise money, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">reported earlier this week</a>. The unicorn startup will soon start the production of its electric scooters, Aggarwal, who also oversees Ola Electric, said recently.</p>
<p>Mobility firms are among the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic. But in recent months, they have started to pick up pace again as more Indian states relax lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>Ola had about 32 million monthly active users on Android in India in June, up from about 26 million in May, according to mobile insight firm App Annie. Uber had about 22 million users in June on Android in India, up from 18 million in May.</p>
<p>“Over the last 12 months we’ve made our ride hailing business more robust, resilient and efficient. With strong recovery post lockdown and a shift in consumer preference away from public transportation, we are well positioned to capitalize on the various urban mobility needs of our customers. I welcome Warburg Pincus and Temasek to Ola and look forward to collaborating with them in our next phase of growth,&#8221; said Aggarwal in a statement.</p>
<p>Ola, which operates in over 100 cities in India and has amassed over a million driver partners on its platform, also expanded to several international markets including Australia, New Zealand, and the UK in the past decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to collaborating with Bhavish and the team in the next phase of Ola’s growth,” said Vishal Mahadevia, MD and head of India business at Warburg Pincus, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DN Capital, one of Europe’s most active VCs has launched its latest $350 million (£220m, €300m) fund off the back of a pretty stand-out year when the firm saw four of its portfolio companies hit billion-dollar-plus valuations. DN’s &#8216;Fund V&#8217; will invest across Europe, the UK and the US, but with strongly European LPs, DN has garnered a reputation for digging up some of continental Europe’s hottest startups from, North, Western, Central, and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Led by industry veterans Nenad Marovac (based in Europe) and Steve Schlenker (based Stateside), DN led the Series A round in Auto1, which IPO’d on the German Stock Exchange earlier this year at a $10 billion valuation and over 150x their entry price per share.</p>
<p>As Marovac explained: “We spend vast amounts of time with entrepreneurs understanding the market, their team, their product and to get to the heart of what they’re trying to achieve, long before we even talk about money… The launch of our fifth fund gives us further scope to uncover new entrepreneurs with the biggest, brightest global ambitions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Schlenker added that he thinks the “full impact of the pandemic on society, work, and behaviors is only just being understood. There are tech founders across the globe right now on critical missions to accelerate this recovery and help address the needs, and solve the biggest problems, of the post-COVID world.”</p>
<p>In July 2021 MrSpex, the Germany-born online eyewear retailer, IPO’d at over $1.0bn. DN Capital also counts unicorns Remitly, Jobandtalent, and GoStudent in its portfolio.</p>
<p>The company, which has a 20-year history, said Fund V was “substantially oversubscribed” and will focus on the funds main specialities in software, fintech, marketplaces and the consumer internet.</p>
<p>Schlenker  said: “Europe has really come into its own now. It is competing very successfully versus the US in terms of returns to investors.”</p>
<p>Were they seeing more US VC in Europe, I asked?</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve done deals with Sequoia with Lightspeed, with Battery. It seems like the competition is very strong in the UK market, because the Americans come over where they can speak the language first. It&#8217;s still more of a competitive landscape with the US players in the series B or C stages when you get to France, Germany, etc.&#8221; said Schlenker.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is changing, but it&#8217;s still mostly them following people like DN in those rounds, whereas at series A-level, which is really our sweet spot, they seem to be more combatative specifically in the UK market. And we do a disproportionate share of our investments on the continent, as opposed to the UK,” said Schlenker.</p>
<p>I put it to Marovac what he thought had attracted LPs back to the fund. “Honestly?” he said, “Performance. We had the auto1 IPO in February which is worth three and a half times Fund III. We just had the Mr Spex IPO last week, which is another one times Fund II. We invested in  GoStudent last June, at a $20 million valuation and they just raised money at $1.4 billion.”</p>
<p>Before some of those events he said fundraising for the fund was going “okay” but it wasn&#8217;t going “gangbusters”. “I think since those things happened &#8211; and  I guess also maybe a difference in investors perceptions or mentality in Q1 this year. But Q1 Q2 Q3 last year were tough. They weren&#8217;t easy for fundraising. But it really came about, maybe, due to changes in the market and then also the performance of the funds. They are now going into our fund three with a 3x, already,” he pointed out.</p>
<p>Marovac also outlined how the fund had quickly moved to support its portfolio last year when the pandemic hit: “The first thing we did when the pandemic hit was go through the portfolio and triage, making sure every company was funded for at least till the end of December 2021. Then we said we want to invest in companies that are, firstly, COVID resistant, in the short to medium term, and, secondly, companies that are going to benefit from this digital transformation since COVID accelerated things that were happening already.”</p>
<p>He points to the example of UiPath and software automation &#8211; the most valuable company to ever come out of Europe: “Digital payments: no one wants to touch cash anymore. And also just different forms of FinTech for digital inclusion. Remitly is probably our key example there, which does remittances for people to send money back home to emerging markets.”</p>
<p>Certainly, with this new $350m fund, it’s clear DN Capital is poised to power though the rest of 2021 and well into the next few years of Europe’s startup growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As environmental issues really came of age in the 1990s, certain German automakers were meeting in secret groups to make sure their cars would continue to industriously contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the European Union, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler have been illegally colluding to restrict competition in emission cleaning for new diesel passenger cars, essentially slowing the deployment of cleaner emissions tech. On Thursday, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3581">the EU issued fines of $1 billion</a> (€875 million) to Volkswagen and BMW for their involvement in the emissions cartel.</p>
<p>“The five car manufacturers Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche possessed the technology to reduce harmful emissions beyond what was legally required under EU emission standards,&#8221; said executive VP of the EU Commission Margrethe Vestager in a statement. &#8220;But they avoided to compete on using this technology&#8217;s full potential to clean better than what is required by law. So today&#8217;s decision is about how legitimate technical cooperation went wrong. And we do not tolerate it when companies collude. It is illegal under EU Antitrust rules. Competition and innovation on managing car pollution are essential for Europe to meet our ambitious Green Deal objectives. And this decision shows that we will not hesitate to take action against all forms of cartel conduct putting in jeopardy this goal.”</p>
<p>All parties acknowledged their involvement and agreed to settle. Volkswagen, which owns Audi and Porsche, will have to pay around $595 million, and BMW will pay $442 million. Daimler would have had to pay around $861 million, but the company is evading fines by being the whistleblower. So we guess Daimler just gets off scot-free?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bmw-remained-profitable-2020-strong-half-76385265">BMW made a net profit of $4.62 billion last year</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/volkswagen-posts-12-2-billion-profit-in-resilient-pandemic-year">and VW made about $12.2 billion</a> and nearly $23 billion in 2019, so this fine sort of feels like a slap on the wrist. And let us remember, this is not the first time VW has gotten into an emissions scandal.</p>
<p>In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to VW for intentionally adding software into its diesel engines to make it look like it was following emissions controls, when in reality its cars were actually producing far more than the legal amount.</p>
<p>In its action against the companies, the EU specifically homed in on the agreement reached by the companies on the sizes of tanks used for AdBlue, a solution that mixes with diesel car exhaust to neutralize harmful pollutants. The companies agreed not to compete on making cars cleaner even though they had the tech to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/volkswagen-audi-porsche-bmw-und-daimler-unter-kartellverdacht-a-1159052.html">Der Spiegel first broke the news about the cartel in 2017</a>, and the companies set to work greenwashing. In the same year, all of the involved parties, as well as Ford Motor Company,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/03/bmw-daimler-ford-and-volkswagen-team-up-on-high-power-charging-network/"> joined forces to create a high-power charging network for EVs called Ionity</a>. The plan was to build and operate around 400 charging stations across Europe by 2020, but it looks like <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/454268/ionity-300-fast-charging-stations-europe/">Ionity only managed to install 300 across Europe</a>, and it even significantly increased the price of a charge by <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/17/ionity-increases-electric-vehicle-charging-prices-500-percent-january-31/">500% last year</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, VW&#8217;s heavy-truck business, the Traton Group, Daimler Truck and Volvo group joined up to invest nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/volvo-daimler-traton-invest-593-million-to-build-electric-truck-charging-network/">$593 million in a network of public charging stations</a> for electric heavy-duty long-haul trucks and buses around Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">5G technology has generated a lot of hype for its potential to power driverless cars using a remote operator, but for the past few years that’s all it’s been — hype. Las Vegas-based startup Halo and telecom giant T-Mobile are teaming up to change that, with a driverless electric car service in Las Vegas powered on 5G to launch later this year.</p>
<p>The service, which will start with five vehicles, will work by connecting users to Halo’s pilot fleet of vehicles via an app. After a user has ordered a vehicle, a remote operator will drive it to the waiting customer. Once the car is delivered, the user can get behind the steering wheel and operate the vehicle as normal for the duration of their trip. When the trip is complete, the remote operator takes back over and drives it to the next waiting customer.</p>
<p><a href="https://halo.car/">Halo</a> departs significantly from companies like Waymo or Cruise, which are developing a full self-driving technology stack that aims to completely remove the human — remote or in-car — from the equation. Instead, Halo vehicles will be equipped with nine cameras, radars and ultrasonics as backup (no lidar), and it will connect to remote operators via T-Mobile’s Ultra Capacity midband 5G network.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Halo CEO Anand Nandakumar told TechCrunch that the service can also run on extended range low-band 5G network and on LTE as needed.</p>
<p>Halo said in a press release that its cars will be equipped with an algorithm that “learns in the background while humans control the vehicle, building a unique feedback loop to achieve Level 3 capabilities over time,” suggesting that the company has its sights set on autonomy in the long term. (“Level 3” refers to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ five levels of autonomous driving. L3 indicates features that allow the driver to be out of the loop under very limited conditions.)</p>
<p>“Full autonomy is a massive challenge from both a technical and social-trust perspective that won’t be solved for years to come,” Nandakumar said in the release. “But Halo has been designed to address these challenges by building automation over time starting with a solution that consumers will feel comfortable using today.”</p>
<p>The startup also said its vehicles will be equipped with an advanced safe stop mechanism, which will immediately bring cars to a full stop if a potential safety hazard is detected.</p>
<p>Last year, Halo joined the 5G Open Innovation Lab T-Mobile co-founded, giving the startup access to the telecom’s engineers and midspectrum network. Nandakumar declined to specify if T-Mobile is one of the company’s investors.</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/circle-is-a-good-example-of-why-spacs-can-be-useful/"><strong>Crypto-powered Circle is going public via a SPAC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are a crypto-minded person, you’ve heard of Circle. If you aren’t, it’s the company that bought SeedInvest and is helping build stablecoin USDC. It’s going public via a SPAC at a multibillion-dollar valuation. Call it riding the Coinbase wave.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Flipping the script and going back to the earlier stages of startup life, here’s a rundown of news from startup land:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/powerz-raises-8-3-million-for-its-video-game-focused-on-education/"><strong>PowerZ raises $8.3M to fuse gaming and education:</strong></a> The French startup is both a gaming company<em> and </em>edtech startup. The startup thinks that “educational games will become mainstream really quickly,” TechCrunch reports. This makes sense: I have learned more about the Middle Ages from Crusader Kings III than any book I’ve read.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/rootly-nabs-3-2m-seed-to-build-sre-incident-management-solution-inside-slack/">Rootly raises $3.2M to bring SRE tooling into Slack:</a> </strong>Look, we all live inside of Slack or Teams, so why not bring more functionality into the services? Rootly wants to bring “an incident-response solution inside” of the work platform that Salesforce is buying. The round and company are neat, as is the fact that startups are building atop Slack itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/homebrew-leads-z1s-effort-to-bring-digital-banking-to-latin-americas-teens/"><strong>Z1 wants to bring fintech to LatAm zoomers:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Homebrew is putting early-stage money to work in Latin America in hopes that Z1 can mimic what Nubank has managed in the region, namely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">build a fintech titan and raise a zillion dollars</a>. Per TechCrunch, Z1 was a recent Y Combinator grad, which means that Homebrew acquired around 0.8 bips worth of equity in the $2.5 million the transaction. We kid.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/popshop-live-raises-around-20m-at-a-100m-valuation-for-its-livestream-shopping-platform-for-hipsters/"><strong>Popshop Live raises $20M for modern QVC:</strong></a> Now worth around $100 million, Popshop Live has built a “standalone business that taps into the millennial taste for shopping from smaller and more edgy brands and individuals as much as bigger retailers.” With new capital and retailer momentum, it’s a startup to watch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/smile-identity-raises-7m-to-build-kyc-and-identity-verification-tools-for-africa/"><strong>Smile Identity raises $7M Series A to verify identities:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Focused on the African market, Smile Identity has put together a lettered round for KYC and ID services on the continent. TechCrunch reports that Costanoa Ventures co-led the deal with CRE Venture Capital.</li>
</ul>
<p>To close out, Natasha <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1413195928651980800">scooped</a> that “Peter Boyce II has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/peter-boyce-stellation-capital/">left General Catalyst to start his own firm</a>, a little over a year after the venture capital firm promoted him to partner.” It’s a busy week for new venture funds, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/acrylic-debut-crypto-fund/">Acrylic</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/renegade-partners-rolls-out-its-much-anticipated-debut-fund-with-100-million/">Renegade</a> also making news.</p>
<h2>The NS1 EC-1</h2>
<p>For the latest entry in our series of long-form articles that explore the inner workings of notable startups, we looked at NS1, an internet infrastructure company best known for its software-defined domain name services (DNS).</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">Origin story:</a></strong> How three engineers decided to rebuild the internet&#8217;s core addressing system.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how NS1 transformed &#8220;a slumbering and dreary yet reliable aspect of the internet&#8221; into &#8220;a strategic moat and an enterprise win&#8221; in just eight years, read on.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>A few notes from Big Tech before we wrap our news coverage. Enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/dropbox-is-reimagining-the-workplace-with-dropbox-studios/"><strong>Dropbox reinvents work(places):</strong></a> No, not in the product sense, but in terms of how it is approaching offices as COVID slowly wanes. The result? Something that looks more like a fancy, private coffee spot than an office. I demand that all companies mimic this immediately.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/beyond-meat-launches-plant-based-chicken-tenders-at-us-restaurants/"><strong>Tendies from $BYND:</strong></a> Yep, Beyond Meat has launched plant-based “chicken” tenders at some 400 U.S. restaurants. The company, long a public firm and thus befitting of our Big Tech moniker, has had a tumultuous life since it went public. Its shares have traded as high as $239 since it debuted. Today, the company is still worth a healthy $140 per share, far above its original $25 IPO price.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Between our work at<a href="http://demandcurve.com/"> Demand Curve</a> and our agency,<a href="http://bellcurve.com/"> Bell Curve</a>, we&#8217;ve rewritten over 1,000 websites for startups across most industries.</p>
<p>Want to convert twice as many visitors into customers? Follow these copywriting tactics.</p>
<h2>Everything &#8220;above the fold&#8221; must have a purpose</h2>
<p>The section of your homepage that&#8217;s immediately visible to a visitor before they start scrolling is called &#8220;above the fold.” (Think of a print newspaper: Everything above the literal fold in the paper is the most important information.) When a visitor sees the content above the fold, they decide to either keep scrolling or exit your site.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In seconds, they&#8217;re trying to figure out what you do and whether you’re a fit for them.</p>
<p>The most common mistake we see startups make? Their “above the fold” is either uninteresting or confusing. This often happens when marketers attempt to squeeze too much content above the fold.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The most common mistake we see startups make? Their “above the fold” is either uninteresting or confusing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The truth is, most of the information on your website is irrelevant to new visitors. So the area above the fold should be used to explain how you can help new visitors solve a specific problem.</p>
<p>For example, you might see a homepage that promotes the newest technical blog post that the company published. But that&#8217;s not useful to a visitor who doesn&#8217;t yet understand what you do.</p>
<p>To further confuse the visitor, many companies add an extensive navigation bar to the top of their site. In theory, this allows your visitors to easily access any part of your website. In practice, it leads to decision fatigue and low conversion rates.</p>
<p>Unless the content directly helps answer what you do and whether you&#8217;re a good fit for that visitor, it should be removed.</p>
<p>There are three things you can do to improve the conversion rate of your homepage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Craft a sharp header.</li>
<li>Use a complementary subheader.</li>
<li>Design with intention.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s get into the tactics of these three areas of improvement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Write headers that speak to an individual (not a crowd)</h2>
<p>Your header is the largest piece of text on your website. In under 10 words (about the longest we&#8217;d recommend), your header needs to accomplish three things:</p>
<h3>1. Identify how customers get value from your product.</h3>
<p>This is your most important value proposition. If you can&#8217;t explain how someone gets value from your product in fewer than 10 words, it&#8217;ll be a challenge to keep visitors&#8217; attention for much longer.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how we uncover your key value proposition:</p>
<ul>
<li>What bad alternative do people resort to when they lack your product?</li>
<li>How is your product better than the bad alternative?</li>
<li>Now turn the last step into an action statement — that&#8217;s your value proposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take Airbnb:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bad alternative is being stuck in a sterile hotel without experiencing any real culture.</li>
<li>Airbnb&#8217;s product is better than the bad alternative because it allows you to stay in a local’s home.</li>
<li>So if we turn the second question into an action statement, we&#8217;d get a value proposition like: Experience new cities like a local.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some more examples from top startups:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175032" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175032" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175032 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="823" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png 1702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=680,547 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=1536,1235 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175032" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h3>2. Include an enticing hook that keeps visitors reading.</h3>
<p>Telling your visitors what you do is a good start, but now we need to get them excited about your product.</p>
<p>A huge missed opportunity we see a lot of startups make with their website copy? It&#8217;s not action oriented. In a world where customers can shop 24/7, there&#8217;s very little urgency for your visitors to take action now.</p>
<p>Adding a hook will increase the likelihood that a visitor buys from you on their first visit.</p>
<p>There are two ways we like to write hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer a bold claim: something highly specific that triggers the thought, &#8220;Wow, I didn&#8217;t know that was possible.”</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2175034" style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175034" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175034" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png" alt="" width="615" height="346" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png 615w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175034" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<ul>
<li>Or address common objections: questions or pushback that your visitor is likely already thinking about. Addressing objections right away might seem counterintuitive, but bringing attention to your weaknesses will actually make your visitor trust your brand more. With no direct sales team, your copy is going to need to work hard to answer as many questions as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some value propositions of top startups that incorporate their biggest objections upfront.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175035" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175035" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175035 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="765" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png 1694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=768,574 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=680,508 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=1536,1148 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175035" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h3>3. Speak directly to your ideal customer persona</h3>
<p>To truly make the message in your header grab the attention of your visitor, rewrite your value proposition to speak directly to your customer personas.</p>
<p>To do so, list your top two to three customer personas. Rewrite your headers to address the part of your product they value most. Use their own language, not industry jargon. The best way to learn what your customers love about your product is through one-on-one customer interviews or reading customer success tickets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4ckLIedx1Y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/10-lies-youve-been-told-about-marketing/">Demand Curve: 10 lies you’ve been told about marketing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Demand Curve: 10 lies you’ve been told about marketing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/10-lies-youve-been-told-about-marketing/embed/#?secret=4ckLIedx1Y" data-secret="4ckLIedx1Y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now you&#8217;ve got headers that speak directly to your ideal customer persona. You can either A/B test which header leads to a higher conversion rate or create custom landing pages using each header to drive traffic from different sources to specific pages.</p>
<p>For example, if you include a link to your website in a guest blog post, send that audience to the page with the most relevant header.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of writing multiple value propositions for the same startup:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175036" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175036" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175036" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png" alt="" width="1024" height="721" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png 1704w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=768,541 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=680,479 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=1536,1082 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175036" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Use a subheader to explain how your header can be possible</h2>
<p>We suggest spending about 50% of your time working on writing the header and 25% of your time on the subheader. Why? Because if your header isn&#8217;t interesting, your visitors won&#8217;t even bother reading the subheader.</p>
<p>Your subheader should be used to expand on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How does your product work <em>exactly</em>?</li>
<li>Which of your features make our header&#8217;s bold claim believable?</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use your top two to three features to explain how your header is achieved.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say Airbnb&#8217;s header is: Experience your getaway vacation like a local. No minimum stays.</p>
<p>To make this statement believable, we need to explain how it&#8217;s possible to vacation like a local and how &#8220;no minimum stays&#8221; is possible.</p>
<p>A subheader could read something like: An online rental marketplace with thousands of short-term rentals in your area.</p>
<p>Do not use industry jargon or technical terms in your subheader or header. Use words that a fifth-grade reader would understand. Use short sentences. Lengthy paragraphs will kill the momentum of your reader.</p>
<p>Here are a few more examples of using the subheader to explain the header:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175037" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175037" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175037" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="586" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png 1696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=768,439 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=1536,878 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175037" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Make your homepage feel familiar and function as expected</h2>
<p>The last aspect to consider when creating a high-converting homepage is the design. We see a lot of high-tech startups try to use their website to show off their creativity.</p>
<p>From our experience, your website is not the place to try to be original.</p>
<p>A website&#8217;s design should rarely be unique. It&#8217;s your <em>product</em> that should be unique. Your website is just a familiar medium for communicating your product&#8217;s uniqueness.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Using familiar buttons and navigation that other websites have popularized will save your visitor the hassle of having to learn how your website works. For example, we&#8217;ve come to expect there to be a &#8220;home&#8221; button in the top left of the page. Attempting to place the same button in the bottom right for the sake of uniqueness will lead to confusion and possibly a lost customer. Stick with what works.</p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Consider these goals when adding images to your homepage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove uncertainty by showing your product in action. GIFs or looping videos are a terrific way of demonstrating how it works without taking up any additional space.
<p><div id="attachment_2175038" style="width: 862px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175038" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175038" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-6.gif" alt="" width="852" height="752" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175038" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://judy.co/">Judy</a></p></div></li>
<li>If you sell physical goods, use images to show off various use cases and close-ups of the material and texture. This will help your visitor assess the quality of the product and further validate that the product is right for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2175040" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175040" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175040" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png" alt="" width="1024" height="542" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=1536,813 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175040" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/">Allbirds</a></p></div></p>
<h3>Call-to-action buttons</h3>
<p>Your call-to-action buttons (CTA) are where you&#8217;ll convert a visitor of your webpage into an active shopper. Therefore, your CTAs should be a continuation of the magic that you teased in your header copy.</p>
<p>Make the CTA button copy action focused and tell your visitor what will happen once they click it.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of CTA buttons that feel natural because they continue the narrative that began with the header copy:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175041" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175041" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png" alt="" width="1024" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png 1684w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=768,308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=680,273 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=1536,617 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">One of VR&#8217;s prospective revenue streams is ad placement. The thought is that its levels of immersion can engender high engagement with various flavors of display ads. Think billboards in a virtual streetscape or sporting venue. Art imitates life, and all that.</p>
<p>This topic reemerged recently in the wake of Facebook&#8217;s<a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/blaston-in-game-vr-facebook-advertising-reverse-course/"> experimental ads</a> in Blaston VR. As TechCrunch&#8217;s Lucas Matney<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebooks-entry-into-vr-advertising-isnt-going-too-well/"> observed</a>, it didn&#8217;t go too well. The move triggered a resounding backlash, followed by the game publisher, Resolution Games,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebooks-entry-into-vr-advertising-isnt-going-too-well/"> backing out</a> of the trial.</p>
<p>This chain of events underscored Facebook&#8217;s headwinds in VR ad monetization, which stem from its broader ad issues. In fairness, this was an experimental move to test the VR advertising waters … which Facebook accomplished, though it didn’t get the result it wanted.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			VR advertising is a bit of a double-edged sword. It could take several years for VR usage to reach requisite levels for meaningful ad monetization.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Regardless, we&#8217;ve taken this opportunity to revisit our<a href="https://artillry.co/artillry-intelligence/vr-global-revenue-forecast-2019-2024/"> ongoing analysis</a> and market sizing of VR advertising in general. The short version: There are pros and cons on both qualitative and quantitative levels.</p>
<h2>The pros of VR advertising</h2>
<p>VR advertising&#8217;s opportunity goes back to factors noted above: potentially high ad engagement given inherent levels of immersion. On that measure, VR<a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/study-vr-ads-aid-same-day-recall-for-70-of-users/507755/"> exceeds</a> all other media, which can mean higher-quality impressions, brand recall and other common display-ad metrics.</p>
<p>Historical evidence also suggests that VR could follow a path toward ad monetization. VR shows similar patterns to media that were increasingly ad supported as they matured. These include video, social media, mobile apps and games (just ask Unity).</p>
<p>To put some numbers behind that, <a href="https://arinsider.co/2020/03/06/xr-talks-will-vr-follow-mobiles-monetization-path/">75%</a> of apps in the Apple App Store&#8217;s first year were paid apps &#8212; similar to VR today. That figure declined to 15% in 2014 and hovers around 10% today. Over time, developers learned they could reach scale through free downloads.</p>
<p>Prevalent revenue models today include in-app purchases &#8212; especially in mobile gaming &#8212; and advertising. The question is whether VR will follow a similar path as developers learn that they can reach scale faster through free apps that employ &#8220;back-end monetization&#8221; like ad support.</p>
<p>This trend also follows audience dynamics: Early adopters are more likely to pay for content and experiences. But as a given technology or media matures, its transition to mainstream audiences requires different business models with less upfront commitment and friction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, there are only about 18% of applications in VR stores such as Steam and Oculus that are free,&#8221;<a href="https://arinsider.co/2020/03/06/xr-talks-will-vr-follow-mobiles-monetization-path/"> Admix CEO Samuel Huber said</a>. &#8220;This is fine for now because we are still very early in the market and most of these users are early adopters. They are willing to pay for content, just like they were willing to pay for prototype unproven hardware and generally, they have higher purchasing power than the average person.”</p>
<h2>Drawbacks of VR advertising</h2>
<p>Considering the above advantages, VR advertising is a bit of a double-edged sword (or beat saber). Those advantages are counterbalanced by a few practical disadvantages in the medium&#8217;s early stage. Much of this comes down to the requirement for scale.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
