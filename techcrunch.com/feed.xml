										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Priti Choksi, partner at Norwest Venture Partners, has a portfolio that includes Bright, Lumosity, Citcon, UPSIDE Foods and Birdies. But before she ever entered the world of VC, she was an operator at companies like Facebook and Google. She managed business development teams and ran M&amp;A and has vast experience in the world of growing and scaling companies.</p>
<p>So, it should go without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely amped to have Choksi join us on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-norwest-venture-partners-and-birdies?utm_source=TC%20Post&amp;utm_campaign=post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 17 at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST for an episode of TechCrunch Live</a>. Choksi will be joined by founder Bianca Gates of <a href="https://birdies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birdies</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. The first step in that, usually, is getting some funding. We&#8217;ll talk to Choksi and Gates about how they first met, what drew Choksi to invest in Birdies and how they&#8217;ve worked together since. We&#8217;ll also take a look through Birdies&#8217; early pitch deck and hear what really sang for NVP and other investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232075" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founders, this is a great opportunity to learn what makes VCs tick and refine your fundraising process accordingly.</p>
<p>This episode of TechCrunch Live will also feature the TCL pitch-off, where founders in the audience can come on our virtual stage and pitch their products to our esteemed guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is accessible to anyone who is available on Wednesdays at noon PST/3 p.m. EST, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">full library of on-demand TechCrunch Live content</a> is reserved exclusively for TechCrunch+ members.

					<description><![CDATA[Braze priced above its IPO range, while UserTesting priced underneath its range. Why?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Braze and UserTesting will begin to trade this morning, kicking off their lives as public companies.</p>
<p>But while it would seem we could simply lump the two companies into a bucket and call the day a win for tech upstarts and their venture capital backers, we can&#8217;t. Why? Because the two companies had very different final pricing results. And that means we have questions.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Braze priced <em>above </em>its IPO range, while UserTesting priced <em>underneath</em> its range. Why? (You can read our initial notes on Braze <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/braze-set-to-put-points-on-the-board-for-new-yorks-startup-scene-in-impending-ipo/">here</a>, if you&#8217;d like.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s parse the numbers, chat through what the two companies are worth at their IPO prices, and discuss what we can learn from the information to better understand the present-day exit market for software companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220370 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We always care about software IPOs because they help us understand the market for software startups &#8212; how much public markets are willing to pay for a software company&#8217;s shares helps price startup funding rounds, for example. But we also have Nubank and Paytm heading out soon, two mega-IPOs that have us up at night wondering how they will be valued. So we&#8217;re collecting all the data that we can in advance.</p>
<p>That in mind, let&#8217;s figure out why Braze had a much better pricing result than UserTesting.</p>
<h2>Two prices, two sagas</h2>
<p>Braze <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001676238/000119312521322227/d40379ds1a.htm">targeted</a> a $55 to $60 per-share IPO price range. It sold stock at $65 per share. In valuation terms, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88338/Customer-engagement-platform-Braze-sets-terms-for-$460-million-IPO">Renaissance Capital estimated</a> that at the midpoint of its range ($57.5 per share), the company would be worth $5.9 billion on a fully diluted basis. That gives the company an estimated valuation at $65 per share of $6.7 billion</p>
<p>UserTesting <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001557127/000162828021022100/usertestingincs-1a2.htm">targeted</a> a $15 to $17 per-share IPO price range. It sold stock at $14 per share. In valuation terms, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88336/Usability-testing-platform-UserTesting-sets-terms-for-$227-million-IPO">Renaissance Capital estimated</a> that at midpoint of its range ($16 per share), the company would be worth $2.7 billion. That gives the company an estimated valuation at $14 per share of $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>Never cry for a company that goes out at a valuation of over a billion dollars. But, still, why the divergence? Here are their growth rates, with a bit more time under the belt for UserTesting because we have more recent data from it given a quirk in how Braze handles its fiscal calendar. (The Braze data compares the six months concluding July 31 of 2020 and 2021.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Braze YoY growth Q1-Q2 2020 v. 2021: 52.5%</li>
<li>UserTesting YoY growth Q1-Q3 2020 v. 2021: 45.4%</li>
</ul>
<p>Those figures are closer than I anticipated, frankly, and therefore do not answer our question.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Historically, the main actors in venture capital have been a specialized set of tech investors who themselves came from the technology industry. They understood it well because they were the ones who built foundational technologies or sold hardware, software and systems into businesses.</p>
<p>And so, generally, the people who invested in tech companies — the traditional venture investors — could tap their extended talent networks and apply their knowledge to bring talented people into startups, or at least coach the founders on how to select the right talent to scale and grow.</p>
<p>To be a good venture capitalist, you must understand what we call “venture risks.” What are the technology risks? What are the market risks? What are the people risks? What are the execution risks that remain? How do we manage hypergrowth when it happens?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235118" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Almost all the returns in venture occur when you have a company with lightning in a bottle. And then if that does happen, can the founders, investors and extended talent network bring it all together in such a way that’ll spur growth and achieve the kind of outlier successes that account for most of the returns in venture capital?</p>
<p>But over the past few years, the momentum for the sources of capital has swung dramatically from these traditional, specialized venture investors to a much more diverse universe of investors. These new venture investors are deploying a lot of capital, believing that they will be able to generate outsized returns. And in some cases, they have had early success, at least with returns on paper.</p>
<p>That said, unlike the traditional venture investors who stayed close to their investments through a stake in the company, a seat on the board and other special terms, these new, nontraditional investors are, for the most part, playing an asset deployment game.</p>
<p>These investors are working under the assumption that the founders, or the existing early investors in the company combined with the founders, should have all the skills and resources it takes to build the company to its full potential. The new entrants are therefore bringing only money to the table with the hope that it can punch through all the remaining problems the company faces and things will work out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, where does this put you &#8212; the startup founder, entrepreneur or company executive?</p>
<h2>It’s a great time to be a founder</h2>
<p>If you’re committed to building an enduring company and you want to, as Steve Jobs put it, “make a dent in the universe,” then this is the best time ever to be a founder. We’re currently living in a capital-surplus environment, which means that there are many options available to you and almost every interesting idea is getting its due. That’s an ideal situation from a founder perspective, and the possibilities are intoxicating.</p>
<p>If you’re a founder who’s trying to decide whether to pursue venture capital or nontraditional investors, ask yourself these questions: What do you need at your stage of development? Have you punched through all the possible failure modes? What risks remain in the business? Given that perspective, how much money should you raise and at what valuation?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a founder and you are completely confident you know everything needed to build a durable company, and all you need from investors is money, then taking money from an asset manager may be the right path for you.</p>
<p>But if you understand there are risks that happen in the lifetime of a company &#8212; things that can go wrong that money alone won’t solve &#8212; then pairing up with a venture investor who knows your business might be the best approach. A pure asset play can buy you a little bit more time, but fundamentally you need to have talent in the management team, and a VC firm can help you there.</p>
<p>If you believe you’ve punched through all the risks and points of failure, then just take the money at the highest possible valuation and be happy. Why waste your time with people who want to take board seats and more? If, however, you still have a lot of risks to work through, a lot of building left to be done and lots of scenarios to play out, then I would be thoughtful about how much money you take from whom, and at what valuation.</p>
<p>People experienced in venture help diagnose and make sure you don’t fall through the inevitable trap doors.</p>
<p>As I explain in my book, “<a href="https://anticipatefailure.com/">Anticipate Failure</a>,” there are many potential sources of failure, including people, product, technology, business model and more. Because while much has changed in the venture industry over the years, the fundamentals of business-building remain the same. And as long as there are founders who need more than just cash to ensure their startups succeed and grow, there will always be a place for the unique skills and networks that the best venture capital investors and firms bring to the table.</p>
<p>How many venture investors truly live up to their promise to add value is a separate discussion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seven-year-old venture firm <a href="https://www.fortross.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fort Ross Ventures</a> just raised its fourth fund. The firm doesn&#8217;t have a specific focus, but has been deploying funds into fintech with a particular focus on insurance tech. The firm has also made a number of SaaS enterprise investments. To date, the firm has mostly invested in Israeli and U.S. companies, but that is about to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have raised over 200 [million USD],&#8221; Victor Orlovski, founder and managing partner at Fort Ross Ventures, told me. &#8220;We keep raising, and we aim to raise at least 300 [million], which is absolutely doable. Our typical check size is between 10 and 30 million; I think the average is around 20. We haven&#8217;t yet made any investments in Europe. We have just started building our European presence, and that is the reason I moved to Europe for a short while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm is planning to continue its core investment strategy with around 60% of its deals in the U.S., 20-30% of investments in Israel, and the remaining in the U.K. and broader Europe. Orlovski told me the firm leads about a third of the deals it participates in, and partners with other venture firms on the remaining investments. The fund’s ongoing investment priorities include fintech, cloud technologies, AI/machine learning, business process automation services, edtech, food tech and tech-enabled businesses. As a general rule, the company focuses on backing companies that have raised at least $50 million in equity capital and are valued at $500 million or more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are operating four funds. Our first fund got some really exciting results &#8212; something like 50% IRR cash to cash &#8212; $7 on each dollar invested. The company that brought the entire return on that fund is eToro,&#8221; Orlovski said, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/">referring to the $10 billion SPAC merger we covered earlier this year</a>. &#8220;We raised our second fund in 2018, which was a $250 million fund. We subsequently closed two more funds. One fund we are operating from is an early-stage fund for SEA founders.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the first close for the fourth fund, Fort Ross Ventures’ Late-Stage Fund has deployed its first check, investing in <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ladder</a>, the digital life insurance company. The company offers flexible term coverage in minutes. As Ingrid covered here on TechCrunch, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/ladder-raises-100m-on-a-900m-valuation-for-a-platform-selling-flexible-term-life-insurance/">recently announced its $100 million Series D</a>. At the time, it didn&#8217;t disclose the other investors in the round.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that Ladder is a great company, and we are bullish on them. They are one of the leaders in a life insurance business,&#8221; said Orlovski. &#8220;We have chosen this company out of many companies we looked at in fintech worlds &#8212; we are quite bullish on the insurance sector overall. We are targeting companies which want to go global early in their lifetime. We are helping companies to build their relationship and presence in the SEA region, and also helping companies to grab a lot of talent out of the SEA region. I think that that&#8217;s our biggest area of expertise and help.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it was announced back in late-September, Amazon mentioned an end of year release date for the Echo Show 15. Looks like the company will be hitting that window. Heck, you could even say it hit a holiday release, depending on which holidays you happen to celebrate. The massive wall-mounted smart screen is officially up for presale starting today, and is set to start shipping December 9.</p>
<p>The product differentiates itself from the army of smart displays by being big. Really big. Like almost cartoonishly so. It’s built around a 15.6-inch 1080p screen and designed to be mounted to a wall, like a large digital picture frame. The $250 device features Visual ID, a new facial recognition feature (also arriving on the Astro robot) that delivers a custom content experience by identifying the user standing in front of it.</p>
<p>The massive amount of screen real estate means, naturally, that you can fit a lot on the thing at once, including feeds for smart home products like security cameras and doorbells, coupled with various widgets that let the screen serve up calendar events, to-do items and the like. The system can also be used as a big kitchen TV, streaming services like Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu and Sling TV.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Countertop stands and cabinet mounts are sold separately.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery platform Instacart is rolling out new safety features for its delivery workers. The company has launched a new &#8216;Shopper Safety Alert&#8217; feature that will notify its delivery providers of local critical incidents. The feature leverages law enforcement, social media, local news to create automated alerts.</p>
<p>Instacart delivery workers who are within the area of an incident will see the alert in the Shopper app so that they can assess the situation and potentially avoid the area. If a delivery worker is in the middle of an order, the app will automatically pause the order. Instacart says it will assess incidents and may pause operations altogether in specific regions if they pose a risk to its workers.</p>
<p>The company is also enhancing its in-app emergency calling feature that launched in May 2020. The feature allows delivery workers to contact emergency services directly within the app. The company has now partnered with emergency response data platform, RapidSOS, to give Instacart delivery workers the ability to share their geolocation and other information for faster emergency response. The feature is currently available in the U.S. and Canada. It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/doordash-rolls-out-safedash-an-in-app-security-toolkit-for-delivery-people-on-the-platform/">DoorDash recently partnered with ADT</a> to launch a similar feature that allows its delivery workers to seek emergency assistance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2235217" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235217" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235217" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png" alt="" width="1024" height="686" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png 1532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235217" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Instacart</p></div></p>
<p>Instacart has also launched new optional safety lessons that provide delivery workers with information on best practices regarding shopping, driving, and delivering. The lessons include an overview of Instacart’s shopper and community guidelines and information on how to report an incident in the Shopper app.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new safety features come a few days after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instacart-rolls-out-reduced-and-free-delivery-option-in-select-markets-deals-tab-and-more/">rolled out</a> a new delivery option, which will reduce or waive the delivery fee on orders placed more than 24 hours ahead of the scheduled delivery. It also introduced a new deals tab and a dollar store hub.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s clear that Instacart has been focused on enhancing its platform with new features, the company&#8217;s recent acquisitions also signal its plans to branch out into retail technology as well. Last month, Instacart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/instacart-acquires-caper-ai-a-smart-cart-and-instant-checkout-startup-for-350m-as-it-moves-deeper-into-physical-retail-tech/">acquired Caper AI</a>, a smart cart and instant checkout startup for $350 million, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/"> FoodStorm</a>, a SaaS order management system (OMS) for an undisclosed amount.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday episode when we niche down to a single topic, looking to expand our understanding of one particular technology trend or another. This week, we spoke about iBuying, a business operation that makes money through flipping homes. Our central question, given Zillow&#8217;s departure from the business and Opendoor&#8217;s impressive earnings, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/zillow-ibuying-exit-opendoor-offerpad/">was if the iBuying model can work</a> &#8211; and who in the world is proving it?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zillow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/opendoor-open-for-business/">made a decision</a> to get out of the iBuying market, with huge costs hanging over its head and a grip of layoffs to manage. <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> were curious what went wrong.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Y6XaU8WfNU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/opendoor-open-for-business/">Zillow may be pulling up the welcome mat, but rival Opendoor is expanding into new markets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zillow may be pulling up the welcome mat, but rival Opendoor is expanding into new markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/opendoor-open-for-business/embed/#?secret=Y6XaU8WfNU" data-secret="Y6XaU8WfNU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<ul>
<li>So we brought along <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanlawler">Ryan Lawler</a>, one of TechCrunch+&#8217;s reporting team, who has covered the space for a chat. Ryan helped us use Opendoor earnings as a comparison point &#8212; it turns out that the iBuying model <em>can</em> work, even if Zillow itself struggled with the model. (Opendoor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/a-quick-peek-into-opendoors-financial-results/">went public via a SPAC</a>, recall.)</li>
<li>We also talked about what the situation could mean for startups in the real estate market more broadly. It turns out that merely having data is not enough to make money in the housing space.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat announced earlier this year that it would add <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-brings-partner-centric-layers-to-its-social-map-used-by-250-million-people/">Layers</a> to Snap Map, making the social product more interactive. Today, the app is launching its first two layers: Memories and Explore.</p>
<p>The Snap Map has been used to show people where their friends are currently located (if they opt-in to location sharing), interesting places to visit, and what areas are most popular among Snapchatters. Now, the Memories layer will show you old Snapchats that you sent from particular places &#8212; so, if you browse your map and zoom in on Central Park, you might find a picture you took last year of a cute dog in the park. Memories are private and only available to the individual user &#8212; you can&#8217;t see friends&#8217; memories.</p>
<p>The Explore layer reimagines the heat map, which shows activity by relative volume on the Snap Map. You can tap on highlighted regions to see public photos and videos submitted by Snapchat users around the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235313" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2235662" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235662" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2235662" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="345" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png 1694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=1536,780 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235662" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snapchat</p></div></p>
<p>These layers are designed to make it easier for users to find what they&#8217;re looking for, rather than crowding a ton of information into one map. Snap&#8217;s partners like Ticketmaster and The Infatuation are also developing layers, which would show users where nearby events are happening, or what restaurants are most popular among Snapchatters. The app also added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/snapchat-adds-my-places-feature-to-snap-map-connecting-users-to-businesses/">My Places</a> feature this summer, which recommended users places to visit based on where they&#8217;ve been, where their friends have been and what places other Snapchat users visit most.</p>
<p>To access layers, users can navigate to the Snap Map and tap the button for a layers menu in the upper right corner of the map. Then, they can toggle between various layers to access what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>These features are available now for Snapchat users on iOS and Android.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SOSV, the venture capital firm known for its vertical-focused accelerators like HAX, is expanding its footprint to Bangladesh. SOSV&#8217;s Asia-focused accelerator called MOX, SBK Tech Ventures, an early-stage fund in Bangladesh, and Miaki, a Bangladesh-based digital services provider, are setting up the SM² accelerator to invest in seed-stage startups in the country.</p>
<p>Bangladesh, with a nascent internet industry but an expanding online population, has emerged as an attractive destination for venture capitalists in recent years. Sequoia made its first deal in the country last year through Sequoia Capital India; it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/shopup-raises-22-5-million-to-digitize-millions-of-mom-and-pop-shops-in-bangladesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> co-led a $22.5 million round in ShopUp</a>, a startup that helps mom and pop shops come online. Another notable deal has been grocery delivery service Chaldal&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/chaldal-bangladeshs-largest-grocery-delivery-platform-raises-10m-series-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $10 million raise</a> this year. Indonesian ride-sharing giant Go-Jek is an investor in its own counterpart for the country, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/bangladeshs-version-of-go-jek-raises-over-10m-in-a-round-led-by-go-jek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathao</a>.</p>
<p>SM² injects around $100,000 into each startup through a convertible note, with room for follow-ons, TechCrunch learned from Sonia Bashir Kabir, founder of SBK. The accelerator has already picked three startups for its inaugural batch that is starting in November.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Funding for the accelerator comes from all three partners, while SBK will also provide on-the-ground support for the portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Like many investors around the world, SM² recognizes how COVID-19 has accelerated people&#8217;s need for digital tools in their everyday life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology has always enabled people and companies to be more productive but post COVID the world witnessed how technology played an instrumental role in becoming the great equalizer,&#8221; said Kabir. &#8220;I am bullish about Bangladeshi tech startups which aim to solve problems of the masses.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plastics are bad, m&#8217;kay, and a lot of the world is pretty god-awful at reducing, re-using and recycling. Single-use plastics are among the worst environmental evils out there, and <a href="https://www.zume.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zume</a> is leaping to the rescue. The company is working to create a sustainable, viable and economic alternative to a lot of the plastics we currently use. This also marks an acceleration of Zume, finding product-market fit as one of the most remarkable startup pivots we&#8217;ve ever seen &#8212; Zume started its life as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/28/zume-pizza-adds-extra-automation-as-it-rolls-out-to-new-cities/">a company creating pizza-making robots</a>, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/zume-adds-a-robotic-arm-to-its-automated-pizza-kitchen/">some pretty impressive robotic pizza-making robot arms,</a> before its co-founder Julia Collins <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/zume-co-founder-goes-from-pizza-to-climate-friendly-food-with-2-7-million-in-funding/">left to make climate-friendly food</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/25/zume-looks-to-life-beyond-pizza/">the whole company eventually changed its focus</a>.</p>
<p>It seems as if the company&#8217;s culture of climate focus didn&#8217;t leave with Collins, however &#8212; and Zume has been making a name for itself in plant-based alternatives to plastics since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/zume-buys-packaging-company-with-eyes-on-plant-based-plastic-alternative/">its acquisition of Pivot back in 2019</a>. Now, the company is declaring all-out war on plastics with an aggressive scale-up operation and a brand new partnership with industry giant <a href="https://global.abb/group/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABB</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;By 2050, we estimate that the world’s oceans will have more plastic than fish, so it is critical that we move everyone away from single-use plastics,&#8221; said Alex Garden, chairman and CEO of Zume, succinctly capturing both why they are solving a problem worth solving, and the urgency of the solution. The company recently inked a deal with ABB to provide an army of robots to help it fulfill its mission, although neither Zume nor ABB are eager to disclose the financial details of the deal.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235385" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>ABB will supply robotic cells that will enable Zume’s production of sustainable packaging on a global scale, helping to reduce reliance on single-use plastics. ABB will integrate and install more than 1,000 molded fiber manufacturing cells (MFC) &#8212; including up to 2,000 robots at Zume customer sites worldwide over the next five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Automating production of Zume’s sustainable packaging with ABB robots makes this a viable and economic alternative to single-use plastics. With Zume, we have the potential to remove trillions of pieces of plastic from the global marketplace, preserving scarce resources and supporting a low carbon world,&#8221; said Sami Atiya, president of ABB Robotics &amp; Discrete Automation. &#8220;Today, robotic automation is expanding possibilities, making the world more sustainable through more efficient production that reduces energy use, emissions and production waste. Our collaboration showcases what is possible when organizations that are committed to pursuing a low-carbon society work together.&#8221;</p>

Excellent work, Judas. <strong>Photo:</strong> ABB</p></div></p>
<p>Not a moment too late &#8212; the UN Environment Program (UNEP) has <a href="https://www.unep.org/interactive/beat-plastic-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified single-use plastics as one of the most serious environmental issues we face today</a>, with almost 60% of all plastics produced since the 1950s ending up in landfills or in nature. It doesn&#8217;t help that a lot of plastics aren&#8217;t nearly as recyclable as you&#8217;d think, as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/912150085/waste-land" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR&#8217;s Planet Money explored recently</a>: it doesn&#8217;t make sense economically or environmentally to recycle plastic a lot of the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shifting some of our use to compostable, bio-degradable materials makes a lot of sense. To that end, Zume and ABB installed a pilot project at Satia Industries, one of India’s largest wood and agro-based paper manufacturers, creating a facility of 10 manufacturing cells that will process 20 tons of wheat straw daily creating 100% compostable packaging for a range of industries. Unlike plastic, plant-based material is 100% biodegradable and simply breaks down after use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our work with Zume and ABB enables Satia Industries to meet and exceed the expectations of our clients for high-performing, affordable and reliable products that are sustainably manufactured and easily composted,&#8221; said Dr. Ajay Satia, CMD Satia Industries. &#8220;Besides adding significant value to the company, we are able to support the planet by providing sustainable solutions to help our customers transition to more modern, reliable and customized products compared to those they use today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.centered.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centered</a> is an app that&#8217;s designed to help you find your flow throughout the day, guard your calendar so you can get some work done and add a personal assistant to help keep you on track. The app lets you do a virtual hang with others trying to get some work done, and plays some soothing beats to trick your brain into getting work done. The company just launched its product and raised $3.9 million to bring some sanity back to your workday.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever done, well, anything at all and enjoyed what you&#8217;ve been doing, you&#8217;ve probably experienced being in a &#8220;flow state&#8221; &#8212; or &#8220;in the zone&#8221; as some people call it. The problem is that a lot of office environments are set up in ways that make it impossible to get to that state of mind. Some workers resort to coming in extra early or staying late, working over the weekend or pulling other silly stunts to get things done. And if you&#8217;ve ever uttered a sentence like &#8220;I like coming in at 7 am, it is so nice here before the phones start ringing,&#8221; well, I&#8217;m talking about you.</p>
<p>The app offers virtual co-working sessions where your team shows up as little thumbnails via video feed. The idea is that if your co-workers can see (but not hear or interact with) you, you&#8217;re less likely to futz on your phone or saunter off for your sixth cup of coffee when you&#8217;re meant to be reviewing code. The app also includes &#8220;Flow Music,&#8221; ambient, slow-BPM tunes that help convince your brain that it&#8217;s time to work. There&#8217;s also a personal assistant, which the founder describes as Siri for Productivity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234386" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Remember that feeling of being on an airplane, putting headphones on, and suddenly there are no distractions at all? Suddenly you are writing the most words you ever have in the shortest amount of time because there&#8217;s nobody around to bug you. That&#8217;s the experience we are trying to replicate with Centered. When you start a flow session, you&#8217;ll be greeted by Noah. The bot will guide you along with your work,&#8221; explains Ulf Schwekendiek, founder and CEO of Centered. &#8220;The assistant will let you know when you are halfway through your allotted time, or nudge you if it notices that you are getting distracted. It&#8217;s like having a parent noticing that you&#8217;re on your Game Boy when you were meant to be doing homework, and reminds you that you&#8217;re meant to be doing something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company today announced that it raised $3.9 million led by <a href="https://uncorkcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uncork Capital</a> and <a href="https://yes.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yes VC</a>, with support from JLL Spark, Shrug Capital, Basement Fund, AVG Basement and Remote First, as well as a cabal of angel investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funding unlocks a few things. It&#8217;s not just me alone, coding, designing, doing everything with contractors anymore,&#8221; says Schwekendiek. &#8220;We just started staffing our engineering, design and content teams. We can enter larger content deals, get better music and create better voice-overs. But the really interesting part is our data. We&#8217;re just starting to unlock the data we have access to &#8212; we know how people work, and nobody else does.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2234820" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234820" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2234820" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png 2780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=1536,862 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=2048,1149 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2234820" class="wp-caption-text">The Centered app in action. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Centered</p></div></p>
<p>The founder assures me that they are handling the data in aggregate, anonymously and in a secure manner. The company didn&#8217;t disclose the valuation for this round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thousands of people have used our product, and early users are finishing their work an average of 30% faster than they estimated &#8212; and report being happier and less stressed as a result,&#8221; says Schwekendiek. &#8220;We’re seeing that our top users spend between three and five hours a day as they use <span class="il">Centered</span> as their operating system for productivity. We have also found that after Week 1 we have almost 100% user retention.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Way back in March, autonomous tractor maker Monarch announced a $20 million Series A. Now, a mere eight months later, the company is tripling the round, with a $61 million Series B. This latest raise is led by sustainable food fund Astanor Ventures, with participation from CNH Industrial, At One Ventures and Trimble Ventures.</p>
<p>The Bay Area-based firm says the funding will go toward scaling manufacturing and sales for its self-titled electric tractor. The system was introduced this year, with a pilot at a local vineyard. That was one of 15 initial pilots, ahead of a planned delivery of production units in Q4 of this year.</p>
<p>Monarch’s clearly striking while the iron is hot on the funding front, as the pandemic has accelerated labor shortages on farms across the U.S. Many farm owners have been looking toward automated and robotic solutions, though current offerings run the gamut when it comes to deployment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234158" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Fruit and vegetable farmers have long been ignored in the electrification and automation movement, and that’s why the Monarch platform is built with them in mind,” CEO and co-founder Praveen Penmetsa said in a statement. “Due to the ever-increasing labor challenges, sustainability concerns, and food traceability and scrutiny issues farmers face, we have experienced great demand for the unique solutions Monarch Tractor offers.”</p>
<p>Along with the new funding infusion, the company is announcing plans to extend pilots globally, to South America, Europe and Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was way back in 2017 that the company that became Ultraleap (Ultrahaptics, as was) demonstrated at TechCrunch Disrupt a technology that pioneered ultrasound to replicate the sense of touch. The impressive &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/ultrahaptics/">demonstration</a> took the crowd by storm.</p>
<p>It was quite the demo (see the video below). The underlying technology was based on post-graduate research from inventor &#8211; and still CEO &#8211; Tom Carter. Ultrahaptics went on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/ultrahaptics-raises-23-million-for-its-invisible-touchless-interfaces/">raise</a> $23 million, begin to interest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/ultrahaptics-launching/">car companies</a>, and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/once-poised-to-kill-the-mouse-and-keyboard-leap-motion-plays-its-final-hand/">absorb</a> the much-hyped Leap Motion, which, it turns out, was a match made in heaven, by uniting both <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/tracking/">hand tracking</a> and <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/haptics/">mid-air haptics</a>.</p>
<p>Ultraleap has now raised an $82 million (£60 million) Series D funding, led by a combination of Tencent, British Patient Capital’s &#8216;Future Fund: Breakthrough&#8217;, and CMB International. Also participating were existing shareholders Mayfair Equity Partners and IP Group plc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235197" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Commenting, Tom Carter, Ultraleap CEO, said recent chatter about the VR-based &#8220;Metaverse&#8221; from companies like Facebook, as well as the shift to touchless interfaces brought about by the pandemic, had helped its fund-raising.</p>
<p>“The metaverse concept is not new to Ultraleap,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has always been our mission to remove boundaries between physical and digital worlds. The pandemic has accelerated the rise of the term as more people now understand the power of enhancing the physical world with digital elements. For Ultraleap, this new era is not constrained to VR headsets. Like the internet, it is a reality we will interact with, in all parts of life: at home, in the office, in cars, or out in public. Our aim with this Series D raise is to accelerate the transition to the primary interface – your hands – because there are no physical controllers, buttons or touchscreens in anyone&#8217;s vision of the metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultraleap’s fifth-generation hand tracking platform, dubbed Gemini, is clearly heading towards a number of devices. It’s already built into multiple platforms, camera systems, and third-party hardware including Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 chipset and Varjo’s VR-3 and XR-3 headsets.</p>
<p>Ultraleap’s plan is to take Gemini to different operating systems, increase investment in tooling / R&amp;D and let developers run away with their imaginations on how to apply the technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, one of the key drivers of this touchless technology is of course The Great Pandemic. Like, who wants to touch anything anymore, right?!</p>
<p>Thus, companies like PepsiCo and Lego are already using Ultraleap’s technology in public interfaces.</p>
<p>And as was hinted at back in 2017, automakers are looking to make the ‘in-cabin experience’ a real thing. So Ultraleap is already working with  DS Automobiles and Hosiden on new mid-air haptics experiences.</p>
<p>Carter expanded on these moves on a call, explaining that the potential for user interfaces that work inside VR-based metaverses are the vision for  Ultraleap’s technology: “Admittedly, the metaverse is a very buzzy thing at the moment, but it really does describe the thing that we&#8217;ve been working towards: removing the barriers between humans and virtual content.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve raised this round to help transition everyone towards that optimum interface of your hands, across all of the markets that we target. So on XR, we&#8217;ve launched Gemini, and in the last few weeks, a new generation of hand tracking, which is getting super rave reviews. It’s really now time to scale out-of-home. Pepsi&#8217;s deployment had 85% user preference and parity with touchscreens in terms of completion times for putting your orders through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there’s automotive. He said: “UX is the new horsepower&#8217;. We&#8217;re still driving, but we are moving towards  being much more focused on the experience within the cabin… whether you&#8217;re working, working, being entertained, or other sorts of similarly Metaverse-like activities within your car.”</p>
<p>He said it turns out that there&#8217;s a very big safety benefit in using these mid-air interfaces over trying to use a touchscreen, where you have to take your eyes off the road: “It reduces the mental load on the driver by about 20%, by reducing the number of glances off the road that the driver takes. Transitioning to that interface makes the driving experience safer. And then once you have that interface and people are used to interacting in this way, it makes the transition to the future world easier.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the 2017 demonstration:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here’s a pleasant &#8212; and frankly unexpected &#8212; update from Apple. The company<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"> just announced Self Service Repair</a>, a new program designed to let users perform common repairs on devices at home. Through the program, users with damaged devices will be sent “Apple genuine” tools and components &#8212; same as the ones they use at the Genius Bar.</p>
<p>The company will also be offering up online repair manuals (text, not video), accessible through the new Apple Self Service Repair Online Store. The system is similar to the one the company rolled out for Independent Repair Providers (of which there are currently 2,800 in the U.S. plus 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers), beginning with the iPhone 12 and 13, focused on display, battery and camera fixes. A similar service for M1Macs will be launching &#8220;soon&#8221; after.</p>
<p>“Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,” COO Jeff Williams said in a release tied to the announcement. “In the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we’re providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple hasn’t listed specific prices yet, but customers will get a credit toward the final fee if they mail in the damaged component for recycling. When it launches in the U.S. in early-2022, the store will offer some 200 parts and tools to consumers. Performing these tasks at home won&#8217;t void the device&#8217;s warranty, though you might if you manage to further damage the product in the process of repairing it &#8212; so hew closely to those manuals. After reviewing that, you can purchase parts from the Apple Self Service Repair Online Store.</p>
<p>The news comes during a time of increasing push for right to repair legislation that has been opposed by some of the biggest names in consumer electronics. The Library of Congress recently <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23311.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved exemptions</a> to the DMCA that blocked user repair. Even the president has <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/07/14/president-bidens-right-to-repair-order-needs-strengthening-to-aid-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten in on the act</a>, following a May letter to Congress from the FTC, which noted, &#8220;To address unlawful repair restrictions, the FTC will pursue appropriate law enforcement and regulatory options, as well as consumer education, consistent with our statutory authority. The Commission also stands ready to work with legislators, either at the state or federal level, in order to ensure that consumers have choices when they need to repair products that they purchase and own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advocates of increased repairability cite numerous concerns, including lowering the pricing burden of planned obsolescence, as well as growing global concerns around e-waste &#8212; the latter of which has been a cause championed by Apple over the past several years. As smartphone tech has become more advanced, the devices have become increasingly more difficult to repair at home. It&#8217;s a long way from the days of swappable batteries &#8212; concerns that have given rise to a boutique crop of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/fairphone-4/">products like Fairphone</a>, which put user repairability out front.</p>
<p>Apple’s new program will be rolling out to additional countries later next year. The company is clearly still encouraging users to bring their devices in for repair at a licensed shop when circumstances allow (particularly in the case of those covered by AppleCare+), but for the many who&#8217;d rather take matters into their own hands, this is a nice a step.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://noissue.co/">Noissue</a>, a New Zealand-based global packaging platform, wants to make sustainable packaging accessible to businesses of all sizes. Everything the company offers, from custom tissue paper and cards to totes, stickers and tape, is 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable, and with low order minimums, it&#8217;s not just the big players who can afford to buy in bulk that are able to meet their sustainable packaging goals.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On Wednesday, the startup announced the close of a $10 million Series A financing round led by Felix Capital. Noissue, which mainly operates in the U.S., intends to use the funds to grow its global team, invest in the technology that powers its platform and localize its supply chain, according to Josh Bowden, CEO and co-founder of noissue. The startup relies on a network of manufacturing partners and suppliers based in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Europe, China, Vietnam and Australia, and it works with its logistics partners to offset carbon emissions related to shipping, the company says. </span></p>
<p>One of the massive downsides of an uptick in e-commerce and the boom of a creator economy is the corresponding packaging involved. Every time you get the dopamine hit of seeing a package delivered to your door, there&#8217;s also the corresponding pang of guilt as you open it and pull the plastic intestines out of the box. A <a href="https://oceana.org/reports/amazons-plastic-problem-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 2020 report</a> from Oceana, a nonprofit ocean advocacy organization, found in that year, e-commerce worldwide, and Amazon in particular, generated over 2.3 million tons of plastic packaging waste. The report projected that by 2025, there&#8217;d be more than 4.5 million tons. Ordering goods online isn&#8217;t going to go anywhere, but as more companies set sustainability goals, noissue is primed to capture what may now be a market niche, but may soon become a necessity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235374" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the past year, we’ve seen an acceleration of the growth of the creator economy and ecommerce, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards a more sustainable and mindful lifestyle,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frederic Court</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-founder of Felix Capital, in a statement. “noissue sits at the intersection of these trends, and we’re excited to be their partner to fully realize noissue’s potential to build a category-defining business in a large and growing market, leveraging their platform business model.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The team at noissue came up with the idea for sustainable packaging while starting a sustainable eyewear brand that makes frames from waste materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it came to do the packaging, it obviously had to be sustainable, as well, to be on-brand,&#8221; Bowden told TechCrunch. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">It proved challenging to find sustainable packaging that could be customized in the low minimums we wanted it in. We ended up sourcing the packaging ourselves and it turned out our eyewear stockists, who were small retailers, were just as interested in the packaging as they were the eyewear! After a bit of research, we realized there were very few places small businesses could go to get sustainable packaging that showcased their brand, so noissue was created to service this need.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Founded in 2017, noissue now serves more than 80,000 customers after growing 200% across North America during the pandemic. The company creates made-to-order, custom products for a range of industries, from apparel and home to beauty, wellness and subscription boxes, through to pets, plants and outdoor goods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of the funds from the Series A will also go toward bringing new products to market, says Bowden. For example, noissue has recently launched compostable kraft mailers, recycled hangtags and reusable drawstring bags &#8212; all driven by customer demand. Noissue&#8217;s biggest customer group is retail and e-commerce, followed by hospitality and &#8220;makers.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re extremely fortunate to have a diverse range of customers in a range of industries who use noissue packaging, and we’re really focused on continuing to deliver a world-class experience, a curated product range, and only release in-demand products for our customers,&#8221; said Bowden. &#8220;Our customers drive our product roadmap by voting or suggesting new products as part of our customer-community, which means we are only releasing products that they’ve asked for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Noissue&#8217;s team is based in seven countries and works with creators and brands including <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mon Coeur, Oak + Fort, Kuyichi, Coalatree, Aesop, McCormick &amp; Company and Davines, according to the company. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Netlify.com">Netlify</a> came early to the idea of separating front-end design and back-end business processes on websites. It embraced <a href="https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/">Jamstack</a> and microservices when those technologies were not well understood. It&#8217;s a fairly common way to build a website today, but it wasn&#8217;t always the case when they started.</p>
<p>Perhaps that knowledge and understanding is what attracted investors to the company. Today, Netlify announced a $105 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation. It comes 18 months after the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/netfily-nabs-53m-series-c-as-micro-services-approach-to-web-development-grows/">$53 million C round.</a></p>
<p>Bessemer Venture Partners led today&#8217;s round with participation from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Bond, EQT Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Mango Capital and Menlo Ventures. The company has now raised close to $200 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235315" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Matt Biilmann, Netlify CEO and co-founder, said that in the early days, they had to educate and convince people that the change in architecture that Netlify was trying to bring about was a real thing. Today, it&#8217;s a different story.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that architectural shift is absolutely happening, and is only accelerating. And that&#8217;s in the background of why we also raised this next round to really accelerate that, to fuel the developer revolution and advance [this] modern way [of developing websites], and to also tackle the next set of challenges. That starts with when it becomes evident that this shift in architecture is real and lasting,&#8221; Biilmann told me.</p>
<p>He said that the goal now is to tackle the next level of friction, which involves managing multiple APIs and how developers juggle all of the dependencies between these different elements. That&#8217;s why the company recently bought early-stage startup <a href="https://www.onegraph.com/">OneGraph</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/onegraph">Y Combinator Summer 2018 cohort</a>, which built a solution based on <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> to connect these different APIs together on the back end.</p>
<p>&#8220;[OneGraph technology] is going to be an important part of our next stage of product development,&#8221; Biilmann explained. &#8220;How can we help teams tackle that complexity of so many different APIs and services and make the experience of building for the Jamstack really feel like a unified application experience while taking full advantage of this new world where there is an API for everything and where your UI is decoupled from all these different parts.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company boasts more than 2 million developers using the platform, although many are using the free tier. It took the company five years to reach 1 million users and just a year to double that, so things are moving quickly.</p>
<p>Netlify currently has 200 employees, with plans to double that in the next year as it puts this new capital to work. Company co-founder Christian Bach said that Netlify has a diverse customer base and it&#8217;s important for the company&#8217;s employees to reflect that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has always been extremely important for us just because of the fact that we are an enterprise global company that caters to anyone that builds for the web. So that&#8217;s a very diverse target audience, and in order for us to have a sufficiently intelligent organization, we need to be diverse as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Netlify also announced a $10 million Jamstack Innovation fund to help encourage and support innovation in the Jamstack ecosystem with checks in the $100,000 range. In addition, it is setting aside another $1 million to invest in adjacent open source tooling for the ecosystem.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Elude launched on iOS, but has plans to launch a web version and Android version in the coming months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel app <a href="https://elude.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elude</a> is on a roll, announcing an additional $3 million on the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/?tpcc=ECTW2020">$2.1 million funding round</a> and launch in August.</p>
<p>Alex Simon, CEO, and Frankie Scerbo, CMO, got the idea for the Los Angeles-based startup three years ago after bonding over a love of spontaneous travel, but not finding enough options within their budget.</p>
<p>Elude, a travel discovery mobile app, is a budget-first search engine that shows people how far their money will take them. The platform’s personalized onboarding experience customizes trip packages and offers future travel suggestions based on those preferences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235045" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new $3 million round was led by ATX Venture Partners, with Mucker Capital, Unicorn Ventures, Upfront Scout Fund, StartupO, Grayson Capital, Gaingels, Maccabee Ventures and Flight VC participating. This brings Elude’s total funding to more than $5 million.</p>
<p>“We felt momentum on the heels of our launch in August and that has continued,” Simon said in an interview. “Current investors spoke to us about our plan and what we wanted to accomplish and were supportive of that.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UkrkJTpjyo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/">Elude raises $2.1M to show spontaneous travelers the best destinations for their budgets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elude raises $2.1M to show spontaneous travelers the best destinations for their budgets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/embed/#?secret=UkrkJTpjyo" data-secret="UkrkJTpjyo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Indeed, with millennials spending <a href="https://www.thewanderingrv.com/millennials-travel-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $200 billion annually</a> on travel, Elude’s goal is to reduce the hours of scrolling in search of a trip and more time actively booking vacations. Whereas competitors may show flights only or hotels only, Elude produces flight and hotel packages.</p>
<p>The latest funding will go toward hiring engineers to assist with feature rollouts. Elude launched on iOS, but has plans to launch a web version and Android version in the coming months. Other features in the works include better personalization approaches to maximize recommendations and expanding beyond flight and hotel. The company is also expanding its marketing and will introduce some paid advertising.</p>
<p>Over 25,000 users have signed up to use the app so far, with many of the searches coming from the coasts, Colorado and Texas, Scerbo noted.</p>
<p>In choosing investors to be included in the round, the co-founders said most of them had dabbled in travel before, and with demand for the industry coming back following a halt during the pandemic, the number of travelers is creeping back up to where it was in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It shows momentum behind what we are doing,” Simon added. “Before, we were showing proof of concept, but now we are showing that demand and conversation is going on.”</p>
<p>With Elude attracting users from the Texas market, the co-founders said they were intrigued by ATX Venture Partners to lead the round. Chris Shonk, co-founder and partner at ATX, said his firm was equally attracted to the company.</p>
<p>ATX Venture Partners likes to see companies doing innovative things in industries that have survived, like travel, where there had been consolidation among venture-backed companies previously.</p>
<p>Now there are sectors, like what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/the-guild-which-turns-apartments-into-short-term-rentals-has-nabbed-25-million-in-series-b-funding/">Guild</a> and Sonder are doing in alternative accommodations, and boutique discovery engines like Elude.</p>
<p>“From day one, Elude wanted to have a different approach where the community, content, brand and vibe were edgy and fun,” Shonk said. “This resonates well with the younger demographic, who have spent a huge amount of money traveling relative to other groups.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that the future of travel will have to be redefined: It used to be about just business or just pleasure, but today, the answer is both or neither. With people now working from anywhere, the future of work is a grey line between work and pleasure, and startups are working to solve that.</p>
<p>Though the redefinition has only begun, Shonk believes that the travel industry is full of passionate founders “who have an emotional mission to go out and solve something they experienced as a traveler, but they are not thinking big enough and that is fine.”</p>
<p>“The whole industry is hyper inquisitive, and many of the startups were gobbled up by Booking.com or Expedia,” he added. “There are now throngs of $25 million to $50 million companies being created here, but not a lot of $1 billion companies. Frankie and Alex saw it differently, and are bold in vision and planning what to do and put in place. They are able to take this venture money and create a $1 billion company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://jiko.io/">Jiko</a>, a fintech startup that uses customer deposits to purchase short-term treasury bills, announced its first </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/baas-served-three-ways-a-closer-look-at-a-rapidly-evolving-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banking-as-a-service (BaaS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> client today. It will partner with <a href="https://euphoria.lgbt/">Euphoria</a>, a technology suite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the transgender community that helps alleviate the struggles associated with gender transition, to launch a banking app called Bliss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2-6 million people in the United States identify as transgender, and 34% lack identification to match their gender, making it harder for them to access banking products, the company wrote in its press release. Most banks’ compliance processes do not accommodate individuals in this situation, but Jiko worked with Euphoria to customize the “know your customer” process for Bliss to allow users to open accounts with alternative forms of verification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Official identification presents an enormous challenge for transgender individuals,” Euphoria founder and CEO Robbi Katherine Anthony told TechCrunch in an email. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235243" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes time, resources, and in some cases the right laws to update your legal documents. If you’re in the process of updating your documents, that creates the opportunity for mismatches to be scrutinized by banks, and that could result in someone not being able to open an account,” Anthony wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony noted that Euphoria got connected to Jiko through one of its investors, who is friends with Jiko cofounder Rocky Motwani. From that initial conversation, a partnership emerged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Euphoria estimates that aligning with a traditional bank to build a platform for its community would have taken 12 to 18 months of implementation, whereas Jiko was able to help them launch Bliss in just a few months, per the press release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move aligns with Jiko’s </span><a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/digital-bank-jiko-accelerates-banking-as-a-service-strategy/609498/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intended pivot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> away from consumer services and toward B2B offerings. It charges partners a flat monthly fee for each account. Each account holds customer funds in government-backed treasury bills, allowing its account holders to spend these funds real-time through debit transactions. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind Jiko’s construct is to provide, for one of the safest possible risk levels, with full spend capability, at the best rate available. And the instrument that historically provides this risk-return level is the treasury bill,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiko CEO and co-founder Stephane Lintner told TechCrunch in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Euphoria is Jiko’s first BaaS client, Lintner said that Jiko has a robust pipeline. The company is in conversations with remittance platforms in the Latino community, and has seen surging demand from corporations and crypto companies that want to store cash, according to Lintner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great part about our core product is that it’s the same for everyone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks, community and lifestyle apps require mostly card issuance and retail accounts. But a very large corporate treasury platform with Fortune 500 companies would also use the same API to open accounts for its corporate clients and help them store their daily liquidity,” Lintner wrote.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getnexar.com/">Nexar</a>, a company best-known for its line of smart dash cams, has raised $53 million in a Series D financing round led by Qumra Capital. The funds will be used, in part, to scale its “digital twin” service built off crowdsourced dash cam footage for automotive OEMs and cities.</p>
<p>The round also saw participation from State Farm Ventures, Catalyst, Banca Generali, Valor and previous investors Atreides Management, Corner Ventures, Regah Ventures and Aleph.</p>
<p>“We had that vision of when we started Nexar of being the Google of the physical world,” co-founder and CEO Eran Shir said. “We believe that over time, this will become more and more a necessity, as more and more machines and algorithms require data about the world.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235272" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Nexar’s first foray into more fully pursuing that project was with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/nexars-live-map-is-like-street-view-with-pictures-from-5-minutes-ago/">&#8220;Live Map&#8221;</a> that it launched back in 2019. The service provides real-time street footage and uses computer vision to mark construction, street signs and other features for users. Since that time, Nexar has introduced more layers and features to the service. The company, which was founded in 2015, now captures 150 million miles of imagery each month.</p>
<p>The recent funds will be used to increase the availability of the data platform across more locations and improve the “digital twin” product such that information is updated within seconds of a dash cam detecting a new feature, like a pothole. The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada is already using Nexar’s CityStream platform to reduce traffic from work zones, for example.</p>
<p>Features could also help cities after natural disasters in identifying which roads are accessible, or which roads have been plowed in the winter, Shir said.</p>
<p>But there could be a use case for automotive companies as well, Shir suggested. “If you are an OEM and you want to enable features like Autopilot or Supercruise, you want to know that in a certain stretch of road it&#8217;s clear, there&#8217;s no interruption, no construction. And you want to know on the other hand, if there is construction, when it&#8217;s finished so you can re-enable those features.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nexar’s data could also be used to train AI models used in autonomous vehicle systems, by identifying edge cases, collisions and uncommon road features.</p>
<p>“When you look at where cars are going in the next three, four, five years, they&#8217;re all pushing the envelope of what is possible from the perspective of autonomy, and those use cases will require a new type of mapping,” Shir said. “The Google Maps level […] of mapping just doesn&#8217;t cut it for where we are heading.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Settle extends payment terms for a customers’ vendors, paying them with Settle's money so the company can pay them back 30 to 120 days later.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cashflow management startup <a href="https://www.settle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Settle</a> announced its second round of funding in five months, this time $60 million in Series B financing as it aims to carve out a niche in the <a href="https://www.llrpartners.com/growth-bit/fintech-trends-2019-b2b-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 trillion business-to-business payments market</a>.</p>
<p>Settle was founded by Alek Koenig in 2019, after spending four years as head of credit at Affirm, to provide alternative lending to businesses. It combines payments, financing and accounting integrations into one tool so that brands can scale faster.</p>
<p>This has become more relevant as the global pandemic created <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/startups/dtc-briefing-how-supply-chain-shortages-are-impacting-e-commerce-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supply chain issues</a> that plague many brands that are selling out quickly and then experiencing inventory shortages that extend beyond the typical 30-day and 45-day pay terms. Settle takes over those upfront costs for vendors and provides a financing plan for brands.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235287" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The really unique thing that we do is extend payment terms where we’ll pay the customers’ vendors with Settle money, and the company can pay us back 30 to 120 days later,” Koenig told TechCrunch. “They can use revenue from those purchases like inventory to pay us back.”</p>
<p>Settle is working with customers like Italic, Huron, Brightland, Branch and Better Booch. Rebecca Zhou, founder of Soft Services, said via a written statement that Settle was “a game changer” for her skincare company so that she could finance its inventory purchases to continue growing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest investment was led by Ribbit Capital, with participation from Kleiner Perkins, Caffeinated Capital, Activant Capital and Stripes. It comes five months after Settle announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/settle-raises-15m-from-kleiner-perkins-to-give-e-commerce-companies-more-working-capital/">$15 million Series A round</a>, led by Kleiner Perkins, to give the company a total of $100 million raised to date.</p>
<p>The company wasn’t planning on raising additional funding, but between customer growth, volume, payments and lending, Koenig said it became clear that the company needed to think about going after additional funding. It also gave Koenig an opportunity to bring on Nick Shalek, general partner of Ribbit Capital, as a member of the company’s board.</p>
<p>The e-commerce space is only growing, even through COVID-19, with every business starting to think about e-commerce as core to its business, or at least a part of it, Shalek said. Rather than spend more time on back-office work, Settle enables them to prioritize what drives their business growth.</p>
<p>“I invested because of the team — Alek and Shane (Moriah, CTO) are terrific, but also have the right background and experience to tackle the problem,” he added. “They have a deep understanding of risk and the capital market. You could see a huge pull from the market, and every time we could check in, the company was growing by multiples, attracting talent and was benefitting from the tailwind in the e-commerce market.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, so far in 2021 Settle has increased its revenues 20 times and grew to 500 merchants since last summer.</p>
<p>The additional capital will enable the company to introduce more products quickly and hire, primarily engineers. Koenig expects to grow from 40 to 100 employees by next year.</p>
<p>“This equity helps us unlock debt, which is our oxygen,” he added. “Just given the increased customer demand, we are able to raise more debt and build our future roadmap.”</p>
