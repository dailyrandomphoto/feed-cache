<p>The big micromobility news of the week revolves around <strong>Spin</strong>, and it&#8217;s not about whether or not Ford is spinning out the company; they kept a pretty tight lip on that, but clearly big changes are happening. Co-founder Derrick Ko is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/">stepping down as CEO</a> and moving into an advisory role, along with his other two co-founders Zaizhuang Cheng and Euwyn Poon. In Ko&#8217;s place is Ben Bear, who previously served as CBO of Spin.</p>
<p>Along with this news came a flurry of other announcements, but it makes sense to start with Spin&#8217;s latest public strategy for winning the e-scooter business. Spin is actively seeking out limited vendor permits with cities. In other words, the company doesn&#8217;t want to see its cities messing around with other operators. Spin is seeking exclusive partnerships and is prepared to better itself to get them. It&#8217;s positioning itself as the most desirable for cities as it shares even more news&#8230;</p>
<p>If Spin wants to have a kind of deal that Lyft-owned CitiBike has with NYC, then it needs to bring more to the table. It&#8217;s starting with e-bikes. 5,000 of them, to be specific, in the coming months, starting with Providence, RI in June and spreading outward into a few other mid-tier cities over the summer.</p>
<p>Spin is also flexing its tech that will help make its scooters safe and reliable &#8212; just what a city wants in a long-term commitment. This week, it brought its Drover AI-equipped scooters to Milwaukee (with plans to launch in Miami, Seattle and Santa Monica, as well) that are equipped to detect sidewalk and bike lane riding and validate parking. Seattle, Santa Monica and Boise, Idaho will soon be graced by Spin&#8217;s new S-200, a three-wheeled adaptive scooter built with Tortoise&#8217;s repositioning software that allows a remote operator to move scooters out of gutters or into more dense urban areas.</p>
<h3>Tier gets some more money</h3>
<p>Berlin-based <strong>Tier Mobility</strong>, which recently won a London permit, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/">raised $60 million</a> so it can expand its fleet of vehicles and battery charging networks. Technically, it&#8217;s a loan. The asset-backed financing comes from Goldman Sachs.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s talk about bikes</h3>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong> has got a new e-bike piloting this month, starting in San Francisco, then Chicago and New York. It&#8217;ll be dropping the sleek, white bikes with soft purple LEDs at random around the city for people to test out. TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/taking-lyfts-new-e-bike-for-a-spin/">Brian Heater gave it a spin</a>, and his general consensus was, <em>Yeah, it&#8217;s a good bike. Can&#8217;t complain.</em></p>
<p>While Lyft may have anti-theft protection on its e-bikes, the rest of us are not so lucky. According to market research company NPD Group, we saw a 63% YOY growth for bike sales in June. <a href="https://bikeindex.org/">Bike Index</a>, a national bike registry group, tells us that the number of bikes stolen has seen similar increases. The number of bikes reported stolen to the service was a little over 10,000 between April and September, compared to nearly 6,000 during the same period in the previous year. That&#8217;s an uptick of nearly 68%. So, when are apartment complexes going to be forced to build bike storage rather than car parks?</p>
<h3>Best cities for biking</h3>
<p>If you are going to risk theft and bike around, you&#8217;ll want to do it in one of the cities <a href="https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/ratings">PeopleForBikes</a> just announced are the best for biking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Topping this year&#8217;s ratings in the United States are Brooklyn, NY; Berkeley, CA and Provincetown, MA (each ranking first in the large, medium and small U.S. city categories, respectively). Top international performers include Canberra and Alice Springs in Australia; Utrecht and Groningen in the Netherlands and Gatineau, Longueuil and Montreal in Canada, all located in the province of Quebec.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biking is not all about fun and commuting. For some of us, it&#8217;s work. <strong>URB-E</strong>, the compact container delivery network that wants to replace trucks with small electric bikes, has announced PackItFresh as its final-mile refrigeration provider. PackItFresh&#8217;s totes can keep food at safe temperatures for up to 24 hours, yet another reason supermarkets need to be nixing the delivery trucks in favor of these more sustainable alternatives.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hesitate to put this one under deal of the week, because, well, the deal ain&#8217;t done. But it is interesting, and this is my show, so here we are. I&#8217;m talking about Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company, and a potential merger with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the tl;dr for those who didn&#8217;t <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">catch my Friday story</a>. Several sources within the financial sector told me that Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the newest special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson. It appears the valuation is going to be somewhere in the $12 billion neighborhood. The deal is expected to be announced as early as next week. I should add that both Aurora and Reinivent declined to comment.</p>
<p>The Hoffman, Pincus, Thompson trio, who are bullish on a concept that they call &#8220;venture capital at scale,&#8221; have formed three SPACs, or blank-check companies. Two of those SPACs have announced mergers with private companies. Reinvent Technology Partners announced a deal in February to merge with the electric vertical take off and landing company Joby Aviation, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Reinvent Technology Partners Z merged with home insurance startup Hippo.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the deal could fall apart? Sure. But my sources tell me that it has progressed far enough that it would take a significant issue to derail the agreement. One more note: there is the tricky issue of Hoffman and Reinvent&#8217;s existing relationship with Aurora. Hoffman is a board member of Aurora and Reinvent is an investor. While Hoffman and Reinvent showing up on two sides of a SPAC deal would be unusual, it is not unprecedented. Connie Loizos&#8217;s accompanying article digs into the increasing cases of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/um-where-is-the-sec-when-it-comes-to-spacs-and-conflicts-of-interest/">conflicts of interest</a> popping up in SPAC deals.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Getir</strong>, the Istanbul-based grocery delivery app, raised $550m in new funding. This latest injection of capital, which tripled its valuation to $7.5 billion, came just three months after its last financing, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3acc197c-cd81-4b3b-a19b-32e58fc687e7">Financial Times reported</a>. The company, which just started to expand outside of Turkey in early 2021, is now planning a U.S. launch this year.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technology</strong>, the Silicon Valley-based startup building three-wheeled electric vehicles for autonomous delivery <em>or</em> human driven jaunts around town, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/faction-raises-4-3m-to-deploy-3-wheeled-evs-for-driverless-delivery/">raised $4.3 million in seed funding</a> led by Trucks VC and Fifty Years.</p>
<p><strong>Flink</strong>, a Berlin-based on-demand &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery delivery service built around self-operated dark stores and a smaller assortment (2,400 items) that it says it will deliver in 10 minutes or less, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">raised $240 million</a> to expand its business into more cities, and more countries.</p>
<p><strong>FlixMobility</strong>, the parent company of the FlixBus coach network and the FlixTrain rail service, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/">closed more than $650 million</a> in a Series G round of funding that values the Munich-based company at over $3 billion. Jochen Engert, who co-founded and co-leads the company with André Schwämmlein, described the round in a press call that TechCrunch participated in as a &#8220;balanced&#8221; mix of equity and debt, and said that the plan will be to use the funds to both expand its network in the U.S. market as well as across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Locus</strong>, a startup that uses AI to help businesses map out their logistics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/locus-raises-50-million-for-its-logistics-management-business/">raised $50 million</a> in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence. The new round, a Series C, was led by Singapore&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund GIC. Qualcomm Ventures and existing investors Tiger Global Management and Falcon Edge also participated in the round, which brings the startup&#8217;s to-date raise to $79 million. The new round valued the startup, which was founded in India, at about $300 million, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p><strong>Realtime Robotics</strong> announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/realtime-robotics-raises-a-31m-series-a/">$31.4 million round</a>. The funding is part of the $11.7 million Series A the company announced all the way back in late 2019. Investors include HAHN Automation, SAIC Capital Management, Soundproof Ventures , Heroic Ventures, SPARX Asset Management, Omron Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures, Scrum Ventures and Duke Angels.</p>
<p><strong>Roadster</strong>, the Palo Alto-based digital platform that gives dealers tools to sell new and used vehicles online has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/cdk-global-buys-vehicle-the-e-commerce-platform-roadster-for-360-million/">acquired for $360 million</a> by retail automotive technology company CDK Global Inc. As part of the all-cash deal, Roadster is now a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>
<p><strong>Sennder</strong>, a digital freight forwarder that focuses on moving cargo around Europe (and specifically focusing on trucks and &#8220;full truck load&#8221;, FTL, freight forwarding), has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-80m-at-a-1b-valuation/">raised $80 million in funding</a>, at a valuation the company confirms is now over $1 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota AI Ventures</strong>, Toyota&#8217;s standalone venture capital fund, dropped the &#8220;AI&#8221; and has been reborn as, simply, Toyota Ventures. The firm is commemorating its new identity with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/rebranded-toyota-ventures-invests-300-million-in-emerging-tech-and-carbon-neutrality/">new $300 million fund</a> that will focus on emerging technologies and carbon neutrality. The capital is split into two early-stage funds: the Toyota Ventures Frontier Fund and the Toyota Ventures Climate Fund. The introduction of these two new funds brings Toyota Ventures&#8217; total assets under management to over $500 million</p>
<p><strong>Trellis Technologies</strong>, the insurance technology platform, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210603005116/en/Trellis-Raises-10-million-to-Bring-Simplicity-and-Security-to-Consumer-Insurance">raised $10 million in Series A funding</a> led by QED Investors with participation from existing investors NYCA Partners and General Catalyst.</p>
<p><strong>VTB</strong>, Russia&#8217;s second-largest lender, has bought a $75 million minority stake in car-sharing provider Delimobil, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-delimobil-vtb/vtb-buys-75-million-stake-in-russian-car-share-service-delimobil-ahead-of-planned-ipo-idUSKCN2DG13K">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<h2>Waymo: by the numbers</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896325 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png" alt="the station autonomous vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Waymo has been on my mind lately — and not because of the executive departures that I wrote about last month. No, I&#8217;ve been thinking about Waymo and how, or <em>if</em>, it&#8217;s been scaling up its Waymo One driverless ride-hailing service, which operates in several Phoenix suburbs. The latest example is that Waymo One can now be accessed and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/waymos-driverless-taxi-service-can-now-be-accessed-on-google-maps/">booked through Google Maps</a>.</p>
<p>But what about ridership? The folks at Sensor Tower, the mobile app market intelligence firm, recently shared some numbers that give the tiniest of glimpses into who is at least interested in trying the service.</p>
<p>First, a bit of history. Waymo started an early rider program in April 2017, which allowed vetted members of the public, all of whom signed NDAs, to hail an autonomous Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivan. All of these Waymo-branded vans had human safety operators behind the wheel.</p>
<p>In December 2018, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/waymo-launches-self-driving-car-service-waymo-one/">Waymo One</a>, the self-driving car service and accompanying app. Waymo-trained test drivers were still behind the wheel when the ride-hailing service began. Early rider program members were the first to be invited to the service. As these folks were shifted over to the Waymo One service, the NDA was lifted.</p>
<p>The first meaningful signs that Waymo was ready to put people in vehicles without human safety operators popped up in fall 2019. TechCrunch contributor Ed Niedermeyer was among the first (media) to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/hailing-a-driverless-ride-in-a-waymo/">hail a driverless ride</a>. These driverless rides were limited and free. And importantly, still fell under the early rider program, which had that extra NDA protection. Waymo slowly scaled until about 5 to 10% of its total rides in 2020 were fully driverless for its exclusive group of early riders under NDA. Then COVID-19 hit.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the company announced that members of Waymo One — remember this is the sans NDA service — would be able to take family and friends along on their fully driverless rides in the Phoenix area. Existing Waymo One members were given first access to the driverless rides. The company started to welcome more people directly into the service through its app, which is available on Google Play and the App Store.</p>
<p>Waymo said that 100% of its rides would be fully driverless, which it has maintained. Today, anyone can download the app and hail a driverless ride.</p>
<p>OK, back to the numbers. Sensor Tower shared monthly estimates for Waymo&#8217;s installs from the U.S. App Store and Google Play. The company said that most of the installs are on iOS, as it looks like the Waymo app only became available on Android in April 2021. This isn&#8217;t a ridership number. It does show how interest has grown, and picked up since February 2021.</p>

<p>Hi folks, welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>Another infrastructure bill was proposed in Washington this week. The <strong>House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure</strong> introduced a new bill that would invest $547 billion over the next five years on surface transport. While much of those funds would go toward improving America&#8217;s roads, bridges, and passenger rail, the INVEST in America Act would dedicate around $4 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and around $4 billion to invest in zero-emission transit vehicles.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that&#8217;s in addition to major infrastructure bills already proposed by President Joe Biden and House Democrats. It&#8217;s likely that this bill, should it pass, would be significantly scaled back &#8212; just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/the-station-rivian-rolls-towards-an-ipo-and-quantumscape-makes-a-big-battery-hire/">Congressional Republicans</a> are attempting to do with Biden&#8217;s infrastructure plan. You can read more about the bill <a href="https://transportation.house.gov/">here</a>.</p>
<p>President Biden has set his sights on battery manufacturing as a way to recover and reuse critical minerals in the EV supply chain. This is after it was reported that he walked back earlier signals that he might support domestic mining for these minerals, like lithium. Instead, it looks like his plan is to push for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-bidens-electric-vehicle-plan-includes-battery-recycling-push-2021-06-04/">continued importing of the metals</a> from foreign countries and then to recycle and reuse them at the end of a battery&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>This news is a blow to America&#8217;s mining industry but sure to be a boost for metal recyclers, like Redwood Materials in Nevada and Canadian company Li-Cycle, which is expanding its operations in the States.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest pushback against mining has come from environmental and conservation groups. A good example is the situation currently unfolding out in Nevada, where a proposed lithium mine may be halted due to the presence of a rare wildflower. Conservation groups want to get protected status for the flower. If they succeed? No more mine.</p>
<p>The final piece of news this week is a recent survey from <strong>Pew Research Center</strong> which found that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/">51% of Americans</a> oppose phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. The report also found that those reported hearing &#8220;a lot&#8221; about EVs were more likely to seriously consider one for their next vehicle purchase. Also, while Americans are roughly in agreement that EVs are better for the environment, they&#8217;re equally in agreement that they&#8217;re more costly.</p>
<p>The upshot is that more and more Americans are coming around to the idea of EVs and the question of their benefits (on the environment, for example) is pretty well understood. But policymakers and OEMs clearly still have a ways to go in convincing a huge swathe of Americans to get on board.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t be providing the looooonnnnggggg roundup of news this week, but here are a few little bits including some hires and other tidbits.</p>
<p><strong>7-Eleven</strong> said it plans to install <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/7-eleven-to-install-500-ev-charging-stations-by-the-end-of-2022/">500 direct-current fast charging ports</a> at 250 locations across North America by the end of 2022. These charging ports will be owned and operated by 7-Eleven, as opposed to fuel at its filling stations, which must be purchased from suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>Baraja</strong>, the lidar startup, appointed former Magna and DaimlerChrysler veterans to its executive team, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauleichenberg/">Paul Eichenberg</a> as chief strategy officer and Jim Kane as vp of automotive engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Heater</strong>, hardware editor here at TechCrunch, covered a recent gathering of ride-hailing drivers in Long Island City, Queens. The group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/rideshare-drivers-gather-in-nyc-in-hopes-of-unionizing/">protested outside of Uber&#8217;s offices</a> ahead of a proposed state bill. The drivers support the proposed bill that would make it easy for gig economy workers in the state to unionize.</p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM that also has backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Microsoft and Honda, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cruise-can-now-give-passengers-rides-in-driverless-cars-in-california/">secured a permit</a> that will allow the company to shuttle passengers in its test vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>
<p>The permit, issued by the California Public Utilities Commission as part of its driverless pilot program, is one of several regulatory requirements autonomous vehicle companies must meet before they can deploy commercially. This permit is important &#8212; and Cruise is the first to land this particular one &#8212; but it does not allow the company to charge passengers for any rides in test AVs.</p>
<p><strong>DeepMap</strong> has developed a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deepmap-announces-roadmemory-a-highly-scalable-and-economical-mapping-service-enabling-hands-off-driving-everywhere-301304788.html">crowdsourced mapping service</a> called RoadMemory that lets automakers turn data collected from their own fleets of passenger vehicles and trucks into maps. The company says the tool is designed to expand geographic coverage more quickly and support hands-off autonomous driving features everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Joby Aviation</strong> is partnering with REEF Technology, one of the country&#8217;s largest parking garage operators, and a real estate acquisition company Neighborhood Property Group to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/joby-aviation-targets-parking-garages-for-its-aerial-ridesharing-network/">build out its network of vertiports</a>, with an initial focus on Los Angeles, Miami, New York and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>Populus</strong>, the platform that helps cities manage shared mobility services, streets and curbs, launched a new <a href="https://www.populus.ai/latest-news/populus-expands-data-sharing-solutions-for-carsharing-in-oakland">digital car-sharing parking feature</a> in Oakland. The gist is that this feature helps cities collect data on car-sharing and deploy curbside paying payments. The company launched this particular product in 2018 and has been expanding to different cities.</p>
<p><strong>Starship Technologies</strong>, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/former-head-of-alphabets-loon-joins-starship-technologies-as-new-ceo/">hired a new CEO</a>. The company tapped Alastair Westgarth, the former CEO of Alphabet&#8217;s Loon, to lead the company as it looks to expand its robotics delivery service. Loon, Alphabet&#8217;s experiment to deliver broadband via high-altitude balloons, was shut down for good at the beginning of this year. Prior to working at Loon, Westgarth headed the wireless antennae company Quintel Solutions, was a vice president at telecommunications company Nortel and director of engineering at Bell Mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri Suzuki</strong>, a partner at design consultancy firm Pentagram, recently conducted a research project into the crucial role electric car sound has on a user&#8217;s safety, enjoyability, communication and brand recognition, out of which he developed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/pentagram-cuts-through-the-noise-of-ev-sound-design/">range of car sounds</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people in emerging markets depend on informal public transport to move across cities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while there are ride-hailing and bus-hailing applications in some of these cities, there&#8217;s a dire need for journey-planning apps to improve mobility for users and reduce the time they spend commuting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African startup <a href="https://www.whereismytransport.com/">WhereIsMyTransport</a> is one such company filling that gap for now. Today, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t is announcing a $14.5 million Series A extension to continue its expansion across emerging markets; the company already has a presence in South Africa and Mexico</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naspers, via its investment arm, Naspers Foundry, co-led the investment with Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to Naspers, the size of its check was $3 million. Japan&#8217;s SBI Investment also participated in the round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extension round is coming a year after WhereIsMyTransport <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/28/google-toyota-invest-in-whereismytransport-to-map-transport-in-emerging-cities/">received a $7.5 million Series A investment</a> from VC firms and strategic investment from Google, Nedbank, and Toyota Tsusho Corporation (TTC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devin de Vries, Chris King and Dave New started the company in 2015. As a mobility startup, WhereIsMyTransport maps formal and informal public transport networks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company then uses data gotten to improve the public transport experience, making commute safe and accessible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this, WhereIsMyTransport licenses some of this data to governments, DFIs, NGOs, operators, and third-party developers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It claims this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is done</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">research, analytics, insights and consumer and enterprise solutions purposes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;WhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority world,&#8221; said CEO Devin de Vries in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year when we covered the company, it had mapped 34 cities in Africa while actively mapping some in India, Southeast Asia and Latin  America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since then, it has only expanded into Latin America by launching in Mexico City last November</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has launched its first consumer product Rumbo which provides network information from all modes of public transport in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhereIsMyTransport currently has over 100,000 users delivering over 750,000 real-time network alerts with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plans to launch Rumbo in Lima, Peru, later this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For co-lead investor Naspers Foundry, this is the firm&#8217;s first investment in mobility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it has funded four other South African startups &#8212; Aerobotics, SweepSouth, Aerobotics, and Studio Cap &#8212; with a focus on edtech, food and cleaning sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t pass on the opportunity to back an extraordinary South African founder who has built his business here in Cape Town to a global market leader in mapping formal and informal transportation with a strong focus on emerging markets,&#8221; Head of Naspers Foundry Fabian Whate said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also adds that there is an overlap between mobility and the food and e-commerce businesses that seem to be Naspers main focus from a Naspers perspective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The global food and e-commerce businesses, often operating in emerging markets, are quite reliant on mobility solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there&#8217;s a great overlap between what the Naspers Group does and the vision for WhereIsMyTransport</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In South Africa, WhereIsMyTransport’s clients include Johannesburg commuter rail system Gautrain and Transport for Cape Town</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its international client base Google, the World Bank and WSP, and others.</span></p>
<p>South Africa CEO of Naspers, Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa, said:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Mobility remains an obstacle for billions of people in high-growth markets across the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our investment in WhereIsMyTransport is a testimony of our belief that great innovation and tech talent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is found</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in South Africa, and with the right backing and support, these businesses can provide solutions to local challenges that can improve the lives of ordinary people in South Africa and abroad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">France&#8217;s competition watchdog, <em>L’Autorité de la concurrence</em>, has fined Google up to €220 million (~$268M) in a case related to self-preferencing within the adtech market which the watchdog found constituted an abuse by Google of a dominant position for ad servers for website publishers and mobile apps.</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité </em>began looking into Google&#8217;s adtech business following complaints from a number of French publishers.</p>
<p>Today it <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/article/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros-pour-avoir">said</a> Google had requested a settlement &#8212; and is &#8220;not disputing the facts of the case&#8221; &#8212; with the tech giant proposing certain &#8216;interoperability&#8217; commitments that the regulator has accepted, and which will form a binding part of <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/decision/relative-des-pratiques-mises-en-oeuvre-dans-le-secteur-de-la-publicite-sur-internet-0">the decision</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The watchdog called the action a world first in probing Google&#8217;s complex algorithmic ad auctions.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, <em>L&#8217;Autorité&#8217;</em>s president<em>,</em> Isabelle de Silva, said: &#8220;The decision sanctioning Google has a very special meaning because it is the first decision in the world to look into complex algorithmic processes. Auctions through which online display advertising works. The investigation, carried out particularly quickly, revealed the processes by which Google, relying on its considerable dominant position on ad servers for sites and applications, was favored over its competitors on both ad servers and SSP platforms. These very serious practices penalized competition in the emerging online advertising market, and have enabled Google not only to preserve but also to increase its dominant position. This sanction and these commitments will make it possible to restore a level playing field for all players, and the ability of publishers to make the most of their advertising space. &#8221;</p>
<p>At specific issue is preferential treatment Google granted to its own proprietary technologies &#8212; offered under the Google Ad Manager brand &#8212; on both the demand and supply sides; via the operation of its DFP [DoubleClick For Publishers] ad server (which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their spaces advertising), and its sales platform SSP AdX (which organizes the auction process allowing publishers to sell their &#8216;impressions&#8217; or advertising inventories to advertisers), per the watchdog.</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité</em> <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros">found</a> that Google&#8217;s preferential treatment of its adtech harmed competitors and publishers.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, a Google spokeswoman referred us to this <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/some-changes-our-ad-technology/">blog post</a> discussing the settlement where Maria Gomri, a legal director for Google France, writes that it has &#8220;agreed on a set of commitments to make it easier for publishers to make use of data and use our tools with other ad technologies&#8221; &#8212; before detailing the steps it has pledged to take.</p>
<p>The publishing groups that made the original complaint against Google in France were News Corp Inc., the Le Figaro group and the Rossel La Voix group, although Le Figaro withdrew its referral last November &#8212; at the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-google-copyrights-idINKBN27Z27B">same time as it signed a content-licensing deal with Google</a>, related to Google&#8217;s News Showcase product (a vehicle Google has spun up as legislators in different markets around the world have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">taken steps to force it to pay</a> for some content reuse).</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition watchdog had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">earlier</a> ordered Google to negotiate with publishers over remuneration for reuse of their content, following the transposing into national law of updated, pan-EU copyright rules &#8212; which extend neighbouring rights to publishers&#8217; news snippets. So the adtech giant&#8217;s operations remain under scrutiny <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">on that front too</a>.</p>
<h2>Google agrees to interoperability changes</h2>
<p>Google has agreed to improve the interoperability of Google Ad Manager services with third-party ad server and advertising space sales platform solutions, per <em>L&#8217;Autorité</em>, as well as agreeing to end provisions that favor itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The practices in question are particularly serious because they penalized Google&#8217;s competitors in the SSP market and the publishers of sites and mobile applications,&#8221; it writes in a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/article/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros-pour-avoir">press release</a> (translated from French with Google Translate). &#8220;Among these, the press groups &#8212; including those who were [the source] of the referral to the Authority &#8212; were affected even though their economic model is also strongly weakened by the decline in sales of paper subscriptions and the decline in associated advertising revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité</em> confirmed it has accepted Google&#8217;s commitments &#8212; and makes them binding in its decision. The commitments will be mandatory for a three year period, <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros">per the agreement</a>.</p>
<p>The commitments Google has offered appear to speak to some operational details that have emerged via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">Texas antitrust lawsuit also targeting Google&#8217;s adtech</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, documents surfaced via that suit which appeared to show the tech giant operated a secret program that used data from past bids in its digital ad exchange to allegedly give its own ad-buying system an advantage over competitors, per the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-secret-project-bernanke-revealed-in-texas-antitrust-case-11618097760">WSJ</a> &#8212; which reported that the so-called &#8216;Project Bernanke&#8217; program was not disclosed to publishers who sold ads through Google&#8217;s exchange.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Texas leads ten states in lawsuit over Google&#8217;s ad business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/embed/#?secret=nYdrwaXCyV" data-secret="nYdrwaXCyV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the area of data access, Google has committed to the <em>L&#8217;Autorité </em>to devise a solution to ensure that all buyers which use Google Ad Manager to participate in its ad exchange receive equal access to data from its auctions &#8212; &#8220;to help them efficiently buy ad space from publishers&#8221;. Including when publishers use an off-platform technique called &#8216;Header Bidding&#8217; (which enables publishers to run an auction among multiple ad exchanges but which, as a result of how Google operates, has meant such buyers may be at a data disadvantage vs those participating through Google&#8217;s own platform).</p>
<p>Google claims it is &#8220;usually not technically possible&#8221; for it to identify participants in Header Bidding auctions, and thus that it cannot share data with those buyers. But it&#8217;s now committed to address that by working &#8220;to create a solution that ensures that all buyers that a publisher works with, including those who participate in Header Bidding, can receive equal access to data related to outcomes from the Ad Manager auction&#8221;.</p>
<p>It notes that &#8220;in particular&#8221; it will be &#8220;providing information around the &#8216;minimum bid to win&#8217; from previous auctions&#8221;, going forward &#8212; which would address one disadvantageous blind-spot for publishers taking an off-platform route to try to earn more ad revenue.</p>
<p>Another commitment from Google to the French watchdog is a pledge to increase flexibility for publishers using its Ad Manager product &#8212; including by letting them set custom pricing rules for ads that are in <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2541069/block-sensitive-categories?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2541069/block-sensitive-categories?hl=en&quot;}">sensitive categories</a> and implementing product changes aimed at improving interoperability between Ad Manager and third-party ad servers.</p>
<p>Google also writes that it is &#8220;reaffirming&#8221; that it won&#8217;t limit Ad Manager publishers from negotiating specific terms or pricing directly with other sell-side platforms (SSPs); and says it is committing to continue to provide publishers with controls to include or exclude certain buyers at their discretion when they use its product.</p>
<p>The third batch of commitments focus on transparency &#8212; and the opacity of adtech has long been a core criticism of the market, including for the competitive dimension as unclear workings by dominant platforms can be used to shield abusive practices from view. (Indeed, <em>L&#8217;Autorité</em> already fined Google $166M back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/france-slaps-google-with-166m-antitrust-fine-for-opaque-and-inconsistent-ad-rules/">December 2019</a> for having what it billed then as “opaque and difficult to understand” rules for its ad platform, Google Ads, and for applying them in “an unfair and random manner.”)</p>
<p>On transparency, Google has pledged not to use data from other SSPs to optimize bids in its own exchange in a way that other SSPs can’t reproduce. It also says it&#8217;s reupping a promise not to share any bid from any Ad Manager auction participants with any other auction participant prior to completion of the auction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, we’ll give publishers at least three months&#8217; notice for major changes requiring significant implementation effort that publishers must adopt, unless those are related to security or privacy protections, or are required by law,&#8221; it further notes.</p>
<p>The commitments made to <em>L&#8217;Autorité </em>will apply to how Google operates its adtech in the French market &#8212; but are also set to be applied more widely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be testing and developing these changes over the coming months before rolling them out more broadly, including some globally,&#8221; Gomri added in the blog post.</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité</em>&#8216;s action comes after years of attention paid to the online advertising market.</p>
<p>Back in 2018 it published a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/sites/default/files/integral_texts/2019-10/avis18a03_en_.pdf">report</a> that delved into a number of competitive advantages leveraged by Facebook and Google, noting how the duopoly&#8217;s ad targeting offerings benefit from their leadership positions in respective markers and the resultant network effects; and also from their vertical integration model (playing in both publishing and technical intermediation); as well as from the &#8216;logged&#8217; environments both have developed, requiring users to log in to access &#8216;free&#8217; services &#8212; giving them access to a high volume of sociodemographic and behavioral data to power their ad targeting products, among other competitive advantages.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority has also conducted an online ad market study <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">in recent years</a> &#8212; findings from which are underpinning &#8216;pro-competition&#8217; regulatory reform that&#8217;s now being targeted at tech giants with &#8216;strategic market status&#8217; which will, in the future, be subject to an ex ante regime of custom requirements aimed at preemptively preventing market abuse.</p>
<p>The European Commission has, meanwhile, issued multiple antitrust enforcements against Google&#8217;s business in recent years &#8212; including a $1.7BN fine related to its search ad brokering business, AdSense,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/"> in 2019</a>, and a $2.7BN penalty for its price comparison service, Google Shopping, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">2017</a>, to name two.</p>
<p>More recently, the EU regulators have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-antitrust-eu-idUSKBN29P23U">reported</a> to be further probing Google&#8217;s adtech practices. So more interventions could be forthcoming.</p>
<p>However the Commission&#8217;s preferred approach of not imposing specific remedies itself &#8212; nor obtaining specific commitments, beyond a general requirement not to continue the sanctioned abuse (or any equivalent behavior) &#8212; seems to have failed to move the needle, certainly where Google&#8217;s market dominance is concerned.</p>
<p>Still, EU lawmakers&#8217; experience with Google antitrust cases has certainly informed a recent pan-EU plan for a set of ex ante rules to apply to digital &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; &#8212; incoming under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act</a>, which was presented by Brussels last December.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014 Alexis Patjane was at a local hookah bar in Mexico City with some friends and the bar ran out of tobacco. They thought maybe they could buy some online and have it delivered to the bar in real-time, but it turns out that service didn’t exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Patjane was running a food truck-making business, which was responsible for about 80% of all the food trucks in Mexico, so he had experience doing business in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of weeks later, to solve the instant delivery problem he had faced at the hookah bar, Patjane launched 99 minutos, a website that sold products and delivered them within 99 minutes, hence the name.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, 99 minutos announced a $40 million Series B from Prosus and Kaszek Ventures which it plans to use to grow its business in Latin America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently operates within 40 major markets across Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru and offers four services: less than 99 minutes delivery, same-day delivery, next-day delivery, and CO2-free delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What started as an e-commerce company with fast delivery quickly became a last-mile delivery service for other e-commerce companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started to build the API connections and plug-ins, and any e-commerce could add our delivery service to their business,” Patjane told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">99 minutos makes money by charging the customer a flat fee for delivery and then offering the driver a flat rate as well, but today, the volume is so large on each route, that it’s become very lucrative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ship about 60-80 packages per route,” Patjane said, and from the consumer’s perspective, the delivery app works similarly to Waze. “You can pause the delivery, you can change the address. You can say, “Oh, I’m not at home, I’m at the Starbucks on the corner, can you drop it off there?”’ he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patjane said that initially, the company offered delivery only within Mexico City, but it quickly grew to offer its services between cities and now operates between 21 cities in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“E-commerce is growing quickly in Latin America, but it is still [the] early days. E-commerce penetration in Latin America is at 6%, while China is reaching 30% and the U.S. is at 20%,” the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we hear big e-commerce players saying that 99 minutos is ‘their most reliable partner’ and that they are ‘the provider with the most potential,’ it tells us that the team is executing extremely well and is on a path to disrupt e-commerce delivery in Latin America,” said Banafsheh Fathieh, Head of Americas Investments at Prosus Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the funds will also be to speed up their city-to-city deliveries. “We’ll be doing same day [delivery] from city to city and will be using small aircraft to connect the cities,” Patjane said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos is going to be one of the passengers on his spaceflight company Blue Origin&#8217;s first ever human space launch on July 20. The Amazon founder announced the news via his Instagram on Monday morning, revealing that his brother Mark will also be coming along for the ride. Bezos and his brother will join the winner of an online auction Blue Origin is currently hosting, which currently stands at $2.8 million as the highest bid for that seat.</p>
<p>The Blue Origin launch of its suborbital, reusable New Shepard rocket on July 20 will be the first time it has ever flown with people on board. It&#8217;s unusual for a company to make its first ever human spaceflight a mission with a paying passenger, and now we know that it&#8217;s also going to be carrying one of the world&#8217;s richest people, another bold choice for a first human flight. Virgin Galactic, by contrast, has flown to space multiple times with test pilots and astronauts before its forthcoming trip with Sir Richard Branson. Elon Musk has also never flown on a SpaceX launch, though he has suggested in the past that he will fly on one of his company&#8217;s vehicles at some point.</p>

<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard has flown plenty of times without people, however, and save for the first flight where the reusable booster was lost, has had a complete success for each of those 15 missions, including landing of the booster (except that first time) and recovery of the capsule (for all of the launches). The New Shepard rocket doesn&#8217;t go all the way to orbit, but instead flies to the edge of space, where passengers experience a few minutes of weightlessness and an unbeatable view of Earth through the capsules many windows, before returning to a parachute-assisted landing on the ground in Texas near Blue Origin&#8217;s launch site.</p>
<p>The auction for Blue Origin&#8217;s first paying customer seat currently sits at $2.8 million, and it&#8217;s been there for a while now after the price raised from $1.4 million when Blue Origin opened unsealed bidding on May 19. The final phase of the auction, set for June 12, will include live online bidding from remaining participants who bump their existing bid to match the high offer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of Google&#8217;s strong advantages in the world of online video has been the sheer size of YouTube: currently, the site has more than 2.3 billion monthly active users and over 500 hours of content uploaded every minute. Now, Google and YouTube are hoping to leverage some of that heft as it goes head to head with TikTok.</p>
<p>Shorts, YouTube&#8217;s TikTok rival for building 60-second videos set to music that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched first in India</a> and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded to the U.S.</a>, is now opening up in three more regions &#8212; the UK, Canada and Latin America. And alongside that, YouTube is turning on a new feature: users will now be able to dip into the wider YouTube catalogue when creating their videos.</p>
<p>The rollout to new countries is starting today and will be fully live by the end of June, a spokesperson tells me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The geographic and feature expansions underscore how Google continues to double down on the shorter video format to capture some of the audience that might otherwise go to TikTok &#8212; or, indeed, rival products from the likes of Instagram (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">Reels</a>), Snapchat (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a>) or others &#8212; for their quick-shot fix.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how well that is playing out in terms of engagement or creators just yet: YouTube tells me that the YouTube Shorts player &#8212; which appears as a bar on the YouTube app &#8212; now has passed 6.5 billion daily views in the countries where it is available.</p>
<p>YouTube is not disclosing creator numbers, nor is it disclosing active user numbers of Shorts itself. (But it has definitely built out a channel for incentivizing them: last month it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a $100 million creators fund</a> to lure more people to build content in its new channel.)</p>
<p>The company declined to say whether it plans to launch a standalone Shorts app at any point, but it&#8217;s in the process of improving user experience for people through the YouTube app. You can now scroll vertically from one Short to the next, not unlike how you would on TikTok, and you can get to Shorts directly from a tab on the app.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2161955,2161956,2161957,2161958"]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shorts is still technically in beta, and so it&#8217;s to be expected that YouTube will be adding in a lot of new features in the coming months as it watches how it gets picked up, or what people decry is lacking.</p>
<p>YouTube tells me, for example, that the ability to sample licensed music had been getting slowly expanded and rolled out in India and the U.S. in the past few weeks. If you are able to access shorts UK and you get access to Shorts as of today, you will be able to use the audio feature, too.</p>
<p>That licensed music trove now numbers millions of songs, YouTube said, from <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">250 labels and publishers, including Universal Music Group’s labels and publishing companies, Sony Music Entertainment and Publishing, Warner Music Group and Warner Chappell Music, Believe, Because Music, Merlin, Beggars, Ditto, AEI, The State51, Kobalt and more. (To be clear: this was the same number and list that it had last month, no new updates there.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to this, YouTube has added in other features since it launched. For example, it now lets creators add text, captions and graphics overlays on Shorts videos; sample audio from other Shorts; clips from your phone&#8217;s gallery; and filters for color correction &#8212; a template that will be expanded with more effects over time, YouTube said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But within that context, it will be interesting to see the impact of adding audio and video from across all of YouTube &#8212; we&#8217;re talking billions of videos here &#8212; will have on how Shorts gets used and how it evolves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This will mean not only music from creators, but all kinds of video segments that may have already gone viral, or may get their 15 minutes of fame as a result of one great Short.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Conversely, Shorts viewers and would-be creators will also be able to click through directly to the original content, and information about a creator, that was used in a Short &#8212; a key detail that should matter to those who have felt that originators of memes, dances, songs and other creator content sometimes get lost in the mix in a lot of what you see on viral video content platforms like TikTok&#8217;s (although it too has made it easier to find and link through, and credit original creators).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The network effect for a platform like YouTube is particularly compelling here, if the right audience takes YouTube up on what it is offering to them. At a time when TikTok remains a relatively new phenomenon, and there remains the question over how regulators will treat the Chinese-owned app longer term in countries like the U.S., there is a lot still to play for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash is the predominant method of sending and receiving payments in the Middle East. If you owe someone a cup of coffee or a trip over a long period, repaying via cash is your best bet. This is one problem out of many financial issues that haven&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been addressed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that startups are springing up to provide solutions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month Telda, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">now two-month-old startup</a> in Egypt, raised an impressive sum as pre-seed to offer digital banking services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.ziina.com/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6yILv-ITxAhXwyYUKHcRnCncQFjAAegQIBBAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1i4nN5d3iZddlUw_WDJ-Ns">Ziina</a>, another startup based in Dubai, has closed $7.5 million in seed funding to scale its peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service across the Middle East and North Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziina has managed to enlist top global investors and fintech founders in the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Avenir Growth and Class 5 Global led this latest tranche of financing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wamda Capital, FJ Labs, Graph Ventures, Goodwater Capital, Jabbar Internet Group, Oman Technology Fund’s Jasoor Ventures, and ANIM also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders who took part include Checkout CEO Guillaume Pousaz via his investment fund Zinal Growth; Krishnan Menon, BukuKas CEO, as well as executives from Paypal and Venmo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This adds to a roster of executives and early employees from Revolut, Stripe, Brex, Notion, and Deel that joined Ziina’s round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, it has raised over $8.6 million since launching last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes the $850,000 pre-seed raised in May 2020 and $125,000 secured after going through Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter batch early this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziina </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Faisal Toukan, Sarah Toukan, and Andrew Gold. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the latest addition to the Middle East’s bubbling fintech ecosystem and is capitalising on the region&#8217;s rapid adoption of fintech friendly regulation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company allows users to send and receive payments with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a phone number —no IBAN or swift code required as is the de facto method in the UAE and some parts of the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After meeting during a hackathon in the U.S., Faisal and Gold began exchanging ideas on how to build wallets, wanting to mirror the successes platforms like WePay, Paytm have had</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the time, VCs seemed to be interested in how the wallets ecosystem intersected with banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The lines between wallets and banking have become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blurred. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every wallet has a banking partner, and people who use wallets use them for their day-to-day needs,&#8221; CEO Faisal Toukan said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sarah, who is Faisal&#8217;s sister, was on her personal fintech journey in London. There, she attended several meetups headlined by the founders of Monzo and Revolut. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her knowledge and the experience of the other two, the founders decided that solving P2P payments issues was their own way of driving massive impact in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how far have they gone? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We launched a beta for the market that&#8217;s restricted for regulatory reasons</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Toukan remarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the process of getting regulated. We&#8217;ve got a banking partner, one of the three largest banks in the UAE, and we&#8217;ve set a new wallet to launch a month from now. That&#8217;s also what we were working throughout our period in YC. So it&#8217;s been quite an eventful year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech sector in MENA is growing fast; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> numbers, at a CAGR of 30%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in the UAE, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19845/fintech-in-the-middle-east-2021-forecast">estimated</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19845/fintech-in-the-middle-east-2021-forecast"> that over 450 fintech companies will raise about $2 billion in 2022</a> compared to the $80 million raised in 2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Fintechs in the region </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on solving payments, transfers, and remittances. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside its P2P offering, these are the areas Ziina wants to play in, including investment and cryptocurrency services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Toukan, there&#8217;s no ease of making online investments, and remittances </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in exchange houses, a manual process where people need to visit an office physically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;So what we&#8217;re looking to do is to bring all these products to life in the UAE and expand beyond that. But the first pain point we&#8217;re solving for is for people to send and receive money with two clicks,&#8221; the CEO affirmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with P2P has its own advantages. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, peer-to-peer services is a repeat behavioural mechanism that allows companies to establish trust with customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, it&#8217;s a cheaper customer acquisition model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toukan says that as Zinna expands </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">geographically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2022; and Egypt and Tunisia some years from now &#8212; as he wants the company&#8217;s wallet to become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamless across borders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want a situation where if you move into Saudi or Dubai, you&#8217;re able to use the same wallet versus using different banking applications,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be on the right side of regulation is key to any fintech expansion, and Toukan says Ziina has been in continuous dialogue with regulators to operate efficiently. But some challenges have stemmed from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finding the right banking partners. &#8220;You need to make a case to the banks that this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mutually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beneficial partnership. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the way we&#8217;ve done that is by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighting different cases globally like CashApp that worked with Southern Bank,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the company has moved past that challenge, it&#8217;s in full swing to launch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ziina has thousands of users who transacted more than $120,000 on the platform this past month.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In addition, there are over 20,000 users on its waiting list to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be onboarded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post-launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziina has already built a team with experience across tech companies like Apple, Uber, Stanford, Coinbase, Careem, Oracle, and Yandex</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to double down on hiring with this new investment and customer acquisition and establishing commercial partnerships</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p>As usual with Apple’s developer conferences, you can expect to learn more about the next major updates of the company’s operating systems. Get ready for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, a new version of macOS and some updates for watchOS and tvOS as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Apple could also use this opportunity to unveil some new products that are particularly popular with developers. Apple has already shipped several laptops and desktop computers with its own ARM-based M1 chip.</p>
<p>High-end models haven’t been updated yet. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">Rumor has it</a> that Apple could use today’s opportunity to unveil a new iMac Pro, updated MacBook Pro models or even a new external display.</p>
<p>You can watch the live stream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you don’t need to download a new app. You can open the Apple TV app and find the Apple Events section. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have an Apple TV and don’t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you live stream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers — Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fug1fQw9_-4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>1971 is the name of the year and an Apple TV+ documentary series billed as The Year That Music Changed Everything. It&#8217;s also the number of hours the former President kept up his blog From the Desk Of. No, that&#8217;s not true. But it is satisfactual. The thesis of the movie 1971 is that music suddenly came into its own a year and a half past the Beatles&#8217; sell date. In fact, the filmmakers make a very good case for this, with lots of studio footage of Elton John, Isaac Hayes, Andy Warhol and the Loud family, and the Osmond Family. I know this sounds like I&#8217;m being sarcastic. I would have been more onboard if there had been a little less of Keith Richards zombied out in the south of France and a tad more of the incredible Tapestry sessions that made the earth move under our feet and the sky come tumbling down, but by the end of the year the music apparently survived, I bought the bit,</p>
<p>2021 could use a little of this treatment. On Gray&#8217;s Anatomy, which has been time delayed 8 or so months back to the height of the Pandemic, the season finale sped up the clock to sync up mostly with the present. This Is Us started in the present, then flashed forward 4 years to a point midway between now and a previous flash forward so far in the future that apparently household appliances and haircut styles seemed to have stalled out in innovations and new features. The hidden message: forget binge viewing and working from home; it&#8217;s all watercooler conversations and cliffhangers just to be clear. Welcome back, Kotter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re just weeks into the Vaccination Age and already we&#8217;re defaulting back to old norms far faster than the experts predict. Twitter is rolling out a $3 per month professional version for French and Canadian journalists that lets you save bookmarks and edit mistakes. Twitter Spaces has found a new tab in the mobile client to aid discovery of new live shows, and Facebook has invented Bulletin as a jump starter for neutered apolitical, private public radio oriented newsletters with embedded Clubhouse rules — evading the Apple 30% app store in-app tax by creating a %-to-be-named-later out-of-app subscription experience. No wonder the future is barely distinguishable from this Thursday. But don&#8217;t mistake my lack of outrage for anything but total support for the three major plans on the table so far. I actually think we&#8217;ll see the beginnings of some real shape-shifting out there in the creator economy, as we saw in an earlier time with Tom Wolf and Ken Kesey&#8217;s Electric Acid Kool Aid Test, and everything Kurt Vonnegut ever wrote.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago we saw what happens when the talent takes over the institution. &#8217;72 the institution strikes back, &#8217;73 the tapes are played back, &#8217;74 even the president of the united states must stand naked. The underlying truth of the matter is that every year is the time when music takes over. The revolution continues to not be televised, this time shared with added interactivity. Joni Mitchell forever sits gunning the engine in her car waiting at the top of the hill:</p>
<blockquote><p>He makes friends easy<br />
He&#8217;s not like me<br />
I watch for judgement anxiously<br />
Now where in the city can that boy be</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fixing workplace misconduct reporting is a mission that&#8217;s snagged London-based <a href="https://vaultplatform.com">Vault Platform</a> backing from Google&#8217;s AI focused fund, Gradient Ventures, which is the lead investor in an $8.2 million Series A that&#8217;s being announced today.</p>
<p>Other investors joining the round are Illuminate Financial, along with existing investors including Kindred Capital and Angular Ventures. Its $4.2M seed round was closed back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/vault-platform/">2019</a>.</p>
<p>Vault sells a suite of SaaS tools to enterprise-sized or large/scale-up companies to support them to pro-actively manage internal ethics and integrity issues. As well as tools for staff to report issues, data and analytics is baked into the platform &#8212; so it can support with customers&#8217; wider audit and compliance requirements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, co-founder and CEO Neta Meidav said that as well as being wholly on board with the overarching mission to upgrade legacy reporting tools like hotlines provided to staff to try to surface conduct-related workplace risks (be that bullying and harassment; racism and sexism; or bribery, corruption and fraud), as you might expect Gradient Ventures was interested in the potential for applying AI to further enhance Vault&#8217;s SaaS-based reporting tool.</p>
<p>A feature of its current platform, called &#8216;GoTogether&#8217;, consists of an escrow system that allows users to submit misconduct reports to the relevant internal bodies but only if they are not the first or only person to have made a report about the same person &#8212; the idea being that can help encourage staff (or outsiders, where open reporting is enabled) to report concerns they may otherwise hesitate to, for various reasons.</p>
<p>Vault now wants to expand the feature&#8217;s capabilities so it can be used to proactively surface problematic conduct that may not just relate to a particular individual but may even affect a whole team or division &#8212; by using natural language processing to help spot patterns and potential linkages in the kind of activity being reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our algorithms today match on an alleged perpetrator&#8217;s identity. However many events that people might report on are not related to a specific person &#8212; they can be more descriptive,&#8221; explains Meidav. &#8220;For example if you are experiencing some irregularities in accounting in your department, for example, and you&#8217;re suspecting that there is some sort of corruption or fraudulent activity happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the greatest [workplace misconduct] disasters and crises that happened in recent years &#8212; the Dieselgate story at Volkswagen, what happened in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion">Boeing</a> &#8212; the common denominator in all these cases is that there&#8217;s been some sort of a serious ethical breach or failure which was observed by several people within the organization in remote parts of the organization. And the dots weren&#8217;t connected,&#8221; she goes on. &#8220;So the capacity we&#8217;re currently building and increasing &#8212; building upon what we already have with GoTogether &#8212; is the ability to connect on these repeated events and be able to connect and understand and read the human input. And connect the dots when repeated events are happening &#8212; alerting companies&#8217; boards that there is a certain &#8216;hot pocket&#8217; that they need to go and investigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would save companies from great risk, great cost, and essentially could prevent huge loss. Not only financial but reputational, sometimes it&#8217;s even loss to human lives&#8230; That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re getting to and what we&#8217;re aiming to achieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is the question of how defensible Vault&#8217;s GoTogether feature is &#8212; how easily it could be copied &#8212; given you can&#8217;t patent an idea. So baking in AI smarts may be a way to layer added sophistication to try to maintain a competitive edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some very sophisticated, unique technology there in the backend so we are continuing to invest in this side of our technology. And Gradient&#8217;s investment and the specific we&#8217;re receiving from Google now will only increase that element and that side of our business,&#8221; says Meidav when we ask about defensibility.</p>
<p><span class="il">Commenting on the funding in a statement,</span> Gradient Ventures founder and managing partner, Anna Patterson, added: “<span class="il">Vault</span> tackles an important space with an innovative and timely solution. <span class="il">Vault</span>’s application provides organizations with a data-driven approach to tackling challenges like occupational fraud, bribery or corruption incidents, safety failures and misconduct. Given their impressive team, technology, and customer traction, they are poised to improve the modern workplace.”</p>
<p>The London-based startup was only founded in 2018 &#8212; and while it&#8217;s most keen to talk about disrupting legacy hotline systems, which offer only a linear and passive conduit for misconduct reporting, there are a number of other startups playing in the same space. Examples include the likes of LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/allvoices-raises-3-million-to-build-a-platform-for-anonymous-harassment-and-bias-reporting/">AllVoices</a>, <a href="https://resources.whispli.com/blog/seed-round">YC-backed Whispli</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/hootsworth-helps-you-address-sexual-harassment-and-other-workplace-issues/">Hootsworth </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/spot-launches-chatbot-for-hr-departments-to-address-harassment-and-discrimination/">Spot</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>Competition seems likely to continue to increase as regulatory requirements around workplace reporting keep stepping up.</p>

<p>The incoming EU Whistleblower Protection Directive is one piece of regulation Vault expects will increase demand for smarter compliance solutions &#8212; aka &#8220;TrustTech&#8221;, as it seeks to badge it &#8212; as it will require companies of more than 250 employees to have a reporting solution in place by the end of December 2021, encouraging European businesses to cast around for tools to help shrink their misconduct-related risk.</p>
<p>She also suggests a platform solution can help bridge gaps between different internal teams that may need to be involved in addressing complaints, as well as helping to speed up internal investigations by offering the ability to chat anonymously with the original reporter.</p>
<p>Meidav also flags the rising attention US regulators are giving to workplace misconduct reporting &#8212; noting some recent massive awards by the SEC to external whistleblowers, such as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whistleblower-is-awarded-28-million-in-panasonic-avionics-case-11621443228">$28M</a> paid out to a single whistleblower earlier this year (in relation to the Panasonic Avionics consultant corruption case).</p>
<p>She also argues that growing numbers of companies going public (such as via the SPAC trend, where there will have been reduced regulatory scrutiny ahead of the &#8216;blank check&#8217; IPO) raises reporting requirements generally &#8212; meaning, again, more companies will need to have in place a system operated by a third party which allows anonymous and non-anonymous reporting. (And, well, we can only speculate whether companies going public by SPAC may be in greater need of misconduct reporting services vs companies that choose to take a more traditional and scrutinized route to market&#8230; )</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a few years back I had to convince investors that this category it really is a category &#8212; and fast forward to 2021, congratulations! We have a market here. It&#8217;s a growing category and there is competition in this space,&#8221; says Meidav.</p>
<p>&#8220;What truly differentiates Vault is that we did not just focus on digitizing an old legacy process. We focused on leveraging technology to truly empower more misconduct to surface internally and for employees to speak up in ways that weren&#8217;t available for them before. GoTogether is truly unique as well as the things that we&#8217;re doing on the operational side for a company &#8212; such as collaboration.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gives an example of how a customer in the oil and gas sector configured the platform to make use of an anonymous chat feature in Vault&#8217;s app so they could provide employees with a secure direct-line to company leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve utilizing the anonymous chat that the app enables for people to have a direct line to leadership,&#8221; she says. &#8220;That&#8217;s incredible. That is such a progress, forward looking way to be utilizing this tool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meidav says Vault has around 30 customers at this stage, split between the US and EU &#8212; its core regions of focus.</p>
<p>And while its platform is geared towards enterprises, its early customer base includes a fair number of scale-ups &#8212; with familiar names like Lemonade, Airbnb, Kavak, G2 and OVO Energy on the list.</p>
<p>Scale ups may be natural customers for this sort of product given the huge pressures that can be brought to bear upon company culture as a startup switches to expanding headcount very rapidly, per Meidav.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the early adopters and they are also very much sensitive to events such as these kind of [workplace] scandals as it can impact them greatly&#8230; as well as the fact that when a company goes through a hyper growth &#8212; and usually you see hyper growth happening in tech companies more than in any other type of sector &#8212; hyper growth is at time when you really, as management, as leadership, it&#8217;s really important to safeguard your culture,&#8221; she suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it changes very, very quickly and these changes can lead to all sorts of things &#8212; and it&#8217;s really important that leadership is on top of it. So when a company goes through hyper growth it&#8217;s an excellent time for them to incorporate a tool such as Vault. As well as the fact that every company that even thinks of an IPO in the coming months or years will do very well to put a tool like Vault in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Expanding Vault&#8217;s own team is also on the cards after this Series A close, as it guns for the next phase of growth for its own business. Presumably, though, it&#8217;s not short of a misconduct reporting solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon has made it official and publicly cancelled plans to produce the Model S Plaid+, a supercharged version of the upcoming Plaid version of the electric vehicle that will be delivered to the first customers this month.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s reason: Plaid is so good that another variant isn&#8217;t needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Model S goes to Plaid speed this week,&#8221; Musk tweeted on Sunday. &#8220;Plaid+ is canceled. No need, as Plaid speed is just so good.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Model S goes to Plaid speed this week</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1401641347040284679?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/elon-musk-reveals-the-tesla-model-s-plaid-slated-for-late-2021/">Tesla Model S Plaid</a> powertrain can go from 0 to 60mph in 1.99 seconds, has a top speed of 200 miles per hour and an estimated range of 390 miles, according to the company&#8217;s website. The powertrain produces 1,020 horsepower, and the cost of the vehicle starts at $112,990. In late May, Musk tweeted that the delivery event for the electric sedan would be pushed back until June 10 in order to finish one last tweak. Musk described driving the Plaid, which has three motors as feeling like a spaceship.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Model S Plaid delivery pushed to June 10. Needs one more week of tweak.</p>
<p>This car feels like a spaceship. Words cannot describe the limbic resonance.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The now-canceled Plaid+ wasn&#8217;t coming to market until mid-2022. Musk had promised this version would pushed the performance and range even higher. The listed starting price also popped up to $150,000. Tesla stopped taking pre-orders for the vehicle on its website in May, prompting coverage and speculation that the Plaid+ would never come to fruition. The tweet from Musk on Sunday confirms those theories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There has been a wave of businesses over the past several years hoping to offer broadband internet delivered from thousands of satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO), providing coverage of most of the earth’s surface.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve seen excitement in the category. Companies and people that you have heard of — Bill Gates and Motorola, to name a few — invested billions of dollars into this business model two decades ago in an adventure that <a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/satellite-companies-to-be-merged-after-12bn-bankruptcy-rescue/32231.article">ended in many bankruptcies and very few people connected to the internet</a> from low-earth orbit. Yet, here we are 20 years later, witnessing billionaires from Elon Musk to Jeff Bezos and entities from SoftBank to the United Kingdom investing billions into broadband from space in a gold rush that began around 2015, and has only accelerated since the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p>During that same period, we have seen a parallel ascendance of China’s space capabilities. In tandem with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/spacex-launches-60-more-starlink-satellites-claims-over-500000-service-pre-orders-so-far/">the accelerated deployment of SpaceX’s Starlink constellation in 2020</a>, China has rapidly responded in terms of policy, financing, and technology, including most notably the creation of a “Chinese answer to Starlink”, namely constellation operating company China SatNet, and the associated GuoWang (国网, or National Net(work)) constellation.</p>
<p>While still in early development, SatNet and GuoWang are likely to compete in certain markets with Starlink and others, while also fulfilling what may be a similar strategic purpose from a government perspective. With considerable backing from very high-level actors, we are likely to see the rollout of a Red Star(link) over China (and the rest of the world) over the coming several years.</p>
<h2>The rapid rise of Starlink</h2>
<p>China’s LEO constellation plans cannot be understood in a vacuum. Like many other areas of high-tech investment, China’s actions here are partially reactive to developments in the West. The acceleration and expansion of Western LEO constellations in recent years — most notably Starlink — has been an accelerant to China’s own plans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome back to Week in Review!</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote about tech taking on Disney. This week, I&#8217;m talking about the search for a new crypto messiah.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><span class="s1">newsletter page</span></a>, and follow my tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny"><span class="s1">@lucasmtny</span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Big Thing</strong></h2>
<p>Elon has worn out his welcome among the crypto illuminati, and the acolytes of Bitcoin are searching out a new emperor god king.</p>
<p>This weekend, thousands of crypto acolytes and investors have descended on a Bitcoin-themed conference in Miami, a very real, very heavily-produced conference sporting crypto celebrities and actual celebrities all on a mission to make waves.</p>
<p>Even though I am not at the conference in person (panels from its main stage were live-streamed online), I have plenty of invites in my email for afterparties featuring celebrities, open bars and endless conversations on the perils of fiat. The cryptocurrency community has never been larger or richer thanks to its most fervent bull run yet, and despite a pretty noteworthy correction in the past few weeks, people believe the best is yet to come.</p>
<p>Despite having so much, what they still seem to be lacking is a patron saint.</p>
<p>For the longest bout, that was SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk who bolstered the currency by pushing Tesla to invest cash on its balance sheet into bitcoin, while also pushing for Tesla to accept bitcoin payments for its vehicles. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/elon-musk-giveth-and-taketh-away/">As I&#8217;ve noted in this newsletter in the past</a>, Musk had a tough time reconciling the sheer energy use of bitcoin&#8217;s global network with his eco warrior bravado which has seemed to lead to his mild and uneven excommunication (though I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s welcome back at any time).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Goods &amp; services are the real economy, any form of money is simply the accounting thereof</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1401251430015582209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There are plenty of celebrities looking to fill his shoes &#8212; a<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> recent </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://t.co/cRHIf2QVU1?amp=1">endorsement gone wrong</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> by Soulja Boy was one of the more comical instances.</span></p>
<p>Crypto has been no stranger to grift &#8212; of that even the most hardcore crypto grifters can likely agree &#8212; and I think there&#8217;s been some agreement that the only leader who can truly preach the gospel is someone who is already so rich they don&#8217;t even need more money. It&#8217;s one reason the community has offered up so much respect for Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin who truly doesn&#8217;t seem to care too much about getting any wealthier &#8212;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/vitalik-buterin-donates-1-billion-worth-of-meme-coins-to-india-covid-relief-fund/"> he donated about $1 billion worth of crypto to Covid relief efforts in India.</a> A Musk-like cheerleader serves a different purpose though, and so the community is in search of a Good Billionaire.</p>
<p>The best runner-up at the moment appears to be one Jack Dorsey, and while &#8212; like Musk &#8212; he is also another double-CEO, he is quite a bit different from him in demeanor and desire for the spotlight. He was, however, a headline speaker at Miami&#8217;s Bitcoin conference.</p>
<p>Dorsey gathers the most headlines for his work at Twitter but it&#8217;s Square where he is pushing most of his crypto enthusiasm. Users can already use Square&#8217;s Cash App to buy Bitcoin. Minutes before going onstage Friday, Dorsey tweeted out a thread detailing that Square was interested in building its own hardware wallet that users could store cryptocurrency like bitcoin on outside of the confines of an exchange.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Square is considering making a hardware wallet for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a>. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community. We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles.</p>
<p>&mdash; jack (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1400839179513339905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“Bitcoin changes absolutely everything,” Dorsey said onstage. “I don’t think there is anything more important in my lifetime to work on.”</p>
<p>And while the billionaire Dorsey seems like a good choice on paper &#8212; he tweets about bitcoin often, but only <em>good</em> tweets. He defends its environmental effects. He shows up to House misinformation hearings with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350705/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-clock-house-hearing-blockclock-mini">bitcoin tracker clearly visible in the background.</a> He is also unfortunately the CEO of Twitter, a company that&#8217;s desire to reign in its more troublesome users &#8212; including one very troublesome user &#8212; has caused a rift between him and the crypto community&#8217;s very vocal libertarian sect.</p>
<p>Dorsey didn&#8217;t make it very far into his speech before <a href="https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1400870769861795843">a heckler made a scene</a> calling him a hypocrite because of all this with a few others piping in, but like any good potential crypto king would know to do, he just waited quietly for the noise to die down.</p>

&#8220;Just because a technology startup has a hot start, that doesn’t mean it will grow quickly forever. Most will wind up somewhere in the middle — or worse. Put simply, there is a larger number of tech companies that do fine or a little bit worse after they reach scale.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Etsy, a marketplace for kitschy and creative DIY goods, acquired Depop, a hippy and thrifty marketplace for resale goods,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal/"> for $1.625 billion this week.</a> So, today we’ll discuss the tale of two marketplaces, a deal that has given us a peek into the evolving ethos of social shopping.</p>
<p>Depop, for those that don’t know, is a London-based company that targets millennial and Gen Z shoppers. Within the past two years, Depop has grown its user base of stylists, designers, artists, vintage sellers and more, from 13 million to 21 million, And, the company claims, some 90% of its users are under the age of 26.</p>
<p>With the buy, Etsy is growth hacking its way into a younger generation, one that thinks thrifting is trendy and individualism is more interesting than fast fashion. But to me, combining two, two-sided marketplaces is not where the work stops. Etsy, with Depop under its umbrella, has an opportunity to be far more inventive with the way it combines operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal/">Etsy is acquiring UK-based social selling site Depop for $1.625B in a mostly cash deal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-asks-how-do-you-do-fellow-kids-with-1-6b-depop-purchase/">Etsy asks ‘How do you do, fellow kids?’ with a $1.6B Depop purchase</a></li>
</ul>
<p>First, Etsy needs to find other ways — beyond a new volume of fresh goods — to modernize its user experience, from homepage to checkout. Why? Because, and I can say this because I am technically part of the cohort, Gen Z is impatient. Sure, thrifting is trendy — but so is Amazon. The same generation that loves the idea of sporting the individual creative, also loves the idea of low-cost goods and two-day shipping. Sure, there are people that sit at either extreme. But I’d bet an unnecessary milk frother that the majority of Gen Z consumers sit in a more grey space.</p>
<p>Secondly, Etsy and Depop have an opportunity to invest in the growing wave of social shopping experiences. When I saw this news break, I immediately thought of The Landing, a company that is using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/the-landing-is-bringing-shoppable-social-and-collaboration-to-interior-design/">customizable and collaborative mood boards</a> as a shopping tool. The startup allows users to create mood boards from products that they can then shop from. Right now, it’s starting with interior design, but the vision can easily extend beyond home goods into clothing or CPG products. Similar to Pinterest, The Landing is trying to serve a set of consumers that like shopping in a collaborative, scroll-friendly way. I’m not asking Etsy to go full early-stage startup, but it would certainly be compelling if it found new ways for consumers to experience its broadened marketplace.</p>
<p>I’ll stop there, and end with this: As more and more companies prioritize serving Gen Z, strategy needs to be more than a land grab. <a href="https://twitter.com/_johnsonator/status/1400117894248341504">As one person put it</a>, Etsy is “ensuring the brand translates through different generational ethos,” with the acquisition. I’m excited to watch this case study in the making play out.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll discuss digital health, the beautiful world of S-1 filings and a Medium memo that has caused employees to leave the company. As always, you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_.</a> Scoops keep me happy, so if you have a tip on an early-stage deal or drama that I should know about, DM me or e-mail me at <a href="mailto:natasha.m@techcrunch.com">natasha.mascarenhas@techcrunch.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Digital health is late on this one</h2>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If my inbox is a fair indicator, every other startup right now is trying to get invited to one group chat: the digital health one. We’ve covered the boom in health tech on TC, but one question has haunted me for the past month: Where are all the PCOS startups? The condition, known as polycystic ovary syndrome, impacts one in 10 women and seems to mesh well with the loud drumbeat of personalized medicine. So, I went digging. </span></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>I learned that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">there is a massive opportunity for startups in hormonal health</a>, but the sector is still nascent due to an array of issues, both related to science and stigma.</p>

<p>The Equity team has probably spent about 3% of our collective recording time manifesting Robinhood’s S-1. Of course, at the time of writing this, our efforts have proven futile. But no worries, we have other public market news to keep you interested as we wait.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Confluent’s S-1 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/confluents-ipo-brings-a-high-growth-high-burn-saas-model-to-the-public-markets/">revealed slowing growth amid a history of impressive expansion</a>.

And Acorn, everyone’s favorite consumer fintech biz, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/acorns-spac-listing-depicts-a-consumer-fintech-business-with-a-saasy-revenue-mix/">listed as a SPAC.</a></p>
<h2>Medium’s extreme</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2161175" style="width: 3210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161175" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2161175 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medium-exodus1.jpg" alt="" width="3200" height="1800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medium-exodus1.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medium-exodus1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medium-exodus1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medium-exodus1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medium-exodus1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medium-exodus1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medium-exodus1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Medium-exodus1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3200px) 100vw, 3200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2161175" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>
<p>I published a scoop this week about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">latest tension at Medium</a>, a startup that has had its fair share of woes and pivots over the years. In April, Medium CEO Ev Williams wrote a memo about the company’s culture. Several employees argue the undertone of the memo has paved the way for an unsafe, “nod-and-smile” work environment, triggering more exits. Of the 241 people who started at Medium, some 50% of that pool are now gone.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Similar to Coinbase and Basecamp, Medium’s culture memo has made employees leave due to a change in mission. But, unlike the aforementioned companies, Medium’s memo has a more subtle undertone, exacerbated by tension after a unionization attempt failed the month prior.</p>
<p><em>And in the early-stage startup world: </em></p>
<ul>
<li>An early-stage startup decided to raise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/unit-tests-an-easier-way-for-workers-to-organize/?tpcc=ECTW2020">venture capital to scale its unionizing-as-a-service business across the country</a>. There’s an inherent tension there, but CEO James White explained why he thinks there is still demand for a mass tech solution in a broken process.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>Happy Saturday everyone. Despite it being a short week I feel pretty run over from the sheer news volume that we’ve put up with in the last few days. So let’s pause, repine and talk about SPACs as a nice little treat.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No, we’re not going through a SPAC investor presentation teardown today. Though we will dig into the <a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6010a862416e07401f64bc95/60b8b95610f77f32420593f8_2021.03.06%20Babylon%20Announcement%20Presentation.pdf">Babylon Health SPAC</a> on Monday. Instead, we’re discussing the SoFi and BarkBox blank-check deals.</p>
<p>Both began to trade this week after announcing their public debuts some time ago. And things went just fine? Here’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/sofi-shares-rise-after-debut-on-nasdaq.html">CNBC on SoFi’s first minutes</a> as a public company:</p>
<blockquote><p>SoFi, short for Social Finance, went public by merging with Social Capital Hedosophia Corp V, a blank-check company run by venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya. The stock closed up more than 12% to $22.65.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s not only a win for SoFi, but also for the somewhat-embattled Chamath Palihapitiya, whose SPAC bets have lost some luster in recent months; of course all SPAC-led debuts are speculative, but some retail traders appeared to index more on Palihapitiya’s reputation than fundamentals &#8212; what can you do!</p>
<p>BarkBox also did perfectly ok when it began to trade this week after its own SPAC combination was consummated, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/barkbox-stock-ipo-price-51622660797">as Barrons reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>BARK stock (ticker: BARK) jumped about 7.5% on Wednesday, to trade at around $12 in the afternoon. That gives the company a market value of close to $2.4 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>BarkBox stock has since given up some of its gains, but managed to get public without falling below its initial SPAC price. That’s a win given how market conditions have shifted since its flotation was initially announced.</p>
<p>Two wins in a single week is good news for SPAC-land and the myriad players on the blank-check and startup sides of the marketplace. Naturally two solid results does not a trend make, but it seems clear that for companies with material revenues the SPAC-route is not as potholed as we might have expected.</p>
<h2>The crypto wager</h2>
<p>If you think SPACs are generally annoying, just wait until we fuse the blank-check boom with crypto. As we are about to do!</p>
<p>This week Circle, a crypto-focused company with a particular taste for stablecoins, <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/circle-raises-440-million-eyes-possible-spac">raised $440 million</a>. That was an ocean of capital for a company best known for the USDC stablecoin; it is also <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/106473/after-440-million-fundraise-circle-is-said-to-be-considering-a-spac-deal">reported to be considering a SPAC-led IPO</a>.</p>
<p>What is a stablecoin? It’s a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a fiat currency. In the case of USDC, as you surmised, the coin is pegged to the US dollar. Stablecoins are useful fiat comps inside the crypto world and have proven to be hugely popular.</p>
<p>Circle’s USDC has $22.8 billion worth of supply in circulation, it claims, and several billion in daily transactions, per CoinMarketCap data. That’s not bad! But what isn’t as clear to your humble servant is precisely how the firm generates huge revenues at super-attractive gross margins. Which is what we’d expect from a company that just locked down nearly a half-billion dollars (or USDC, we suppose) in private capital in a single go.</p>
<p>So, for once, bring on the SPAC. Because we want to see the damn numbers, and quickly, given our sheer curiosity.</p>
<h2>Growth?</h2>
<p>Wrapping, Ron and I got to dig into a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/once-a-buzzword-digital-transformation-is-reshaping-markets/">public companies’ earnings reports the other day</a>, essentially discovering that the vaunted digital transformation <em>acceleration</em> is actually coming true for some companies.</p>
<p>This week’s news continued the argument. Zoom’s earnings, for example, backed up our thesis. Its revenues <a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-reports-financial-results-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2022">were up 191%</a> in Q1 F2022 compared to Q1 F2021. That’s just bonkers good.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum are Dropbox and Box, which are under fresh pressure this week from external investors. The pair of former private-market darlings have run into a growth wall and are taking incoming fire due to it. Grow or die is more than just startup advice. It’s what software companies need to do if they want to stay in charge of their own destiny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week was a busy one. Facebook held its developer conference F8 which delivered a lot of app-related news across its platform. Now, WWDC is just days away. We also broke a few big app stories this week, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">one about TikTok&#8217;s privacy policy</a> and its newly added permission to collect biometric data on U.S. users, including &#8220;faceprints and voiceprints.&#8221; Twitter added a subscription service, and Tinder tested group video chat.</p>

<p>WWDC&#8217;s big keynote<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/"> is kicking off next week</a> on June 7 at 1 PM ET. The livestream page is <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/event-stream/index.html">here</a>. While we may see new MacBook Pros, what software developers will care about are the forthcoming details about Apple&#8217;s latest OS releases and other new technologies. As to what they may include? <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/technology?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a> that iOS 15 will introduce a way for users to set different notification preferences and automatic replies, based on their current status (driving, working, sleeping, etc.) and an updated Lock Screen where this menu of choices would be accessible. iMessage may be upgraded to be more social, to better compete with Messenger and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, iPadOS could be getting the App Library and an upgraded Home Screen with support for widgets. (And you can fill the screen with just widgets, if you choose.) Or who knows! Until it&#8217;s official, it&#8217;s all a maybe!</p>
<p>But one potentially interesting rumor to watch for would be a new privacy feature that would show users which apps were collecting data about them. This builds on Apple&#8217;s investments in App Tracking Transparency and could make it more difficult for shady SDKs to stay in business.</p>
<p>There will likely be some updates coming to other Apple&#8217;s own apps, Siri, watchOS and more. It&#8217;s going to be a packed week &#8212; stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Ahead of WWDC, Apple also updated its report (conducted on its behalf via the Analysis Group) on App Store commerce. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/apples-app-store-facilitated-643-billion-in-commerce-up-24-from-last-year/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">says the App Store facilitated $643 billion in billings and sales in 2020</a></strong>, up 24% from the $519 billion seen the year prior. It also noted that about 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store actually took place outside its walls, meaning Apple took no commission on those purchases. This is up from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">85% figure reported last year</a>. The full report delves into other trends related to the pandemic&#8217;s impact, small and large businesses, and more. Apple initially commissioned the report to demonstrate how little business on the App Store is actually subject to App Store fees, but now it&#8217;s updated the report a year later. It&#8217;s interesting how much understanding Apple has about its App Store, especially when Tim Cook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony/">claimed to know so little</a> about several crucial figures.</p>

<p><strong>Apple also this week <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=36dv0725">unveiled</a> its 2021 Apple Design finalists.</strong> The awards honor apps and games that offer a combination of innovation, ingenuity and technical achievement &#8212; the latter which often means making great use of Apple technologies. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">finalists</a> span six categories: Inclusivity, Delight and Fun, Interaction, Social Impact, Visuals and Graphics, and Innovation.</p>
<p>Among the prospective winners are apps including snarky weather app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574">Carrot Weather</a> as well as the unique <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-weather/id1531063436">(Not Boring) Weather</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/briefs-mobile-news-app-aims-to-tackle-information-overload-and-media-bias/">short-form news service</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brief-unbiased-us-news/id1475186118">Brief</a>, mental wellness app and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">Google Play award winner</a> Loona, Editor&#8217;s Choice Genshin Impact, Snowman&#8217;s new kids app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/snowman-the-studio-behind-altos-adventure-and-others-launches-a-kids-app-company-pok-pok/">Pok Pok Playroom</a> and summertime fun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/retro-inspired-music-player-poolside-fm-brings-its-summery-fun-to-iphone/">music app Poolside FM</a>, and many others.</p>

<h3>Platforms: Google</h3>
<p><strong>Google this week <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/grow-your-indie-game-with-help-from.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FhsDu+%28Android+Developers+Blog%29">opened submissions</a> for two of its annual developer programs: the Indie Games Accelerator and the Indie Games Festival</strong>. The programs are designed to help small games studios grow on Google Play. This year, the programs will include more eligible markets and will be fully digital experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Google will restrict third-party apps from customizing the native Android Sharesheet in Android 12.</strong> Currently, the UI of the Sharesheet can differ from app to app, but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-blocks-third-party-apps-from-replacing-the-share-sheet/">XDA Developers reports</a> it will become more iOS-like, by offering a consistent menu across apps.</p>
<p><strong>Google is taking a cue from Apple by allowing users to opt out of personalization using the advertising ID in the Android Settings. Once users opt out, the advertising ID is disabled.</strong> The ID is a unique, user-resettable identifier provided by Google Play services. As part of a <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248/advertising-id">coming Google Play services update in late 2021</a>, the advertising identifier will be removed when the user opts out of tracking, and any attempt to access the identifier will only return a string of zeros. Google says ad and analytics service partners will receive notifications about a user&#8217;s preferences to help them with compliance. The change will roll out in late 2021 and will impact apps running on Android 12 devices initially, with an expansion to devices that support Google Play in early 2022.</p>

<h3>Messaging</h3>
<p><strong>WhatsApp<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458805/whatsapp-privacy-policy-no-plans-limit-functionality?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"> reversed course</a> and now says it won&#8217;t reduce the app&#8217;s functionality if users don&#8217;t agree to its new privacy policy</strong>. The rollout had led to a lot of backlash as it revealed the messaging app would begin sharing more info with Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>As part of its F8-related announcements, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-doubles-down-on-business-tools-with-whatsapp-api-updates-login-connect-for-messenger-and-more/">WhatsApp said</a> it would <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/?lang=en">update</a> its Business API to make it quicker for business to get started with its service.</strong> WhatsApp will make it faster to set up a business account (5 minutes instead of weeks), and will allow businesses to respond faster to inbound messages, as well as send messages to users who opted in. The business tool for customer care will allow up to 10 pre-written messages, among other updates.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told popular news outlet/leaker <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/will-cathcart-and-mark-zuckerberg-confirm-to-wabetainfo-3-features-to-come-on-whatsapp/">WaBetaInfo</a> that WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/zuckerberg-says-whatsapp-will-add-multi-device-support-introduce-view-once-disappearing-feature/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">will add multi-device support</a> for connecting up to four devices to one account.</strong> He also said WhatsApp will introduce a &#8220;view once&#8221; disappearing feature for photos and videos, and is working on an iPad app. The method of delivering this news is worth noting &#8212; WaBetaInfo is not a traditional news outlet, but more of an independent news portal of sorts. Zuckerberg has been taking Facebook news to non-traditional (and often far friendlier) channels as of late, including popping up in Clubhouse rooms and other independent outlets. Facebook clearly feels mainstream press has turned on it when they&#8230;<em>[checks notes]</em>&#8230;held Facebook accountable for its actions.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-opens-its-messenger-api-for-instagram-to-all-businesses/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">announced</a> the general availability of the Messenger API for Instagram</strong>. First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/facebook-introduces-a-new-messenger-api-with-support-for-instagram/">announced</a> last fall and rolling out in phases, the API offers a more efficient way for larger brands to handle a high volume of messages by allowing them to integrate Instagram messaging into the tools and applications they&#8217;re already using in-house to manage their Facebook conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Community social network Nextdoor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/not-on-nextdoor-you-can-still-grab-your-neighbors-stuff-on-free-finds/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">launched</a> a new feature called Free Finds that helps its users unload their unwanted stuff on others in their neighborhood</strong>.

<p><strong>Spotify rolled out a sort of mid-year version of Wrapped with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">the launch of the new personalized experience, Only You</a>.</strong> The feature offers insights about your music history in a sharable format, like your musical dinner party or audio birth chart, and other fun finds. Why now? Perhaps Spotify is heading off Apple Music news to come with a feature that reminds users it does personalization best?</p>
<p><strong>Spotify also added Blend</strong>, a way to create a playlist with any other Spotify user. The company offers a similar feature for users on its Family and Duo plans, but this new tool doesn&#8217;t require users to be in the same household.</p>

Like Apple Music, Apple TV is a service that needs to work across platforms in order to compete with rivals.

Students can pay $6.99/mo while the others can pay $9.99/mo. Military members and their families can lock in that rate for life. The company is facing a PR crisis after recalling treadmills that injured 70 and led to one infant death.</p>

Of course, this isn&#8217;t the only way police can acquire Ring videos, as the company has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/18/amazon-ring-largest-civilian-surveillance-network-us">many police partnerships across the U.S.</a> that let them acquire footage without a warrant.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.soleretriever.com/mobile-app">Sole Retriever</a> is a newly launched app that aims to be a sneakerhead&#8217;s dream.</strong></p>
<p>The app offers a one-stop shop for all things sneaker &#8212; including sneaker news, sneaker releases, sneaker raffles, a calendar of upcoming drops and more. The company says its goal is to democratize access to sneaker drops by making this info more accessible and convenient for consumers. Before its mobile launch, Sole Retriever had offered its service via the web only. Now it&#8217;s live on both <a href="https://www.soleretriever.com/mobile-app">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.soleretrieverapp.soleretriever">Android</a>.</p>
<p>Unique to the mobile experience is the ability to customize your alerts so you only hear about the raffles you want to know about &#8212; like those in the U.S., or only those that are in-store or online, for example. It also makes entering raffles easier with autofill features. Custom profiles that let you save the info for others who have agreed to let you enter their name and address to increase your chances of winning. And the app can save your logins for different retailers to make shopping easier.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>Sole Retriever is currently only available as a waitlist, <span style="color: #000000;">but TechCrunch readers can <span style="color: #ff0000;">bypass the waitlist!</span></span> Here&#8217;s how! </strong></em></span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Earlier today, TechCrunch&#8217;s Kirsten Korosec reported that the autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with one of three blank-check companies that have been formed to date by renowned entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus and a third partner in these deals, Michael Thompson, who long managed special situation funds. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, TechCrunch&#8217;s Kirsten Korosec reported that the autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">finalizing a deal</a> to merge with one of three blank-check companies that have been formed to date by renowned entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus and a third partner in these deals, Michael Thompson, who long managed special situation funds.</p>
<p>The development is intriguing for a lot of reasons, including because Aurora’s founders are big wheels in their industry (no pun intended), and having already acquired the self-driving unit of Uber in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/aurora-sends-offers-to-majority-uber-atg-employees-but-not-the-rd-lab/">complicated arrangement</a>, Aurora could, as a publicly traded entity, snap up even more rivals, given it would have a more liquid currency than it does right now.</p>
<p>Possible merits of the deal aside, the deal is also interesting because of Hoffman&#8217;s involvement. His venture firm, Greylock, is an investor in Aurora and has been since co-leading its Series A round in 2018, at which point Hoffman joined the board as a director. Now Hoffman’s SPAC is looking to take Aurora public at what we can safely assume is a much, much higher valuation than where it was valued back then. In fact, Korosec reports that one of the sticking points in this new deal is how much the company could conceivably be worth, writing that talk involved a $20 billion valuation at one point and is now closer to $12 billion, with the deal expected to be announced as early as next week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn’t the first time a SPAC sponsor has pursued an existing investment as a target. In just one similar case, famed VC Chamath Palihapitiya was an<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clover-health/company_financials/investors"> investor</a> in insurance company Clover through his firm Social Capital and as industry watchers will know, one of his blank-check companies merged with Clover <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clover-health-m-a-social-capital/clover-health-to-go-public-via-3-7-billion-deal-with-social-capital-idUSKBN26R1XB">last year</a>.</p>
<p>A representative for Palihapitiya declined to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-23/former-cypress-ceo-tj-rodgers-shows-up-on-two-sides-of-spac-deal">disclose to Bloomberg</a> whether or not he sold the stake prior to the SPAC deal, but legally, it doesn’t matter anyway. All a SPAC sponsor need do right now is write a lengthy disclosure when raising a SPAC that ultimately says, ‘Hey, I might use the capital I’m raising for this blank-check company to buy another company where I already have a financial interest, and here&#8217;s how that&#8217;s going to work.&#8217;</p>
<p>The question is whether such rules around potential conflicts &#8212; or lack of rules &#8212; will continue to exist indefinitely. The SEC is clearly taking a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/accounting-reporting-warrants-issued-spacs">closer look</a> right now at SPACs, and while it offered guidance specifically around conflicts of interest <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-special-purpose-acquisition-companies">last December</a>, saying that they make the agency a little nervous and could sponsors please disclose as much as possible to everyone involved in a deal, there’s a new administration in Washington and a new agency head in SEC Chief Gary Gensler, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see more being done on this front than we’ve witnessed to date.</p>
<p>There perhaps should be. SPACs already have a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6eb655a2-21f5-4313-b287-964a63dd88b3">lousy reputation</a> because investors lose money on the majority of them, and notwithstanding the esteem of individuals like Hoffman, these obvious conflicts of interest &#8212; let&#8217;s face it &#8212; generally smell bad.</p>
<p>Yes, there’s a strong argument that a SPAC sponsor who has been long involved with a target company knows better the value of that company than anyone else. That inside knowledge cuts both ways, though. The target <em>could</em> be an amazing company that just needs a way to go public more quickly than might be possible with a traditional IPO. Let&#8217;s assume for now that Aurora falls into this camp. But the target could also need to bailed out by SPAC sponsors who have a vested interest in the company and know its prospects may dim otherwise.</p>
<p>Do most retail investors know the difference between the two? It&#8217;s doubtful, and in this go-go market, they seem bound to get hurt if regulators continue to turn a blind eye to the practice. That&#8217;s leaving some industry observers to wonder of the SEC: what&#8217;s it waiting for?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM that also has backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Microsoft and Honda, has secured a permit that will allow the company to shuttle passengers in its test vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M387/K064/387064893.PDF">permit</a>, issued by the California Public Utilities Commission as part of its driverless pilot program, is one of several regulatory requirements autonomous vehicle companies must meet before they can deploy commercially. This permit is important — and Cruise is the first to land this particular one — but it does not allow the company to charge passengers for any rides in test AVs.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to launch a commercial service for passengers here in the state of California, you need both the California DMV and the California PUC to issue deployment permits. Today we are honored to have been the first to receive a driverless autonomous service permit to test transporting passengers from the California PUC,&#8221; Prashanthi Raman, Cruise&#8217;s director of Government Affairs said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are two regulatory bodies, the CPUC and the California Department of Motor Vehicles, that dictate the testing and eventual deployment of autonomous vehicles. The California DMV regulates testing of autonomous vehicles with and without safety operators. About 55 companies have permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver. Driverless testing permits, in which a human operator is not behind the wheel, have become the new milestone and a required step for companies that want to launch a commercial robotaxi or delivery service in the state. AutoX, Baidu, Cruise, Nuro, Pony.ai, Waymo, WeRide and Zoox have driverless permits with the DMV.</p>
<p>The final step with the DMV, which only Nuro has achieved, is a deployment permit. This permit allows Nuro to deploy at a commercial scale. Nuro&#8217;s vehicles can&#8217;t hold passengers, just cargo, which allows the company to bypass the CPUC permitting process.</p>
<p>Over at the CPUC, there are &#8220;drivered&#8221; and &#8220;driverless&#8221; permits, which allow companies to give rides in their autonomous vehicles. Aurora, AutoX, Cruise, Deeproute.ai, Pony, Voyage (which was acquired by Cruise) Waymo and Zoox all have &#8220;drivered&#8221; permits. Cruise is the first to snag the driverless permit.</p>
<p>Any company that wants to eventually shuttle and charge passengers for rides in their robotaxis have to secure all of these permits from the DMV and CPUC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Issuance of this first driverless permit for the CPUC&#8217;s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service Pilot Programs is a significant milestone. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform our transportation system and communities by solving individual mobility needs, improving roadway safety, and moving goods throughout the state sustainably and efficiently,&#8221; Commissioner Genevieve Shiroma said in statement. &#8220;The effective deployment of autonomous vehicles can also transform vehicle manufacturing, maintenance, and service business models to create new jobs and industries for the California workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, the CPUC<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> approved two new programs to allow permitted companies to provide and charge for shared rides in autonomous vehicles as long as they can navigate the lengthy regulatory process. The decision came after months of lobbying by the AV industry pushing the </span>CPUC to consider a rule change that would allow for operators to charge a fare and offer shared rides in driverless vehicles.</p>
<p>The CPUC said Cruise, along with any other company that eventually participates in the pilot, must submit quarterly reports about the operation of their vehicles providing driverless AV passenger service. Companies must also submit a passenger safety plan that outlines their plans for protecting passenger safety for driverless operations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 4, 2021. What a week, yeah? That was four super-packed days. But don’t think that the pace of news is about to slow down. It’s not. Next week is Apple’s big WWDC developer event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">which we previewed here</a>. And TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">next event focused on mobility is just around the corner</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s to catching up on sleep this weekend. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-will-reconsider-trumps-ban-in-two-years/"><strong>Facebook can’t quit Trump</strong></a><strong>:</strong> News broke today that Facebook will reconsider its ban of former American president and wannabe autocrat Donald Trump in two years’ time. The decision fits inside of Facebook’s larger struggle to decide the rules for its hugely popular social platforms.</li>
<li><strong>The IPO wave continues:</strong> Venture-backed startups are filing to go public at a rapid clip. Today it was Xometry (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/xometry-is-taking-its-excess-manufacturing-capacity-business-public/">our first look here</a>) and SentinelOne (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cybersecurity-sentinelone-ipo/">more here</a>). Expect to see more filings as a busy Q3 pipeline forms.</li>
<li><strong>Governments v. Tech:</strong> The world’s governments continue to push tech companies around. Sometimes for reasons that make some sense, as with the U.S. government’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/white-house-expands-investment-ban-on-chinese-tech-and-telecom-companies/">refreshed</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/white-house-expands-investment-ban-on-chinese-tech-and-telecom-companies/"> crack</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/white-house-expands-investment-ban-on-chinese-tech-and-telecom-companies/">down</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/white-house-expands-investment-ban-on-chinese-tech-and-telecom-companies/"> on certain Chinese tech companies</a>. And sometimes for reasons that do not, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">like Nigeria trying to ban Twitter late this week</a>. Regardless of your politics, expect more from this space every week until the end of time.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups and VC</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">Flink raises quick $240M</a>:</strong> After operating in the market for just half a year, German grocery delivery startup Flink has raised a quarter billion dollars. Flink is German for quick, which relates to both its delivery timeline and its venture capital cadence.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/softbank-invests-150m-in-gmb-a-mexico-city-based-investment-platform/"><strong>GBM raises “up to” $150M from SoftBank</strong></a><strong>:</strong> When is a startup not a startup? When it’s 35 years old. That’s the case with Mexican company Grupo Bursátil Mexicano, or GBM. But as TechCrunch reports, the company is seeing hypergrowth, expanding from “having 38,000 investment accounts in January 2020 to more than 650,000 by year’s end.” It is not over the 1,000,000 account mark. Not bad.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/as-buy-now-pay-later-startups-keep-raising-capital-a-dive-into-klarna-afterpay-and-affirms-earnings/"><strong>The BNPL market is growing quickly, still expensive</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A TechCrunch analysis of recent buy-now-pay-later companies that are big enough to report earnings indicates that the popular startup market is still growing quickly, but that few if any companies working on the consumer sales model are actually making money. Yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/rebranded-toyota-ventures-invests-300-million-in-emerging-tech-and-carbon-neutrality/"><strong>Toyota commits $300M to startups</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Toyota’s AI-focused venture capital fund is AI-branded no more, and TechCrunch reports that the corporate VC group is “commemorating its new identity by investing an additional $300 million in emerging technologies and carbon neutrality.” That’s a lot of bread to help save the world.</li>
<li><strong>Auto SPAC:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">TechCrunch broke the news</a> that “autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the newest special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman.”</li>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news is essentially a huge slug of Facebook. So, if you are irked by spending more time than you have to considering Zuckerberg’s empire, feel free to move on to the Community section of today’s missive!</p>
<p>Facebook land was more today than just the news <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-will-reconsider-trumps-ban-in-two-years/">regarding former U.S. President Donald Trump</a>. Big Blue also got busy buying a gaming company and getting hit with antitrust probes in the U.K. and EU.</p>
<p>On the gaming front, Facebook announced today that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-buys-studio-behind-roblox-like-crayta-gaming-platform/">it is buying Crayta</a>, which TechCrunch described as a ”a Roblox-like game creation platform.” Roblox, of course, recently went public via a direct listing after seeing its fortunes rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. TechCrunch also wrote that Facebook has been buying one-off VR startups as well. So, there’s something of a larger gaming push afoot at the company, perhaps. If there is any rule to Facebook’s actions, it’s that if it sees any other company doing a thing and making money, it has to copy it.</p>
<p>To close out Big Tech for the week, Facebook is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebooks-use-of-ad-data-triggers-antitrust-probes-in-uk-and-eu/">under new scrutiny by both the U.K. and the EU</a>, this time for its use of data from advertising customers and the folks who use its single-sign-on tool. TechCrunch reported that the investigations are “looking at whether it uses this data as an unfair lever against competitors in markets such as classified ads.”</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Thanks for joining us yesterday for <a href="https://twitter.com/EthanChoi7/status/1400555790021300227">our chat about the future of e-commerce</a>. It’s nice to be able to dive deeper into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce/">the things we write</a>. Twitter Spaces was fun to use, but sadly <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonMChu">our friend Brandon Chu from Shopify</a> wasn’t able to join from his Android device (yay beta apps!). Just means we’ll have to do it again.</p>
<p>Speaking of doing Twitter Spaces again, we’re going to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">pregaming WWDC</a> on Monday, led by our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/brian-heater/">hardware editor, Brian Heater</a>. We’ll start bright and early at 8:30 a.m. PDT/11:30 a.m. EDT, so bring all of your thoughts and questions then.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the complications of meeting new people in the midst of a global pandemic, dating apps have shown <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tinder-bumble-and-hinge-show-surge-in-americans-looking-for-love-online-11613246400">a recent spike</a> in both downloads and usage. Now, as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available, it&#8217;s likely that this trend will continue.</p>
<p>In other words, Tinder is anticipating a &#8220;<a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-04-Tinder-Gives-Members-More-Control-With-New-Feature-Allowing-You-to-Block-Your-Ex">post-pandemic uncuffing season</a>,&#8221; and they&#8217;re rolling out a new feature to prepare. Now, users can upload their phone contacts to select certain people that they&#8217;d rather not see on the app, whether that&#8217;s an ex, a co-worker or a family member. According to a survey commissioned by Tinder, 40% of people have found an ex-partner on the app, 24% have encountered a family member and one in 10 have even encountered their professor.</p>
<p>Sure, it would be pretty awkward to see your ex out on the dating market again. But the new feature is more interesting for the user safety aspect. For example, if someone has previously encountered a stalker or otherwise abusive figure &#8212; whether on the app or off &#8212; they now have a tool to directly block them on Tinder.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, instead of creating a simple form where you could enter the phone number or email address of the abuser, Tinder is asking for permission to access the user&#8217;s entire contacts list. Ostensibly, this is for ease of use &#8212; Tinder even claims it only keeps on hand the contact information for those you&#8217;ve blocked, and not your entire address book &#8212; but users may still be wary. For years, social apps have used address book uploads as a big data grab from users, with little benefit beyond friend-finding functionality. More recently, this trend has reemerged with new apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/">Poparazzi</a> and Clubhouse. The latter thankfully<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22332182/clubhouse-privacy-contacts-invites-update"> stopped</a> the practice in March after user outcry.</p>

<p>“We’re rolling out Block Contacts as an additional resource empowering members with peace of mind by helping create a worry-free space for them to spark new connections,&#8221; said Bernadette Morgan, Group Product Manager, Trust &amp; Safety at Tinder, in a <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-04-Tinder-Gives-Members-More-Control-With-New-Feature-Allowing-You-to-Block-Your-Ex">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Tinder tested the Block Contacts feature in India, Korea and Japan, reporting that members who used the feature blocked about a dozen people on average.</p>
<p>To use the feature, go to Settings under your profile icon, select &#8220;Block Contacts,&#8221; then grant the app permission. To block individuals, you can&#8217;t rely on whether or not they were blocked on your phone. You&#8217;ll need to select each person you want to block under the &#8220;Contacts&#8221; tab then tap &#8220;Block Contacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>This user interface makes it easier to block abusers and exes, but it&#8217;s also designed for people who want to block a large number of people &#8212; like everyone in their family or close friend group. That makes the feature a big perk for those using Tinder&#8217;s app to cheat, too.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Tinder is strict about requiring a valid phone number to register, though it&#8217;s not impossible for people to circumvent the system by registering with a Google Voice number, for example. So, regardless of which safety features Tinder rolls out, proceed wisely.</span></p>
