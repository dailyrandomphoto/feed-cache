										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase is acquiring the Bangalore-headquartered startup Agara, which operates an AI-powered customer support platform, the two said Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency exchange looks to make it easier for users to join the service and seek help.</p>
<p>The firms didn’t share the financial details of the acquisition, but the size of the deal is between $40 million and $50 million, two people familiar with the matter told me. A Coinbase spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment. Agara co-founder and chief executive Abhimanyu declined to comment.</p>
<p>Four-year-old Agara, which has operations in India and the U.S., had raised about $7 million from Blume Ventures, RTP Global, UTEC Japan, and Kleiner Perkins prior to the acquisition.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227515" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://agara.ai">Agara </a>has built deep expertise in machine learning and natural language processing that it uses to improve user experience. The startup has amassed several larger customers across the globe and offers integrations with a number of popular services such as Salesforce, Shopify, and Twilio. After the acquisition, Agara will shift focus to Coinbase, Abhimanyu told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“We started the firm largely looking at two things. One was customer experience and support. The second was machine learning. The idea was to create an ML tech stack and apply that to customer care,” said Abhimanyu. “Some of the more complicated things we do are around phone calls. We have been working to automate much of, if not all, of the support that happens through phone calls,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup’s tech team will join Coinbase as part of the deal, he said.</p>
<p>“We plan to leverage Agara’s powerful technology to automate and enhance our customer experience (CX) tools. Improving our CX remains a top priority for Coinbase &#8212; in the past few months we have increased our support staff headcount by 5x and announced that we’ll deliver 24/7 phone support and live messaging by end of year. Through this acquisition, we’ll be able to provide our customers with new personalized, intelligent, and real-time support options,” said Manish Gupta, EVP of Engineering at Coinbase, in a blog post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moka, a six-year-old Chinese startup that wants to make human resources management easier with software, said today it has closed a $100 million Series C round.</p>
<p>The startup aims to automate the entire process of talent management, from hiring to retaining existing staff. For example, it can automatically collect post-interview feedback from candidates and store that information in a database. It can also <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">alert employers when staff make changes to their resumes, which signifies they may be mulling new opportunities. </span></p>
<p>The latest investment was led by Tiger Global with participation from Blue Lake Capital, GL Ventures &#8212; the early-stage arm of the storied Hillhouse Capital, GSR Ventures and GGV Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227497" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new round came just over a year after Moka <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/moka-43-million-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earmarked $43 million</a> in a Series B round. The company said it has reached the &#8220;unicorn&#8221; status but declined to disclose its exact valuation. Its streak of fundraising success no doubt reflects rising investor interest in startups that help boost enterprise productivity, as consumer-oriented internet services, from gaming to short videos, face enhanced regulatory restrictions.</p>
<p>Moka said it has accumulated over 1,500 paid clients including Tencent, Xiaomi, McDonald&#8217;s, and Arm China, with an annual retention rate of over 110%. Its CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guoxing-li-97429b3a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Li Guoxing</a>, a Stanford grad, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UakFpel_DrJwuWjQAChh0g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> in a previous speech that Moka&#8217;s products are particularly popular amongst Chinese internet firms.</p>

Both companies are based in Singapore and operate in Southeast Asian markets. The deal was done in stock and cash, and terms were undisclosed.</p>
<p>After the merger closes, ShopBack will own all of Hoolah, but the BNPL service&#8217;s brand, app and website will continue to operate as before, ShopBack founder and chief executive officer Henry Chan told TechCrunch. The merger means new features will be added to ShopBack’s platform, evolving it from a loyalty app for e-commerce purchases to enabling transactions with BNPL options.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Rivian hopes to raise up $8.4 billion in its initial public offering, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488ds1a.htm">regulatory filing</a> posted Monday.</p>
<p>The company, which is backed by Amazon, said in the filing that it plans to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also have an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares. If underwriters exercise that option, Rivian would raise as much as $9.6 billion.</p>
<p>Based on the number of outstanding shares, that would put its market valuation at about $53 billion. If employee stock options and other restricted shares are considered, Rivian&#8217;s valuation could be as high as $60 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Rivian filed October 1 to become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/">publicly traded company</a> in the United States. The S-1 document did not disclose the targeted share price at the time. An amended document filed Monday provided the new information, which included interest from repeat backer Amazon and newcomer Blackstone in Rivian.</p>
<p>Amazon, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Coatue Management, Franklin Templeton, Capital Research Global Investors, D1 Capital Partners LP, Third Point LLC, funds affiliated with Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Dragoneer Investment Group LLC and certain entities affiliated with Soros Fund Management LLC have indicated an interest in buying up to $5 billion of shares of Class A common stock.</p>
<p>A recent filing by Amazon shows the e-commerce giant already holds a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">20% stake in Rivian</a>.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s filing was been one of the most anticipated of the year; now attention has turned to its public debut on the Nasdaq exchange. Rivian will trade under the ticker symbol RIVN.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The final version of iOS 15.0 was released on September 20. While there are no major changes in the OS itself, Apple touts this new wave of updates will present faster, more stable and convenient operations for users.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s really important are a number of updates that will greatly affect developers and their apps’ presence on the App Store. There hasn’t been this big of a change since iOS 11 was released over four years ago.</p>
<p>With iOS 15.0&#8217;s new updates come new opportunities for developers, giving them more freedom and opportunity to test and market their work across this OS. Let’s break down how developers can make the most of iOS 15.0 and what these updates mean for the wider app community.</p>
<h2>Optimizing your product page with A/B testing</h2>
<p>Updated product pages are the most anticipated feature of this update. Developers now have access to a tool for testing icons, screenshots and videos that are accessible directly from the App Store Connect management console, which will help gauge the impact of visuals on potential users.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It’s been a long time since the app community has seen such significant updates in the name of user experience.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Within the App Store ecosystem, the icon being tested must be inside the app build and it must successfully pass the App Review approval process before it can become available to all users.</p>
<p>During this process, moderators check the app for prohibited content, inconsistencies, etc. that may impact user experience. How does this impact uploads? We’ve already seen the results through updates within the Google Play Store (which has a similar implementation), where the app icon for testing can be uploaded without an app update and does not require approval from the moderators.</p>
<p>Screenshots and videos have a similar process. All of these elements must be reviewed first, and only then can they be used for testing purposes. The final difference is that the ability to test the subtitle (a brief description of the app) in Google Play is not available in App Store Connect.</p>
<p>This matters because developers can finally try different icons, subtitles, etc. to measure what may have the most impact on consumers checking out a product page. These results are available in the App Analytics section of the App Store Connect console. Developers can evaluate changes in conversion, compare page performance and decide whether to keep the new screenshots/icons or roll back to older assets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to Max Q. It feels odd to be living in a time when companies are announcing their plans to develop commercial space stations and yet, here we are! Read on for news from Sierra Space, Blue Origin, Boeing and others on their plans for a station, called Orbital Reef. Plus this week, another space SPAC and more.</p>

<h2>Orbital Reef is claiming its slice of LEO real estate</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s get into it: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blue-origin-boeing-and-others-join-sierra-space-to-build-commercial-space-station/">Sierra Space, Blue Origin and Boeing are teaming up</a> to send the spacecraft to orbit in the second half of the decade. The planned station, called “Orbital Reef,” will also include tech and services from Redwire Space, Genesis Engineering and Arizona State University.</p>
<p>The news comes less than a week after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">Voyager Space, Nanoracks and Lockheed Martin</a> laid out their own plans for a commercial space station, which the group says will launch in 2027. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/axiom-space-raises-130-million-for-its-commercial-space-station-ambitions/">Axiom Space</a> is also planning a commercial station.</p>
<p>The big questions that remain: how much it&#8217;s going to cost. None of the executives would say. The other major piece of the puzzle is the launch capabilities of Blue Origin’s New Glenn, Boeing’s Starliner and Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser spaceplane. None of these vehicles have yet reached orbit, and the team wants their commercial station in space by the latter half of the decade.</p>

<h2>Satellite manufacturer Terran Orbital is going public via SPAC merger</h2>
<p>The trend of space companies heading to the public markets via SPAC mergers is not over yet. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/satellite-manufacturer-terran-orbital-to-go-public-in-1-58b-spac-merger/">Terran Orbital, a leading manufacturer of small satellites, is going public</a> in a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Tailwind Two Acquisition Corp. The deal has a post-transaction enterprise value of $1.58 billion and will furnish the company with around $470 million.</p>
<p>Terran Orbital is a contract manufacturer of satellites, working primarily with the government. The company will be opening the world&#8217;s largest spacecraft manufacturing facility in Florida. It also has plans to launch and operate its own satellite constellation and to deliver satellite imagery as a service. In a statement, CEO Marc Bell called it the new SaaS: “Satellites-as-a-Service.”</p>
<h2>Other news from TechCrunch</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/gitai-successfully-demos-autonomous-robot-inside-the-international-space-station/">Gitai Japan</a> successfully completed a technology demo of its robotic arm aboard the International Space Station, a major milestone in the Tokyo-based startup&#8217;s goal of commercializing its space robots. Gitai has a really fascinating vision for the future of space, which sees robots as composing the labor force in off-world colonies on the moon and Mars.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 1, 2021. TechCrunch hopes that you had a lovely Halloween, if you celebrate. Yes, your humble scribe had some leftover candy for breakfast. No, he doesn’t feel well.</p>
<p>That it’s finally November means that our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">two-day space-themed event is now <em>next month</em></a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/learn-about-the-benefits-of-on-orbit-operations-and-servicing-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/">more here</a>)! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227274" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">Nubank files to go public:</a> </strong>Brazilian neobank Nubank has filed to go public, and TechCrunch has first notes out concerning its economics. Our read of its filing left us impressed at its low-cost customer acquisition, ability to drive long-term revenue from its customers and the fact that its sales and marketing spend is minimal compared to its aggregate revenues. More to come on the intricacies of its business model.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/epic-pulls-plug-on-fortnite-in-china/">Epic pulls Fortnite from China:</a></strong> The China-world decoupling takes on many forms. One way to view it is through a rising inability for non-Chinese companies to bring their products to the country’s shores. LinkedIn is out. And now Epic Games is ending its work to make a Fortnite version for China, despite having Tencent as a key shareholder.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/chromebook-sales-fall-hard-in-in-q3-as-education-market-becomes-saturated/">Chromebook sales crash:</a> </strong>News that global PC sales fell 2% in the third quarter might sound like bad news, but computer sales are still above their pre-pandemic levels, Ron Miller reports. But of the PC varieties out there, it appears that Google’s own Chromebook effort is taking the most stick. It dropped from 18% market share to just 9%. Good news for Windows, we reckon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into our regular run of startup news, let’s talk satellites. News that gigantic private company SpaceX’s Starlink has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/spacexs-starlink-forms-india-subsidiary-aims-to-deploy-200000-active-terminals-by-2022/">formed an Indian subsidiary</a> was not a surprise. But that it came the same day that Amazon’s Project Kuiper <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/amazons-project-kuiper-wants-to-launch-two-prototype-satellites-by-the-end-of-next-year/">wants to put two prototype satellites into orbit</a> by the end of next year caught our eye. We’re seeing American companies continue to push ahead on space tech despite a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/13/space-the-newest-frontier-for-resurgent-chinese-pride">more national-level space rivalry</a> forming between China and the United States.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/octoml-raises-85m-for-it-for-its-machine-learning-acceleration-platform/"><strong>OctoML raises $85M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The work of building and deploying machine learning (ML) models is big business. Startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/mage-aims-to-be-the-stripe-for-ai-raises-6-3m-for-developer-tools-to-build-ai-into-apps/">Mage</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/spice-ai-wants-to-help-developers-build-smarter-applications/">Spice AI</a> are working in similar areas of technology. Or more simply, in time there will be ample tooling to help companies of all sizes — and, we presume, levels of technical know-how — to get busy with ML at scale without having to fight tooth and nail to hire a full-stack, in-house data science team.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/zendesk-moves-into-customer-experience-data-with-4-13b-surveymonkey-deal/"><strong>Zendesk v. Twilio?</strong></a> Everyone wants to own customer data. Last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">Twilio announced a multibillion dollar deal</a> to buy Segment, allowing it to scoot into the customer data world (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilios-3-2b-segment-acquisition-about-helping-developers-build-data-fueled-apps">more here</a>). And more recently Zendesk announced that it was dropping even more billions of dollars for SurveyMonkey, which will help it also better understand customers. They are not yet competing directly, but as we see tech companies get busy buying rivals, it’s going to be a recurring theme that two giants that previously played somewhat separately are now a bit closer to one another.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/walden-catalyst-focuses-on-deep-tech-startups-in-the-u-s-europe-and-israel-with-a-newly-launched-550m-fund/"><strong>$550M for hard venture bets:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Any yahoo can stick $50 million into a growth-stage software startup that is cruising toward an IPO. Just make sure that its various SaaS ratios are in good shape and write the check. Walden Catalyst just put together a huge fund to invest in harder technology solutions to perhaps more intractable problems. The result <em>should </em>be higher returns on home runs. (TechCrunch also covered a new fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/30/how-vcs-are-adapting-to-meet-an-increasingly-global-startup-market/">from White Star over the weekend</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/mosaic-raises-44m-to-automate-the-construction-planning-process/"><strong>Mosaic raises $44M for its construction tech:</strong></a> By working to automate certain parts of the residential construction process, Mosaic wants to lower the cost of such projects. Given that many nations around the world are enjoying related housing crises, anything to get more homes built sounds like a win to us.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/when-i-work-an-messaging-app-that-lets-shift-based-teams-schedule-work-and-more-raises-200m/"><strong>When I Work wants to help you tell others when you work:</strong></a> Shift-based work has often been organized, managed and crisis-controlled via text messages and phone calls. Stonehenge-era tech, in other words. When I Work wants to bring modern messaging to shift-based workers, allowing them to better swap, miss and snag work as they need to. It also just raised $200 million.</li>
<li>Finally from our startup-related notes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/kenyas-twiga-raises-50m-to-scale-affordable-food-solutions-across-africa/"><strong>Twiga raised $50M to scale its food logistics work in both Kenya and surrounding nations</strong></a>. As our own Tage Kene-Okafor notes, Africans spend more of their household income on food than folks living on other continents. It wants to shake up that dynamic and bring lower-cost foods to more, by our read.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When should your B2C startup enter a new market?</h2>
<p>Many entrepreneurs say fortune favors the brave, but French microbiologist Louis Pasteur got it right: Fortune favors the prepared mind.</p>
<p>Bold is good, but smart is better, especially when it comes to expanding the range of a B2C startup. Introducing yourself to customers (not to mention regulators) in a foreign market comes with a lot of known unknowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that through luck or ingenuity, your business has thrived in your home country with minimal marketing spend, but there is absolutely no guarantee this will happen abroad,&#8221; says Jim Mann, director of acquisitions at Thrasio, a consumer goods company.</p>

The new feature essentially allows users to respond to other users’ Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic. The global launch comes as Instagram initially tested the feature in Indonesia and Japan last month. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455235802682646530?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that it’s introducing a new &#8220;Add Yours&#8221; sticker that creates public threads in Stories. The new feature essentially allows users to respond to other users’ Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic. The global launch comes as Instagram initially <a href="https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/instagram-rolls-trial-run-add-095810535.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested</a> the feature in Indonesia and Japan last month.</p>
<p>The interactive sticker can be used to create a content chain where each user adds their own Story. For instance, a user can post an “Outfit of the Day” Story and then prompt their followers to add their own via the sticker.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Add Yours = a sticker that creates public threads in Stories <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f91d.png" alt="🤝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227306" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With custom prompts and public responses, you can share the sticker and see who responds to it in their own Stories. <a href="https://t.co/C9AXiFEo92">pic.twitter.com/C9AXiFEo92</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Instagram (@instagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455235802682646530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“With custom prompts and public responses, you can share the sticker and see who responds to it in their own Stories,” the social media giant said in a tweet.</p>
<p>You can access the new feature by selecting the sticker tool from the top navigation bar when you capture or upload content to your Story. From there, you can select the &#8220;Add Yours&#8221; sticker to start a public thread. Alternatively, you can respond to an &#8220;Add Yours&#8221; sticker by clicking on it and adding your own Story to take part in a chain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Although the feature is aimed at getting users to collaborate, it can also be seen as a way to discover more people to follow. Once you click on the sticker in someone’s Story, you’ll be able to see everyone who has taken part in the thread and view their Stories.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the new sticker is somewhat similar to TikTok’s “duet” feature, which allows users to create content featuring an original video. However, Instagram’s feature slightly differs, as it allows you to see everyone’s additional posts in the content chain in one place, whereas TikTok currently doesn’t surface all of the duetted videos that were posted from an original TikTok in one place.</p>
<p>The launch of this latest sticker comes as Instagram made its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/instagram-rolls-out-the-ability-for-all-users-to-share-links-in-stories-via-link-stickers/"> Link sticker</a> in Stories available to all users last week after previously limiting it to businesses and high-profile creators. The global availability of these two new stickers aims to give users ways to collaborate and share their interests, as Instagram continues to compete with other social media platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Switzerland-based <a href="http://mictic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mictic</a> has created a pair of wearables that turns thin air into your concert hall. Imagine a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXn4_JkVFVo">theremin</a> without the theremin, hooked up to a clever loop station, and you&#8217;ve got the right idea. Just from the demos and descriptions, it&#8217;s the kind of startup you&#8217;d scratch your head over and talk about in the bar after a long day of CES, for it to never be heard of again. Mictic, however, rose above the gimmicks sufficiently to raise a $2.5 million seed round from <a href="https://www.ptkcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PTK Capital</a> &#8212; and even adds music megastar Moby to its cap table.</p>
<p>The Mictic device is a pair of wristbands that includes sensors to measure your movements. It connects to your smartphone, and the app unlocks music-making creativity for beginners with no music skills at all. At launch, the app will offer 15 sounds and soundscapes, including a variety of musical styles and genres.</p>
<p>The startup has one of the stranger inception stories &#8212; it started with a game of badminton. The founders went along to a game of tennis, which was canceled due to rain, and the game was moved indoors instead. The founders were discussing how anti-climactic the game is, from an aural enjoyment point of view. So they went and hacked together a product that turns every slap of the shuttlecock into an epic explosion or other sound effects. From there, the team added a bunch of other soundscapes, changed the interface and ended up building a full-on musical instrument.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226356" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to the pre-made soundscapes, the company&#8217;s founders are excited about the potential of their product as a more serious musical instrument.</p>
<p>&#8220;People can connect with Ableton, and they can use Mictic the same way they would use any MIDI controller. We hope that people will find new ways of using our product,&#8221; says the company&#8217;s CTO Matthias Frey. &#8220;We are also planning to expand our platform business in the very near future. Once the product is out, one of the next steps for users is for them to be able to create their own soundscapes quite easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding round will enable the company to grow further and to test out its product in the market. Mictic currently consists of 10 people, and it is hoping to grow further.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really had to bootstrap for a while and then we built this fundraising round. Our next step is to put the product out as soon as possible. We&#8217;re proud of it and we are looking forward to getting a sense of how people are planning to use the product,&#8221; says Mictic&#8217;s CEO Mershad Javan. He agrees that $2.5 million isn&#8217;t going to be enough to fulfil all of the company&#8217;s dreams; &#8220;It&#8217;s not a whole lot of money, but to us it is a matter of shipping our product to our customers, and then hopefully ramp up from there. As soon as we can actually bring in some key data and business insights, we can continue to grow and probably raise another round of funding fairly quickly after.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its press materials, Mictic makes a big deal of Moby being on the company&#8217;s cap table, and is excited about the potential for collaboration and advisor potential, but admits that the musician was a relatively minor participant in the round, investing less than 10% of the $2.5 million round. In addition to investing directly in Mictic, the musician is a limited partner (i.e. an investor) in PTK Capital, the venture firm leading Mictic&#8217;s round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mictic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mictic opened up for preorders over the weekend</a>, and the weird and wonderful musical instruments can be yours for a cool $119. The company expects to be shipping in the next month or so.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Op71GlLg72U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Update: An error snuck in, and we stated that the Mictic product cost $199. That has been updated to the correct price: $119</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wisconsin-based generator producer Generac <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/01/2324831/0/en/Generac-to-Acquire-ecobee-Inc.html">today announced plans to acquire Ecobee</a>. A bit of a surprising match on the face of it, though not the first time we’ve seen a more traditional company has expanded into the smart home space through this kind of acquisition &#8212; take Assa Abloy’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/swedish-lock-maker-assa-abloy-set-to-acquire-august-home/">purchase</a> of August Home a few years back.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it’s the easiest way to kickstart new tech development for a company that’s been around for a long time &#8212; more than 60 years, in Generac’s case. The company will pay $200 million in cash, plus $450 million in stock to Ecobee’s shareholders. If additional targets are hit before closing, Generac will toss in up to $120 million more in stock, totaling up to $770 million.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Ecoboee was founded in 2007, and has since become one of the bigger names in the connected thermostat space, alongside companies like Nest, which was acquired way back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/google-just-bought-connected-device-company-nest-for-3-2b-in-cash/?_ga=2.51767465.1228581280.1635780577-1197876916.1629943591">2014</a>. Nest would eventually become Google’s de facto smart home brand. And, like Nest, Ecobee subsequently expanded into additional smart home devices, including security cameras and sensors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227290" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Generac’s evolution into an energy technology solutions company creates many opportunities to integrate our ecobee products with their residential device offerings, enabling direct monitoring and control of a significant portion of the home’s electrical load,” Ecobee CEO Stuart Lombard said in a statement. “We are excited to join the Generac team so together we can deliver a cleaner, more resilient and sustainable energy future for our customers and communities.”</p>
<p>Ecobee has raised around $150 million, including investments from Amazon’s Alexa Fund. For a while, Amazon seemed like a clear candidate to acquire the company, adding to its existing smart home brands like Ring, though it recently announced its thermostat created with help from Honeywell.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in Q4, pending regulatory approval.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdhenry001/">Catherine D. Henry</a> is SVP Growth at <a href="https://media.monks.com/">Media.Monks</a>, where she advises leading global brands on how to enter the metaverse.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There is a heated debate on the state of the race between the United States and China to dominate in AI. But perhaps the more strategic question is whether China is building the metaverse.</p>
<p>Built upon infrastructural technologies like AI, the metaverse refers to the vast array of digital experiences and ecosystems, from e-commerce and entertainment to social media and work, where we spend more and more of our lives. It’s soon going to be hard to conceive of a world in which much of our social and economic lives are not defined by the rules of the metaverse. To the builder goes the opportunity to establish rules to their own benefit.</p>
<p>In truth, both the U.S. and China are trying to build and lay claim to the metaverse, with other actors such as Europe trying to do so as well, but they simply don&#8217;t control enough of the core technologies that make the metaverse possible.</p>
<p>These core technologies include AI, 5G, end-user devices and the sector-straddling super apps that bring everything together — and related technologies such as smartwatches and eyewear. Competence and dominance across these four criteria is what may give China an insurmountable head start over the U.S. in the race to build the future of the virtualized human experience.</p>
<h2>China’s AI advantage</h2>
<p>The Chinese leadership understands that AI is revolutionizing virtually all aspects of social life, including consumption. AI is a top priority for government and business, and the Chinese government has called for China to achieve major new breakthroughs by 2025 and become the global leader in AI by 2030.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If the metaverse does become the successor to the internet, who builds it, and how, will be extremely important to the future of the economy and society as a whole.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The strategy was initially outlined in the Chinese government’s <a href="http://fi.china-embassy.org/eng/kxjs/P020171025789108009001.pdf">New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan</a> in 2017. It has since spurred both new policies and billions of dollars of R&amp;D investments from ministries, provincial governments and private companies.</p>
<p>As a result of China’s AI initiatives, the American advantage in the sector has been steadily eroding: In 2017 the U.S. <a href="https://chuvpilo.medium.com/whos-ahead-in-ai-research-insights-from-nips-most-prestigious-ai-conference-df2c361236f6">had an 11x lead over China</a>, but by 2019, that lead had come <a href="https://chuvpilo.medium.com/ai-research-rankings-2019-insights-from-neurips-and-icml-leading-ai-conferences-ee6953152c1a">down to 7x</a>. By 2020, the U.S. was left with a narrow lead of 6x. Even this lead has been uncertain, and the ex-chief software officer of the Pentagon went so far as to say that China already had <a href="https://on.ft.com/303UpRW">an insurmountable lead in AI and machine learning</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, some question the American lead when it comes to the availability of training data. In the privacy versus public good debate, the U.S. tends to lean toward privacy, whereas China has long exercised government intervention in maintaining a civil society as a public good.</p>
<p>Finally, China has access to vast data sets to train AI, which presents a significant strategic advantage, especially considering the country&#8217;s population of 1.4 billion.</p>
<h2>China builds the devices</h2>
<p>The capacity to build and ultimately become the preeminent force in the metaverse starts with <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-us-smartphones-shipments-Q2-2020?ctid=1567-e913418954aa2858d308f33691e27999">China’s long-standing and unrivaled dominance</a> of consumer device manufacturing. From smartphones and notebooks to AR and VR headsets, Chinese manufacturers are building the largest portion and widest varieties of the devices that consumers need to access digital platforms and social experiences. The most advanced design and production competencies are likely to already reside in <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2018/10/11/chinas-grip-on-electronics-manufacturing-will-be-hard-to-break">cities like Shenzhen</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games <a href="https://fn.qq.com/webplat/info/news_version3/10021/34544/34546/m20913/202110/903484.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that its work to bring video game mega-title Fortnite to the Chinese market is shutting down.</p>
<p>The company said in an official announcement that the long-running test of the popular shooter title in China will conclude on November 15. New users won&#8217;t be accepted starting today.</p>
<p>Tencent, a Chinese internet giant, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/tencent-epic/">owns a stake in Epic Games</a>, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/17/tencent-takes-full-control-of-league-of-legends-creator-riot-games/">complete ownership of Riot Games</a>, another American gaming company with an international gaming hit in its portfolio.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227237" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>China&#8217;s gaming industry has been undergoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">refreshed regulatory scrutiny in recent months</a>, with the domestic government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/china-restricts-kids-online-gaming-to-three-hours-a-week/">working to limit gaming time amongst youths</a>. The impact of the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s move to lower hours-played amongst its younger population is not yet clear, but the decision could have made the economics of building Fortnite for China untenable.</p>
<p>Epic had built a China-specific version of Fortnite, a variation on the title that is well-known in the rest of the world. A <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Fortnite:_China" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gamer-powered wiki</a> details a suite of differences, including gameplay and monetization changes, along with different character graphics to meet local laws. The same article notes that after a certain amount of playing time users could no longer earn in-game experience points.</p>
<p>The decision to halt Fortnite China could be viewed as a response to the country&#8217;s changing gaming market. With even more restrictions placed on gaming time, and lower monetization possibilities due to restrictions on microtransactions, the math simply has not penciled out.</p>
<p>To see another American company pull its popular product from the Chinese digital realm in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">wake of LinkedIn&#8217;s own decision</a> the other month is notable. The two moves underscore how difficult it can be for non-Chinese companies to offer products inside of the nation, even if they have a local champion.</p>
<p>Other cultural content is not faring much better. Recent Marvel film &#8220;Eternals&#8221; doesn&#8217;t appear set to release in the country, perhaps due to its director &#8212; Beijing-born Chloé Zhao &#8212; having made comments that some construed as critical of the nation.</p>
<p>The regulatory environment and lessening ability, or interest, to bring global films and games to China will further isolate the country from international culture. And, perhaps, in reverse, limit China&#8217;s ability to earn soft power through its own cultural creations.</p>
<p>Regardless, for Fortnite&#8217;s Chinese fans, their ability to play the game sans using tricks to get around Chinese authorities is coming to a close.</p>
<p>Epic Games is not commenting on the closure beyond the following statement shared with players in China (translated to English below):</p>
<blockquote><p>To Fortnite China players:</p>
<p>Fortnite China’s Beta test will be ending, and the servers will be closed soon. For details, please see below:</p>
<p>On Monday, November 1 at 11 am, we will close the new user registration entrance and game download portal;</p>
<p>On Monday, November 15 at 11 am, we will turn off servers for Fortnite, and players will no longer be able to connect to the game through the WeGame client.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the Fortnite China players who have ridden the Battle Bus with us by participating in the Beta.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about the servers closing, please click here to send us feedback.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has responded to allegations contained in a recently unsealed US antitrust lawsuit that it worked covertly to stall European Union privacy legislation that could have blasted a huge hole in its behaviorial advertising business.</p>
<p>Per the US states&#8217; suit, a couple of years after a European Commission proposal to update the EU&#8217;s ePrivacy Directive &#8212; to replace it with a more widely applicable Regulation &#8212; the tech giant was privately celebrating what it described as a &#8220;successful&#8221; tilt at &#8220;slowing down and delaying&#8221; the privacy legislation.</p>
<p>The update to the EU&#8217;s privacy rules around people&#8217;s electronics communications (and plenty more besides) remains stalled even now, with negotiations technically &#8216;continuing&#8217; &#8212; just without any agreement in sight. So Google&#8217;s &#8216;success&#8217; looks overwhelming.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224004" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That said, the adtech giant can&#8217;t take all the credit: The US states&#8217; case against Google quotes an internal memo from July 2019 &#8212; in which it claims to have been &#8220;working behind the scenes hand in hand&#8221; with the other four of the &#8216;big five&#8217; tech giants (GAFAM) to forestall consumer privacy efforts.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the relevant allegation from the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.564903/gov.uscourts.nysd.564903.152.0.pdf">antitrust case against Google</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><i>&#8220;(b) <b>Google secretly met with competitors to discuss competition and forestall consumer privacy efforts.</b> The manner in which Google has actively worked with Big Tech competitors to undermine users’ privacy further illustrates Google’s pretextual privacy concerns. For example, in a closed-door meeting on August 6, 2019 between the five Big Tech companies—including Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft—Google discussed forestalling consumer privacy efforts. In a July 31, 2019 document prepared in advance of the meeting, Google memorialized: “we have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [<span class="il">ePrivacy</span> Regulation] process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies.”&#8221;</i></div>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as putting questions to Google, TechCrunch contacted Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft about the August 6 meeting referenced in Google&#8217;s memo.</p>
<p>A spokeswomen for Microsoft declined comment &#8212; saying only: &#8220;We have nothing to share.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon and Facebook did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>
<p>However last December <em><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/amazon-sought-to-water-down-eu-privacy-rules-document-shows/">Politico</a></em> reported on an internal Amazon document, dating from 2017, which showed the ecommerce giant making an eerily similar boast about eroding support for the ePrivacy Regulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our campaign has ensured that the ePrivacy proposal will not get broad support in the European Parliament,&#8221; <em>Politico</em> reported Amazon writing in the document. &#8220;Our aim is to weaken the Parliament’s negotiation position with the Council, which is more sympathetic to industry concerns,&#8221; the text went on.</p>
<p>According to its report, Amazon&#8217;s lobbying against ePrivacy focused on pushing the Parliament for &#8220;less restrictive wording on affirmative consent and pushing for the introduction of legitimate interest and pseudonymization in the text&#8221; &#8212; which, as the news outlet observes, are legal grounds that would give companies greater scope to collect and use people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s motivation for wanting to degrade the level of privacy protections wrapping Europeans&#8217; data is clear when you consider the $42M fine it was slapped with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">last year </a>by a single EU data protection watchdog (France&#8217;s CNIL) under current ePrivacy laws. Its infringement? Dropping tracking cookies without consent.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s digital advertising business isn&#8217;t as massive as Google&#8217;s (although it is growing). But the ecommerce behemoth has plenty of incentive to track and profile Internet users &#8212; not least for targeting them with stuff for sale on its &#8216;everything store&#8217;.</p>
<p>A beefed up ePrivacy could put limits on such tracking. And evidently Amazon would prefer that it didn&#8217;t have to ask your permission for its algorithms to figure out how to get you to buy more stuff on Amazon.fr or .de or .es and so on.</p>
<p>But what about Apple? It&#8217;s certainly unusual in the list as a (rare) tech giant that&#8217;s built a reputation as a champion of user privacy.</p>
<p>Indeed, back in 2018, Apple&#8217;s CEO personally stood in Brussels lauding EU privacy laws and calling for the region&#8217;s lawmakers to go further in reining in the &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/apples-tim-cook-makes-blistering-attack-on-the-data-industrial-complex/">data industrial complex</a>&#8216;, as Tim Cook dubbed the dominant strain of adtech at the time. So seeing Apple&#8217;s name in an anti-privacy lobbying list is certainly surprising.</p>
<p>Asked about Google&#8217;s memo, Apple did at least response: It told us that no Apple representative was present at the August 6, 2019 meeting.</p>
<p>However it did not provide a broader public statement distancing itself from Google&#8217;s claim of joint work to forestall consumer privacy efforts. So Apple&#8217;s limited rebuttal leaves plenty of questions about the aligned interests of tech giants when it comes to processing people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>Zooming out, the ruinous damage to people&#8217;s privacy* which flows from the dominance of a handful of overly powerful Internet giants has been a slowly emerging thread in antitrust cases against big tech. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court/">See for example: The German FCO&#8217;s pioneering litigation against Facebook&#8217;s superprofiling</a> which Europe&#8217;s top court is set to weigh in on.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, competition regulators have generally been slow to recognize privacy abuse as a key lever for Internet giants to unfairly lock in market dominance. Although the penny does <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/05/ico-and-cma-set-out-blueprint-for-cooperation-in-digital-markets/">finally seem to be dropping</a>.</p>
<p>Just last week, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/android-search-choice-screen-is-needed-to-tackle-googles-market-power-says-australias-accc/">report by Australia&#8217;s ACCC</a> highlighted how alternative search business models, which <em>don&#8217;t</em> rely on tracking people, are being held back by Google&#8217;s competitive lock on the market &#8212; and, crucially,<em> by its grip on people&#8217;s data</em>.</p>
<p>Effective remedies for breaking big tech&#8217;s hold over consumers and competition, alike, will therefore require public authorities to grasp the key role privacy plays in protecting people and markets.</p>
<p><em>*not to mention the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/04/05/1175/facebook-algorithm-discriminates-ai-bias/">other human rights that privacy helps protect</a>&#8230;</em></p>
<h2>Mind the ePrivacy gap</h2>
<p>The EU&#8217;s proposed update to ePrivacy is aimed at extending the scope of existing rules attached to the privacy of electronic communications so that they cover, among other things, comms and metadata that&#8217;s travelling over Internet platforms; not just message data that telcos carry on their mobile networks.</p>
<p>That change would put plenty of big tech platforms and products in the frame. Google&#8217;s Gmail, for example.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s interesting to note that, later in the same year the ePrivacy proposal was presented, Google announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/23/google-has-all-the-data-it-needs-will-stop-scanning-gmail-inboxes/">stop scanning Gmail message data for ads</a>.</p>
<p>But of course Google hasn&#8217;t stopped tracking user activity across the lion&#8217;s share of its products or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/eu-govt-and-public-health-sites-lousy-with-adtech-study-finds/">majority of the mainstream web</a>, via data-harvesting tools like Google Analytics, Maps, YouTube embeds and so on.</p>
<p>Rules that cover how Internet users can be tracked and profiled for behavioral ads are also in scope in the Commission&#8217;s ePrivacy Regulation proposal. And that could present a far more existential threat to an adtech giant like Google &#8212; which makes almost all its money by tracking and profiling Internet users&#8217; via their digital activity (and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/google-and-mastercard-cut-a-secret-ad-deal-to-track-retail-sales">other data sources</a>), to calculate how best to sell their attention to advertisers.</p>
<p>Another consumer friendly goal for the ePrivacy proposal is to simplify the EU&#8217;s much hated cookie consent rules &#8212; potentially by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/europe-needs-to-back-browser-level-controls-to-fix-cookie-consent-nightmares-says-privacy-group/">reviving a &#8216;Do Not Track&#8217; style mechanism</a> where consent could be pre-defined ahead of time and signalled automatically via the browser, doing away with loads of annoying pop-ups.</p>
<p>So blocking progress on that front has basically consigned Europeans to years of tedious clicking which &#8212; all too often &#8212; still leaves people with no real choice over how their data is used, given how widely the EU&#8217;s consent rules are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/cookie-consent-still-a-compliance-trash-fire-in-latest-watchdog-peek/">flouted by adtech</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iyToBXZMv5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/cookie-consent-still-a-compliance-trash-fire-in-latest-watchdog-peek/">Cookie consent still a compliance trash fire in latest watchdog peek</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cookie consent still a compliance trash fire in latest watchdog peek&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/cookie-consent-still-a-compliance-trash-fire-in-latest-watchdog-peek/embed/#?secret=iyToBXZMv5" data-secret="iyToBXZMv5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There&#8217;s other stuff in the ePrivacy proposal too. EU lawmakers want the update to cover machine-to-machine comms &#8212; to regulate privacy around the still nascent but rapidly expanding connected devices space (aka, IoT or the Internet of Things), in order to keep pace with the rise of smart home technologies &#8212; which offer new and intimate avenues for undermining privacy.</p>
<p>The scope of the regulation does, therefore, touch other industries beyond pure adtech. And it&#8217;s true that big tech hasn&#8217;t been alone in opposing ePrivacy. (Big telco has also lobbied fiercely against it too, for example, basically in the hopes of getting the same free license over data as big adtech.)</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/power-lobbies/2018/06/shutting-down-eprivacy-lobby-bandwagon-targets-council">2018 report</a> by the NGO, Corporate Lobby Europe, which tracks regional lobbying, fingered digital publishers and the digital advertising lobby as the biggest guns ranged against ePrivacy &#8212; pointing to frequent collaboration between them (&#8220;As print media circulations fall, online advertising has become increasingly important to publishers&#8221;).</p>
<p>This collaboration saw publishers stepping up &#8220;fear-mongering&#8221; hyperbole against ePrivacy &#8212; claiming it would mean the &#8216;end of the free press&#8217;.</p>
<p>There was no nuance in this narrative. No recognition that other forms of (non-tracking) advertising are available. And no air time for the salient point that if tracking ads were not the dysfunctional &#8216;norm&#8217;, publishers could recover the value of their own audiences &#8212; rather than having them arbitraged by platform giants like Google (now facing antitrust litigation on both sides of the Atlantic for how it operates its adtech) and the adtech middlemen enabled by this opaque model. Publishers have essentially been used as a table for others to feast and left with the scraps.</p>
<p>But the problem is big (ad)tech&#8217;s influence extends to selling the notion of market dominance via a business model that views people as attention nodes to be data-mined and manipulated for profit.</p>
<p>This means it&#8217;s also &#8216;advertising&#8217; tracking as a business model for other industries to follow &#8212; providing newly digitizing (or, in the case of publishers, revenue-challenged) industries with an incentive to lobby alongside it for lower consumer protections in the hopes of cutting a slice of a Google-sized pie.</p>
<p>Publishers&#8217; &#8216;share&#8217; of the digital ad pie is of course nowhere near Google-sized. Their ad revenues have in fact been <a href="https://performancein.com/news/2020/05/20/digital-publishers-experienced-decline-in-ad-revenue-prior-to-pandemic/">declining for years</a>, which has led to the rash of paywalls now gating previously free content as scores switch to subscription models. (So so much for big adtech&#8217;s other cynically self-serving claim that the data-mining of Internet users supports a &#8216;free and open&#8217; web; not if it&#8217;s quality information and professional journalism you want vs any old bs clickbait&#8230;)</p>
<p>Beyond publishers, the data harvesting potential of &#8216;smart&#8217; things &#8212; be it a connected car or an in-home smart meter or doorbell &#8212; means many traditionally mechanical products (like cars) are becoming Internet-connected and increasingly data-driven. And with that switch comes the question of how will these industries and companies treat user data?</p>
<p>Big adtech is ready with an answer: Luring others to conspire against privacy by adopting surveillance so they too can build lucrative ad targeting businesses of their own. (Or, well, plug into big adtech&#8217;s data-feeder systems to fuel its self-serving profit machine).</p>
<p>And since adtech giants like Google have faced almost no regulatory action in the EU over the privacy apocalypse of their mass surveillance, other industries that are just starting to fire up their own data businesses could <em>almost</em> be forgiven for thinking it&#8217;s okay to copy-paste an anti-privacy model. So where GAFAM lobbies, car makers, publishers and telcos are willing to follow &#8212; fondly believing they are following the money.</p>
<p>Fondly &#8212; because the aforementioned antitrust suits suggest big adtech&#8217;s collusion against privacy extends to anti-competitive measures that have actively prevented others from getting a fair spin of the dice/slice of the pie. (See, for example, the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/10/inside-jedi-blue-facebooks-secret-deal-with-google.html">&#8216;Jedi Blue&#8217; allegations of a secret deal between Google and Facebook</a> to rig the ad market against publishers and in their own favor.)</p>
<p>So, well, others lobbying against privacy alongside big tech tech risk looking like GAFAM&#8217;s useful idiots.</p>
<p>But wait, isn&#8217;t the EU supposed to have comprehensive privacy legislation? How is any of this even possible in the first place?</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s true the EU was (wildly) successful in passing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which updated long standing data protection rules when it came into application in May 2018, beefing up requirements around consent as a legal basis for processing people&#8217;s data (for example) and adding some much needed teeth &#8212; the regulation has nonetheless been hamstrung by the presence of an outdated ePrivacy Directive sitting alongside it.</p>
<p>The Internet advertising industry has been able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/cookie-walls-dont-comply-with-gdpr-says-dutch-dpa/">leverage this legislative mismatch to claim loopholes</a> for its continued heist of people&#8217;s data for ads. (And, unsurprisingly, disputes over the legal basis under which people&#8217;s electronic comms and metadata can be used have been a key ePrivacy sticking point.)</p>
<p>But the forces ranged against the update have seen an even bigger prize than just stopping ePrivacy: They&#8217;re trying to force the bloc into reverse and rip out protections the GDPR so recently cemented.</p>
<p>In a particularly ironic recent development, cookie consent friction has been seized upon and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">spun by ministers in the UK</a> as suggested justification for downgrading the UK&#8217;s level of data protection &#8212; as Boris Johnson&#8217;s Conservatives look at diverging from the GDPR, post-Brexit.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s not <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">&#8216;simplified&#8217; rules</a> that are needed to fix cookie consent; it&#8217;s enforcement against systematic rule-breakers that have been allowed to make a mockery of the law in order they they can keep profiting by ignoring everyone&#8217;s right to privacy.</p>
<p>The long and short of this is that the damage to consumers and civic society across Europe as a result of regulatory inaction on adtech &#8212; and because of Google&#8217;s &#8216;successful&#8217; lobbying against ePrivacy &#8212; looks staggeringly high.</p>
<p>While GDPR enforcement on adtech has been largely stalled these past three+ years, thanks (in no small part) to big tech&#8217;s forum shopping, <em>if there had been</em> an updated ePrivacy Regulation sitting alongside GDPR &#8212; adding enhanced transparency and consent requirements &#8212; it could have blasted tracking-based business models right out of EU waters years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lobbying in context of ePrivacy was definitely of majestic size,&#8221; says <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr Lukasz Olejnik</a>, an independent privacy researcher and consultant based in the EU. &#8220;This was readily felt by policymakers. Concerning the scale, it was the Olympic Games in lobbying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked what he believes has been the impact within the EU of the delaying of ePrivacy, Olejnik says the lobbying has likely slowed down data protection enforcement across the bloc and made outcomes more patchy, as well as holding up progress on further adapting the bloc&#8217;s rulebook to account for newer tracking techniques.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, the roadblock on ePrivacy has bought the adtech industry more time to get even further ahead of regulators &#8212; while simultaneously profiting off of its consentless exploitation of consumers&#8217; data. (See for example, in the case of adtech giant Facebook, its shiny new placeholder about building &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">the Metaverse</a>&#8220;, aka a new type of immersive, data-capturing infrastructure Facebook intends to stoke the fires of its ad engines into the far future under its new brand name &#8216;Meta&#8217;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;ePrivacy is currently not well aligned with GDPR. While in context of ePrivacy, all references to the previous Data Protection Directive are understood to be upgraded to GDPR, the current framework for protecting privacy in electronic communication is obsolete,&#8221; says Olejnik. &#8220;What is worse, some Member States still divide the data protection regulations, leaving enforcement of ePrivacy Directive to other, non-DPA [data protection agency] regulators. This means that one regulator is dealing with GDPR, and another with ePrivacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s as problem mainly because the old ePrivacy Directive is not well adapted to GDPR. Meanwhile, the old ePrivacy fails to account for new tracking and ad targeting methods, as well as phenomenons of microtargeting political content based on the processing of personal data.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">moves by a number of MEPs</a> to push for adtech-related amendments to another legislative proposal &#8212; the Digital Services Act (DSA) &#8212; to try to tackle rampant adtech data abuse by outlawing behavioral advertising entirely (in favor of contextual ads that don&#8217;t require mass surveillance).</p>
<p>But Olejnik doesn&#8217;t see that as the ideal route to defeat surveillance-based advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not a good idea to take the fight and ideas such as curbing of microtargeting to other unrelated regulations, such as the DSA, just because some actors were late to the process,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;It is much better to finalise ePrivacy as soon as possible, and then immediately start another process of updating.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s how it should work from the point of view of EU law and regulation baking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Council did finally adopt a negotiating position on ePrivacy earlier this year (<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/02/10/confidentiality-of-electronic-communications-council-agrees-its-position-on-eprivacy-rules/">February</a>) during the Portuguese presidency &#8212; proposing a version of the text that, critics say, waters down protections for data and provides fresh loopholes for adtech to exploit.</p>
<p>That in turn could mean ePrivacy ends up creating legislative cover for surveillance-based business models &#8212; reversing the stronger protections earlier EU lawmakers had intended and further undermining the GDPR&#8217;s (already weak) application against adtech&#8230; In short, a disaster for fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Whereas, if the ePrivacy update had been passed at around the same time as the GDPR, Olejnik reckons it would have resulted in a more practically successful upgrade of EU data protection rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;There would be chances to synchronise the upgrade,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;It would also avert the subsequent backlash due to &#8216;GDPR paranoia&#8217;, which instantly made everybody &#8212; including policymakers and the industry &#8212; ultra-careful and less happy about any changes in this domain. So the changes would be of a practical nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would also be simpler and more coherent to do compliance preparations to the two at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EU now has a whole suite of new and even more ambitious digital legislative proposals on its plate &#8212; some of which the Commission proposed at the end of last year &#8212; including the (aforementioned) DSA; and the (tech giant-targeting) Digital Markets Act (DMA); where it wants to legislate for ex ante powers to tackle so-called &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; platforms in order to reboot competition in tipped digital markets.</p>
<p>And of course all this further stretches (limited) legislative resources, while EU lawmakers are still stuck trying to pass an already out-of-date ePrivacy update.</p>
<p>So when adtech giant Facebook&#8217;s chief spin doctor and former UK deputy PM, <a href="https://twitter.com/mryderqc/status/1454152673129807874">Nick Clegg, makes a big show</a> of claiming regulators are simply too slow and bumbling to keep up with fast-paced technology innovators, it pays to remember how much resource tech giants spend on intentionally delaying external oversight and retarding regulation &#8212; including shelling out on a phalanx of in-house lawyers to maintain a pipeline of cynical appeals to delay any actual enforcement.</p>
<p>In Facebook&#8217;s case, this includes the claim that the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) moved &#8216;too quickly&#8217; when it arrived at<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/"> a preliminary decision on a complaint</a> &#8212; despite the complaint itself being over seven years old at that point&#8230;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>One EU diplomat, who we are not identifying because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the ePrivacy file, spoke plainly about its problems. &#8220;This has been going on for fucking ages,&#8221; the source told us. &#8220;Big tech is lobbying like crazy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody says they&#8217;re lobbying like crazy. Of course they are trying to hold back these issues &#8212; like consent for cookies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the Commission it has a team of around 40 people who deal with the DMA, just to work on that, but Google probably has, like, 300 lawyers already in Brussels &#8212; just to paint a picture there,&#8221; the EU source added.</p>
<p>Other Brussels chatter this person reported hearing included a recent incident in which Google had apparently briefed journalists that it doesn&#8217;t have a dominant market position in search engines &#8212; and said its lawyers were &#8220;able to prove it&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wild, if true. (NB: A Google search for its market share in Europe points to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/europe">Statcounter data</a> which pegs its share at 92.98% between September 2020 and 2021.)</p>
<p>Back in reality, the trilogue phase of the ePrivacy discussions has technically been ongoing for months, involving the Commission, the Parliament and the Council &#8212; with another legislative tug-of-war over the final shape of any text that would then need to be put to a vote.</p>
<p>Slovenia currently holds the rotating Council presidency, meaning it is steering the file and representing the other Members States in the talks.</p>
<p>We contacted the Slovenian representation to the EU to ask whether it has been lobbied by Google (or any other tech giants) on ePrivacy and to ask for minutes of any lobbyist meetings.</p>
<p>A spokesperson denied any meetings with Google &#8212; and flat denied the file had been held up by the Council.</p>
<p>&#8220;The file is not being blocked within the EU Council, on the contrary. The work is [being] very intense,&#8221; it said. &#8220;After the first political trilogue under the Portuguese presidency at end of May 2021, the Slovene Presidency held numerous and regular meetings with the European Parliament at the technical level to discuss open issues and prepare the file for the second political trilogue that is planned for November 18, 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for your question related to meetings behind closed doors with Google on ePrivacy in 2019, no such meetings took place,&#8221; the spokesperson said, adding: &#8220;The Slovene Presidency has put digital files on top of our priorities and this goes for ePrivacy as well. We are actively working and negotiating on the ePrivacy legislation in line with the mandate that was given to us by the EU Council.&#8221;</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s permanent representation to the EU does publish a &#8220;<a href="https://www.gov.si/en/representations/permanent-representation-to-the-european-union-brussels/about-the-permanent-representation-to-the-european-union-brussels/transparency-register/">transparency register</a>&#8221; of meetings with lobbyists.</p>
<p>However the data on its website only goes back to the start of this year, and the entries are severely limited &#8212; with, in the vast majority of cases, no details provided on the topics discussed.</p>
<p>The register for this year, for example, shows a meeting back in March with a Facebook representative, Aura Salla, the adtech giant&#8217;s managing public policy director and head of EU affairs &#8212; but there are no details about the meeting&#8217;s contents.</p>
<p>The Slovene list also records a number of meetings with third party business associations that are affiliated with tech giants and known to parrot their talking points. But, again, no detail is given about what the lobbyists were pressing for.</p>
<p>Portugal&#8217;s permanent representation to the EU also publishes a <a href="https://ue.missaoportugal.mne.gov.pt/en/permanent-representation/transparency-register">transparency register</a> of lobby meetings with its ambassadors.</p>
<p>Similarly, though, its list is partial &#8212; only dating back to 2020 (with no details provided on any of the listed meetings).</p>
<p>Portugal&#8217;s register also records a meeting between its ambassador and Facebook&#8217;s Salla.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Look at the size of our lobby network!&#8217;</h2>
<p>Google&#8217;s public messaging about people&#8217;s information typically features at least one claim that it &#8220;cares deeply for user privacy and security&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google does certainly cherish your data. Of course it does. Your information is the fuel for an ad targeting empire that raked in <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2020Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=9e991fd">$182.5BN last year</a>.</p>
<p>Google Cloud generated a small slice of that ($13BN). Its &#8216;other bets&#8217; division added a morsel too ($657M). But almost all of Google&#8217;s vast profits come from targeting advertising at eyeballs based on what it knows about the mind behind the peepers.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Google about the discrepancy between fine-sounding<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/googles-sundar-pichai-grilled-over-destroying-anonymity-on-the-internet/"> claims that fall from its execs&#8217; lips</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; such as CEO Sundar Pichai telling US lawmakers last year that Google “deeply cares about the privacy and security of our users” (as he was being accused of destroying anonymity on the Internet); or the text of Google&#8217;s own privacy policy, where it writes that it: &#8220;work[s] hard to protect your information and put you in control&#8221; even as it applies labyrinthine settings that make it <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters/status/1453277776887300106">almost impossible to opt out of tracking and remain opted out</a> &#8212; vs allegations in the States&#8217; lawsuit of backroom dealings to derail European privacy legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In response, Google</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> sought to divert attention by claiming other businesses were also lobbying against ePrivacy and, therefore, that it was &#8220;not alone&#8221; in opposing the update &#8212; using a similar tack to the strategy Facebook applies when</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/"> Europeans talk about banning microtargeted ads altogether</a>; or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">even just enforcing current EU laws against Facebook </a>(per Clegg this would &#8216;kill SMEs&#8217; and be &#8220;disastrous&#8221; for Europe&#8217;s economy)<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, the statement that Google&#8217;s spokesman sent us on its anti-ePrivacy lobbying contains a centerpiece reference to an <a href="https://www.euroispa.org/wp-content/uploads/Joint-industry-letter-on-the-future-of-the-ePrivacy-Regulation.pdf">open letter</a>, released in May 2018 &#8212; which the tech giant fastidiously observes was signed by &#8220;56 business associations from multiple sectors &#8212; not just tech&#8221;, seemingly presenting a united front to urge EU Member States to apply the legislative brakes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Google&#8217;s claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The tech industry was not alone in raising concerns with the ePrivacy regulation as it was then drafted, as a broad range of European organizations &#8212; from news to automotive to banking to small business &#8212; raised their voices in multiple public and private statements on the same issues. In May 2018, 56 business associations from multiple sectors &#8212; not just tech &#8212; published an open letter asking for &#8216;more time&#8217; to assess the draft’s impact &#8216;on all sectors of the economy&#8217; given the simultaneous arrival into force of the GDPR.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We supported the industry in asking for time on ePrivacy so that we could all assess the impact of the GDPR and get that right, first. We also raised our concerns directly with policymakers in our meetings with them over multiple years,&#8221; Google&#8217;s statement goes on, apparently admitting to extensive lobbying.</p>
<p>The statement ends with a segue into a claim of (Google&#8217;s own) GDPR compliance &#8212; combined with the subtle suggestion that any privacy abuse would therefore be the fault of third parties that plug into its ad ecosystem (ohhai publishers!), as Google writes: &#8220;We’ve invested heavily in building our products to be private by design, secure by default, and compliant with Europe’s GDPR. As well as working on our own compliance, we’ve launched tools to support our partners’ efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s claimed &#8216;compliance&#8217; with GDPR ignores the fact that its adtech business is the subject of multiple complaints (not to mention wider <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">antitrust investigations</a>) in the region. Some of these complaints have spent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">years sitting on the desk of Ireland&#8217;s DPC</a> &#8212; which continues to face accusations of impeding effective enforcement of the regulation. (The country&#8217;s low corporate tax economy has attracted scores of tech giants &#8212; so tech industry interests may be viewed as generally aligned with Irish interests.)</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s compliance claim also glosses over a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">$57M GDPR fine in France</a>, at the start of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">2019</a> (when its EU business hadn&#8217;t yet restructured to put users under the jurisdiction of Ireland on data protection matters) &#8212; a fine Google was handed for failing transparency requirements, meaning the consents it claimed hadn&#8217;t actually been legally obtained.</p>
<p>It also omits a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">$120M fine Google got at the end of last year under current ePrivacy rules</a> &#8212; for dropping tracking cookies without consent (also from France&#8217;s CNIL).</p>
<p>It is blindingly obvious self-interest for Google to want to gut ePrivacy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s interesting the tech giant reaches for a fig-leaf defence for its lobbying that tries to dilute attention by claiming multiple other businesses feel the same way too. (Not to mention how it has specifically maneuvered publishers into an invidious position where are supposed to shield its adtech empire from legal risk around privacy abuse because Google requires these &#8216;partners&#8217; obtain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">impossibly broad &#8216;consents&#8217;</a> from users for the ad targeting that Google makes such a handsome return on&#8230; )</p>

<p>Sure, some other business than Google/tech giants also don&#8217;t like ePrivacy.</p>
<p>But more missing context here is how big tech&#8217;s lobbying in Europe &#8212; pegged at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/us-giants-top-tech-industrys-100m-a-year-lobbying-blitz-in-eu/">eye-watering levels</a> in recent years &#8212; has led to the creation of a sprawling, obfuscated lobby network where affiliated third parties are happy to parrot its talking points in public while, behind closed doors, accepting its checks.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/us-giants-top-tech-industrys-100m-a-year-lobbying-blitz-in-eu/">report this summer</a> by two civil society groups, (the aforementioned) <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/en">Corporate Europe Observatory</a> along with Germany-based <a href="https://www.lobbycontrol.de/">LobbyControl</a>, found Google topped the lobbying list of Big Tech big spenders in the EU — with Mountain View shelling out €5.8M (~$6.7M) annually on trying to influence the shape and detail of EU tech policy.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s likely just the tip of Google&#8217;s policy influence spending in Europe.</p>
<p>It looks to be the same story for all of GAFAM: Facebook (€5.5M annually); Microsoft (€5.3M); Apple (€3.5M); Amazon (€2.8M) &#8212; although Google and Facebook, the Internet&#8217;s adtech duopoly, top the list of big spenders in the digital industry.</p>
<p>The report highlights how big tech&#8217;s regional lobbying relies on an obfuscated network of third parties to &#8220;push through its messages&#8221; &#8212; including think tanks, SME and startup associations and law and economic consultancies &#8212; with platform giants exerting their influence by providing funding via sponsorships or membership fees.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this policy influence network appears to have an outsized megaphone as a result of the wealthy company it keeps: Per the report, the lobbying budget of business associations lobbying in Europe on behalf of big tech “far surpasses that of the bottom 75 per cent of the companies in the digital industry”.</p>
<p>Or, put another way, the smallest and least well-funded players &#8212; individuals, civil society and businesses/startups with privacy-preserving approaches that don&#8217;t align with the surveillance model of big adtech &#8212; are having their views drowned out by adtech astroturfing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rising lobby firepower of big tech and the digital industry as a whole mirrors the sectors’ huge and growing role in society,&#8221; the report notes. &#8220;It is remarkable and should be a cause of concern that the platforms can use this firepower to ensure their voices are heard &#8212; over countervailing and critical voices &#8212; in the debate over how to construct new rules for digital platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that big tech also directly funds a number of startup associations &#8212; which may (otherwise) be seen by policymakers as dissociated from platform giants.</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=03181945560-59">Google&#8217;s entry</a> on the EU&#8217;s Transparency Register notes sponsorships of Allied for Startups, for example. And the advocacy organization&#8217;s <a href="https://alliedforstartups.org/about-us/">website</a> does at least disclose what it describes as &#8220;sponsorship&#8221; by a &#8220;Corporate Board&#8221; &#8212; which as well as Google includes Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, among other platform and digital giants.</p>
<p>(&#8220;We are proud to be sponsored by our Corporate Board. It supports our activities, as selected by our members, but has no voting rights,&#8221; is the official Allied for Startups line on taking funding from tech giants while claiming to represent the interests of startups free from the influence of its platform giant funders.)</p>
<p>Links between big tech and a sprawling array of worthy sounding associations and business alliances are often far less plainly disclosed. The report emphasizes that affiliations are frequently fuzzed or not disclosed at all &#8212; thereby concealing &#8220;potential biases and conflicts of interest&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We still don’t have a complete picture of this network,&#8221; the report further warns. </span></p>
<p>TechCrunch shared the list of signatories in the open letter cited by Google as cover for its anti-ePrivacy lobbying with the two transparency organizations to ask for their verdict on how &#8216;clean&#8217; it is &#8212; i.e. from a Google and/or big tech influence point of view.</p>
<p>Both confirmed that many of the listed groups have some form of affiliation with Google and/or other tech giants.</p>
<p>Margarida Silva, a co-author of the aforementioned <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/2021/08/lobby-network-big-techs-web-influence-eu">big tech EU lobbying</a> report, said a &#8220;quick check&#8221; of the list of signatories turned up 28 organizations that count Google as member or sponsor.</p>
<p>&#8220;With direct links to 28 out of 57 signatories, Google&#8217;s footprint is very clear here,&#8221; she told TechCrunch, adding: &#8220;The majority of the list is made up of lobby associations for big tech (i.e. EDIMA, CCIA, ITI, DigitalEurope, IAB), plus national level business associations that often have big tech as members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silva also highlighted that some of the signatories are from other sectors (rather than tech) &#8212; including car manufacturers and publishers. But on that she pointed to the organization&#8217;s <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/power-lobbies/2017/10/big-data-watching-you">earlier</a> <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/power-lobbies/2017/10/big-data-watching-you">findings</a>, when it examined ePrivacy lobbying directly &#8212; and identified what she said was &#8220;a strong push by big tech [that was] matched with intense lobbying by telecoms and publishers and even other sectors who also want to benefit from surveillance advertising&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, again, big adtech&#8217;s wider influence is hard at work exerting an anti-privacy pull that&#8217;s redefining the center of gravity for other industries.</p>
<p>When we raised Google&#8217;s comments about working &#8220;hand in hand&#8221; with other tech giants in its lobbying against privacy, Silva also suggested that &#8220;coordination seems very likely&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;GAFAM are members of the big tech lobby groups (e.g. EDIMA) who were themselves active pushing back against ePrivacy&#8221;, she noted, adding: &#8220;Usually these forums are useful for their members to discuss, agree shared approaches or delegate some lobbying activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>LobbyControl&#8217;s Max Bank also took a look at the list of signatories &#8212; and his pass turned up &#8220;at least 23&#8221; with an affiliation with Google &#8212; i.e. meaning the tech giant is &#8220;a member and most probably provides a member fee&#8221;.</p>
<p>Per the pair&#8217;s analysis, examples of Google-affiliated associations whose names appear on the open letter include industry-wider groups like Digital Europe, BusinessEurope, EDIMA and the Computer and Communications Industry Association &#8212; but also regional industry bodies like the Confederation of Danish Industry, Technology Industries of Finland, Digital Poland and Tech in France, to name a few.</p>
<p>Across Europe, big adtech&#8217;s reach has grown long indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all of these memberships are reflected in the EU transparency register,&#8221; Bank added. &#8220;It reflects again the in-transparent and powerful lobby network Google has in the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talking of powerful lobby networks, it&#8217;s instructive to return to Facebook&#8217;s recent flashy rebrand and &#8216;pivot&#8217; to &#8220;building the Metaverse&#8221;, as it describes its plan to extend its ad tracking model&#8217;s grip on people&#8217;s attention for decades to come.</p>
<p>This looks very interesting from a regional lobbying point of view because Facebook&#8217;s announcement included an explicit bung for Europe &#8212; with the adtech giant saying it would be hiring 10,000 highly skilled tech workers to develop the metaverse &#8220;within the European Union&#8221;. (And where exactly in the EU those jobs end up could be an instructive way to map Facebook&#8217;s regional influence network.)</p>
<p>The timing here is key &#8212; with EU lawmakers busy negotiating the detail of the <em>next</em> suite of EU digital regulations &#8212; including rules that are <em>exclusively</em> set to apply to big tech (aka, the DMA)&#8230;</p>
<p>So the question for the bloc is whether Member States&#8217; narrow, local interests will continue to allow EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights be traded away on the vague promise of jobs for a few techbros&#8230;</p>
<p>(Going on <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/facebook-ireland-staff-coin-it-as-average-pay-reaches-154-000-1.3714642">Facebook average wage data in the EU</a> in recent years, it&#8217;s maybe offering to spend a little over €1.5BN on this spot of local hiring &#8212; or just a few hundreds of millions per year until 2026.)</p>

<h2>A gaping hole in EU transparency</h2>
<p>The statement Google sent us in response to public disclosure of its anti-ePrivacy lobbying ends with what sounds <em>almost</em> like a (micro)apology on being caught claiming to champion consumer privacy in public while simultaneously pressing lawmakers to stall progress on the self-same subject behind closed doors.</p>
<p>To wit:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As lawmakers debate new rules for the internet, citizens expect companies to engage with legislative debate openly and in ways that fully account for the concerns of all of society. We know we have a responsibility to take this understanding into our work on internet policy, and consistently strive to do so.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div>But, essentially, even Google&#8217;s own assessment of how it operates is an expression of never actually achieving full accountability. Which also looks instructive of how big tech works.</div>
<p>Meanwhile, the ePrivacy Regulation remains undone &#8212; more than four years since the Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/proposal-eprivacy-regulation">original reform proposal</a> (all the way back in January 2017).</p>
<p>The blockage has centered on the European Council &#8212; the EU institution that&#8217;s (mostly) made up of heads of governments from the 27 Member States &#8212; which has spent years failing to agree a negotiating position, meaning the Regulation couldn&#8217;t move through to discussions with the Parliament to arrive, very likely amended, at some kind of consensus and ultimate adoption.</p>
<p>An EU source on the European Council declined to comment on the States&#8217; lawsuit&#8217;s allegations of Google celebrating success in stalling ePrivacy, saying only: &#8220;Negotiations on this regulation are ongoing, and I cannot provide you with more information or comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>A European Commission spokesman also declined to comment.</p>
<p>But the EU&#8217;s executive, which was responsible for drafting the original proposal, told us it stands by it &#8212; and also sounded a warning against deviation from core objectives, writing: &#8220;As far as the Commission is concerned, we stand by our proposal and remain committed to supporting the European Parliament and the Council in the trilogues to find a compromise, in keeping with the objectives of the Commission’s proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were disagreements in the Parliament over ePrivacy. But MEPs did arrive more quickly at a negotiating position. So the real culprit for stalling ePrivacy is the Member States.</p>
<p>The European Parliament&#8217;s rapporteur on the ePrivacy trilogues, Birgit Sippel, declined to comment on Google&#8217;s lobbying against the file. But we also contacted a couple of shadow rapporteurs &#8212; who were more open in their views.</p>
<p>MEP Sophie In &#8216;t Veld said that while lobbying transparency around EU institutions has improved in recent years there is still a major blindspot when it comes to corporate influence ops targeting Member States&#8217; governments directly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lobbying to national governments is invisible,&#8221; she told TechCrunch &#8212; dubbing it &#8220;a big gaping hole in transparency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way it&#8217;s not surprising,&#8221; she said of ePrivacy. &#8220;There are big interests at stake, everybody&#8217;s always trying to influence the lawmakers &#8212; it&#8217;s interesting to see how worried [big tech] are up to the point that they feel that they have to join forces but it also confirms what we are always saying that the Member States are much more susceptible to this kind of corporate and industrial interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[ePrivacy] has been stuck in Council for a very long time and it&#8217;s always the same problem,&#8221; In &#8216;t Veld added. &#8220;The European Parliament is of course made up of different political groups, political families, political convictions &#8212; but ultimately we always find a common line. In the Council you never know, it&#8217;s opaque&#8230; it&#8217;s not even related to political color but they&#8217;re just a lot more susceptible to corporate and industrial lobbying for reasons I fail to grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;They always, systematically, take a line which is closest to big industry, to the big international corporations, big tech, American big tech &#8212; which I find even more surprising. But that&#8217;s what they do systematically. So the fact they are being successfully lobbied is not surprising.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed out that the situation was the same when the EU was negotiating the GDPR &#8212; and other pieces of pan-EU legislation, like the law enforcement directive.</p>
<p>So the lobbying itself is nothing new (even if the scale keeps stepping up).</p>
<p>However, given the blistering pace and iterations of technology change &#8212; and the market power that has accrued to a handful of the biggest data-mining giants &#8212; legislative logjams affecting the passage of digital regulations start to look like a fundamental crisis for the rule of law, as well as for Europeans&#8217; fundamental rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;GDPR in its final version was not what big tech had in mind. So the European Parliament is doing its job &#8212; but it&#8217;s very annoying that we always have to push back against the Council,&#8221; said In &#8216;t Veld, adding that perpetual stalling is unfortunately a common Council tactic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their tactic is to not actually negotiate or debate &#8212; they just stall, they just say oh we can&#8217;t agree,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;There are so many files which have been blocked in Council for years &#8212; in some cases ten, 15 years &#8212; they just block, it&#8217;s their tactic, rather than trying to find solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, though, in the digital sphere this delaying tactic looks particular concerning.</p>
<p>And given the huge vested interests ranged against other nascent EU digital regulations, like the DSA and DMA, how can the bloc confidently claim it can regulate Internet &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; &#8212; when it can&#8217;t even stop big adtech&#8217;s lobbyists from stalling its own lawmakers?</p>
<p>MEP Patrick Breyer, another rapporteur on the ePrivacy file, was equally withering in his assessment of the ePrivacy situation &#8212; saying that while trilogue negotiations have started, the Council has &#8220;succumbed to lobbying to a degree that rather than accept this it would be far better to abandon the reform altogether&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Industry (including the ad business and publishers) and national governments have colluded to block ePrivacy rules which the European Parliament wants to ban surveillance tracking walls and eliminate the cookie banner nuisance by making browser signals mandatory, among other things,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year Member States have adopted a position which doesn&#8217;t deserve to have privacy in its name. I have more on this <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/digital-privacy-of-correspondence-eprivacy-regulation/">dossier</a> on my homepage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame on national governments for succumbing to this lobbying,&#8221; Breyer added. &#8220;The online activities of an individual allow for deep insights into their (past and future) behaviour and make it possible to manipulate them. Users have a right not to be subject to pervasive tracking when using digital services.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason why lobbying is &#8220;so easy to do is precisely because Council members refuse to publish lobby meetings (unlike, to some degree, Parliament and Commission)&#8221;, he added.</p>
<p>With lines in to such an extensive third party influence network in Europe, and so many opaque avenues of approach to tickle friendly national governments across Europe until they adopt helpful policy positions &#8212; or else spend years refusing to adopt a position at all &#8212; it&#8217;s not hard to see how Google bought its business years more profits by delaying ePrivacy.</p>
<h2>Postcards from Pichai&#8217;s European tour</h2>
<p>Without full transparency into both the number and content of lobby meetings between EU Member States and tech giants we are left to speculate on how exactly adtech giants like Google went about derailing legislative progress.</p>
<p>Perhaps by targeting certain &#8216;friendly&#8217; governments &#8212; dangling the prospect of a little local investment, either in tech infrastructure or jobs (or both), in exchange for not &#8216;rushing&#8217; (aka stalling) the negotiations.</p>
<p>On this front it&#8217;s instructive to look through press photography of the Google CEO, back in 2018 and 2019 &#8212; when Pichai took the time to personally tour a number of European cities &#8212; and can be seen in conversation with heads of state, including France&#8217;s president Emanuel Macron, who he met in Paris in January 2018. (In the below shot at least, Macron does not look very friendly though.)</p>
<p>There is also an intimate <span class="kqEaA z8gr9e">tête-à-tête</span> with Poland&#8217;s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, in what was surely a very chilly Warsaw in January 2019.</p>
<p>In another in-person visit, Pichai held a joint press conference with a beaming Finnish prime, Minister Antti Rinne, in September 2019 in Helsinki.</p>
<p>In Helsinki the Google CEO announced a plan to invest €3BN to expand its data centers across Europe over the next two years, supporting a total of 13,000 full-time jobs in the EU per year. The Google announcement also trailed included the construction of more than €1BN in new energy infrastructure in the EU, including a new offshore wind project in Belgium; five solar energy projects in Denmark; and two wind energy projects in each Sweden and Finland, according to <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2019-09-google-invest-billion-euros-europe.html">press coverage</a> at the time.</p>
<p>Which does rather smell like &#8216;pork barrel politics&#8217;, big tech style (i.e. with glossier press photography).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2224713,2224723,2224724,2224749"]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pichai also made it to Berlin in January 2019 to cut the ribbon on a new policy office for Google Germany. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Press pics show him standing smiling alongside Philipp Justus, Google&#8217;s VP for Central Europe, and Annette Kroeber-Riel, its senior director public policy and government relations &#8212; ahead of an official opening that night in which Berlin Mayor, Michael Muller, was slated to attend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">W</span>e&#8217;re sure the canapés and cava flowed freely.</p>
<p>LobbyControl&#8217;s Bank says public criticism has forced Google to be more open about its &#8220;in-transparent&#8221; lobbying &#8212; highlighting a <a href="https://www.lobbycontrol.de/2020/06/google-antwortet-nur-teilweise/">campaign</a> the organization ran last year in Germany calling for the tech giant to publish its local lobby network. (He said Google did make some disclosures &#8212; but only after that public pressure.)</p>
<p>The lobby network on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=03181945560-59">Google&#8217;s EU transparency register</a> was also only included after public criticism, per Bank.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.lobbycontrol.de/2020/06/google-antwortet-nur-teilweise/">blog post</a> about its campaign last year, LobbyControl noted ongoing disclosure limitations that prevent the full picture of Google&#8217;s regional influence from being seen. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.lobbycontrol.de/wp-content/uploads/Google-Antwort-an-LobbyControl_19Juni2020.pdf">In its answer</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Google lists the organizations of which the group is a member in Germany. This ranges from the Atlantic Bridge to the Federal Association of German Startups and the Digital Association Bitkom to the Economic Forum of the SPD and the Economic Council of the CDU. For Europe, Google refers to its entry in the European transparency register,&#8221; it wrote.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;However, we also asked Google about the organizations that are financially supported by the company. Unfortunately, we have not received an answer to these questions. Google continues to deny comprehensive transparency of its lobby network in Germany and the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also noted that in the US Google publishes what it describes as &#8220;a <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/trade_association_and_third_party_groups.pdf">more comprehensive list</a>&#8221; vs its influence ops in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;There the company lists 94 trade associations and member organizations as well as 256 &#8216;third party organizations&#8217;,&#8221; it wrote. &#8220;In the US, there are on average 2.5 other organizations for every member organization that Google supports financially without membership.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Germany and Europe, too, we can assume that, in addition to the disclosed memberships, there are also numerous organizations that receive money from Google. Google keeps this information under lock and key.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted a number of Member States&#8217; permanent representatives to the EU to ask for a response to Google&#8217;s memo about its &#8220;successful&#8221; lobbying to freeze ePrivacy.</p>
<p>The permanent representations to the EU of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Finland, Poland, Sweden and Denmark did not respond to questions about their position on the file &#8212; nor did they confirm whether Google had lobbied them (directly or indirectly) to stall the legislation.</p>
<p>In fact we got no response to these requests at all.</p>
<p>Some representations do publish (partial) lists of lobbying meetings, as we have noted. But this is even a sketch as big tech can route around even those limited disclosures by approaching national governments locally, either directly to national governments or through their vast influence network of third parties.</p>
<p>Sometimes &#8212; presumably when a giant like Google feels a particular piece of legislation poses enough of a risk &#8212; it might even send in its own CEO to personally petition a government or head of state. Divide and conquer as they say.</p>
<h2>EU digital rules in the deep freeze?</h2>
<p>The adtech influence network across Europe is quite the thing to behold, even just looking at the (partially) visible tip.</p>
<p>An iceberg seems an appropriate visual metaphone for what Google and other tech giants have been busily developing behind closed doors across the EU to put a deep freeze on legislation that could disrupt their surveillance capitalism in a region with ~450M pairs of eyeballs &#8212; and the world&#8217;s most well-established set of digital privacy rules (at least on paper).</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/amazon-sought-to-water-down-eu-privacy-rules-document-shows/">Politico</a></em>&#8216;s report last year on Amazon&#8217;s lobbying memo described the document as offering &#8220;a snapshot of the company&#8217;s modus operandi in the EU&#8221; &#8212; highlighting references in the text to how it channels its positions through &#8220;a range of different lobby groups including tech groups CCIA and DigitalEurope, as well as marketing group FEDMA&#8221;. All of which now sounds very familiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon lobbyists said in the document that they would focus on lobbying Council telecoms attachés,&#8221; the report went on, suggesting another link between the interests of US tech giants and European telco giants (after all, US telcos don&#8217;t have the same regulatory limits on what they can do with users&#8217; data). &#8220;They said that they had met with ministries in Madrid, Rome and Paris and noted that Spain was &#8216;now openly outspoken against the proposal and aligned with our views&#8217; and that Italy was likely to follow suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the playbook for big tech to play EU policymakers off against each other looks firmly established. Even embedded.</p>
<p>That does not bode well for the passage of a suite of ambitious new EU digital regulations &#8212; from the aforementioned DSA and DMA to an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">Artificial Intelligence Regulation</a> which will provide controls for high risk applications of AI; or broad plans to expand the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">rules around data resharing</a> (with claimed privacy protections); or even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">planned legislation for online political ads</a>, given the risks that data-driven adtech can pose to democratic processes.</p>
<p>Still, revelations that GAFAM has been privately celebrating its success at derailing updates to the bloc&#8217;s rules may not sit easily with all EU Member State governments.</p>
<p>France and the Netherlands have &#8212; at least in public pronouncements &#8212; broken ranks somewhat, pressing for Brussels to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/france-and-the-netherlands-signal-support-for-eu-body-to-clip-the-wings-of-big-tech/">greater powers to reign in big tech</a> for example.</p>
<p>There is also pressure building within a number of Member States over the need for a competitive reboot of digital markets &#8212; to ensure a better outcome for consumers and competition. So even if EU legislation fails, big tech may face a patchwork of rules clipping its wings at a local level.</p>
<p>On this front, Germany is ahead: It has already updated its digital rulebook to bring in ex ante powers and the FCO has a raft of procedures open to assess tech giant&#8217;s market power &#8212; including into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts/">Facebook</a>. If it confirms they have what the law dubs “paramount significance for competition across markets” the next steps would be bespoke antitrust interventions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PzwpzgV0e7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">Google&#8217;s data terms are now in Germany&#8217;s competition crosshairs</a></p></blockquote>

<p>France has also been banging the drum for national and European &#8216;digital sovereignty&#8217; in recent years &#8212; and its competition watchdog stung Google with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">$268M fine over adtech abuse this summer</a> (albeit extracting interoperability commitments which Google will probably be more than happy to comply with if they further entrench its surveillance model).</p>
<p>France&#8217;s national stance aligns with rhetoric from the (French) EU commissioner, Thierry Breton, who is responsible for the bloc&#8217;s internal market policy &#8212; and is also fond of talking up <em>la souveraineté</em> &#8212; and/or warning of the balance of power between different global blocs &#8220;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/breton/announcements/europe-keys-sovereignty_en">hardening</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>And, this summer, French president Macron had some bold-sounding words about <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-france-tech-macron-idCAKCN2DS1UV-OCATC">breaking up US tech giants</a> &#8212; making his  utterance in front of a tech audience, no less.</p>
<p>So one looming development for the ePrivacy file &#8212; which could auger at least a shift of tone &#8212; is that France takes over the rotating Council presidency from Slovenia next year.</p>
<p>France has named digital regulations as among its priorities during the six-month stint when it will be steering activity. So there may be a small window of opportunity to unchoke big tech&#8217;s choke-hold on ePrivacy. Although France&#8217;s list of claimed priorities is long, and there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-council-presidency/news/too-many-priorities-kill-the-priorities-frances-many-ambitions-for-its-2022-eu-presidency/">scepticism over how much it will actually be able to get done</a>.</p>
<p>In &#8216;t Veld, for one, isn&#8217;t holding her breath &#8212; saying her expectations of the rotating presidency mechanism are &#8220;limited&#8221;.</p>
<p>She suggests a better solution for fixing blockages in the EU&#8217;s legislative firepower might be to strategically withhold portions of the budget &#8212; as a tool to concentrate Member States&#8217; minds on, well, the common good of all Europeans. (Though she says that such talk can make some of her fellow MEPs &#8220;nervous&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very tired of the way that the Council operates. They have to start taking responsibility,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t we learnt anything from the last couple of years? Look in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">the last weeks</a> &#8212; just today &#8212; about Facebook. Think about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/facebook-ignored-staff-warnings-about-sketchy-cambridge-analytica-in-september-2015/">Cambridge Analytica</a>. Haven&#8217;t they learnt anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>While adtech giants splash millions on bending the ears of EU policymakers, civil society organizations don&#8217;t even have a fraction of the resource to marshal to defend European&#8217;s fundamental rights from such self-interested attacks.</p>
<p>It is, in short, not a fair fight. But it&#8217;s a fight for the future of so much &#8212; perhaps for the very substance of society itself &#8212; as connectivity inexorably expands the net of data-driven surveillance that losing it doesn&#8217;t even bear thinking about.</p>
<p>Privacy is, on the one hand, inherently personal &#8212; which can make articulating its fundamental importance a challenge, since it is so very multifaceted and multidimensional. But, hey, you sure as hell miss it when it&#8217;s gone. Collectively, it is also a shield that helps keep people and communities aligned towards a civilized, common goal by eliding difference in a way that fosters good will, social cohesion and consensus.</p>
<p>Again, if we&#8217;re all broken out so we can be badged and branded, manipulated and jerked around &#8212; and, sure, set against each other if it happens to sell more stuff &#8212; aka, atomized by adtech &#8212; it can quickly become a very different, polarizing story. One that doesn&#8217;t have a happy-looking ending for democratic civilization.</p>
<p>And with giants like Facebook already making a pitch to co-opt interoperability to its own ends by embedding the surveillance model at the core of an &#8216;<a href="https://twitter.com/riptari/status/1454003961954975745">ad-ternative</a>&#8216; immersive digital reality (&#8216;the metaverse&#8217;), time is fast running out to save the European model &#8212; of fundamental rights and freedoms &#8212; from the deep-pocketed corporate lobbyists now ranged against it.</p>
<p>Remember: If the shiniest version of the future big adtech has to sell comes straight out of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">sci-fi dystopia</a> &#8212; and stars Nick Clegg trying to buy off the European model for &#8216;10,000 jobs&#8217; &#8212; it really is time to wake up and show big tech&#8217;s lobbyists where to find the door.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starlink, part of Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX company, has registered its business in India and is preparing to apply for licenses from the local government, according to a top official.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleased to share that SpaceX now has a 100% owned subsidiary in India,&#8221; Sanjay Bhargava, India director for Starlink, said in a LinkedIn post Monday. Starlink&#8217;s local India unit is registered with the name Starlink Satellite Communications Private Limited.</p>
<p>A local unit is required for an internet company to offer its services in India, where Starlink &#8212; assuming that it gets the license &#8212; plans to offer 200,000 active terminals in over 160,000 districts by December 2022, the company representatives said. That&#8217;s an ambitious goal for the company, which as of August had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/spacex-ships-100000-starlink-terminals-to-customers-eyes-future-launches-using-starship/">shipped 100,000 user terminals in 14 countries</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227157" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bhargava, a former PayPal executive, started in the new role at the beginning of October. The company has hired a number of key executives in India in recent months, including Parnil Urdhwareshe, who previously oversaw AMD’s policy efforts in India, as its Market Access director for the local business.</p>
<p>A SpaceX spokesperson didn’t respond to a query in September about the appointment of Bhargava, but the company’s chief executive Elon Musk confirmed the development over the weekend on Twitter.</p>
<p>Starlink, one of the leading companies that is launching small satellites to build a low-Earth orbiting network to provide low-latency broadband internet services, is aiming to serve rural communities in India, said Musk in a tweet, adding “Sanjay deserves a lot of credit for making X/PayPal succeed.”</p>
<p>In another LinkedIn post, Bhargava said, “at Starlink, we want to serve the underserved. We hope to work with fellow broadband providers, solution providers in the aspirational districts to improve and save lives.” The company said over the weekend that it&#8217;s working with Niti Aayog, a powerful Indian think tank, to identify 12 districts in the country for Starlink&#8217;s initial deployment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as more than half a billion people are online in India, just as many are still offline. According to industry estimates, hundreds of millions of Indians living in rural areas don&#8217;t have access to any broadband network.</p>
<p>“The government approval process is complex. So far there is no application pending with the government, so the ball is in our court to apply for consideration, which we are working on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our approach will be to get pilot approval quickly if Pan India approval will take long. We are optimistic that we will get approval for a pilot program or Pan India approval in the next few months,” said Bhargava last month, adding that if it fails to get the government approval, the actual number of terminals it may end up deploying by the end of next year will be “much lower than that or even zero.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In good news for its peers that may seek to go public, the numbers Nubank has shared in its IPO filing seem to make pretty reasonable business sense.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the neobanking boom has matured into a collection of large digital banks, we&#8217;re slowly getting a better picture of the economics of such business efforts. Chime was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/">early in telling the market that it was EBTIDA positive</a>, for example, unlike less profitable European neobanks.</p>
<p>The upcoming Nubank IPO — technically the public offering of Nu, but we&#8217;ll just say Nubank for simplicity — provides us with far more information and detail regarding the operations of a neobank at scale, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001691493/000119312521314359/d213207df1.htm">thanks to its newly public filing</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In good news for its peers that may seek to go public, the numbers Nubank has shared seem to make pretty reasonable business sense.</p>
<p>We will have more notes in time regarding the company&#8217;s offering, its shareholders, its varying business lines and more. This morning, we&#8217;re narrowing our focus to the broad economics of neobanking and will end with an examination of Nubank&#8217;s aggregate financial health. We&#8217;ll take just a second at the end to test a few valuation marks against what we find.</p>
<p>Building a neobank at scale is not cheap. Leading startups and unicorns in the market niche have raised tectonic sums of capital to get to where they are today. But what did all that cash buy them? In Nubank&#8217;s case, quite a lot, it appears.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5ql2LDM23N"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/">The Nubank EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Nubank EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/embed/#?secret=5ql2LDM23N" data-secret="5ql2LDM23N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>The economics of neobanking</h2>
<p>Nubank is one of the most valuable startups in the world, with over 40 million users across Brazil, as well as Mexico and Colombia.</p>
<p>Neobanks, like any consumer product, can be viewed through the lenses of customer acquisition costs, customer monetization and activity, and long-term revenues. We want to know what Nubank pays to attract new users, how their product use and rates thereof translate to income and how much the fintech giant can juice users for over a longer time horizon.</p>
<h3>Customer acquisition costs</h3>
<p>Nubank is proud of its customer acquisition costs (CAC). The company states in its F-1 filing that its CAC was &#8220;US$5.0 per customer of which paid marketing accounted for approximately 20%&#8221; for the first three quarters of 2021. That&#8217;s lower than we anticipated, frankly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As access to unique sounds is becoming a competitive advantage for social apps, Snapchat announced today it&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/nbcuniversal-sounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inked a deal</a> with NBCUniversal to give users access to licensed audio clips from various NBCU movies and TV shows. With this latest launch, users can add to their Snaps audio clips from fan favorites such as &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; and &#8220;The Office,&#8221; then send them to other users or post them to Snapchat Spotlight.</p>
<p>When someone sends you a Snap with a sound, you’ll be able to swipe up to view the title of the movie or TV series from which the audio originated. A “Play This Sound” link will open a webpage that will display the streaming platforms where you can watch whichever movie or TV show the audio is from.</p>
<p>The audio catalog includes popular TV shows and movies like &#8220;The 40-Year-Old Virgin,&#8221; Back to the Future,&#8221; &#8220;Billy Madison,&#8221; &#8220;Bridesmaids,&#8221; &#8220;Forgetting Sarah Marshall,&#8221; &#8220;Happy Gilmore,&#8221; &#8220;Scarface,&#8221; &#8220;Shrek,&#8221; &#8220;The Office,&#8221; &#8220;Parks and Recreation,&#8221; &#8220;Saturday Night Live,&#8221; &#8220;Law &amp; Order,&#8221; &#8220;Brooklyn Nine-Nine,&#8221; &#8220;30 Rock,&#8221; &#8220;Friday Night Lights&#8221; and others. The deal additionally includes audio from Peacock Originals, like &#8220;Saved by the Bell,&#8221; &#8220;Girls5eva,&#8221; and &#8220;A.P. Bio.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227078" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“NBCUniversal has an iconic catalog and we know Snapchatters will love adding quotes from their favorite movies and series to their Snaps to help perfectly express the moment,” said Ben Schwerin, Snap’s senior vice president of content and partnerships, in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Snapchat also has partnerships with numerous studios and companies within the music industry, including Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, NMPA, Sony Music Publishing, Warner Chappell, Kobalt, BMG and more.</p>
<p>Snapchat has been looking to compete with TikTok, which has popularized short-form video sharing with posts set to music from a large catalog. For Snapchat, giving users access to different sounds is an important part of its efforts to compete with TikTok. Last year, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/snapchat-launches-its-tiktok-rival-sounds-on-snapchat/">Sounds</a>, a music-powered feature that allows users to set their Snaps to music. Snap says that since launching Sounds, videos created with music from Sounds have resulted in 521 million videos created and 31 billion views, the company said.</p>
<p>But Sounds aren&#8217;t just used to help fuel Snap&#8217;s TikTok competitor. Since Sounds&#8217; launch, nearly 45% of all Snapchat videos created with Sounds (across sends, posts and saves) were sent via direct message.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new catalog of NBCU Sounds will be made available to Snapchat users globally, across iOS and Android.</p>

		An art historian by training, Michael Maizels is a multidisciplinary researcher working at the intersection of creativity, technology and economics. His next book, a new study on business model evolution in postwar art history, will be out in 2021.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I am an art historian who has carried out extensive research on the evolution of the market for “recent art.” And I can tell you that something generational is now happening with NFTs.</p>
<p>As a historian, this is quite exciting — almost the equivalent of an astronomer getting to watch the birth of a new galaxy. The multimillion-dollar results achieved by Cryptopunks, Bored Ape and Beeple have shattered long precedents in the history of art auctions and suggest that we may be nearing some tectonic tipping point around digital culture and virtual currency.</p>
<p>That tipping point may be inevitable in the century to come, but the fate of today’s most visible figures is remarkably uncertain. Having studied several of these cycles up close, I can say with some confidence that the factors that have determined whether art trends become art history are receiving scant attention amid the NFT writing of today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225953" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Namely, the movements that have held their long-term critical esteem (as well as market value) are those who have managed to attach themselves to the institutions, such as museums and universities, that both distill prestige and create knowledge.</p>
<p>Said differently, how will the world of NFT.NYC, taking place now in Times Square, relate not only to Sotheby’s downtown, but uptown — to MoMA? Or to Columbia University’s Department of Art History and Archaeology, widely considered the preeminent modern and contemporary program in the world?</p>
<p>The NFT world may collectively decide to sidestep these questions. No one would think of looking to the Golden Globes or the NYU film school to arbitrate the value of TikTok virality.</p>
<p>However, I’m skeptical that no serious attempt will be made to cultivate NFT worth for the long haul. There’s just too much at stake for the multibillion-dollar ecosystem of today not to attempt to organize and sort itself out. Gatekeepers and tastemakers arise organically, and powerful ones already exist in the $60 billion art market that predates the NFT universe by hundreds of years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, the relationships between artists, collectors, curators and academics have formed the fault lines around which art history has broken over the last centuries — sorting winners from losers, visionaries from imitators, priceless heritage from passing fancy. And I am certain that, for the NFT world, this intersection of intellectual and financial value has the potential to matter a lot. More than almost anyone realizes.</p>
<p>Probably the closest art historical analog to the present NFT fervor was the dramatic rise of pop art in the early 1960s. Artists such as Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol turned suddenly and in earnest to colorful, recognizable imagery produced in technological, déclassé media in multiple such as screen prints and lithographs.</p>
<p>Intentionally or not, this created an unprecedented volume of stuff to sell to the nouveau riche who had been locked out of the Old Master circuit. Fifty soup cans support a lot more market action than one Vermeer.</p>
<p>Gross market value aside, the durability of the success of Johns and Warhol is due in no small part to the efforts of a dealer named Leo Castelli, arguably the most impactful character of modern art history whose name is not widely known beyond the discipline.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/leo-castelli-archive-moma-contemporary-art-market-1202667829/">My research</a> uncovered how Castelli zealously worked to ensure that his coterie would end up on the walls of museums and as the subjects of academic monographs, endeavors that required him to occasionally flout ethical and legal norms. Importantly, his efforts broke through for a wave of new significant voices: not just the first young Americans to cross the threshold to canonization, but many of the first openly queer figures, as well. It rarely permits coloring within the lines, but writing history in real time can open the door to necessary change.</p>
<p>Pop’s priming of the museum ecosystem stands in marked contrast to a more recent episode of democratization. The “return to painting” of the 1980s presaged the NFTs’ auction-fueled dynamics as dealer Mary Boone and Sotheby’s CEO Alfred Taubman pioneered techniques akin to futures trading and margin buying — the last major innovations in the art auction space before the blockchain. They effectively poured gasoline on the fire of the secondary market but, without significant attention to an academic or institutional matrix to support the work, the overnight sensations they hyped mostly faded into oblivion.</p>
<p>These things will matter deeply in the long run. As years stretch into decades and centuries, cryptocurrency usage will almost inevitably grow. Nearly every interaction on the planet today is technologically mediated in some way, and the currency of record is ever more likely to become that which is native to the medium. This long-term potential provides a huge opportunity to rethink not just the expressive capabilities of the NFT but the fundamental means of academic knowledge creation.</p>
<p>An incredibly rich set of potential lurks here, made all the more pressing given the unfolding waves of crisis in higher education. Imagine a political scientist gaining a chance to tinker with an experimental voting mechanic as a part of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Or a historian working to close the gaps in an archival record through artistic re-imaginings.</p>
<p>Out of far-flung research, world-changing discoveries are sometimes forged. Voting mechanics might move from experimental margin to governmental center — perhaps finally unblocking comprehensive climate reform or other blue-sky legislative needs. The NFT world in which these ideas were incubated would have, through its collaboration with the academy, created something of deep significance. Something worthy of museum preservation (and market valuation) as an artifact of history.</p>
<p>At the present moment, open possibilities linger in the decentralized ether. How will practice be turned into history, ideally with the best net effect for society at large?</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Netflix sees gaming as a big part of its future in the battle for consumer attention. In July, the company hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-verdu-2a6113/">Mike Verdu</a> to head a new gaming division, signaling just how serious it is about moving into this new territory.</p>
<p>Verdu has a lot of gaming cred. He most recently served as vice president of augmented reality and virtual reality content at Facebook, and he was also the former head of Electronic Arts’ mobile gaming division. He has had stints at other game developers including Zynga, Kabam, Atari and Legend Entertainment, and he was a game developer himself. In short, Verdu knows this world inside and out, which is a good thing because his decisions could have a profound impact on the future of game development.</p>
<p>Verdu recently hinted at the company’s future plans. On September 28, Netflix announced its acquisition of <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/expanding-our-games-team-with-the-acquisition-of-night-school-studio">Night School Studio</a>, bringing some developer talent in house. It’s also been speculated that Netflix will pursue licensing deals with other gaming studios to quickly grow its offerings.</p>
<p>It makes one wonder how Netflix’s plans will influence game developers and studios around the world. More importantly, how will developers respond to Netflix’s entry into the space?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			There will likely be some fallout over the next few years as Netflix finds its footing, but ultimately, the company&#8217;s move into gaming will push game development further.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Options: A model shakeup</h2>
<p>Netflix’s existing audience of over 209 million subscribers translates into a lot of free marketing impressions and low player acquisition costs, giving it an immediate advantage over small studios and independent game developers who often struggle to gain attention for their games. Additionally, Netflix’s gaming division could spell trouble for the huge numbers of mobile game developers who rely on in-app purchases or advertising to make money — Netflix’s subscription model means it controls the user experience and doesn’t have to rely on ads or in-app purchases for its revenue stream.</p>
<p>At first blush, this could seem like a terrible blow to game developers, but it also opens new opportunities. If Netflix starts to gain traction in the gaming market (still a big <em>if</em>), developers will be spurred to innovate to stay a step ahead. This could be in terms of how games are designed and marketed, the actual player experience or how they are monetized. Innovation is good and necessary if developers want to continue attracting players.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say we could see some new models and experiences entering the gaming landscape. Netflix’s move into gaming is an inflection point, as it validates the work that developers have done thus far in capturing the mindshare of billions of players throughout the world. Gaming has gone mainstream, and Netflix will likely force it to evolve even more. This could be the moment gaming grows up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to Facebook AI Research, the next generation of robots should be much better at feeling — not emotions, of course, but using the sense of touch. And to advance the ball in this relatively new area of AI and robotics research, the company and its partners have built a <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/reskin-a-versatile-replaceable-low-cost-skin-for-ai-research-on-tactile-perception" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new kind of electronic skin</a> and fingertip that are inexpensive, durable and provide a basic and reliable tactile sense to our mechanical friends.</p>
<p>The question of why exactly Facebook is looking into robot skin is obvious enough that AI head Yann LeCun took it on preemptively on a media call showing off the new projects.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, he recalled, it started with Zuckerberg noting that the company seemed to have no good reason to be looking into robotics. LeCun seems to have taken this as a challenge and started looking into it, but a clear answer emerged in time: If Facebook was to be in the business of providing intelligent agents — and what self-respecting tech corporation isn&#8217;t? — then those agents need to understand the world beyond the output of a camera or microphone.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The sense of touch isn&#8217;t much good at telling whether something is a picture of a cat or a dog, or who in a room is speaking, but if robots or AIs plan to interact with the real world, they need more than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve become good at is understanding pixels and appearances,&#8221; said FAIR research scientist Roberto Calandra, &#8220;But understanding the world goes beyond that. We need to go towards a physical understanding of objects to ground this.&#8221;</p>
<p>While cameras and microphones are cheap and there are lots of tools for efficiently processing that data, the same can&#8217;t be said for touch. Sophisticated pressure sensors simply aren&#8217;t popular consumer products, and so any useful ones tend to stay in labs and industrial settings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DIGIT was released in 2020 as an open source design; it uses a tiny camera pointed at the pads to produce a detailed image of the item being touched. You can see the fingertips themselves in the image at top; it&#8217;s quite sensitive, as you can see from the detailed maps it&#8217;s able to create when touching various items:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226539" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226539" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2226539" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg" alt="Objects shown above images of the signals produced by the robotic fingertip." width="1024" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg 1818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=768,263 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=680,233 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=1536,526 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2226539" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>The ReSkin project has roots dating back to 2009; we wrote about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/19/a-unique-fingertip-sensor-helps-robots-touch-the-world-around-them/">MIT project called GelSight in 2014</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/mit-creates-a-soft-fingered-robotic-gripper-than-could-eventually-tie-knots-and-sew-stitches/">then again in 2020</a> — the company has spun out and is now the manufacturing partner for this well-documented approach to touch. Basically you have magnetic particles suspended in a soft gel surface, and a magnetometer beneath it can sense the displacement of those particles, translating those movements into accurate force maps of the pressures causing the movement.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the GelSight type system is that the hard component — the chip with the magnetometer and logic and so on — is totally separate from the soft component, which is just a flexible pad impregnated with magnetic dots. That means the surface can get dirty or scratched and is easily replaced, while the sensitive part can hide safely below.</p>
<p>In the case of ReSkin, it means you can hook up a bunch of the chips in any shape and lay a slab of magnetic elastomer on top, then integrate the signals and you&#8217;ll get touch information from the whole thing. Well&#8230; it&#8217;s not quite that simple, since you have to calibrate it and all, but it&#8217;s a lot simpler than other artificial skin systems that were possible to operate at scales beyond a couple square inches.</p>
<p>You can even make it into little dog shoes, because why not?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226536" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ReSkin-dog-shoe.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226536" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2226536" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ReSkin-dog-shoe.gif" alt="Animated image of a dog with pressure-sensing pads on its feet and the readings from them." width="768" height="432" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2226536" class="wp-caption-text">Animated image of a good dog with pressure-sensing pads on its feet and the readings from them. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>With a pressure-sensitive surface like this, robots and other devices can more easily sense the presence of objects and obstacles, without relying on, say, extra friction from the joint exerting force in that direction. This could make assistive robots much more gentle and responsive to touch — not that there are many assistive robots out there to begin with. But part of the reason why is because they can&#8217;t be trusted not to crush things or people, since they don&#8217;t have a good sense of touch!</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s work here isn&#8217;t about new ideas, but about making an effective approach more accessible and affordable. The software framework will be released publicly and the devices can be bought fairly cheaply, so it will be easier for other researchers to get into the field.</p>
