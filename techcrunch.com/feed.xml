</div><p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to building a data science team, many companies fail at the first step — creating a job posting. These mistakes have been amplified in the age of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.datanami.com/2020/11/16/why-data-science-is-still-a-top-job/">increasing</a> <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/08/data-scientist-job-market-2020.html">demand</a> for AI and data science experts, <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-recessions-impact-on-analytics-and-data-science/">driven in part</a> by the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact, is showing no sign of abating. Many employers are failing to identify viable job candidates, much less interviewing or hiring them.</p>
<p>What’s the biggest obstacle holding them back? In our experience, it is often a poorly drafted job posting. And with the pandemic completely <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/2021-recruiting-trends-shaped-by-covid-19.aspx">stopping all in-person recruiting events</a>, hiring success hinges on an effective job rec. Previously tolerable mistakes are now fatal.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com/">The Data Incubator</a>, a data science training and placement firm, we’ve helped hundreds of companies successfully hire data science teams. Honestly, it pains me to see amazing companies undersell themselves in this area.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When it comes to building a data science team, many companies fail at the first step — creating a job posting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Companies inevitably gravitate toward the same generic buzzwords, promoting themselves as &#8220;cutting edge,&#8221; &#8220;creative,&#8221; &#8220;collaborative,&#8221; &#8220;data driven,&#8221; &#8220;passionate&#8221; or &#8220;insightful&#8221; (just peruse <a href="https://www.indeed.com/q-Data-Scientist-jobs.html">Indeed</a> for examples of these lackluster postings). Or they delve into industry jargon, which may be lost on candidates who are not familiar with the industry.</p>
<p>To streamline the writing process, we recommend that clients break down their competitive advantage into three buckets: compensation, mission and tech. Only by understanding where their strength lies can they successfully market their job openings.</p>
<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>Compensation is an important component of making a position competitive. Managers certainly need to fight to ensure their remuneration range is appropriate for their data science roles. However, budget constraints are difficult to overcome, especially given the ability of tech and finance to pay top dollar for these sought-after skills. How to combat this when you don’t have the same budget? Consider listing compensation in job ads.</p>
<p>If you’re one of (the majority of) employers who cannot afford to compete on salary, this will help job seekers understand what to expect. Neither you, nor a potential candidate, wants to spend hours interviewing just to discover that it would have never worked out because of compensation. Save yourself the time and frustration by listing remuneration upfront.</p>
<p>What if you are one of the few employers able to pay major-league salaries? Congratulations, but don’t throw away your hard-won budget! Companies develop reputations for compensation. Unless you are one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@paysa/best-paying-companies-for-data-scientists-7930d4b8c6a">select firms</a> with a reputation for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/10/22/15-data-scientist-jobs-that-pay-100k-or-more/?sh=309be96626c9">paying top dollar</a>, you will need to signal that to top talent. Otherwise, strong candidates may assume the remuneration is low and not apply, defeating the purpose of paying a high salary in the first place.</p>
<p>Obviously, listing salaries is controversial and there are <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/why-isnt-salary-always-listed-on-a-postin/">plenty of reasons</a> why <a href="https://www.macslist.org/money-and-benefits/why-employers-dont-include-salary-job-posts-what-you-can-do-about-it">employers are weary</a> of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2016/11/23/why-dont-job-ads-include-a-salary-range/?sh=7ce8766d7a85">listing salary ranges</a>. However, a <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/salary-most-important-part-job-ad.aspx">recent survey by SHRM</a> found that 70% of professionals want to hear about salary upfront and <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/press/">Glassdoor.com</a> reports that salary is the No. 1 consideration for 67% of job seekers. With all these benefits, employers should seriously consider being more upfront and transparent about what they are able to pay, if only to save themselves time and frustration.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>In the COVID-19 workplace, employees are finding themselves increasingly isolated. With work from home poised to stay even after the virus has dissipated, the risk of isolation will continue. Companies need to double down on articulating their mission and galvanizing employees around that. This doesn&#8217;t just start with employment but the very first step of the hiring process: the job posting. Emphasizing mission in the job posting will attract employees.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/">BMW</a> plans to have 25 electrified cars in its lineup by 2025 and it&#8217;s taking a few more steps in this direction this year with the launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">all-electric iX SUV</a> and <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/future-vehicles/i4-all-electric-vehicle.html">the i4 sedan</a>. Today, for the first time, the German automaker shared a few more details of what we can expect from the i4, its first fully-electric sedan, in addition to sharing the first exterior shots of the new model.</p>
<p>At the top end, the i4 will have a power output of 390kW / 530HP. Going from zero to 100km/h will take four seconds.</p>
<p>BMW promises up to a 300 miles range, according to its own preliminary tests based on the EPA&#8217;s test procedures. Enough to go from L.A. to Las Vegas. That&#8217;s the same range as the iX will be able to cover on a single charge and a slight increase in horsepower compared to BMW&#8217;s new SUV. And while that range is less than what Tesla and some other competitors can offer, it&#8217;s still more than what&#8217;s possible with comparable all-electric Porsche and Audi models like the eTaycan and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/audis-new-2022-e-tron-gt-is-a-real-electric-performance-sedan-not-just-another-electrified-crossover/">e-tron GT</a>, which are in the lower 200s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2126583" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90416005-highRes.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126583" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126583" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90416005-highRes.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126583" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;With its sporty looks, best in class driving dynamics and zero local emissions, the BMW i4 is a true BMW. It makes the heart of the BMW brand now beat fully electric,&#8221; said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales.</p>
<p>For now, we don&#8217;t have any pricing details or additional specs for the i4. It will become available later this year, so we&#8217;ll likely see more details in the summer.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHF3RHQCqsA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;The iX is purpose-built, it&#8217;s spectacular and it&#8217;s a completely new BMW X product,&#8221; Frank Weber, BMW’s head of development, said at a press event earlier this week. &#8220;But what people are longing for is to see that we have a sport sedan that is fully electric. [&#8230;] And the i4 has everything it takes to have a real sporty sedan from BMW that is fully electric.&#8221;</p>
<p>And indeed, unlike the somewhat quirky i3, BMW&#8217;s first all-electric car, the i4 is a standard, four-door sedan (with real passenger doors, unlike the i3) &#8212; something that buyers in the market for a sporty yet roomy electric car from BMW in the spirit of the existing 4-series will likely appreciate.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, BMW also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bmw-debuts-the-next-generation-of-its-idrive-operating-system/">version 8 of its iDrive operating system</a>, which will feature a new dashboard layout and visual design, with two curved screens. It will make its debut in the i4 and iX.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">covered an interesting round</a> for <a href="http://Copy.ai">Copy.ai</a>, a startup that employs GPT-3 to help other companies with their writing projects. GPT-3, or <em>Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3</em>, is a piece of AI from the OpenAI group that takes text from the user, and writes a lot more for them.</p>
<p>As part of the process of covering the Copy.ai round, I got caught up in the idea of AI-powered writing. I&#8217;ve long been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/01/bring-on-the-blogging-robots/">more curious than afraid</a> of automated writing. So when the Copy team described their very positive impressions of the GPT-3 AI writing tool to TechCrunch during an interview, I was intrigued.</p>
<p>To scratch this newly-formed itch, I doodled around this morning with a competitor of sorts to the Copy team , <a href="https://headlime.com/">Headlime</a>. And, <em>freaking</em> heck am I am impressed at what folks have managed to build around the GPT-3 technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sure, GPT-3 can add words to a prompt. But the technology can do a lot more than that. The GPT-3-powered Headlime managed to not only write some medium-good stuff for me, but also managed bring in concepts concerning my reporting beat that were in my head but <em>not</em> in the prompts I provided.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t do better than just show you what I mean. So, here&#8217;s what happened when I used Headlime for the first time, sans help.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the first thing that Headlime showed me, a language selector and a request for a description of the post that I wanted to write. I decided to push the system a bit by just telling it about a piece I need to write in light of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/olo-prices-ipo-sharply-above-its-target-valuing-company-as-high-as-4-6b/">today&#8217;s market action</a>:</p>

<p><em>Ha ha</em>, I thought, that will kick it in the teeth and I, a biped of intelligent meat wrapped around some calcium sticks, will feel grossly superior to the computer player. I hit go and then realized that I actually had to provide 500 characters of stuff, so I rambled for a bit to fill in required length:</p>

<p>Time for the next step! Hitting the button brought up a list of possible headlines for the post I was helping create, which were honestly not terrible:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126249" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="596" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png 743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?resize=680,596 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Fair enough, yeah? At this point I was starting to become impressed.</p>
<p>I selected the first headline as it was my favorite and moved along. Next came the work to get an intro put together for the post, a process that involved the strenuous work of clicking a button:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126246" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.47-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.47-AM.png 732w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.47-AM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.47-AM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.47-AM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.47-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />Here are the options proffered:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126250" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?w=604" alt="" width="604" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png 714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?resize=266,300 266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?resize=604,680 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
<p>Again, <em>not bad</em>.</p>
<p>What struck me about these are not merely minor variations on each other. They are structured differently, taking various angles on what I was halfway talking about in the 500 characters of bilge I had fed into the system. I was starting to wish that I had given GPT-3 a bit more to work with up top, as it was trying its best after I had clearly not.</p>
<p>Intro selected, I was brought into a CMS of sorts, where our selected bits were included, and your humble servant was asked to do a bit more writing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126254" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png 1393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>I was happy to oblige, only for the system to stop me and offer to take over:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126257" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png 1393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Having precisely no idea what a credit is, or what two of them cost as I was on a free trial of sorts, I hit the &#8220;Write for me&#8221; button. This is what came out:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png 1391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><em>Look at how it finished that sentence I started, even after I used em-dashes!</em> The software gets the next sentence backwards, but is right back on the horse afterwards talking about how higher interest rates make exotic investment classes like venture capital less attractive! I was gobsmacked.</p>
<p>I will keep playing with the tech and the various software wrappers that are being built to productize GPT-3. More notes to come. But I wanted to pause and share my initial delight. This is <em>cool</em>. I can&#8217;t recall the last time that technology actually shocked me. But, well played GPT-3, you&#8217;re amazing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://seon.io/">Seon</a>, which lets online businesses fight online fraud like fake accounts has raised a $12 million Series A round led by Creandum, with participation from PortfoLion, part of OTP Bank. The funding appears to be one of Hungary’s larger series A rounds to date.<br />
 <br />
Seon is a fraud-detection startup that establishes a customers’ ‘digital footprint’ in order to weed out false accounts and thus prevent fraudulent transactions. Clients include Patreon, AirFrance, Rivalry and Ladbrokes Launched in 2017, the company claims to bave been profitable since the end of 2019, after experiencing growth through working with neobanks, esports, gaming, Forex, and crypto trading throughout the rapid digitization brought on by the pandemic.</p>
<p>SEON’s CEO and Founder, Tamas Kadar, said in a statement: “We’re extremely pleased to have completed our latest funding round, led by Creandum, joining its exciting tech portfolio. We feel we have found a like-minded investor to work closely with to pursue the significant global opportunity for our business as we continue to democratize fraud fighting.”<br />
 <br />
Simon Schmincke, general partner at Creandum, said: &#8220;At Creandum, we believe cybercrime will be one of the most serious threats of the 21st century. With SEON, we’ve found an anti-fraud solution that’s effective, affordable, flexible, intuitive, and clearly proves its ROI.&#8221;<br />
 <br />
Gábor Pozsonyi, partner at PortfoLion Capital Partners, added: &#8220;Seon is a fundamentally useful brand: it offers a solution to one of the greatest challenges of digitalization, not only saving hundreds of millions of euros for its partners but making the internet a safer place.&#8221;</p>
<p>SEON are seen as competing with Emailage, Iovation, Threatmetrix. However, SEON’s thesis is that social media is a great proxy of a legitimate user vs bot/fake fraudster, so it looks heavily at social accounts to weed out fraudsters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the funding round, Seon has brought on board the following investors as shareholders: N26 founders, Maximilian Tayenthal and Valentin Stalf; SumUp founders Stefan Jeschonnek and Jan Deepen; Tide CEO Laurence Krieger; Revolut ex-CFO Peter O&#8217;Higgins; iZettle ex-chief Product Officer Leo Nilsson; Onfido cofounder Eamon Jubawy, and ComplyAdvantage founder Charlie Delingpole.</p>

<p>Why are developers still solving everyday pain points with these manual, archaic processes, as opposed to employing “Little AI&#8221;?

<h2><strong>What we’re missing </strong></h2>
<p>Take this article you’re reading right now. If TechCrunch let loose a Little AI  — essentially empowered machine learning — it could learn you prefer to read short, newsworthy articles in the morning and longer thought pieces at night. That learning informs a personalized home page, presenting you with bullet points upon awakening and feature stories at night — all without you having to laboriously enter your preferences or respond to pop-up surveys.</p>
<p>Little AI also learns that what your VC friend wants to see on their screen first thing is recent series funding announcements. A truly personalized experience is not only our expectation, it is the core component of the relationship between us and our content providers. And yet, it’s missing.</p>
<p>Let’s raise the stakes. There are multiple players in the split-pay space. A sprinkle of Little AI can teach a fintech provider that one consumer likes to finish paying off an item in less than six months and never wants any outstanding payment to exceed $250. It can also learn that they are open to revolving credit/product offers for an experience-related purchase above $1,500. This type of truly personalized financing enables both the consumer and merchant to benefit from a completed sale while lowering the risk of default to the credit provider.</p>
<p>Travel will be coming back in a big way, with more deals than ever. Little AI can jump in and learn how to make that experience far easier for consumers and far more successful for travel providers. Rather than showing consumers every single deal for every single location, it can take personal preferences into account.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Motors has designed the battery packs in its luxury electric vehicle for two lives. The company, which is already experimenting with energy storage systems for commercial and residential customers, is also eyeing ways to repurpose batteries from its electric vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Lucid is still years from having to contend with a large number of used batteries —  its first EV, the luxury Lucid Air sedan, isn&#8217;t coming to market until the second half of 2021 — the company is already planning how to give them a second life them in a yet-to-be-launched energy storage business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery-cell modules that power Lucid’s vehicles are identical to the ones that will be used for energy storage, making them well-suited for “second-life” purposes, according to the company. The company has already constructed a prototype of a 300-kilowatt hour stationary battery storage system at its engineering lab, Lucid’s Chief Engineer and Senior VP of Product Eric Bach told TechCrunch. The batteries in that system are new, but there is “no technical limitation” that would prevent Lucid from swapping them out with used batteries, Bach said. While Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson has previously discussed plans to eventually build energy storage systems like Tesla that uses new batteries, this is the first time the company has talked about second-life applications for the product. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have already initiated second-life pilot projects aimed at extracting that remaining value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bach explained the company will likely retrieve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">batteries used in Lucid EVs after they reach the end of their useful life through its dedicated service centers or when customers trade in their vehicles. Once batteries are returned to Lucid, the company would need to harvest the modules from the packs and run a quality check on them. Lucid’s vehicles have built-in sensors that provide data on each of its cars from the battery packs down to the module level, Bach said, which will come in handy when determining the health of each module. After physical testing, the modules could be ready to be placed in an outgoing product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage systems do contain some additional components. In a home system, that may include a DC-to-AC inverter, a cooling system and safety switches. The actual battery will remain consistent across Lucid’s products.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucid hasn’t determined how it will distribute the second-life batteries between home and industrial applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personally, I feel in an industrial application, using these [second-life] modules would be more appropriate and easier because there, the key metric is really just dollars per kilowatt hour,” Bach said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In instances where a Lucid vehicle ends up at a car dismantler, Bach suggested there may be an opportunity to incentivize the dismantler to feed the battery packs back to the company. Even if that doesn’t happen, as the price of EV battery raw materials continues to rise, dismantlers will likely make their own business of selling battery packs to companies or recyclers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point – with no product yet on the market and with an expectation that it will be low- to mid-volume – Lucid has not started branching out into recycling materials itself, he said. For the moment, Lucid is leaving recycling operations to its battery cell suppliers, like South Korea-based LG Chem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But in the long run, I mean, we’re just at the start of our journey [. . .] and I can envision that in multiple years we will look into cell manufacturing ourselves as well as the full value chain for everything that’s needed to make the applicable energy storage devices,” Bach said. “So in the future, absolutely it makes a lot of sense as the volume goes up, you need to try to contain more of the supply chain and that goes back into a sustainable method of harvesting the raw materials.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bach said the company is laser-focused on the Lucid Air and the public may be a few years out from seeing a Lucid home battery system. Until then, the Lucid Air will come equipped with bidirectional charging capabilities, meaning the customer will be able to feed the power from her car into her house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Essentially, that is the first home battery system that we will have already,” Bach said.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what resources — in terms of people and capital — Lucid is putting towards an energy storage business. Such details are likely to remain scant until after the company officially becomes a publicly traded company. In March, Lucid Motors announced it had reached an agreement to become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">publicly traded company</a> through a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp., in what was considered the largest deal yet between a blank-check company and an electric vehicle startup.</p>
<p>The combined company, in which Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund will continue to be the largest shareholder, will have a transaction equity value of $11.75 billion. Private investment in the public equity deal is priced at $15 a share, putting the implied pro-forma equity value at $24 billion.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to bring the Lucid Air and an SUV to market as well as to expand its factory in <span class="xn-location">Arizona</span>, Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson previously told TechCrunch. The company plans to expand the factory over another three phases in the coming years to have the capacity to produce 365,000 units per year at scale. The initial phase of the $700 million factory was completed late last year and will have the capacity to produce 30,000 vehicles a year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is apparently pleased with how its Amazon Care pilot in Seattle has gone, since it <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-care-to-launch-across-u-s-this-summer-offering-millions-of-individuals-and-families-immediate-access-to-high-quality-medical-care-and-advice-24-hours-a-day-365-days-a-year">announced this morning</a> that it will be expanding the offering across the U.S. this summer, and opening it up to companies of all sizes, in addition to its own employees. The Amazon Care model combines on-demand and in-person care, and is meant as a solution from the search giant to address shortfalls in current offering for employer-sponsored healthcare offerings.</p>
<p>In a blog post announcing the expansion, Amazon touted the speed of access to care made possible for its employees and their families via the remote, chat and video-based features of Amazon Care. These are facilitated via a dedicated Amazon Care app, which provides direct, live chats via a nurse or doctor. Issues that then require in-person care is then handled via a house call, so a medical professional is actually sent to your home to take care of things like administering blood tests or doing a chest exam, and prescriptions are delivered to your door as well.</p>
<p>The expansion is being handled differently across both in-person and remote variants of care; remote services will be available starting this summer to both Amazon&#8217;s own employees, as well as other companies who sign on as customers, starting this summer. The in-person side will be rolling out more slowly, starting with availability in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and &#8220;other cities in the coming months&#8221; according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of today, Amazon Care is expanding in its home state of Washington to begin serving other companies. The idea is that others will sing on to make Amazon Care part of its overall benefits package for employees. Amazon is touting the speed advantages of testing services, including results delivery, for things including COVID-19 as a major strength of the service.</p>
<p>The Amazon Care model has a surprisingly Amazon twist, too – when using the in-person care option, the app will provide an updating ETA for when to expect your physician or medical technician, which is eerily similar to how its primary app treats package delivery.</p>
<p>While the Amazon Care pilot in Washington only launched a year-and-a-half ago, the company has had its collective mind set on upending the corporate healthcare industry for some time now. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/amazon-jpmorgan-and-berkshire-hathaway-to-build-their-own-healthcare-company/">announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan back at the very beginning of 2018</a> to form a joint venture specifically to address the gaps they saw in the private corporate healthcare provider market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YC9tmdwxBa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/amazon-jpmorgan-and-berkshire-hathaway-to-build-their-own-healthcare-company/">Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway to build their own healthcare company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway to build their own healthcare company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/amazon-jpmorgan-and-berkshire-hathaway-to-build-their-own-healthcare-company/embed/#?secret=YC9tmdwxBa" data-secret="YC9tmdwxBa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That deep pocketed all-star team ended up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/the-amazon-berkshire-hathaway-jpmorgan-healthcare-joint-venture-is-officially-ending/">officially disbanding at the outset of this year,</a> after having done a whole lot of not very much in the three years in between. One of the stated reasons that Amazon and its partners gave for unpartnering was that each had made a lot of progress on its own in addressing the problems it had faced anyway. While Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan&#8217;s work in that regard might be less obvious, Amazon was clearly referring to Amazon Care.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for large tech companies with lots of cash on the balance sheet and a need to attract and retain top-flight talent to spin up their own healthcare benefits for their workforces. Apple and Google both have their own on-campus wellness centers staffed by medical professionals, for instance. But Amazon&#8217;s ambitious have clearly exceeded those of its peers, and it looks intent on making a business line out of the work it did to improve its own employee care services — a strategy that isn&#8217;t too dissimilar from what happened with AWS, by the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ultra precise cancer therapies! Human-like hair grown from plants! A way to potentially save the bees!</p>
<p>The spectrum of companies coming out of <a href="https://indiebio.co">IndieBio</a> has always been pretty wild, and its latest batch definitely doesn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>
<p>As the early stage, biology-focused accelerator arm of SOSV, IndieBio gives the companies in its program $250,000+, mentorship, and full access to a biology lab to bring their ideas to life.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When founder Arvind Gupta left the accelerator last year to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/leaving-the-3-2-billion-portfolio-he-helped-build-at-indiebio-arvind-gupta-joins-mayfield-to-create-the-genesis-consortium/">join the venture capital fund Mayfield</a>, Mayfield and IndieBio partnered to form the Genesis Consortium, which offers IndieBio companies an additional $250,000 in optional funding.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Leaving the $3.2 billion portfolio he helped build at IndieBio, Arvind Gupta joins Mayfield to create the Genesis Consortium&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/leaving-the-3-2-billion-portfolio-he-helped-build-at-indiebio-arvind-gupta-joins-mayfield-to-create-the-genesis-consortium/embed/#?secret=a1cPyXiPXr" data-secret="a1cPyXiPXr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>IndieBio initially operated solely out of San Francisco, with the accelerator expanding just last year to include a New York cohort that runs in parallel. The SF program is led by Managing Director Po Bronson, while the New York program is led by Managing Director Stephen Chambers.</p>
<p>With its Demo Day still a ways out, IndieBio gave us a peek at the teams currently going through the program. It&#8217;s worth noting that IndieBio deliberately invests very early — in many cases, even before it&#8217;s entirely clear whether or not the scientific concepts behind a company are fully feasible. &#8220;Our program <em>is</em> our diligence&#8221;, Bronson tells me. The goal is to prove out concepts — and figure out how to turn them into big businesses — for hundreds of thousands of dollars, rather than millions. &#8220;We&#8217;re biting off the risk, and de-risking it for the next investors in line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are the companies currently in each program, alphabetically:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cartediem.org/">Diem</a>, a London, UK-based fintech start-up has raised a seed round of $5.5 million led by Fasanara Capital, and Angel investor Chris Adelsbach, founder of Outrun Ventures. Additional investors include Andrea Molteni (early investor in Farfetch), Ben Demiri (co-chairman at fashion tech PlatformE) and Nicholas Kirkwood (founder of the eponymous brand). </p>
<p>Diem is a debit card with an app affording instant cash access, traditional banking service benefits (debit card, domestic and international bank transfers), but also allowing consumers to dispose of goods for eventual resale. The idea here is that this feeds into the so-called circular economy, making Diem attractive from an environmental point of view. Some estimates put the amount of worth of goods disposed of in the last 15 years at $6.9Tn.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: You have an old time of clothing, phone, book or bag, for instance. You load the item it into the app. The app makes you an offer for what the item is worth. If you accept, cash is loaded into your account and there’s a facility to spend in the item, which is then resold. The incentive, therefore, is not to throw away the object and add to landfill, because you have now turned it into cash. Think “neo bank meets people who sell your stuff on eBay”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Geri Cupi said in a statement: “Diem&#8217;s mission is to empower consumers to value, unlock, and enjoy wealth they never knew they had. All of this while fuelling the circular economy and supporting the commitment to sustainability as our key value proposition. DIEM makes it possible for capitalism and sustainability to co-exist.”</p>
<p>Lead Investor and CEO at Fasanara Capital, Francesco Filia, said: “Fasanara is excited to announce our partnership with DIEM and Geri Cupi… [it’s] a new generation fintech powered by principles of circular economy and look forward to support its growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Snap, Inc. is a camera company,&#8221; <a href="http://snap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snap</a> notes on its homepage, and while a lot of its effort up to now have been about using that camera ethos to help people share images of their lives with their social circles on its flagship app Snapchat, today the company made an acquisition to further that camera reach in another direction: selling fashion and more generally, e-commerce and shopping.</p>
<p>Snap today confirmed that it has acquired<a href="https://www.fitanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Fit Analytics</a>, a startup based in Berlin that has built technology to help shoppers find the right-sized apparel and footwear from online retailers, along with a wider set of personalization tools and other analytics to help retailers figure out how to sell more overall.</p>
<p>Fit Analytics already works with a <a href="https://www.fitanalytics.com/partners#!partners-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of big retailers</a>, including North Face, Asos, Calvin Klein, Patagonia, Puma, and many more &#8212; in all, some 18,000 retailers already.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, Snap is adding not just a technology team &#8212; there are 100 staff at the company, based in Berlin, who will be reporting to <span class="il">Snap</span> VP of Engineering Nima Khajehnouri &#8212; but a substantial e-commerce technology business into its portfolio.</p>
<p>Fit Analytics has <a href="https://blog.fitanalytics.com/fit-analytics-is-joining-the-snap-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that it will be continuing to operate its existing business, while also working on helping Snap build out its shopping platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If you are a Fit Analytics partner, this is only the beginning,&#8221; Fit Analytics&#8217; CEO and co-founder Sebastian Schulze wrote in a blog post announcing the deal. &#8220;By leveraging Snap’s scale and capabilities, we will not only continue to service our existing clients, but also deepen our relationships and offerings with our brand partners and retailers. Our main focus going forward will be to scale the Fit Analytics business and work with Snap to grow their shopping platform, leveraging our technology and expertise. Our teams will be jointly executing on next-gen shopping, fashion and style offerings.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Fit Analytics&#8217; technology lets people enter their own measurements into a tool that uses machine learning to match those dimensions up to the clothes or shoes in question to find the best fit.</p>
<p>Notably, although it is not the focus for the company right now, Fit Analytics also has built technology to match clothing using images that customers upload themselves &#8212; an interesting area considering Snap&#8217;s focus on the visual experience, on visuals created by its users &#8212; and of course the features it has built around lenses and other augmented reality experiences to let people play with different versions of themselves and how they look.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126452" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fitfinder.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="547" /></p>
<p>The terms of the deal are not being disclosed. Fit Analytics, which used to be called UpCload (and actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/31/upcload-uses-your-webcam-to-help-you-order-clothes-that-actually-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched back in 2011</a> at a TC Disrupt event in Beijing focused mainly on &#8220;webcam&#8221; technology &#8212; this was the days before smartphone-created selfies were <em>de rigueur</em>) had <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/134270-65/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosed less than $1 million in funding</a> according to PitchBook data, although that list of customers implies that it was generating strong revenues.</p>
<h2>Social shopping spree</h2>
<p>Snap&#8217;s acquisition of Fit Analytics pulls on a few different strategic threads for the social media company.</p>
<p>For starters, it will give Snap another way to diversify its revenues. The company is now making nearly $1 billion a quarter in revenues (in its <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Snap-Inc.-Q4-2020-Earnings-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q4 earnings</a>, it posted sales of $911 million). The majority of that is coming from advertising on Snapchat, so Snap is naturally looking for other ways of making money.</p>
<p>Whether Fit Analytics is integrated into Snapchat or not, and regardless of what will happen with how Apple and Google let apps monetize on their mobile platforms, Fit Analytics is already likely pulling in a substantial amount of revenue by way of its e-commerce services for retailers.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has led a lot of retailers to rethink how well their e-commerce experiences work, and that could have meant more activity for companies like Fit Analytics. All that will now be funneled on to Snap&#8217;s balance sheet.</p>
<p>Its advertising business, meanwhile, reveals that Snap already has a substantial relationship with fashion and beauty brands.</p>
<p>In those Q4 earnings alone, it noted augmented reality campaigns with NYX Professional Makeup and Ralph Lauren, as well as a partnership with Perfect Corp for 200 beauty brands to upload catalogs to the Snap Camera for augmented reality try-on. Fit Analytics will help it deepen those engagements, by giving Snap another range of features that it can build out for those customers. Come for the AR filter to see how you look in a Ralph Lauren sweater, and then&#8230;shop the look.</p>
<p>In addition to diversifying its revenues, it could be a sign of how Snap is diversifying the kinds of bells and whistles it&#8217;s providing for its audience. Again, Snap is not commenting on how and when it plans to integrate Fit Analytics&#8217; tools, but it is notable that Snapchat&#8217;s core audience of teen and younger users also happens to be a major target for fashion retailers, too.</p>
<p>Clothing, fashion accessories and shoes together made up some 33% of US teenagers&#8217; spend in Fall 2020, according to research from <a href="http://www.pipersandler.com/private/pdf/TSWTs_Fall_2020_Full_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piper Sandler</a>, against other categories like video games, music, and food. (Books got a paltry 1% &#8211; I guess they didn&#8217;t survey many bookish types&#8230;)</p>
<p>Slicing up the pie somewhat differently, Piper Sandler said that the majority of spend, 40%, was dedicated to &#8220;How I Look (aka the Selfie Budget)&#8221; &#8212; putting what Fit Analytics enables more squarely in the same categories that Snap is also looking to address.</p>
<p>Sidenote: Piper Sander&#8217;s research shows that Amazon is far and away the biggest destination for fashion shopping right now for teens, which shows how fragmented the D2C market is.</p>
<p>That also sets up an interesting opportunity for Snap, by way of Snapchat, to provide another shopping channel for those D2C brands, while also riding on the coattails, so to speak, of Instagram and its growing role in the world of social media-based commerce.</p>
<p>At its core, Fit Analytics&#8217; tools are part of what you might think of as the &#8220;missing link&#8221; in fashion e-commerce.</p>
<p>The benefits of online commerce are pretty extensive: people can shop whenever they want; they can get a much bigger selection of items, since the retail &#8220;space&#8221; is limited only by the time shoppers want to commit to shopping; they can get more personalised experiences; and they are increasingly getting a diversified range of delivery options and times.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The biggest drawback has, of course, been in the lack of &#8220;hands-on&#8221; interaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Put more simply, you have no way of trying on clothes and shoes, leading to the other big pain point: returns. Fit Analytics is part of the army of startups that have been building technology to fill that gap: others have included companies that provide visualizations of how clothes can look on a person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Notably, these are areas where Amazon has also been making significant investments &#8212; in addition to making acquisitions like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/amazon-has-acquired-3d-body-model-startup-body-labs-for-50m-70m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D modeling startup Body Labs</a>, it has launched a plethora of services to make it easier for people to buy from it, such as its try-on-and-return feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/amazon-prime-wardrobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Wardrobe</a>. The e-commerce giant has a lot of weapons in its arsenal, but technology undoubtedly has been helping it win the fashion commerce race. </span></p>
<p>Snap has made <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/snapchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 20 acquisitions to date</a>, covering areas like advertising technology, location-based services, services to further the company&#8217;s AI and augmented reality products, and forays into music. Fit Analytics appears to be the first focused on shopping and e-commerce, and specifically fashion, but if its interest in shopping continues to grow, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s the last.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>A friend and I founded a tech startup last year. Like a lot of other startups, we’re looking for funding. Should we come to Silicon Valley to meet with venture capitalists? </strong></p>
<p><strong>How should we begin that process? What type of visa should we get and how easy is it to get?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Logical in Lagos</strong></p>
<p>Dear Logical:</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to me from the entrepreneurial hotspot of Lagos!</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/062-investing-in-diversity-with-esther-tricoche/">episode</a> of my podcast, I spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esthertricoche/">Esther Tricoche</a>, director of investments at Kapor Capital, who offered up many words of wisdom to founders. She also mentioned that in many emerging entrepreneurial markets, including Lagos, accelerator funding and Series A funding are relatively easy to find, but pre-seed and seed funding are not.</p>
<p>Getting yourselves and your startup in front of Silicon Valley investors that focus on pre-seed and seed funding will be important to rapidly scale. Esther mentioned that even in U.S. cities, such as Atlanta, that are entrepreneurial hotspots, investment dollars are not as plentiful as they are in Silicon Valley. Moreover, investors outside of Silicon Valley tend to be more risk-averse.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>So, yes, you should meet with Silicon Valley investors, but be aware that most U.S. embassies and consulates remain closed to routine visa and green card processing due to the ongoing pandemic. Given that, you can start requesting virtual meetings now; and you will have to wait until the U.S. consulate in Lagos comes back to full capacity to apply for a visa to come to the U.S. I like checking for visa availability through the <a href="https://waypoint.international/directory">Waypoint Embassy and Consulate Directory</a> (full disclosure: I am an advisor to Waypoint).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As always, I recommend that you consult an experienced immigration attorney when you’re ready to take the step of actually applying for a visa.</span></p>
<p>Once U.S. consular offices reopen, if you aren’t <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html">eligible for ESTA</a>, you can apply for a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/b-1-visa-visitors-business/">B-1 visitor visa for business</a>. With a B-1 visa, you can request an initial stay of up to six months. This is a great status for business meetings such as to talk to prospective investors, negotiate contracts and incorporate a new business. However, you can’t work in the U.S. You must be aware that no hands-on work for pay (or even the chance of future remuneration) by a U.S. entity is allowed.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has fended off an attempt by advertisers in France to use a competition complaint route to derail incoming pro-privacy changes in iOS that will require third party apps to obtain users&#8217; consent before they can track them.</p>
<p>The French competition authority (FCA) <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/article/ciblage-publicitaire-pas-de-mesures-conservatoires-lencontre-dapple-mais-poursuite-de">said today</a> it has rejected calls by IAB France, MMAF, SRI and UDECAM for it to intervene pre-emptively and block Apple&#8217;s move, saying it does not currently consider the introduction of the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature to be an abuse of a dominant position.</p>
<p>However the regulator said it is continuing to investigate Apple &#8220;on the merits&#8221; &#8212; specifying it will be looking to ensure the tech giant is not applying less restrictive rules for its own apps vs third party developers (aka &#8216;self preferencing&#8217;).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-apple-antitrust/apple-gets-boost-in-french-privacy-fight-but-still-faces-probe-idUSKBN2B914D">Reuters</a>, the competition authority worked closely with France&#8217;s privacy watchdog, CNIL, to reject the request to suspend ATT.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The CNIL has been contacted for comment.</span></p>
<p>An Apple spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re grateful to the French Competition Authority for recognizing that App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 is in the best interest of French iOS users. ATT will provide a powerful user privacy benefit by requiring developers to ask users&#8217; permission before sharing their data with other companies for the purposes of advertising, or with data brokers. We firmly believe that users’ data belongs to them, and that they should control when that data is shared, and with whom. We look forward to further engagement with the FCA on this critical matter of user privacy and competition.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">January</a> Apple said the ATT would be applied to iOS in early spring.</p>
<p>Since then a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/french-startup-lobby-targets-apple-with-privacy-hypocrisy-complaint/">complaint</a> by a French startup lobby, France Digitale, has also been filed with the country&#8217;s privacy watchdog &#8212; accusing Apple of privacy hypocrisy.</p>
<p>That complaint similarly invoked competition concerns &#8212; contrasting the incoming ATT requirement for third party apps to gain consent before tracking iOS users to default iOS setting for Apple&#8217;s own apps that the complaint said allow tracking. However Apple called the allegations &#8220;patently false&#8221;, saying ATT will be &#8220;equally applicable to all developers including Apple&#8221;.</p>
<p>The ATT switch in iOS is certainly wildly unpopular with adtech companies like Facebook, who claim it will harm developers&#8217; ability to monetize their apps. Facebook has also conceded Apple&#8217;s move will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/facebook-q4-earnings-2/">significantly dent its own revenues</a>.</p>
<p>Apple, meanwhile, has accused the adtech industry of hysteria and false claims &#8212; and continued to denounce the “data-industrial complex” for creeping on Internet users to exploit their personal data and try to manipulate people for profit.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s also true that Apple can serve personalized advertising to iOS users of its own apps it argues that it holds itself to &#8220;a higher standard&#8221; than the adtech data industrial complex because it lets users opt out of what it calls its &#8220;limited first-party data use for personalized advertising&#8221; &#8212; claiming that feature &#8220;makes us unique&#8221;.</p>

<p>In a similar recent development involving Google, a competition complaint was filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/digital-marketing-firms-file-uk-competition-complaint-against-googles-privacy-sandbox/">late last year</a> in the UK in an attempt to block changes it intends to make to how users of its Chrome browser can be tracked by third parties.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s so-called &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">Privacy Sandbox</a>&#8216; plan is also wildly unpopular with advertisers &#8212; who accuse the tech giant of abusing a dominant position by shutting down their ability to track users while continuing to do so itself.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, multiple efforts are underway across the adtech industry to devise alternative means of tracking web users&#8217; activity &#8212; accelerating by the prospect of Chrome, the dominant browser by marketshare, depreciating support for third party trackers.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority announced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">January</a> it&#8217;s investigating suspected breaches of competition law by Google following a number of complaints about Privacy Sandbox.</p>
<p>That probe continues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rivahealth.com/">Riva Health</a>, founded by scientist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuhinksinha/">Tuhin Sinha</a> and Siri co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dagkittlaus">Dag Kittlaus</a>, wants to help people measure their blood pressure in a clinically approved way. Blood pressure can help indicate at-risk patients before they are actually at risk, showing early signs of heart disease. While other hardware solutions on the market promise the same end goal, Riva wants to be a purely software solution that integrates with hardware that it thinks its end user has anyway: their smartphone.</p>
<p>The company, launching out of stealth today, has raised $15.5 million in seed funding in a round led by Menlo Ventures, with participation from True Ventures. UC Health and University of Colorado Innovation Fund account for $5 million of the round, with other angels including GoHealth’s Brandon Cruz and Madison Industries Larry Gies. Greg Yap of Menlo, who talked to Sinha for three years before investing, will be joining the board.</p>

<p>Kittlaus, who also founded AI-assistant Viv, says that he began thinking about how to make a difference in digital health after undergoing his own severe health issues. Kittlaus was diagnosed with pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer in 2016, the same type of cancer that late Apple CEO Steve Jobs died from.</p>
<p>“I spend time researching ideas on it, but I was missing the thing that I’ve had in both my previous companies, which was some amazing technical innovation that could form a wedge that you can move the world with,” he said.</p>
<p>Kittlaus mentioned this internal conversation with his friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/shawnvc">Shawn Carolan</a>, this past summer. The friend, who was the first investor in Siri, introduced him to Tuhin Sinha, the scientist who spent years developing the technology that is used to power Riva.</p>
<p>To use Riva, all a person needs to do is open the app on their phone and tap &#8220;Go,&#8221; which triggers the camera flash on the back of the phone. The app will then guide the user to place their finger over the right camera and help them adjust positioning until it locks into place. After that, Riva will use the light to track blood pressure change and create a rendering of it on screen.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126338" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126338" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2126338" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BP-Purple-BG.png" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BP-Purple-BG.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BP-Purple-BG.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BP-Purple-BG.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BP-Purple-BG.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BP-Purple-BG.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BP-Purple-BG.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BP-Purple-BG.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126338" class="wp-caption-text">Riva Health planned design, subject to change. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Riva Health</p></div></p>
<p>“The well-known part of this technology is shining a light on a blood vessel and getting a wave out of it,” Sinha said. “The novelty is the shape of the wave, how it relates to blood pressure, and our secret sauce is looking at those waveshape changes and validating them in a rigorous and comprehensive way.” Sinha declined to share how they are validating exactly, but said that it is key that a startup has to measure blood pressure in a variety of different scenarios — think standing or sitting — to see if it is effective.</p>
<p>Once Riva tracks five to seven heartbeats&#8217; worth of data, it has a comprehensive understanding of someone’s blood pressure at that moment.</p>
<p>The data, which is HIPAA compliant, can then be sent to a family physician or doctor’s office to be analyzed if a risk is present, starting with hypertension.</p>
<p>“Moving to a platform like the smartphone is mobilizing the measurement and management of [health and disease management],” Sinha said. Riva Health is a purely software solution.</p>
<p>The company is currently in the process of verifying its software with Android phones, but Kittalus says that “any modern phone should be able to acquire the signal needed” to work.</p>
<p>A big hurdle for any health tech company, and especially Riva, is whether it can get FDA approval for clinical usage. The company is currently engaged in that process with the FDA and will ask users who pilot its free app, coming out this summer, to participate in the trial and data-gathering to bolster its approval process.</p>
<p>Right now, Riva is using its technology to track the changes in blood pressure in a clinical setting, and the second half will be in a home setting. By tracking the use of its system in the real world, it can prove that it works in a laboratory and home setup, helping it prove that its disease management technology is effective.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of gizmos and gadgets that will claim to do blood pressure reading,” Kittlaus said. “I call it blood pressure as a novelty where it gives you blood pressure reading but not a clinic.” Other solutions like cuffless wearables that connect to smart devices like an iPhone or Apple Watch measure blood pressure for nonclinical usage, <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/home-blood-pressure-monitors-arent-accurate-201410297494#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHome%20blood%20pressure%20monitors%20may,used%2C%E2%80%9D%20according%20to%20Dr.">which means that it isn’t super accurate</a> and only notifies obvious blood pressure problems.</p>
<p>Riva wants to be daily and precise enough to be relied on by doctors, which is part of its overall route to make money. While the team wouldn’t share any published research or proof about its scientific method, Dr. Richard Zane, the chief innovation officer of UC Health said that it is “bulletproof” technology. Over 700 companies in the past three years have tried to work with Zane’s team, and Riva is one of the few that met the bar.</p>
<p>“When our team tested it, it actually worked out of the box the first time, which basically never happens,” Zane said. He added that one of the biggest barriers to entry is that people have needed devices in the past, and Riva brings “a novel technology that actually works that will be embedded in something that patients already carry around with them and allow them to manage their heart disease or hypertension.”</p>
<p>“The core product of the company is healthcare outcomes,” Sinha said. The company is part of the wave of startups that believe outcome-based healthcare is the future, a model where doctors are paid for results instead of the number of visits they complete in a day. With this vision, Riva plans to monetize by selling outcomes to hospital systems and providers: If it can provide a tool to help doctors keep people out of surgery and indicate issues earlier than before, it can make a solid argument as to why systems should adopt it.</p>
<p>Only 20% of healthcare works on the value-based model, so this will be a hurdle even with the right sentiment. In the meantime, Kittlaus says that it is working with insurers to pay for its service. Riva would get reimbursed for treating and managing hypertension.</p>
<p>“We want to keep it free for the consumer, free for the doctor and insurance will cover it,” he said.</p>
<p>If and when the FDA clears this technology, Kittlaus says that doctors and medics “will still be skeptical about it” but will ultimately be convinced of the outcomes being more accurate, and ongoing, than the cuff.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re prescribing an app,” he said. “Instead of medicine.”</p>
<p>The app, pending FDA approval, will be available for public late this year or early next year. The next few months for Riva will be key in determining its success and validity — and Sinha, the chief scientist, says it will be rigorous, but fast. He has a personal tie to the company’s success.</p>
<p>Sinha has lost five uncles and one aunt, as well as his father, before the age of 59 to heart disease. Now, his app has the ability to track the condition that made him lose these family members in the first place.</p>
<p>“I feel like I have a ticking time bomb in my chest,” he said. “And if anything, I’m going to do this for myself.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arrival, the UK electric vehicle startup that will soon be a publicly traded company, plans to build a second microfactory in the United States.</p>
<p>The announcement comes several months after Arrival picked Charlotte, North Carolina for its North American headquarters. This new microfactory will be located in West Charlotte near the airport and about 32 miles from its first U.S. factory in Rock Hill, South Carolina.</p>
<p>The newly announced microfactory will be producing two different classes of EV vans for our U.S. customers, expanding the zero-emissions options for fleet operators, the company&#8217;s CEO Mike Ableson said. Production is expected to begin by the third quarter of 2022. Arrival said it is investing about $41.2 million in the production center, which will have the capacity to assemble up to 10,000 electric delivery vans each year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Many of the vehicles produced at the new Charlotte microfactory are expected to enter UPS&#8217;s North American fleet, according to the company. UPS committed to <a href="https://arrival.com/news/ups-invests-in-arrival-and-orders-10000-generation-2-electric-vehicles">buy up to 10,000 vehicles</a> from Arrival in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s other, and first, U.S. microfactory in Rock Hill will be used to assemble electric buses.</p>
<p>Arrival was a secretive electric vehicle startup for nearly five years until January 2020 when it announced a $110 million investment from Hyundai and Kia. Over the past 14 months the company has shared more of its plans and partners, all culminating in its announcement last month to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/"> merge with a special purpose acquisition company </a>CIIG Merger Corp., to become a publicly traded company. The SPAC merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Arrival&#8217;s business model centers on its microfactories, which the company argues allows it to produce electric vehicles that are price competitive with fossil fuel-powered commercial vans, buses and other vehicles. The microfactories require a low capital expenditure and have a smaller footprint than conventional factories, Arrival says.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We're checking in on the price investors paid for a block of Olo shares before it began trading and will look into the latest numbers in Coinbase's new S-1/A filing]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stock-futures-edge-down-ahead-of-fed-decision-11615970655?mod=hp_lead_pos1">big story</a> in the finance world this morning is that the Nasdaq composite index lost ground in pre-market trading while bond yields rose. The concern is that inflation could rise, which led to bonds selling off and falling valuations for expensive stocks. So, tech stocks were broadly lower this morning.</p>
<p>Unlike last night, when New York-based restaurant software company Olo priced its IPO <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210316006106/en/Olo-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $25 per share</a>, sharply above its raised IPO target price range.</p>

<hr />
<p>Today, we&#8217;re checking in on the price investors paid for a block of Olo shares before it began trading. The resulting valuation and its new revenue multiples will help us answer several questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>First, how hot is the market for high-growth tech shares that also feature profitability? And, second, is Olo pricing ahead of, or behind, known comps? If the latter is true, it could point to a cooling enthusiasm among public investors for tech IPOs, even if the headline numbers coming from the Olo IPO are impressive.</p>
<p>Then we&#8217;re going to chat about <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001679788/000162828021004939/coinbaseglobalincs-1a1.htm#i86a9d9b35e45447ea6eb369e5dcf1e6a_115">Coinbase&#8217;s latest S-1/A filing</a>, which helps provide a bit of guidance regarding how its direct listing is scooting along.</p>
<p>Ready to get caught up on the public-private divide that the most successful startups cross? Let&#8217;s get into it!</p>
<h2>Is Olo&#8217;s IPO pricing aggressive, neutral or a letdown?</h2>
<p>As a quick reminder, Olo initially targeted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/olos-ipo-could-value-the-company-north-of-3b-as-toast-waits-in-the-wings/">a $16 to $18 per-share IPO price interval</a>. That <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/olo-raises-ipo-range-as-digitalocean-sees-possible-5b-debut-valuation/">was raised</a>, as expected, to $20 to $22 per share. Pricing at $25, then, is a strong 56.25% greater per-share value than the low end of the company&#8217;s first estimate.</p>
<p>As Olo featured rapid growth (an acceleration in year-over-year revenue from 59.4% in 2019 to 94.2% in 2020), and GAAP profits (a 2019-era net loss of $8.3 million became 2020 net income of $3.1 million) in its IPO filings, the first price range it rolled out felt a bit light. The second, however, felt more appropriate.</p>
<p>At $25 per share, we have to do new math. Using a simple share count inclusive of the company&#8217;s underwriters&#8217; option, Olo is worth $3.62 billion. That figure swells to $4.6 billion when a fully diluted valuation is calculated, per IPO watch group <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79476/Restaurant-SaaS-platform-Olo-prices-IPO-at-$25-well-above-the-upwardly-revi">Renaissance Capital</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google earlier this year <a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/vaccines-how-were-helping/">announced</a> an update to Google Maps to help people find COVID-19 vaccination sites nearby, and now <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apple-maps-now-displays-covid-19-vaccination-locations/">Apple is doing the same</a>. Apple device owners can either ask Siri or search within Apple Maps to find nearby COVID-19 vaccine providers within the U.S., the company says. These results will include key information, like operating hours, addresses, phone numbers and links to the provider&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>To access this information through a voice command, users can ask Siri something like &#8220;where can I get a Covid vaccination?,&#8221; which will direct them to Maps.</p>
<p>In addition to Siri or searching directly within Apple Maps for vaccine info, the option &#8220;Covid-19 vaccinations&#8221; will also be available in Apple Maps&#8217; &#8220;Find Nearby&#8221; menu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Apple says its vaccination location data is being sourced from <a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/">VaccineFinder</a>, an initiative led by Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital. This data has also been helping to power Google Maps&#8217; vaccine finding capabilities, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/vaccines-how-were-helping/">earlier said.</a> Apple notes that healthcare providers, labs and other businesses can also choose submit their information about either COVID-19 testing or vaccination locations via the <a href="https://register.apple.com/covid-19/">Apple Business Register</a> page. After doing so, Apple will validate the information and then display it to users who are searching for COVID-19 resources in their local area.</p>
<p>At launch, there&#8217;s information about over 20,000 vaccine locations being provided through Apple Maps. Apple says more sites will be added in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, Apple has integrated other COVID-related health resources into Apple Maps both in the U.S. and internationally. Last year, for example, it updated Apple Maps to display COVID-19 testing sites in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the U.S. It also added COVID-19 modules to business pages, and updated Siri with more knowledge about Covid-19, testing sites, and, now, vaccination locations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">One of the biggest gripes about investing apps is that they are not acting responsibly by not educating users properly and allegedly letting them fend for themselves. This can result in people losing a lot of money, as evidenced by the number of lawsuits against Robinhood.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, an eight-year-old company that has been focused on nothing <em>but</em> financial education is now offering trading and banking services in the U.S..</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the years, London-based <a href="https://invstr.com/">Invstr</a> has built out an educational platform with features such as an investing Academy. It’s created a Fantasy Finance game, which gives users the ability to manage a virtual $1 million portfolio so they can learn more about the markets before risking their own money for real. Via social gamification, Invstr has set out to make the educational process fun.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">It has also built a community around users so they can learn from each other (something another Robinhood competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/gatsby-raises-millions-to-take-on-robinhood/">Gatsby</a> is also doing).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over 1 million users have downloaded the platform globally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Invstr, according to CEO and founder Kerim Derhalli, is taking a different approach from competitors by offering education and learning tools upfront. And in addition to giving users the ability to make commission-free stock trades, it’s also giving them a way to digitally bank and invest using their Invstr+ accounts “without ever needing to move money from one place to another.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Invstr takes it all a step further for subscribers who have access to an “Invstr Score,” performance stats and behavioral analytics among other things.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Derhalli said moving in this direction with the company was part of his business plan from day one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think the most powerful trend in the U.S. is self directed investing,” Derhalli told TechCrunch. “Younger generations have grown up in an app world and they expect to be autonomous and do things for themselves. Many distrust the banking system, and they don’t want to follow in their parents’ footsteps when it comes to banking and finance. We think this is a massive opportunity.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the unveiling of its new offerings, Invstr also announced Wednesday that it has closed on a $20 million Series A in the form of a convertible offering. This builds upon $20 million it previously raised across two seed rounds from investors such as Ventura Capital, Finberg, European angel investor Jari Ovaskainen and Rick Haythornthwaite, former global chairman of Mastercard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Derhalli said he felt compelled to found Invstr after seeing firsthand how a lack of knowledge and confidence can prevent individuals from starting to invest. He worked for three decades in senior leadership roles at Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan before founding Invstr “so that anyone, anywhere could learn how to invest.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Invstr is offering its new investing services in partnership with<a href="https://www.apexclearing.com/"> Apex Clearing</a>, which formerly provided execution and settlement services to Robinhood. Its digital banking services are being offered through a partnership with <a href="https://www.vast.bank/">Vast Bank</a>. To address the security piece, Invstr said its user data is also protected by technology from<a href="https://www.okta.com/"> Okta</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company, which also has offices in New York and Istanbul, plans to use the new capital to launch new brokerage and analytics tools and a portfolio builder.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we think about getting access to an application, we tend to focus on the authentication side &#8212; granting or denying people (or devices) entry. But there is another piece to this, and that&#8217;s authorization. This is related to what you can do once you are inside the application, and <a href="https://www.osohq.com/">Oso</a>, an early stage startup, has created an open source library for developers to make it easier to build authorization in their applications.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced an $8.2 million Series A led by Sequoia with participation from SV Angel, Company Ventures, Highland Capital and numerous angel investors. When combined with a $2.7 million seed round from 2019, it brings the total raised to $10.9 million.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Graham Neray says that developers have benefited from tools like Stripe and Twilio to normalize the use of third-party APIs to offload parts of the application that aren&#8217;t core to the value prop. Oso does the same thing, except for authorization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We help developers to speed up their authorization roadmaps by up to 4x, and the way that we do that is by providing this library, which comes with pre-built integrations, guides and an underlying policy language,&#8221; Neray explained.</p>
<p>He says that authorization is a misunderstood concept, and as though to confirm this, when I tried to explain Oso to a colleague, his first thought was that it is an Okta competitor. It&#8217;s not. As Neray explains authorization and authentication are related, but are in fact different and require a different set of tools.</p>
<p>While tools like Okta grant you access, authorization determines what buttons can you click, what pages, can you see, what data can you access. Most developers handle this manually by writing the authorization code themselves, linking it to Active Directory (or a similar tool) and fashioning a permissions matrix. Oso&#8217;s goal is to remove that burden and provide a set of tools to abstract away most of the complexity.</p>
<p>The tool is open source and the startup is concentrating on building a community of users for now to build developer interest. Over time, they fully intend to build a commercial company on top of that, but are still thinking about how that will look.</p>

<p>For now,  the company, which launched in 2018, has 9 employees with plans to triple over the next 18 months. Neray and co-founder and CTO Sam Scott are thinking carefully about how to build a diverse, inclusive and equitable company as they grow. That means hiring from underrepresented groups, treating them fairly and making them feel like they belong. Neray says at this point, he is doing all of the hiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;I make a concerted effort to ensure that our pipeline is as diverse as I want the team to be &#8212; full stop &#8212; and that&#8217;s the only way to do it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He adds that while building a diverse workforce is the morally right thing to do for him and his co-founder, there is also a practical business side to this too. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to build an echo chamber with people from the same background, the same thought process and all the same upbringing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When the company can return to the office, the plan is to have a home base, but let folks work where they want and how they want. &#8220;The plan is we will have an office in New York, and we will have remote team members. So in one form or another it will be hybrid,&#8221; Neray said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LA and Bangalore-based space startup <a href="https://pixxel.space">Pixxel</a> has closed a $7.3 million seed round, including newly committed capital from Techstars, Omnivore VC and more. The company has also announced a new product focus: Hyperspectral imaging. It aims to provide that imaging at the highest resolution commercially available, via a small satellite constellation that will provide 24-hour, global coverage once it&#8217;s fully operational.</p>
<p>Pixxel&#8217;s funding today is an extension of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/indias-first-earth-imaging-satellite-startup-raises-5-million-first-launch-planned-for-later-this-year/">$5 million it announced it had raised back in August of last year</a>. At the time, the startup had only revealed that it was focusing on Earth imaging,, and it&#8217;s unveiling its specific pursuit of hyperspectral imaging for the first time today. Hyperspectral imaging uses far more light frequencies than the much more commonly-used multispectral imaging used in satellite observation today, allowing for unprecedented insight and detection of previously invisible issues, including migration of pest insect populations in agriculture, or observing gas leaks and other ecological threats.</p>

<p>&#8220;We started with analyzing existing satellite images, and what we could do with this immediately,&#8221; explained Pixxel co-founder and CEO Awais Ahmed in an interview. &#8220;We realized that in most cases, it was not able to even see certain problems or issues that we wanted to solve – for example, we wanted to be able to look at air pollution and water pollution levels. But to be able to do that there were no commercial satellites that would enable us to do that, or even open source satellite data at the resolution that would enable us to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The potential of hyperspectral imaging on Earth, across a range of sectors, is huge, according to Ahmed, but Pixxel&#8217;s long-term vision is all about empowering a future commercial space sector to make the most of in-space resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started looking at space as a sector for us to be able to work in, and we realized that what we wanted to do was to be able to enable people to take resources from space to use in space,&#8221; Ahmed said. That included asteroid mining, for example, and when we investigated that, we found hyperspectral imaging was the imaging tech that would enable us to map these asteroids as to whether they contain these metal or these minerals. So that knowledge sort of transferred to this more short-term problem that we were looking at solving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the reason that Pixxel&#8217;s founders couldn&#8217;t find existing available hyperspectral imaging at the resolutions they needed was that as a technology, it has previously been restricted to internal governmental use through regulation. The U.S. recently opened up the ability for commercial entities to pursue very high-resolution hyperspectral imaging for use on the private market, effectively because they realized that these technical capabilities were becoming available in other international markets anyway. Ahmed told me that the main blocker was still technical, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we were to build a camera like this even two or three years ago, it would not have been possible because of the miniaturized sensors, the optics, etc.,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The advances that have happened only happened very recently, so it&#8217;s also the fact that this the right time to take it from the scientific domain to the commercial domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pixxel now aims to have its first hyperspectral imaging satellite launched and operating on orbit within the next few months, and it will then continue to launch additional satellites after that once it&#8217;s able to test and evaluate the performance of its first spacecraft in an actual operating environment.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down and focus on a single topic, or theme. This is our sweet spot: going beyond definitions and into the dirty and deep impact of how a phenomenon could impact startups and tech. We are hoping to explore more than answer, and debate more than agree.</p>
<p>This week we&#8217;re riffing on the impending Y Combinator demo day class, all hailing from the Winter 2021 cohort. As we stated on the show, we&#8217;re not saying that these are the only startups worth looking at. They&#8217;re simply the startups from the batch that TechCrunch has already covered, as well as some crowdsourced favorites.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a brief rundown of the show, bucketed by market choice, loosely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Startups serving startups:</strong> The largest group of startups in our rundown, we chatted about <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a>, which is building HR software for Southeast Asia (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/briohr-raises-1-3m-ahead-of-y-combinators-demo-day/">here</a>), <a href="https://firstbase.io/en">Firstbase</a>, which is building a remote-work onboarding service (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/">here</a>), <a href="https://contentfly.com/">ContentFly</a>, which wants to use a hybrid of computer and human intelligence to provide writing services, <a href="https://www.runway.team/">Runway</a>, which wants to help companies better manage app rollouts (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/rent-the-runways-first-ios-team-launches-runway-an-easier-way-to-coordinate-app-releases/">here</a>), and <a href="https://mono.co/">Mono</a>, which is building a Plaid for Africa (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Marketplaces:</strong> Here we found two companies to discuss, the first being Providence&#8217;s own <a href="https://pangea.app/">Pangea</a>, and <a href="https://queenly.com/">Queenly</a>. Pangea (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/yc-backed-pangea-discusses-growth-fundraising-ahead-of-demo-day/">here</a>), is building a freelance marketplace for digitally-savvy college kids and small businesses, while Queenly is a marketplace for formalwear (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Space: </strong>Alex demanded that we include <a href="https://www.albedo.space/">Albedo</a>, which is aiming to launch a satellite constellation to improve imaging of the planet using low-orbit flight paths.</li>
<li><strong>Biotech: </strong>And then there were two biotech companies. The first, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/23610">Pipe|Bio</a> does big data management for drug development, and <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/23522">Nuntius Therapeutics</a>, which is working on delivering &#8220;large genetic payloads into the correct cells.&#8221; Which sounds cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual Demo Day is happening next Tuesday, so TechCrunch and Extra Crunch will be all over day-of coverage as per usual. Talk then!</p>
