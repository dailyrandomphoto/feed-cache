<p>On paper, there’s never been a better time to work out at home. But are these subscriptions actually any good? For example, what’s the experience of Apple Fitness+ actually like?</p>
<p>That’s what I’ve been working on this month: Reviewing Apple Fitness and demonstrating where the experience fails to reach its stride.</p>
<p>This TechCrunch+ exclusive is a more detailed conversation around <a href="https://builtformars.com/case-studies/using-apple-fitness">this article</a>, which you can read on Built for Mars.</p>
<h2>1. The &#8220;jump in&#8221; fallacy</h2>
<p>“It&#8217;s wrong to assume that showing &#8216;options&#8217; quickly is always good UX — this is often under the guise that it&#8217;s allowing the user to &#8216;jump right in.&#8217; There&#8217;s a nuance that&#8217;s seldom considered: Can the user actually engage with all of this content or not? If they wanted to, could they actually use all of these options (or results)?”</p>
<p>This is something I see all the time, and it’s hugely misunderstood. Imagine if you went on Rightmove (or Zillow) and the homepage just showed you a selection of houses all over the world — it’d be useless. It’s rare that someone is looking to relocate anywhere, so instead, their first action is to apply a filter. It’d be wrong for Rightmove to think: &#8220;Well, we’ve shown houses immediately, so it only takes one click to find your dream home.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is essentially what happens with Apple Fitness+ — they show you workouts on the homepage, despite many (if not most) being unsuitable for you, and then don’t provide any obvious means to filter the options.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is deepening its investment in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Spaces</a>, the Clubhouse-like audio rooms the social network launched this year.</p>
<p>The company announced the launch of a<a href="https://media.twitter.com/en/verticals/creators/twitter-spaces-spark-program"> new creator program for Spaces on Tuesday</a>. The Spark program is a three-month-long accelerator that aims to &#8220;discover and reward great Spaces on Twitter with financial, technical, and marketing support.&#8221; Twitter says it&#8217;s open to established Spaces audio shows and untested experiments for the program, inviting creators interested in audio to apply.</p>

<p>today we’re opening the application process for the Twitter Spaces Spark Program</p>
<p>what’s that? it’s an initiative for creators who are excited about the future of social audio <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/4zay8uvao8">pic.twitter.com/4zay8uvao8</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1447956725924077583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Since launching Spaces, Twitter has signaled that its audio product isn&#8217;t likely to be just another<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/"> test feature destined for an early retirement</a>. The company expanded ticketed Spaces last month, inviting hosts to monetize audio rooms by selling access to their hosted audio chats. This week, the company added a way for hosts to invite listeners via DM when firing up a Space. It also <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1447647870006579204">rolled out a dedicated Spaces tab to more iOS users</a>, with plans to expand further to non-English languages and Android in the works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">we’re working on making it easier to find and join Spaces you love. today starts the rollout of the Spaces Tab to more people in English and iOS first, with other languages and Android coming in the future!</p>
<p>if you have access, let us know what you think <a href="https://t.co/MatEDXv01F">pic.twitter.com/MatEDXv01F</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1447647870006579204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Anyone who gets accepted into the <a href="https://media.twitter.com/en/verticals/creators/twitter-spaces-spark-program">Spark program</a> is expected to run an audio room two times a week for the three month period. They&#8217;ll be compensated $2,500 a month — a flat rate not dictated by the Space&#8217;s performance — and granted monthly ad credits to boost their show. Anyone who signs on to the program will have the added benefit of getting promoted by Twitter&#8217;s accounts in tweets and discovery features.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize the hard work it takes to create audio content that’s compelling, engaging, and keeps people coming back,&#8221; the company wrote in the Spark program announcement. &#8220;And above all else, we believe in the potential of people’s ideas and the potential of live social audio, and we see an opportunity to help audio content Creators — like you — take off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter users interested in building out a bi-weekly Twitter-backed audio project can apply with the company by October 22. Accepted applicants will get notified by in early November.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most of the people who poured into California during the Gold Rush have been long forgotten.</p>
<p>We remember Levi Strauss, however: Before he and Jacob Davis patented those denim jeans, he sold shovels and other supplies to fortune-seekers.</p>
<p>Today’s banking-as-a-service startups are similarly placed — instead of digging for treasure in the crowded consumer financial services marketplace, BaaS companies offer fintech companies access to APIs, compliance tools and other software needed to move money around.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216880" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In recent weeks, Ryan Lawler has been mapping the landscape of BaaS companies. For his latest report, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/baas-served-three-ways-a-closer-look-at-a-rapidly-evolving-market/">he studied three different strategies</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turnkey banking as a service</li>
<li>Playing matchmaker between banks and fintechs</li>
<li>Buying a bank to get into BaaS</li>
</ul>
<p>“If you’re looking to spin up a new fintech app or want to add banking, debit cards or other financial services to your existing business, knowing how each of these competitors is positioned to work with customers and bank partners is key,” he writes.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, note-sharing network StuDocu raised a $50 million Series B, but Marnix Broer, the company’s CEO, says he didn’t initially intend to co-found an edtech startup.</p>
<p>“It was more of a project to create a tool that we could use while studying in school,” he writes in a TechCrunch+ guest post that explains how the company scaled up from storing notes on a USB thumb drive to serving more than 15 million users.</p>

<p>Going up against large enterprise companies may be daunting for a startup, but Scribe CEO and co-founder Jennifer Smith says you’re never too small to start.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much to their detriment, many early-stage companies wait too long to spin up strategies for competing with industry leaders, she writes. One example: 12 years after its founding, Slack exited to Salesforce for $27.2 billion.</p>
<p>“The question is, if Slack had considered selling into the enterprise sooner, could it have survived as an independent public company?”</p>

<p>A casual observer might assume that NerdWallet was a fintech company with a strong marketing game, but after perusing the company’s S-1, Alex Wilhelm concluded that it is “essentially a weaponized content play.”</p>
<p>In his analysis for The Exchange, he looked at how well NerdWallet has fared during the pandemic, its profitability, growing revenue, “and how the company manages to stay trustworthy, a question that we’ll address through the lens of editorial independence.”</p>

<p>Dave Mullen, a fintech-focused investor with SVB Capital, takes a look at how well leading fintech firms are allocating their mountains of cash.</p>
<p>“There are now a slew of fintech startups approaching or far surpassing $10 billion in value … so we can glean some insight into their capital allocation strategies by considering how they have spent to achieve their position in the ecosystem,” he writes.</p>
<p>In a guest column, he unpacks data from Coinbase, Robinhood, Affirm, Chime, Marqeta and others, offering suggestions to founders in the fintech space.</p>
<p>“Dollars may buy growth, but they can’t guarantee a good business.”</p>

<p>Good news: Businesses of all stripes are digitizing their operations faster than ever before, creating huge advantages for companies that start the work now.</p>
<p>Bad news: Many technical workers are already looking for new jobs, and companies must compete to find the right people who can build robust, secure IT environments.</p>
<p>Managed services providers (MSPs) are filling the gap, and private equity firms are paying attention.</p>
<p>“MSPs have all the ingredients that private equity loves,” write Mike McGill and Kevin Jolley of Cowen and Company, LLC.</p>
<p>“A strong demand trend, low risk of obsolescence, a ‘sticky’ service that attracts long-term customers and high recurring revenues, strong cash flow margins and a relatively ‘asset-light’ business.”</p>

<p>We don’t run many articles that call out mistakes or describe dysfunctional processes; most of us have a fairly good handle on what’s going wrong at any given moment, so we focus on solutions.</p>
<p>With that in mind, growth marketer Jonathan Martinez shared a guest post with strategies for tackling these endemic issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low testing velocity</li>
<li>Reliance on incorrect measurements</li>
<li>Focusing only on top-of-funnel traffic</li>
<li>Lack of incrementality</li>
<li>Insufficient product-growth integration</li>

<p>Global venture capital is flowing so freely, there are unicorn herds in more regions than ever before.</p>
<p>“Which, in turn, boosts the scale of unexited private-market value that will eventually need to exit,” writes Alex Wilhelm in this morning’s The Exchange.</p>
<p>“And with some U.S. tech giants limiting acquisitions as a way of playing defense against antitrust concerns, there is an implicit expectation that the IPO market will eventually have to make room for a stampede of unicorn debuts.”</p>

<p>Barely three months after Blue Origin successfully sent its first crewed rocket to orbit, it&#8217;s poised for another launch on Wednesday, October 13. This time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">instead of Blue&#8217;s founder and CEO Jeff Bezos headlining</a> the flight, the company will be sending 90-year old William Shatner, who is set to become the oldest person to go to space.</p>
<p>The NS-18 mission is set to take-off from Launch Site One, the company&#8217;s sprawling launch facility near Van Horn, in the western part of Texas. The crew will be flying in the company&#8217;s New Shepard rocket. The launch was originally scheduled to fly on October 12, but Blue Orign&#8217;s Mission Operations decided on Sunday to push it back by one day due to forecasted high winds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216857" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce">readying the launch</a> of an NFT marketplace that will compete with existing major players in the space like OpenSea, debuting a user <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce">waitlist</a> for the desktop product that it hopes to launch by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Coinbase has limited details to share on its upcoming platform, but notes in a blog post that they hope to more deeply integrate social features into the platform, &#8220;<span class="il">Coinbase</span> NFT will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever. We’re making NFTs more accessible by building intuitive interfaces that put the complexity behind the scenes. We’re adding social features that open new avenues for conversation &amp; discovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as Bitcoin inches closer to the all-time-high it was flirting with when the Coinbase direct listing occurred, Coinbase&#8217;s stock has still failed to keep pace with the rebounding growth of some of the most popular coins in the space, now down some 27% since its direct listing in April. The exchange simultaneously has regulators breathing down their neck, with the SEC recently threatening to sue the company over their Lend yields product, which they later canceled the launch of. Coinbase is also dealing with a crowding competitive landscape stateside for buying and selling crypto as exchanges like Robinhood build out deeper support for crypto.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216849" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Coinbase NFT could open up a major revenue source to the now-public company, assuming that NFTs continue to court investor interest from those looking for high-priced digital collectibles and art. After spiking earlier this year and again in August, the NFT market is showing more resiliency than many expected but is still seeing even much broader swings than already-volatile cryptocurrency prices. OpenSea saw a record $3.4 billion in transaction volume in August.</p>
<p>The company is launching with support for the Ethereum blockchain, which isn&#8217;t a very surprising place to start an NFT rollout, but Coinbase notably won&#8217;t be integrating with any Layer-2 scaling networks at launch, meaning Coinbase NFT users will still potentially be paying hefty gas fees and dealing with many of the scalability issues of mainnet Ethereum at launch. Coinbase says in a blog post that it will eventually offer &#8220;multi-chain&#8221; support on Coinbase NFT, but is launching with support for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 Ethereum standards. Competitor OpenSea recently launched support for significantly lower-priced transactions leveraging the Polygon network.</p>
<p>OpenSea is the dominant power in the space, but is far from the only player that Coinbase will have to compete with. Rivals like Binance and FTX have also announced recent entries into the NFT marketplace ecosystem. While many crypto investors see NFTs as just scratching the surface of their potential, Coinbase is launching much later than some of its soon-to-be competitors. Nevertheless, given Coinbase&#8217;s name recognition in the consumer crypto world, this is likely going to be a big launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://airbyte.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbyte</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/airbyte-announces-26m-series-a-for-open-source-data-connector-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-funded</a> open source data integration startup, always made it easy for data teams to set up their ELT (extract, load and transform) pipelines, but until now, that meant self-hosting and managing the service, with all the complications that come with that. Today, the company announced the official launch of Airbyte Cloud, a hosted service that takes all of the features of the open source version and adds hosting and management, on top of a number of additional support options and enterprise features like access management for teams (though single sign-on support is currently still listed as &#8220;coming soon&#8221;).</p>
<p>Currently, more than 6,000 companies use Airbyte in some form or another. That&#8217;s up from only 250 at the end of January. Over the course of the year, the company has also taken on a seed and Series A round, for a total of just over $31 million in funding. The fact that there were only two months between the seed and Series A round is a pretty good indication of how hot this space is.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216843" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216843" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216843" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png" alt="" width="1024" height="644" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png 1230w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216843" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Airbyte</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216779" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And talking about money, Airbyte also decided to mix up its pricing model a bit with Airbyte Cloud. Instead of volume-based pricing, which used to be somewhat of the norm of these kinds of services, the team decided to opt for charging for the compute time these jobs take.</p>
<p>Ideally, this takes away at least some of the friction that is often associated with these kinds of workloads. Traditionally, the Airbyte team argues, enterprises use multiple systems like Fivetran to connect to the most common API sources and internally developed scripts the data engineering teams build for their one-off use cases &#8212; and then a system for database replication on top of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to really commoditize and solve the data integration problem,&#8221; Airbyte COO and co-founder John Lafleur told me when I asked about the pricing model. &#8220;The only way to do that is really through an infrastructure-type pricing model, like Snowflake: buy credits, consume these credits based on the hours of compute. At that point, because your database replication throughput is very high, it makes it possible. That&#8217;s why we went with compute.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Airbyte CEO and co-founder Michel Tricot added, this also means that businesses can now think about pricing for virtually all of their data services in the same compute-centric way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, Airbyte features about <a href="https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations">130 connectors</a> to services that range from consumer products like Instagram to BI systems like Google&#8217;s Looker and virtually every major database system. As the team noted, a lot of customers also use Airbyte&#8217;s open source code to build their own custom connectors. In addition, there are now also vendors who build connectors for their own customers and the team is looking at how it can incentivize its community to maintain connectors over time through the use of some form of revenue share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket launch startup Astra provided more details into its rather remarkable mission failure in August, during which the small launch vehicle hovered and drifted in the air before managing a brief vertical ascension. Even as it recounted the debacle, the company is ready to try again, opening the launch window for its next attempt on October 27.</p>
<p>This will be the fifth launch attempt for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">which recently went public</a> via a SPAC merger that injected it with around $500 million in cash. The rocket, dubbed “LV0007,” will carry a test payload for the U.S. Space Force.</p>
<p>This most recent flight on August 28 failed due to a propellant leakage, which caused the shutdown of one of the rocket’s engines, Astra chief Engineer Benjamin Lyon explained in a blog post. The rocket did manage to ascend as high as around thirty miles before the launch was terminated around 148 seconds after take-off. The company, along with the Federal Aviation Administration, conducted an investigation into the cause of the failure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ROg7X99f85"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">Astra&#8217;s first commercial launch fails to reach orbit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Astra&#8217;s first commercial launch fails to reach orbit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/embed/#?secret=ROg7X99f85" data-secret="ROg7X99f85" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“The issue we encountered was something we hadn’t seen before,” Lyon said. After it leaked, it seems that the first stage propellant distribution system became trapped between the rocket and the launcher. Exhaust from the other engines caused that trapped propellant to ignite, severing the electronic connections to the fuel pump and shutting down the engine less than one second after takeoff.</p>
<p>Lyon says the company has taken steps to ensure these issues do not recur on the next test flight, including tweaking the rocket-to-launcher design to ensure that even if leaks do occur, the two propellants will not mix. Astra also modified the propellant supply mechanism and improved other verification processes, he said. “Together, we believe these changes significantly reduce the likelihood of seeing a similar event in the future.”</p>
<p>LV0007 will take off from the company’s launch site in Kodiak, Alaska, with the launch window opening on October 27 through October 31. There is an additional backup window from November 5 to November 12.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Data from the two-and-a-half-minute flight provided valuable insights that we have incorporated into LV0007 and future launch vehicles,” Astra CEO Chris Kemp said. “Our team is looking forward to returning to flight and learning more about our launch system – consistent with our launch and learn philosophy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hardware season isn&#8217;t over over yet. A day before Google&#8217;s big Pixel event, Apple&#8217;s getting one more (probably) swing at things with an &#8220;Unleashed&#8221; event on Monday, October 18. The company sent out invites for the announcement, which will once again be livestreamed from the company&#8217;s Cupertino headquarters.</p>
<p>The event, which kicks off at 10AM PT, comes just a smidge over a month after Apple&#8217;s last big event which brought a brand new iPhone and Apple Watch, among others. So, what does that leave? New Macs were the biggest question mark after the last event. The company is still in the midst of a two-year plan to upgrade all of its desktops and laptops to its in-house silicon. Perhaps we&#8217;ll be seeing that new MacBook Pro, with an upgraded version of last year&#8217;s M1 chip. A larger version of last year&#8217;s Arm-based iMac has been rumored, as well, along with a new Mac Mini.</p>
<p>Accessories like brand new AirPods also look like a reasonable possibility. So, what, precisely, constitutes &#8220;unleashed&#8221; in all of this? If the graphic is any indication, Apple&#8217;s invented some sort of warp speed space travel. Stay tuned.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216834" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is testing a new feature that will notify users when the platform is experiencing an outage or technical issue. The notification will appear directly in users’ activity feeds. Instagram notes that it won’t send a notification every single time there is an outage, but if it sees that users “are confused and looking for answers,” it will determine if a notification would make things clearer.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Facebook and its properties were hit with a lengthy outage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">last week on Monday</a> and again briefly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/facebook-and-instagram-went-down-again-this-afternoon/">on Friday</a>. The company explained that both outages were caused by configuration changes but were unrelated.</p>
<p>“Through conversations with our community and extensive research, we know how confusing it can be when temporary issues happen on Instagram. When they impact engagement or distribution, we also know that it can lead people to think that the problems are unique to them, based on what they post. That lack of clarity can be frustrating, which is why we want it to be easier to understand what&#8217;s going on, directly from us,” Instagram said in a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-outages-and-account-status">blog post.</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new feature is a welcome addition to the app, as users will no longer have to wonder if the app isn’t loading because of an error on their end. Instagram is running the new test in the U.S. for the next few months. The company says it wants to start small with the feature and then expand it to more users if it makes sense to do so.</p>

<p>Instagram also announced that it’s launching a new feature called ‘Account Status’ that will make it easier for people to know whether their account is at risk of being disabled. Instagram says the new tool will be a “one-stop shop to see what’s going with your account.” If users think Instagram has made a mistake with a post of theirs that was removed, they can appeal by selecting the “Request a Review” option directly within the tool.</p>
<p>The company plans to add more information to this tool to give users a better sense of how their content is being distributed and recommended across different parts of the app. Instagram says it will share more information about these two new features over time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://atomic.financial/">Atomic</a> announced this morning that it has closed a $22 million Series A. <a href="http://corevc.com/">Core Innovation Capital</a> led the round, which saw participation from preceding investors. The company has raised just under $39 million to date.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s API-delivered product, which focuses on payroll data, helps power a number of fintech startups that we track &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/30/upstart-banking-company-dave-is-now-worth-1-billion-as-norwest-puts-in-50-million/">Dave</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/who-needs-a-baas-partner-anyway/">Bond</a>, among others &#8212; making it an interesting company to dig into.</p>
<p>Atomic&#8217;s APIs allow consumers to connect their income to different services, helping them set up direct deposit at a neobank, for example. Other use cases include income and employment verification that is simpler for workers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s head of markets, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-crusan-davis/">Lindsay Davis,</a> told TechCrunch in an interview that her company wants to &#8220;unlock the power of the paycheck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, the company does not currently compete with Plaid, perhaps the best-known provider of financial APIs, according to Davis.</p>
<p>Plaid&#8217;s products are used for linking consumer banking accounts to financial services and products. In contrast, Atomic focuses on income streams, allowing them to be partially or completely diverted to new financial buckets, or simply made observable to other parties with user permission for verification purposes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Atomic charges corporate customers for income and employment verification services on a usage basis, and for its direct deposit product in a more SaaS-like manner. Davis added that some customers bundle the two services together, underscoring that Atomic&#8217;s business model is a blend of both on-demand and subscription pricing.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BaaS served three ways: A closer look at a rapidly evolving market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/baas-served-three-ways-a-closer-look-at-a-rapidly-evolving-market/embed/#?secret=RqwQHyRr9I" data-secret="RqwQHyRr9I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Thinking broadly, a cohort of fintech startups are building business products that may provide consumers with more control over their money. Businesses are willing to pay for their services as they can lessen friction to bring new funds onto their own platforms. That neobanks and other financial services that compete with traditional banking companies are paying up to help end-users make provider choices is not a surprise. The result of that work is fintech making &#8212; to a degree &#8212; the financial world a bit more amenable to consumer control.</p>
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>TechCrunch asked the company why it decided to raise its Series A now &#8212; a question that we&#8217;ve added to our regular arsenal thanks to increased round pre-emption by investors; gone are the days when startups were expected to reach a certain revenue threshold to raise one round type or another.</p>
<p>Davis said that, in her view, companies are ready to raise a Series A when they have both have a product in market and customer traction, so it made sense for Atomic to raise this particular round now.</p>
<p>She added that her company was offered more capital last year, but that it wasn&#8217;t ready to take on the funds. But with market demand demonstrated for Atomic&#8217;s direct deposit product, she explained, and a few preemptive term sheets, the startup decided that now was the right time.</p>
<p>Atomic has around 55 staffers today, a figure that it is looking to rapidly expand. The company has 20 open roles, Davis noted.</p>
<p>The company has lots of white space around its current business to expand into. With income verification, TechCrunch will be curious to see whether Atomic eventually digs into the credit scoring market. Credit scores in the United States <a href="https://medium.com/commonfuture/why-credit-scores-are-racist-da109fcfb300">are a mess</a>, to be polite. And we&#8217;re looking for the startup that will take on the traditional agencies in charge of deciding how worthy you are of loans and other financial products.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see if that winds up being Atomic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the Apple v. Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">lawsuit</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">goes under appeal,</a> Google on Monday afternoon filed an answer and counterclaim in the Epic Games&#8217; antitrust litigation against the company. The tech giant and Android maker denies Epic&#8217;s allegations of antitrust behavior and instead says that it&#8217;s owed relief, as Epic Games breached the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement (DDA) by allowing Fortnite players who download the app through Google Play to use Epic&#8217;s own payment processing technology.</p>
<p>This situation is similar to what took place on the App Store, where Epic Games updated its app to workaround App Store policies, and then facilitated payments through its own payments system, in violation of its legal contract with Apple. The court&#8217;s decision in Apple&#8217;s case was that Epic owed financial relief to Apple, to the tune <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-pays-apple-6-million/">of $6 million dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Epic Games did much of the same thing on Google Play, the counterclaim alleges. Last year, Epic submitted a build of Fortnite to Google Play which used Epic&#8217;s own direct payments system and not Google Play Billing. This submission was immediately rejected for failing to comply with Google&#8217;s policies. Epic then submitted a compliant version in April 2020, which Google now describes as &#8220;an act of deception designed to provoke litigation.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216771" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new version had concealed Epic&#8217;s payment system in an update that was sent to both Apple and Google&#8217;s app stores. This would allow Epic to switch over to its own payment system by applying a server-side configuration change, or &#8220;hotfix,&#8221; without Google&#8217;s knowledge.</p>
<p>That switched was flipped on August 13, 2020. It allowed Fortnite users to choose between Google Play Billing and Epic&#8217;s own direct payments system. This move was meant to trigger the game&#8217;s rejection from the app stores, paying the way for Epic to pursue its planned litigation. Google said it notified Epic Games on the same day the hotfix was applied that it was in violation of the DDA, Google&#8217;s Malicious Behavior Policy, and the Google Play Billing Policy, and removed Fortnite from Google Play. However, it did not disable Epic&#8217;s account so the game maker could resubmit a compliant version.</p>
<p>However, Android users who had downloaded the game from Google Play could still use Epic&#8217;s own payments system even after the app was pulled down, allowing Epic to evade its contractually obligated service fee to Google, the counterclaim states. Google is asking the court to award restitution of this loss of feeds, in addition to other damages, attorney&#8217;s fees, interest, and any other relief the court deems necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Epic, a multibillion-dollar company backed by two of the world’s largest video game developers, has profited immensely from the safe, secure platform provided by Google Play, a platform for which it pays a fee equivalent or less than that charged by other major platform providers,&#8221; the counterclaim states. &#8220;Not satisfied with those immense profits, it entered into a legal agreement with Google with which it never intended to comply, deceiving Google and concealing its true intentions to provoke a legal and public relations confrontation that continues to this day. Its actions have put its own users at risk, have harmed Google, and are deserving of relief from this Court,&#8221; it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Epic Games has no further comment on the new filing.</p>
<p>However, Epic&#8217;s position has been that Apple and Google&#8217;s requirement to use their own in-app payment systems exclusively is a monopolistic practice that disadvantages developers. In Apple&#8217;s case, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">the court agreed</a> that Apple should not block developers from sharing a link to other payment methods inside their own app or communicating to customers. It did not declare Apple a monopoly.</p>
<p>But Google&#8217;s situation is a bit different as Android already allows for sideloading apps &#8212; that means there&#8217;s another method of reaching Android users outside Google Play, making an antitrust claim more difficult.</p>
<p>Google has also filed its answer with the state&#8217;s attorney general, developer, and consumer cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-bike manufacturer <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com">VanMoof</a> recently raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/vanmoof-raises-128-million-to-become-the-worlds-leading-e-bike-brand/">$128 million funding round</a>. And the company is already using some of that cash to develop a brand new product — the <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-FR/vanmoof-v">VanMoof V</a>. This is a new product in the VanMoof lineup, a high-speed bike.</p>
<p>The VanMoof V isn’t available just yet. Instead, the company teased the new bike in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7ymwpXFxtg">live YouTube video</a>. The company plans to release the VanMoof V by the end of 2022. It should cost approximately <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/vanmoof-v">$3,598</a>, <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-FR/vanmoof-v">€3,498</a> or <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-GB/vanmoof-v">£2,998</a> according to the landing pages on VanMoof’s website.</p>
<p>What you get for that price is an electric bike with two motors — one in the front wheel and one in the rear wheel. There are two suspension systems at the front and at the back of the vehicle to help you with uneven streets. The VanMoof V also features thick tires for increased safety.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216791" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2216797" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216797" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VanMoof-V-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2216797" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VanMoof-V-2.jpg 3128w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VanMoof-V-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VanMoof-V-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VanMoof-V-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VanMoof-V-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VanMoof-V-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VanMoof-V-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VanMoof-V-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216797" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> VanMoof</p></div></p>
<p>According to the YouTube video, the bike can reach a top speed of 60 km/h (37 mph). But if you have an e-bike already, you know that there are regulations when it comes to motor assistance for bikes. In Europe, an e-bike cannot travel faster than 25 km/h (15.5 mph). In the U.S., that limitation depends on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle_laws">each state</a> but is still lower than the VanMoof V top speed.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean that you can’t ride faster than that. It means that the motor will stop assisting you if you reach the top speed of your jurisdiction. The company is already saying that the VanMoof V won’t help you break the law.</p>
<p>“When we first started imagining what the V could become, we very soon agreed it’s about a whole new approach to how we use the roads. The VanMoof V will have integrated speed settings to match your country’s regulations. However, this bike has the technology and capacity to hit speeds up to 60 kilometers per hour or 37 miles per hour. As it stands, local regulations across the world cap the top speed of this category. But in the long term, we need much bigger thinking,” VanMoof co-founder and CEO Ties Carlier said during the announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“In our vision, current policy is limiting the adoption of this type of transportation. We’re calling for policies designed for people instead of cars. That’s why we will work with city governments to explore geofencing and push for modernized speed regulations,” he added.</p>
<p>In other words, the VanMoof V should be considered as a concept bike to share VanMoof’s vision, as well as a lobbying vehicle for policymakers around the world. The company had to share its plans in advance because you don’t need a two-wheel drive to reach 25 km/h.</p>
<p>Having said that, VanMoof is sending invitations to a group of VanMoof customers and crowdfunders. These invitations let you reserve a VanMoof V with a $20 reservation deposit. Reservations start today with a potential release date of late 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese technology giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">Olympus</a> has confirmed it was hit by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattack/">cyberattack</a> over the weekend that forced it to shut down its IT systems in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.olympus-global.com/news/2021/nr02217.html">a statement on its website</a>, Olympus said it is “investigating a potential cybersecurity incident detected October 10” and is “currently working with the highest priority to resolve this issue.”</p>
<p>“As part of the investigation and containment, we have suspended affected systems and have informed the relevant external partners. The current results of our investigation indicate the incident was contained to the Americas with no known impact to other regions.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216777" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are working with appropriate third parties on this situation and will continue to take all necessary measures to serve our customers and business partners in a secure way. Protecting our customers and partners and maintaining their trust in us is our highest priority. Our investigation is ongoing and we are committed to transparent disclosure and will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s near-identical to a statement put out by Olympus last month following a cyberattack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">on its European, Middle East and Africa network</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of the attack, Olympus also said it was “investigating a potential cybersecurity incident.&#8221; A person with knowledge of the incident told TechCrunch that Olympus was recovering from a ransomware attack. A ransom note left behind on infected systems was also linked to the BlackMatter ransomware-as-a-service group.</p>
<p>Brett Callow, a ransomware expert and threat analyst at Emsisoft, told TechCrunch that given this latest incident occurred at the weekend — often when gangs often deploy ransomware, including holidays — increases the likelihood of a repeat attack. &#8220;And if it is ransomware, whether it’s BlackMatter again is impossible to say. It certainly could be, or the affiliate responsible for the attack on the EMEA operations could have chosen to deploy different ransomware this time,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>When reached, Olympus spokesperson Susan Scerbo did not have any immediate comment. We&#8217;ll update as we learn more about Olympus&#8217; security incident.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Password sharing in the workplace and at home is a common practice, but doing so securely can be tricky. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1-password-8-mac-early-access-120012791.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">1Password</a> aims to address that with its new feature that gives you a way to share log-in credentials in a secure way even with people who don&#8217;t have an account with the service. It&#8217;s called <a href="https://blog.1password.com/psst-item-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Psst!</a>, which is short for Password Secure Sharing Tool, and it&#8217;s apparently one of the company&#8217;s most requested features.</p>
<p>Based on a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-mismanaging-secrets-costs-companies-1-2m-annually-301317447.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">research</a> the company conducted, most workers reuse corporate credentials. Of those people, 36 percent admitted to sharing log-ins with other workers and clients via insecure channels, including emails, chat apps, spreadsheets, documents and texts. In another <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-40-of-parents-give-preschoolers-a-head-start-in-password-education-301194976.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">survey</a>, 1Password found that most families share passwords between members and also use insecure methods, such as writing them down and messaging them to each other.</p>
<p>Psst! allows you to share credentials with anybody by generating a link with the information that other people can access, even if they don&#8217;t have a 1Password account. You can choose how long the link remains valid, from an hour to 30 days, after which it will automatically expire. You can also choose to share the credentials with anybody who has the link or with specific people only. If you choose the latter, the service will require the recipient to confirm their identity by verifying their email addresses before giving them access.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216769" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The service has launched this new feature alongside its announcement that it now has over 100,000 business customers and that it&#8217;s growing its employee headcount to 500. Jeff Shiner, CEO of 1Password, said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Having the ability to share passwords and other credentials outside of a business or family has been one of our most highly-requested features, and I’m very excited by today’s launch of Psst! as it helps keep everyone, not just 1Password customers, safe online. Crossing the 100,000 business customers mark is a clear indication that businesses understand the need to safeguard their passwords and other sensitive information online.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Exchange is digging into the Chinese venture capital market this week, but getting folks to chat about business and China on the record is turning out to be slightly harder than we anticipated. More on that later this week.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>While our dives into the Chinese and Indian startup markets are underway, let&#8217;s talk about indigestion, namely venture capital indigestion. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">executed its initial look into the Q3 venture capital market</a>, but it&#8217;s still a struggle to get our minds around just how much capital has poured into startups this year.</p>
<p>Global venture capital fundraising is at an all-time high, with many countries seeing record results. Q3 2021 saw more than double the dollars that were invested Q3 2020 across thousands of more deals, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">per corporate data provider CB Insights</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>All that capital is leading to more and more unicorns around the world. Which, in turn, boosts the scale of unexited private-market value that will eventually need to exit. And with some U.S. tech giants limiting acquisitions as a way of playing defense against antitrust concerns, there is an implicit expectation that the IPO market will eventually have to make room for a stampede of unicorn debuts.</p>
<p>That impending debit grows larger every quarter, and at an increasingly rapid clip; the second derivative is positive, in other words.</p>
<p>The Exchange has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/future-tech-exits-have-a-lot-to-live-up-to/">noted the rising unicorn backlog from time to time</a>, but new data makes it clearer than ever that the venture capital world is investing as if there is a future exit wave coming that will put prior IPO cycles to shame in its intensity and length.</p>
<p>Turning back to CB Insights&#8217; Q3 data set, which we&#8217;ll mine over the next few weeks, observe the following chart detailing the pace at which capital is being disbursed into the global startup market:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-punwani-md">Vishal Punwani</a>, the CEO and co-founder of SoWork, is building a business based off of a feeling that he stumbled upon by accident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sowork.com/">SoWork,</a> a virtual co-working startup, began after Punwani and his co-founders decided to build a machine learning edtech company. While building, Punwani’s team, who ironically met while playing World of Warcraft just 17 years ago, needed a better way to communicate. So, combining their love for building and gaming, the group put together an internal communication product inspired by virtual worlds.</p>
<p>The team’s internal communication tooling began growing faster than their external edtech one. The startup eventually rebranded and pivoted to Sophya, a company based on the feeling that every employer will eventually feel the pressure to invest in a virtual work experience for employees to repair culture and combat climate change.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216738" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The feeling was enough to convince investors to back the early-stage startup. SoWork announced today that it has raised a $15 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.taliscapital.com/">Talis Capital</a>, a U.K.-based firm that routinely cuts early-stage checks. Beyond hiring and R&amp;D capital, SoWork has also added one big customer to its 100-company private beta: Tinder.</p>
<p>By bringing on a virtual space, Tinder is trying to show new and old distributed employees what its work culture is like, from collaboration rooms to company-wide virtual events such as hackathons. Still, while delayed office reopening plans may have triggered Tinder’s interest in a virtual space, the company appears to think the technology will be key going forward.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216743" style="width: 823px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216743" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2216743" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png" alt="" width="813" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png 1296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=768,479 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=680,424 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216743" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SoWork</p></div></p>
<p>“It’s been incredibly important to find more permanent ways to extend Tinder’s culture into a hybrid physical and virtual space as we think about the future of how our employees will be working,” said Nicole Senior, VP of Culture and DE&amp;I at Tinder, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Permanence is the elephant in the room for any virtual HQ. SoWork is joining a string of virtual HQ platforms like <a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com/">Teamflow</a>, <a href="https://with.so/">With</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/">Gather</a>. One of the biggest challenges for any virtual HQ business is if it&#8217;s realistic to expect employers, especially those in the growth stage, to transfer their growing teams to the metaverse, when in-person offices do the trick. And as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work/">Slack invests more to bring spontaneity and huddles </a>to its already well-ingrained service, startups need to prove that its customers, even the ones that didn&#8217;t grow up gaming, want to live and work in an online universe.</p>
<p>“If they&#8217;re not feeling the problem, that’s fine. But eventually, there&#8217;ll be so many companies that have built up a base in whether it&#8217;s SoWork or something else, that the benefits of being on those other platforms will start to build up. And then all of a sudden, there are benefits there that [employers] can&#8217;t get elsewhere,” Punwani said. “It’s like Twitter. In the beginning, [no company] was like ‘oh we must have Twitter.’ But as it became the place where all of the random noise happened, then they said, ‘we want to go there because we want to stay relevant.’”</p>

<p>Sophya has a number of functionalities that add to its experience, from proximity-based audio and high-quality video, self-expression of avatars, customizable offices and visualization of who is around you. It is also building ways for employees to venture outside of their offices into the broader SoWork ecosystem to network with folks at other companies and to attend community events &#8212; all within the platform. Punwani estimates that teams spend between 25-40 hours per week working out of their virtual offices, for both asynchronous catch-ups and synchronous meetings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216744" style="width: 899px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216744" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2216744" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png" alt="" width="889" height="467" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216744" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SoWork</p></div></p>
<p>Still, the startup’s biggest differentiation may be the team’s mindset on climate change. Unlike many virtual HQs on the market, SoWork is loud about its mission to combat climate change by giving employers a way to grow their companies virtually, instead of through offices. The startup plans to showcase estimates of how much carbon emissions and commute times have been saved for companies that live in SoWork rather than IRL. It also chose a bank for its Canadian entity that is 100% divested from fossil fuels, and is doing the same for its U.S. corporation, per the co-founder.</p>
<p>“Climate is the number one thing that we’re trying to deal with, it’s why our tagline is moving workplaces from the earth to the cloud,” Punwani said. “Imagine what that does to climate impact, right? [It limits] carbon footprint, commuting, small business travel, [and the] building [of] pointless fucking buildings and parking lots.”</p>
<p>The diversity of the team is also striking in comparison to its competitors. Punwani is joined by two co-founders, Emma Giles and Mark Liu, and five of SoWork’s six main teams in ops, marketing, growth, product and research, are led by women.</p>
<p>SoWork is opening up its private beta to the public in the first week of November. There are already over 1,000 companies, amounting to over 300,000 people, on the waitlist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paris-based cryptocurrency broker <a href="https://www.sheeldmarket.com">SheeldMarket</a> has raised a $10 million Series A funding round led by Atomico. As a EU-registered broker, the company wants to help institutional investors buy and sell crypto assets in a regulated way.</p>
<p>Most cryptocurrency products designed for institutional investors focus on American or Asian investors. SheeldMarket thinks it can convince institutional investors in Europe by complying with local regulation and offering a product that works better for European investors.</p>
<p>In addition to Atomico, Semantic also participated in today’s funding round. Several angel investors also participated, such as Pascal Gauthier (CEO of Ledger) and Alexis Bonillo (co-founder of Zenly).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you want to start investing in cryptocurrencies as an institutional investor, you have to deal with several products and services, such as exchanges, custodians and over-the-counter providers. Customers using SheeldMarket can get started more easily.</p>
<p>When you start working with SheeldMarket, you can deposit your funds directly with SheeldMarket. After that, the startup lets you process market orders through multiple crypto exchanges and over-the-counter platforms. SheeldMarket automatically routes your order to the platform that offers the best exchange rate and/or enough liquidity. The average order size on the platform is $150,000.</p>
<p>“We appreciate SheeldMarket&#8217;s advanced platform because it allows us to execute very large trades across multiple global crypto exchanges, in a regulated way, using advanced algorithms. This has been a gamechanger for us when it comes to saving time, manpower and trading costs compared to trying to execute the same volume of trades manually,” Wave Financial’s Benjamin Tsai said in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition to improving its current product offering, SheeldMarket also wants to integrate with decentralized finance protocols (DeFi). This way, it could open up high-yield opportunities to financial investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And this is key to understanding the potential of these prime brokers. Institutional investors aren’t just looking for ways to expose part of their portfolio to crypto price changes. DeFi opens up a ton of possibilities with new, sophisticated financial products. And institutional investors always like to be able to access more markets and more products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging markets fintech financier <a href="https://www.lendable.io/">Lendable</a> is targeting to raise a $100 million fund to invest in African and Asian fintech companies, the firm said in an emailed statement today</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, the firm said it planned to raise funds between $120 million to $180 million to give new loans to fintechs so they could</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then provide credit, asset finance, payments and remittances to individual customers and businesses in emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unclear if the fund announced today continues that discussion as there&#8217;s no reference in this recent statement. But what is clear is Lendable stating that this is its fourth fund.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the MSME Fintech Credit Fund, Lendable says it will provide credit to African and Asian fintech companies so they can offer credit facilities and financial services for more than 150,000 small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the fintech lender has closed $49 million from impact investors such as DFC, EMIIF (DFAT), Calvert Impact Capital, Ceniarth, BIO, FMO and FSD Africa. It expects to close another $20 million this fourth quarter before a final hard close in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first close takes Lendable&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> committed capital to more than $200 million, although it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managed a pipeline of over $400 million since launching in 2016, per the firm&#8217;s statement. The lender has also disbursed $180 million in that timeline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-goldfarb-17211728"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Goldfarb</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/dylan-fried-024b825b"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dylan Fried,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lendable has provided more than 1.4 million consumer and small business loans, over 80,000 productive asset loans and more than 105,000 solar home systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lendable says it has delivered an annualized net return of 14.32% to its investors.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have had an amazing response to this Fund and have brought on board an impressive slate of leading impact investors and DFIs who back our approach,&#8221; Goldfarb said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through our fintech investments, we are providing essential working capital for MSMEs that enables off-grid customers to buy energy products and opens the door to innovative digital banking services to consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Lendable has provided debt financing to several fintechs from nine emerging markets. Some include Tugende, Carbon, Uploan, KoinWorks, Planet42, FairMoney, Trella, Payjoy, Solar Panda and MFS Africa. The fintech financier said its debt facilities range between $2 million to $15 million, with a payback duration between three to four years. So far, Lendable has a default rate of about 0.01%, said a company&#8217;s spokesperson in an interview with TechCrunch this year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On the heels of World Mental Health Day, an app called MentalHappy is launching with the goal of making mental health care accessible, affordable and stigma-free. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been on both sides of the spectrum where I can afford the $175 an hour for therapy, and where I couldn&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; said founder and CEO Tamar [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of World Mental Health Day, an app called <a href="https://www.mentalhappy.com/">MentalHappy</a> is launching with the goal of making mental health care accessible, affordable and stigma-free.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on both sides of the spectrum where I can afford the $175 an hour for therapy, and where I couldn&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; said founder and CEO Tamar Blue. &#8220;We all need help navigating the life events that we go through, but how do we do that with an expert, not pay a fortune for it, be accessible, and do that collectively with other people in a positive way?&#8221;</p>
<p>MentalHappy&#8217;s approach to solving this problem is to develop low-cost peer support groups on its app, with qualified professionals facilitating each group. These groups start at $10 per month, spanning topics like Black mental health, life after divorce and coping with anxiety. Some groups are more intimate, while others can have upwards of 100 members, functioning as a message board with the ability to join video meetings with the group leader. Blue told TechCrunch that she expects the app to have over 1,000 support group leaders by the end of the year, facilitating discussions about more than 47 different types of life events. So far, MentalHappy is working with psychologists, general practitioners (MD), acupuncturists and certified life coaches. Currently, the app is operating in the United States, but Blue plans to explore other countries and languages in the future.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Security is top of mind for everyone,&#8221; Blue said. While some groups can be fully anonymous, others use screen names to identify participants. &#8220;A lot of the groups have privacy control mechanisms, so the user would have to submit some type of authentication to let the group leader know who they are and why they want to join, just to make sure it&#8217;s a great fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>MentalHappy also offers a revenue stream for qualified health and wellness professionals &#8212; the company takes 5% of their monthly earnings on the app. The professionals set their own price for access to their groups. But for larger groups, content moderation might pose a challenge. While MentalHappy has automated systems to identify trigger words or bullying, a group leader is expected to moderate their own group. Blue said sometimes leaders will bring in an assistant or an associate therapist to help them manage the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;MentalHappy is a marketplace,&#8221; Blue said. &#8220;Similar to Airbnb hosts or Patreon creators, support group leaders are marketplace participants operating independently.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216404" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216404" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216404" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?w=680" alt="Screenshots of the MentalHappy app and interface" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png 1621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/slide-02.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216404" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MentalHappy</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An app like MentalHappy needs both facilitators and group members to work, and scaling the app at a sustainable rate could pose a challenge &#8212; what if there are too many people seeking help, but not enough professionals to provide it? Right now, MentalHappy is focusing on onboarding group leaders, some of whom have existing client bases that they bring with them to the platform.</p>
<p>The cost of therapy often prohibits people from seeking mental health care, but Blue thinks that a remote, digital experience can also help people who might not physically be able to access specialized care in their area. Plus, the United States is experiencing a shortage in therapists &#8212; according to the American Psychological Association (APA), there are only <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/01/datapoint-states">31.3 licensed psychologists</a> per 100,000 people. Many therapists and psychologists have <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-get-help-when-theres-a-waitlist-to-see-a-therapist-5116341">long waitlists</a>, making it harder for new patients to start treatment. Though one-on-one treatment can be essential for some people, MentalHappy&#8217;s peer support groups can help make care more accessible and immediate in the interim.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we don&#8217;t realize is nearly 180 million people live in rural areas in the United States, where they just simply aren&#8217;t in driving distance to any type of mental health facility or office,&#8221; Blue told TechCrunch. &#8220;So, meeting other people online is a perfect way to get that help.&#8221;</p>
<p>MentalHappy also operates with a strong focus on diversity, working to develop support groups for people of various identities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Black woman in tech here in San Francisco, so I definitely know what it feels like to not really be able to identify with professionals, or colleagues, or people who look like you,&#8221; Blue said. &#8220;That&#8217;s something we really focus on. We do have Black and Brown health professionals on the platform that lead groups, because we know that provider fit is definitely very critical.&#8221; In a recent launch event, for example, NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Owens was part of a support group specifically for Black men, seeking to shed light on the particular stigmas that Black men face in seeking mental health care.</p>
<p>But over the last five years, mental health care startups have been scrutinized for how they navigate the murky line between making money and providing quality support to users in need. The anonymous mental health app Talkspace struggled with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddessig/2016/08/18/talkspace-reveals-clients-email-violating-clinical-confidentiality/?sh=5e6cb71a4652">violating clinical confidentiality</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/19/14004442/talkspace-therapy-app-reviews-patient-safety-privacy-liability-online">preventing therapists</a> from reporting dangerous situations due to the patients&#8217; anonymity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will facilitate case by case management of the identities of people in dangerous situations,&#8221; Blue said. &#8220;We carefully vet the support group leaders and review their background. We provide best practices to ensure they are safeguarded as well as members on the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, the second-time founder has raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/briefing-4-29-21/">$1.1 million in seed funding</a> from Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures (Blue&#8217;s first company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/canustart2day">CanUStart</a>, which was acquired, helped efficiently match job seekers with employers). At first, MentalHappy was a wellness product for large corporations, working with clients like the UCSF Benioff Children&#8217;s Hospital and Boston Scientific. When an employee at these companies experienced a significant life event, MentalHappy provided <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/mentalhappy-helps-companies-send-custom-care-packages-to-employees-going-through-a-rough-time/">wellness kits</a> for support. But Blue wanted to expand MentalHappy&#8217;s reach by creating a consumer product for the general public to access mental health support. Blue was part of the summer 2018 Y Combinator class, where she redeveloped MentalHappy into the app it is today, available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mentalhappy/id1574363583">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mentalhappy.app">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later (BNPL) has been making headlines all over the place this year &#8212; from </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square’s planned acquisition of Afterpay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirm going public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Latin America remains an under-penetrated market in the increasingly crowded space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nelo.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup founded by former Uber international growth team leads, began offering buy now, pay later services to Mexico earlier this year. Its ultimate goal is to expand to all of Latin America. And it has just raised $20 million in an effort to help it advance on that goal. The Mexico City-based company already is live with over 100 merchants, including Steve Madden and Ben &amp; Frank. Using Nelo’s app, customers can make purchases from merchants such as Amazon, Mercado Libre, Telcel, Netflix and Spotify.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215725" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to enable digital commerce throughout LatAm, and BNPL in Mexico is our first step towards that vision,” said CEO and co-founder Kyle Miller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based Two Sigma Ventures led the round, with existing backers such as Homebrew, Susa Ventures, Crossbeam and angel investor and popular podcast host <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony Pompliano</a> also participating. New investors include angels like Gokul Rajaram and Emilie Choi, founders and employees from Wealthsimple, Orum, Alloy, Chime, Square and funds/syndicates in addition to Primer Capital, Gaingels and Moving Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest Series A financing, Nelo has raised a total of $25.6 million since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Nelo is not the only player in the Mexican market. A number of others, including Alchemy and Addi, have also outlined plans for buy now, pay later offerings in the region. But what differentiates Nelo from its competitors, according to Miller, is that it claims to be the only BNPL company in the region that has a consumer mobile app in addition to an embedded checkout experience for merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mobile app allows customers to buy now and pay later at over 75 merchants, and very soon, any</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">merchant,” Miller said, “ultimately becoming the destination for any consumer that wants to buy online. This captive consumer base is crucial to building the network that is Nelo.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo issued its first product in Mexico in January 2020, similar to a debit card offering from a neobank. In the middle of the year, the company launched credit installment loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in March of 2021, Nelo launched its first product via an Android app. Customers can use its offering like a credit card, connecting directly with merchants such as Netflix and Spotify. Many users started out by paying for things like utility bills and cell phone bills, turning them from prepaid to postpay.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=8JVvOzCnob" data-secret="8JVvOzCnob" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the startup has apps on both Android and iOS and its revenue and GMV is growing by 50% month over month, according to Miller. It is currently seeing over 100,000 new purchases/transactions per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo is planning to use its new capital to grow its consumer and merchant base, and to continue to build out its team. The company has hubs in Mexico City, New York City and remote employees. It currently has 23 employees, up from 12 in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Nelo is focused 100% on Mexico, where Miller notes, e-commerce is “exploding&#8221; and is home to &#8220;the fastest growing market in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has greatly impacted our business,” he told TechCrunch. “Right now is the perfect time for this business and product.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Sigma Ventures Partner Frances Schwiep believes that Nelo has the potential to emerge as the leading financing option for consumers in LatAm, starting with BNPL.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her view, the case for BNPL in LatAm, and particularly Mexico, is even stronger than for BNPL in the many regions where it has already exploded in popularity such as the United States, Europe and Australia. She points out that in Mexico, there is an “extreme” lack of access to credit with less than 15% of the population in Mexico having a credit card. Also, there is existing behavior around paying in installments in Mexico that has been around for several decades, called “meses sin interes,” but via “difficult-to-access” cash vouchers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, e-commerce spend in Mexico is increasing much faster than access to credit, Schwiep noted, in addition to open fintech regulation in the country making it all easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The relatively young population in Mexico is also more aligned with the target demographic for BNPL businesses,” she said. “On top of this, the accelerating adoption of banking and mobile e-commerce in LatAm has created an environment for a breakout company in the space today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a personal level, having lived in Mexico over the past year (and previously having lived in LatAm in 2011), Schwiep told me that it has been “wild” to witness the market for digital commerce essentially transforming overnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe Nelo has built the team, product, data moat and go to market playbook that is best positioned to capitalize on this incredible market opportunity,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Nelo started by offering installment payments for everyday essentials, such as utility and phone bills, before evolving into retail, gives the startup some advantages, Schwiep added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, Nelo owns a direct and deep, recurring relationship with the consumer,” she said. “Nelo is the only BNPL company in the region building the trust and brand loyalty with the consumer in this way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, the multiple touch points per month with consumers translates into a “tremendously valuable longitudinal data asset for Nelo,” according to Schwiep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are amassing valuable repayment history on their platform that incumbents like Affirm and Afterpay and even local credit bureaus do not have on consumers in the region,” she said.</span></p>
