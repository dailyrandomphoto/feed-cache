										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most important goals for any early-stage startup venture is gaining exposure for your company and product. As much as we love the mantra, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3c_pJ_CLJQ">if you build it, they will come</a>,” it’s gonna take more than that to make your Field of Dreams come true.</p>
<p>Are you a founder of an early-stage SaaS startup? Then grab this opportunity to showcase your innovative tech and talent to the major movers, shakers, investors and makers around the world at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=demotables&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=demotablespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> on October 27. Talk about a targeted audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=demotables&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=demotablespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy a Startup Exhibitor Package</a> and spend a full day exhibiting to your exact target audience.

<p>“I’m never disappointed when I attend TechCrunch events. Whether from the smallest startup all the way up to a Google, I always find someone or something surprising that makes me say, &#8216;Oh, I didn’t know about that.&#8217;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monterey Car Week wrapped up on Sunday with the return of the Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance. A black 1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K Autobahn Kurrier took top honors at the show, now in its 70th year, held on the golf course overlooking the Pacific Ocean. But it was the electric hypercars and high-performance hybrids, not the historics that stood out this year.</p>
<p>Over the years, the glitz and glam of Pebble Beach has ballooned into a week of activities around racing, displaying, parading and selling cars throughout the picturesque Monterey Peninsula. Last year, car week was canceled. This year, despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Champagne was flowing.</p>
<p>When the New York Auto Show was canceled earlier in the month due to concerns over the presence of the delta variant, there was speculation that Pebble would also be canceled. But it snuck through as the de facto show that must go on before the uncertainty of the fall season amid pandemic shutdowns.</p>

The 1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K Autobahn Kurier, winner of the Best of Show award at the 2021 Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance in Pebble Beach on Aug. 15, 2021.</p></div></p>
<p>On the days leading up to the Concours, the streets of Carmel and Monterey were quieter and less busy, and there seemed to be fewer old cars driving around. There were plenty of modern Lamborghinis, Bentleys and Ferraris revving their engines in parking lots. Many guests slipped masks on and off at gatherings, which were mostly held outside, despite misty rain and cool temperatures. By Sunday, the crowds were back in full force for the Concours, which seemed as packed as ever.</p>
<p>The main event, the Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance, was once dedicated to restored pre-war classic cars. But as generations and tastes shifted, newer cars were featured on the green. The attendees also seemed younger; high-performance sports cars dominated the scene.</p>
<p>A 1995 McLaren F1 was auctioned for a record-breaking $20 million at the Gooding &amp; Company auction on Friday night. Meanwhile, automakers hurriedly pulled together splashy car launches of their limited edition high-dollar supercars for the media and their top customers who milled about at private events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Pebble Beach is an important pillar,&#8221; said Lamborghini CTO Maurizio Reggiani. &#8220;Pebble Beach told us what people love in terms of the aesthetic of the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most notably, Audi showed the futuristic Skysphere concept on Wednesday. Mercedes-Benz previewed a new California-style convertible SL on Friday, which won&#8217;t be officially revealed until September. Aston Martin showed its Valkyrie and Valhalla models on a generous stand overlooking the golf course at Pebble Beach, but only allowed media and serious, vetted customers a close look at its models.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Rimac Automobili and Lucid Group showed up at Pebble Beach to connect with potential customers that can afford to invest in the most pricy electric powertrains. Rimac used the podium to debut its blistering fast Nevera sports car. Monterey 2021 seemed to have shifted to where new cars and new player overtook the old on the periphery. </span></p>
<p>After a year of pent-up demand for super luxury cars, it was the perfect setting for showing off all of those pandemic purchases on the race track and roads in and around Monterey and Carmel. As auction prices soared and seven-figure sports car sold out, it became clear that performance car enthusiasm hasn&#8217;t waned. The new cars shown at Pebble Beach share much in common: All are pricey, packed with sports car technology and manufactured in low volumes. Here are some of the highlights.</p>
<h2>Aston Martin</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190459" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190459" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190459 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6723-rotated.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190459" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credit</strong>: Tamara Warren</p></div></p>
<p>After several delays in recent years, the Aston Martin Valkyrie Spider was unveiled as a sold-out car by new CEO Tobias Moers. The Valkyrie has removable roof panels and a top speed of 217 miles per hour. Moers, who took the role over the pandemic, has been making drastic changes to the way Aston produces its cars.</p>
<p>Moers said that adding new in-car technology is essential to the brand&#8217;s future, and will pivot away from using last generation Mercedes-Benz tech. Also on display at the Aston stand was the 2024 Valhalla, which will have a hybrid powertrain.</p>
<h2>Audi Skysphere</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190465" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190465" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190465 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg" alt="Audi Skysphere" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/audi-skysphere-getty.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg. The Audi AG Skysphere electric concept car during The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering, in Carmel, California.</p></div></p>
<p>The self-driving Skysphere concept looked more like it belonged at the CES show than a vintage car concours. It stuck out as the most interesting car unveiled at Pebble Beach. Audi says it can slim down its wheelbase from a larger car into a small roadster.</p>
<h2>Bentley Flying Spur Mulliner</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190476" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190476" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190476 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg" alt="Bentley Flying Spur Mulliner " width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flying-Spur-Mulliner-5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190476" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Bentley. Bentley Flying Spur Mulliner.</p></div></p>
<p>While the luxe interior of the Bentley Flying Spur Mulliner drew compliments for its lush leather, news that would include a hybrid powertrain is significant for Bentley.</p>
<h2>Bugatti Bolide</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2190487" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190487" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190487 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg" alt="Buggati -Winkelmann" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210816_PB_01_Winkelmann.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credit</strong>: Bugatti. Stephan Winkelmann, president of Bugatti Automobiles, stands next to the Bugatti Bolide at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering, in 2021.</p></div></p>
<p>The Bolide wasn&#8217;t at Pebble, but announced at a press conference held at The Quail on Friday. For the ultra-exclusive automaker, a new car is a big deal, especially one that will be its last gasoline-powered car. Bugatti says it will make 40 Bolides priced at $4 million apiece.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rimac stamped its mark on Monterey with its U.S. debut of the Nevera, a $2.44 million electric super car. Rimac says Nevera will run up to 400 miles on full  charge, at a top speed of 258 miles per hour. Rimac’s buzzy presence around town is a reminder that while Pebble Beach was once about the past, there’s a hunger for new EV players that can outrun the competition. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just five months after raising $90M, Brazil’s Nuvemshop announced today it has raised $500 million in a round co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing values Nuvemshop – which some say is Latin America’s answer to Shopify – at $3.1 billion and brings the Sao Paulo-based startup’s total funding in the last 10 months to more than $620 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunley House Capital and VMG Partners, as well as existing backers Accel, Kaszek, Kevin Efrusy, Qualcomm Ventures LLC and ThornTree Capital also participated in the latest round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop (also known as Tiendanube in Spanish speaking countries) aims to give entrepreneurs a way to build and grow online businesses. The company’s platform serves more than 90,000 merchants across Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, ranging from direct-to-consumer (DTC) upstarts to more established brands such as PlayMobil, Billabong, Colombraro, Zaira Beauty, Osram, Lolja, Vitabe and StrappyCo. That’s up from 20,000 merchants at the start of 2020 and 80,000 at the time of its last raise in March.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nuvemshop, LatAm&#8217;s answer to Shopify, raises $90M in Accel-led Series D&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/nuvemshop-latams-answer-to-shopify-raises-90m-in-accel-led-series-d/embed/#?secret=FyZ8IdnCyb" data-secret="FyZ8IdnCyb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than selling their goods on existing marketplaces (such as Mercado Libre, the Brazilian equivalent of Amazon), many merchants and entrepreneurs are opting to start and grow their own online businesses, according to Nuvemshop co-founder and CEO Santiago Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most merchants have entered the internet by selling on marketplaces but we are hearing from newer generations of merchants and SMBs that they don’t want to be intermediated anymore,” he said. “They want to connect more directly with consumers and convey their own brand, image and voice.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtually every KPI tripled in the company in 2020 as the world saw a massive transition to online, and Nuvemshop’s platform was home to 14 million transactions last year, according to Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year Nuvemshop launched a beta version of its own payments solution platform for merchants that is designed to allow for “faster and more secure” purchases. It also reflects the Latin American consumers&#8217; approach to paying for retail purchases over time. In fact, the company says that 70% of the credit card transactions on its platform happen via installments. The new product will be made broadly available to all merchants over the course of the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop says that its logistics capabilities allow merchants to deliver directly to consumers via partnerships and integrations with what would otherwise be a highly fragmented network of carriers. The company plans to keep broadening its set of warehouse and carrier partners with the goal of driving down the click-to-delivery time in most regions — now typically 5 to 6 days — to an eventual goal of the 1- or 2-day delivery, which is now standard in the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;With 650 million consumers, <span class="xn-location">Latin America</span> is not only a huge market, but it is the fastest growing e-commerce market in the world,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Matt Gatto</span>, managing director at Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Accel Partner Ethan Choi believes the Latin American e-commerce market has the potential to be just as big as the U.S. market in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the rapid adoption of e-commerce, we believe Nuvemshop has the potential to be one of the most important companies in the region,<br />
he told TechCrunch. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Looking at Shopify&#8217;s $185 billion market cap gives you a sense of what&#8217;s possible if you&#8217;re the leading eCommerce player in a big market like the U.S.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will go toward growth in Nuvemshop’s existing markets and support expansion into new countries such as Colombia, Chile and Perú. Nuvemshop will also work to expand its capabilities to serve larger merchants by expanding its sales and customer support staff, as well as continuing to invest in resources and support for its app partners and agencies. The company additionally plans to accelerate its payment and logistics capabilities, and will use the fresh capital in part toward some acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently has more than 600 employees and offices in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">InfoSum, a London-based startup that provides a decentralized platform for secure data sharing between organizations, has secured a $65 million Series B funding round led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chrysalis/">Chrysalis Investments</a>.</p>
<p>The investment comes less than a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/infosum-raises-15-1m-for-its-privacy-first-federated-approach-to-big-data-analytics/">InfoSum closed a $15.1 million Series A round co-led by Upfront Ventures and IA Ventures</a>. Since, the data privacy startup has tripled its revenue, doubled its employee base, and secured more than fifty new customers, including AT&amp;T, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/disney/">Disney</a>, Omnicom and Merkle.</p>
<p>Its growth was boosted by businesses that are increasingly focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>, largely as a result of the mass shift to remote working and cloud-based collaboration necessitated by the pandemic. InfoSum’s data collaboration platform uses patented technology to connect customer records between and amongst companies, without moving or sharing data. It helps organizations to alleviate security concerns, according to the startup, and is compliant with all current privacy laws, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gdpr/">GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>The platform was bolstered earlier this year with the launch of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/infosum-outs-an-identity-linking-tool-thats-exciting-marketing-firms-like-experian/"> InfoSum Bridge</a>, a product which it claims significantly expands the customer identity linking capabilities of its platform. It is designed to connect advertising identifiers along with its own &#8220;bunkered&#8221; data sets to better facilitate ad targeting based on first-party data.</p>
<p>“The technology that enables companies to safely and securely compare customer data is thankfully entering a new phase, driven by privacy-conscious consumers and companies focused on value and control. InfoSum is proud to be leading the way,” said Brian Lesser, chairman and CEO of InfoSum. “Companies are looking for solutions to help resolve the existing friction and inefficiencies around data collaboration, and InfoSum is the company to drive this growth forward.”</p>
<p>The company, which says it is poised for &#8220;exponential growth” in 2021 as businesses continue to embrace privacy-focused tools and software, will use the newly raised investment to accelerate hiring across every aspect of its business, expand into new regions, and further the development of its platform.</p>
<p>Nick Halstead, who previously founded and led big data startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/datasift/">DataSift</a>, founded InfoSum (then called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/09/cognitivelogic-raises-3m-to-help-enterprises-pool-big-data-while-keeping-privacy-intact/">CognitiveLogic</a>) in 2015 with a vision to connect the world’s data without ever sharing it. The company currently has 80 employees spread across offices in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some Bluetooth bugginess and questionable mic performance, I liked the NuraTrue, quite a bit. And obviously, I’m always in favor of smaller companies mixing it up with tech giants, while bringing something unique to the process. In Nura’s case, that thing is custom sound profiles that can dramatically enhance the listening experience.</p>
<p>The company has also been a proponent of the hardware as a service model. It’s a concept we’ve written about quite a bit that has yet to really catch fire with a broader audience. You pay some money up front and then effectively rent the product for a monthly fee. The company is extending the model to its NuraBuds product.</p>
<p>The fully wireless headphones shouldn’t be confused with the NuraTrue (honestly, though, the NuraBuds name is the better of the two). The devices are remarkably similar, but these are cheaper (and smaller) versions that drop some of the features in the name of keeping the cost down. They&#8217;re not unlike <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/googles-much-improved-pixel-buds-are-finally-here/">Google&#8217;s Pixel Buds A</a>, in that respect.</p>
<p>The smaller size (which also drops the largely ornament circle design) also comes with a reduced battery, down from six hours to four on the buds (plus 10 additional hours via the case). How big a difference that will make to you, the user, really depends on how you use the buds. The other big difference is the NuraBuds can’t be used to perform the company’s signature hearing test.</p>
<p>Instead, users will have to use the app to import it from a different model. Essentially that means missing out on their best feature, unless you&#8217;ve already owned (or rented) another set of Nura headphones and saved that profile.</p>
<p>If that all sounds good, the buds run $5 a month through the Nuranow program, plus a $19 upfront “one-time setup” fee. The over ear Nuraphones are also available through the program for $10 a month (plus $49 up front), while the NuraLoop run $8 a month (plus $29).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.branchapp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has built a flexible workforce payments platform, announced today it has raised $48 million in Series B funding and closed on a $500 million credit facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Fixel’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/lee-fixel-burnishes-his-reputation-raising-his-second-massive-fund-in-2020/">Addition</a> –– which has also backed the likes of Flipkart, Stripe and Coinbase – led the equity financing while the credit facility was secured in the form of purchased assets from funds managed by Neuberger Berman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive Capital, Crosscut Ventures, Bonfire Ventures, Matchstick Ventures, and HR Tech Investments LLC, a subsidiary of Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. (an affiliate of job search site Indeed) also participated in the equity funding, among other investors. With the latest investment, Minneapolis-based Branch has brought in a total of $58 million in equity funding since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise marks Branch’s first since 2017.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch CEO and founder Atif Siddiqi declined to reveal at which valuation the company’s current round was raised but did note that it saw 300% revenue growth year over year in 2020, and a 700% increase in the number of enterprises using its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch was founded to give companies a more cost-effective, faster way to pay employees and  contractors, which in turn theoretically can maybe help them attract and retain talent and save money compared to using traditional payment methods. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Siddiqi first started the company, Branch was focused on a use case of helping workers pick up additional hours at companies they already worked at to grow their income. But then the team started looking for other ways to help these workers financially.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our strengths was that we were connected to a lot of very disparate enterprise systems. And we were collecting a lot of really interesting employment data,” Siddiqi told TechCrunch. “With that data, we realized we could really build a better financial service experience for this consumer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch typically focuses on low to moderate income users, and sits between the company and its worker payment flows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started off with earned wage access and then began accelerating payments for workers. It has since expanded into use cases such as digital tip payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things we saw when we were working with a lot of Domino&#8217;s franchisees is that a lot of them didn’t have enough cash at the end of the day to tip out their drivers,” Siddiqi explains. Rather than be forced to go to an ATM to get cash, some turned to Branch’s Wallet offering, which gives franchise owners the ability to push tip payments in real time after a driver finishes a shift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tips represent about 40% of a driver’s income on a monthly basis so that’s pretty significant,” Siddiqi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch then expanded into contractor payments, such as helping companies pay their 1099 contractors faster with a “uniform” payment experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized we could rebuild a better financial service experience from the ground up, and that&#8217;s where you find Branch today,” Siddiqi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siddiqi said the company tries to provide as many free options as possible such as not charging for instant transfers into the Branch Wallet and non-instant transfers to another financial account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other fintechs, the startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">monetizes primarily off of interchange fees. It also charges a transaction fee for pushing funds instantly from the Branch Wallet to another financial account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Faster payments is a compelling and transformative benefit expected by today’s workforce,” Siddiqi said. “We’ve seen how it can significantly improve cash flow for both companies and workers, so we’re excited to deliver instant payments and other engaging tools to more sectors and workforces, from other workers living paycheck to paycheck to independent contractors growing their own businesses.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the company’s efforts to grow beyond the multi-billion dollar earned wage access market, it has expanded into contractor and influencer payments with a new deal with influencer marketing platform Tagger and other on-demand delivery platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch also recently inked an agreement with Kelly, a global staffing firm. Other customers include Delivery Drivers, Inc. (DDI), an independent contractor management solution specializing in last-mile delivery, and HR and IT management platform Rippling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is similar to another fintech, <a href="https://gigwage.com/">GigWage</a>, but the biggest difference – according to Siddiqi –– is that Branch has built its own payment rails and system to push out funds instantly, and also has offerings for W-2 workforces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive Capital Partner Andy Jenks believes that the company’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">financial services address pay cycle gaps and cash flow challenges in a way “that can save time and costs for both workers and the companies they work for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen how impactful Branch’s acceleration of payments for employers and the W-2 workforce has been,” he wrote via email, “and look forward to their expansion into contractor payments where they can serve a range of rapidly growing industries such as last-mile delivery, logistics and influencers.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora Propulsion Technologies, a Finnish company that develops thrusters and de-orbiting modules for small satellites, will be sending its technology to space for the first time. The company has signed on with Rocket Lab to send its inaugural AuroraSat-1 cubesat into low Earth orbit aboard an Electron rocket rideshare mission in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Aurora is part of a small number of startups have emerged over the past few years whose technology could help solve a tricky problem that, for most of us, can be summed up as ‘out of sight, out of mind’: space junk.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1MAfrVw3DJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/removing-space-debris-requires-action-and-caution/">Removing space debris requires action and caution</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Removing space debris requires action and caution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/removing-space-debris-requires-action-and-caution/embed/#?secret=1MAfrVw3DJ" data-secret="1MAfrVw3DJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Space junk, or orbital debris, includes any human-generated object in space that’s no longer functional. While the Department of Defense keeps track of around 27,000 pieces of space junk through its Space Surveillance Network, there are estimated to be millions of pieces of debris floating around in low Earth orbit. As the costs of launch and other technology continues to decline, LEO is only poised to grow more crowded in the coming years – which could mean more useless junk floating around us in the long-term.</p>
<p>The launch with Rocket Lab later this year is the opportunity for the company to demonstrate its technology in-space. AuroraSat-1 will have two modules. The first module will contain 6 “resistojet” thrusters, designed to help cubesats quickly de-tumble and adjust their attitude control, or the satellite’s orientation. Aurora will also test its Plasma Brakes, which use an electrically charged microtether to generate drag for satellite de-orbiting.</p>
<p>AuroraSat-1 was originally scheduled to fly with in-space transportation provider Momentus on board a Space X Falcon 9 rideshare mission earlier this year, but that flight was halted after Momentus failed to receive approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>Regarding the switch up, Aurora CEO Roope Takala told TechCrunch that “in light of Momentus’ difficulties, we had to re-manifest the satellite onto the now published Rocket Lab flight.” Aurora announced in March it had signed on to launch a satellite with Momentus in June 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A California-based medical startup that provides COVID-19 testing across Los Angeles has pulled down a website it used to allow customers to access their test results after a customer found a vulnerability that allowed access to other people&#8217;s personal information.</p>
<p>Total Testing Solutions has ten COVID-19 testing sites across Los Angeles, and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/flurotest-diagnostics-systems-and-total-testing-solutions-sign-pilot-program-mou-to-bring-first-high-volume-sars-cov-2-testing-system-to-california-301281753.html">processes &#8220;thousands&#8221;</a> of COVID-19 tests at workplaces, sports venues, and schools each week. When test results are ready, customers get an email with a link to a website to get their results.</p>
<p>But one customer said they found a website vulnerability that allowed them to access other customers&#8217; information by increasing or decreasing a number in the website&#8217;s address by a single digit. That allowed the customer to see other customers&#8217; names and the date of their test. The website also only requires a person&#8217;s date of birth to access their COVID-19 test results, which the customer who discovered the vulnerability said &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t take long&#8221; to brute-force, or simply guess. (That&#8217;s just 11,000 birthday guesses for anyone under age 30.)</p>

<p>Although the test results website is protected by a login page that prompts the customer for their email address and password, the vulnerable part of the website that allowed the customer to change the web address and access other customers&#8217; information could be accessed directly from the web, bypassing the sign-in prompt altogether.</p>
<p>The customer passed on details of the vulnerability to TechCrunch to get the vulnerability fixed before someone else finds it or exploits it, if not already.</p>
<p>TechCrunch verified the customer&#8217;s findings, but while we did not enumerate each result code, through limited testing found that the vulnerability likely put around 60,000 tests at risk. TechCrunch reported the vulnerability to TTS chief medical officer Geoffrey Trenkle, who did not dispute the number of discovered tests, but said the vulnerability was limited to an on-premise server used to provide legacy test results that has since been shut down and replaced by a new cloud-based system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were recently made aware of a potential security vulnerability in our former on-premises server that could allow access to certain patient names and results using a combination of URL manipulation and date of birth programming codes,&#8221; said Trenkle in a statement. &#8220;The vulnerability was limited to patient information obtained at public testing sites before the creation of the cloud-based server. In response to this potential threat, we immediately shut down the on-premises software and began migrating that data to the secure cloud-based system to prevent future risk of data breach. We also initiated a vulnerability assessment, including the review of server access logs to detect any unrecognized network activity or unusual authentication failures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trenkle declined to say when the cloud server became active, and why the allegedly legacy server had test results as recently as last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, TTS is not aware of any breach of unsecured protected health information as a result of the issues with its prior server. To our knowledge, no patient health information was actually compromised, and all risk has been mitigated going forward,&#8221; said Trenkle.</p>
<p>Trenkle said the company will comply with its legal obligations under state law, but stopped short of explicitly saying if the company plans to notify customers of the vulnerability. Although companies aren&#8217;t obliged to report vulnerabilities to their state&#8217;s attorney general or to their customers, many do out of an abundance of caution since it&#8217;s not always possible to determine if there was improper access.</p>
<p>TTS chief executive Lauren Trenkle, who was copied on an email chain, did not comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As many companies shift to a hybrid approach to work where some folks are working in the office and some at home, it&#8217;s easy for the home-based workers to feel a disconnect, even with video conferencing tools like Zoom. Video Window is designed to give users a feeling of being connected to other offices as though you were looking through a virtual window. Today, the company introduced a companion app for iOS and Android called <a href="https://videowindow.com/#remote">Video Window Remote</a> aimed squarely at those remote employees.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the latest addition to the Video Window family is designed to involve not just intra-office remote communication, but also include those employees who are working offsite, whether at home or in another location, and make them feel like they are in the office.</p>
<p>While video conferencing allows you to meet virtually to discuss the business of your work, it doesn&#8217;t give that connection that you feel of being in the office and chatting with your colleagues. That can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation or that your ideas are not being heard.</p>
<p>With Video Window Remote, users download the app to their phone or tablet and use that as a visual connection to the office, getting both video and audio as desired. This gives the water cooler experience that many remote workers feel they are missing by not being in the office.</p>

<p>Company CEO Daryl Hutchings says he came up with many of the features in Video Window Remote based on his own experience working at home during the pandemic. &#8220;Using Video Window is exactly like looking through a window to see your colleagues. It enables you to really be present with the people you work with while successfully completing your projects and accomplishing your goals, making work better, more enjoyable, fun and leveling the playing field for all. Ultimately creating a happy hybrid workplace,&#8221; Hutchings said in a statement.</p>
<p>In case you are concerned about security or privacy with a tool like this, Hutchings says that he built in several safeguards including preventing guest access, audio and video off by default (you control when you want to be seen and heard), the ability for everyone to see who is present regardless of their video/audio status, and scheduled sleep mode, so the service only turns on during scheduled hours.</p>
<p>The tool is available for free starting today from the iOS and Android app stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swing Therapeutics, a digital therapeutics startup, has received an FDA breakthrough device designation for their 12 week smartphone-assisted fibromyalgia management program. This is the company’s first breakthrough designation, and precedes a deluge of clinical trials scheduled for this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swing Therapeutics was founded in 2019 and has raised a total of $9 million in seed funding led by JAZZ Venture partners. The company is focused on managing chronic pain, and specifically fibromyalgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This FDA breakthrough designation was awarded to the company’s smartphone adaptation of an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) program originally designed and tested at the University of Manitoba. Swing Therapeutics has exclusively licensed the program, and adapted it to form their own phone-based version. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We basically used [The University of Manitoba program] as a basis for our program and then really built on top of it, and adapted it to a sort of experience that would work great for a modern day smartphone interface,” says Mike Rosenbluth, the founder and CEO of Swing Therapeutics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This FDA designation will allow Swing Therapeutics expedited review at the FDA as the company conducts a series of clinical trials on the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, there is no cure for fibromyalgia, but the FDA has approved three drugs that can help manage symptoms. Those include: Lyrica, which is usually prescribed to treat nerve damage, but is also used to treat fibromyalgia; Cymbalta, which was originally developed to treat depression, anxiety and diabetic neuropathy; and Savella, an SSRI that’s similar to treatments for depression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of the drug world, there’s some evidence ACT can help patients who live with chronic pain (including fibromyalgia). </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Neuroglee gets $2.3 million to develop digital therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/neuroglee-gets-2-3-million-to-develop-digital-therapeutics-for-neurodegenerative-diseases/embed/#?secret=272smn94vL" data-secret="272smn94vL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26818413/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meta-review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 25 studies on ACT and chronic pain, for instance, found that ACT therapy had small effects on pain intensity. But the therapeutic process of teaching patients to accept their pain (but not ignore it) was linked with moderate and long-term improvements in depression, anxiety and quality of life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What ACT does is it tries to help people accept those symptoms and things that are uncontrollable. It helps people think about their values – what is really important to them,” says Rosenbluth. “And then they try to make behavior-based changes aligned with those values.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that vein, Swing Therapeutics’ platform is designed to be prescribed by a doctor as a treatment management tool. Once prescribed, the patient would enter a 41 session acceptance and commitment therapy program that’s run entirely on their phone, and broken into “daily doses.” A &#8220;daily dose&#8221; might include a prompt for a mindfulness session or a short writing prompt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Manitoba program that Swing’s smartphone program is based on</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29481976/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does have</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a randomized controlled trial to its name. It was initially validated in a study on 67 participants who either received treatment as usual or their regular treatment plus ACT delivered via an 8-week online course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completing the course was linked with improvements in depression symptoms and improvements in patients’ scores on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R), which measures the effects of fibromyalgia on sleep, pain perception fatigue, or psychological distress.  The course appeared to help patients improve their “pain acceptance” and through that mechanism the experience of fibromyalgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, the Swing Therapeutics program does differ slightly from the University of Manitoba program – namely, it’s designed for almost daily use, over 12 weeks on a smartphone, as opposed to 8 weeks on a computer. Even these small changes warrant their own independent clinical trials to ensure this approach also helps fibromyalgia patients benefit from this specific ACT therapy program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swing Therapeutics has several of these clinical trials at different stages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This spring, Swing completed enrollment of a 67-person pilot study on their adapted treatment for fibromyalgia (patients were assigned to an active control or the ACT digital therapy). This study is ongoing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Swing also launched a large-scale study called <a href="https://react-fm.com/welcome/003">REACT-FM</a>. This study, currently recruiting, aims to enroll about 100 to 150 patients who will use the ACT product for two weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the company is also in the development phase for a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial. After completion of that study, the company plans to submit to the FDA for full approval of the platform. That study, says Rosenbluth, is planned to launch at the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA breakthrough therapy designation has already helped shape these studies. As the trials continue, this designation means the device will continue to enjoy expedited review, which could smooth the platform’s journey through clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We found it really useful to be able to have that channel dialogue with the FDA, so that we can make sure that we&#8217;re aligned in clinical study design and our approaches are in line with things that the FDA expects,” Rosenbluth says. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The sports car market can seem like an exclusive club, one reserved for those with enough extra cash and garage space to make such a highly impractical passion purchase.</p>
<p>More often than not, these prestige items are billed with intimidating power numbers and equally frightening price tags, both tacitly challenging would-be buyers — Can you handle me? Can you even afford me?</p>
<p>The Daft Punk-ian &#8220;harder better faster stronger&#8221; mantra of the sports car industry is great for those with deep enough pockets to participate or for those who enjoy cheering from the sidelines, but anyone looking to get in on the action on the ground floor these days would be hard-pressed to find a sub-$30,000 performance-specific ride that isn&#8217;t the Mazda Miata.</p>
<p>The misnomer too that &#8220;performance&#8221; refers exclusively to the high-speed, high-horsepower machines is enough to scare away the inexperienced or drive off those who just don&#8217;t need that. Hello again, Miata.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why the Introduction of the first-generation Toyota GT 86 (née Scion FR-S) was an important one and why its next iteration, the GR 86, is an exciting prospect: Performance for the people; a sports car for everyone.</p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>The GR 86 is a 2+2 coupe powered by a 2.4-liter flat four-cylinder boxer engine that produces 228 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with this configuration, it&#8217;s a layout that delivers more balance than the Vs-and-straights that you may be used to. Power is sent to the rear wheels by way of a six-speed transmission, manual or automatic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It rides on an independent suspension with MacPherson-type struts at the front and multilink setup in the rear. Depending on the trim level, the GR 86 is saddled with 17- or 18-inch wheels.</p>
<p>Speaking of trims, the GR 86 comes in two flavors: base and premium, with the latter bringing a handful of upgrades such as the aforementioned 18-inch wheels, a duckbill rear spoiler, adaptive front LED headlamps, a smattering of visual accents, plus an upgrade to eight stereo speakers from the standard six.</p>
<p>All trims come with an 8-inch touchscreen display for entertainment and connectivity purposes, as well as a host of standard safety equipment that includes seven airbags and the Toyota Star safety system that&#8217;s made up of the stability control, anti-lock braking systems we&#8217;ve come to expect, plus brake assist and brake-force distribution.</p>
<p>GR 86s fitted with the automatic gearbox have the added benefit of an active safety system that handles pre-collision braking, lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control.</p>
<p>Connected services requiring a subscription give the GR 86 remote connect abilities via an app that can start the engine, lock the doors and honk the horn, but can also provide vehicle health reports and set up what are essentially parental controls for the car: geofencing, speed alerts and even a curfew setting.</p>
<h2>Race-bred tech</h2>
<p>A keep-it-simple sports car like the GR 86 lacks the luxury luster of a tech-laden Lamborghini Huracán or its close cousin, the Audi R8.</p>
<p>While these cars have more hardware than a gaming PC, the GR 86 is light on computational muscle. Indeed, branded as a &#8220;purist&#8217;s sports car,&#8221; it&#8217;s scant on too many assists when it comes to spirited driving sessions.</p>
<p>Stability can be switched off and drive modes &#8220;Sport&#8221; and &#8220;Track&#8221; will increase input response on the brakes and throttle. These modes will also make the automatic gearbox punchier in kind to the more aggressive engine mapping.</p>
<p>With the GR 86 being such a small package, finding the tech that makes a difference requires some keen scrutiny in specific areas. Toyota states the car earns its &#8220;GR&#8221; (for Gazoo Racing, Toyota&#8217;s motorsport branch) branding through the car being developed with race-bred technology.</p>
<p>On the outside, this is notable in the aerodynamic touches that make big differences in stability. It starts at the front where functional vents channel air at high speeds to aid in the car&#8217;s control and is continued at the rear, where the molding above the rear wheel well is shaped to continue this work at the back end.</p>
<p>Structurally, the GR 86 is improved over the previous version by increasing the frame&#8217;s rigidity, implementing reinforcement in key areas in the front and rear, as well as using more high-strength steel.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the car manages to gain a few pounds over the outgoing model, from 77 to 117 pounds depending on the transmission. A number of weight-saving measures such as an aluminum roof and fenders mitigate this. However, the efforts were more to carefully distribute weight than shed the pounds.</p>
<h2>Strapped in</h2>
<p>From behind the wheel of the GR 86, it&#8217;s clear to see the interior as an upgrade more than a drastic change. Gone is the analog gauge cluster in favor of a 7-inch TFT digital screen that changes depending on drive mode.</p>
<p>For the 86s fitted with an automatic, there are three distinct screens that shift the visible information around for optimal usage and two in the manual.</p>
<p>For instance, the &#8220;normal&#8221; screen will have the miles-per-hour stat front and center, while the &#8220;track&#8221; screen will put the current gear at the top, above a three-color rpm indicator. This is useful for those who will take the Toyota out on a closed course since this is more critical info to know &#8220;in the moment&#8221; over the current speed. Bumping this up and giving the interface a distinct amber glow helps deliver that data with either a quick glance or even just through the driver&#8217;s periphery.</p>

<p>The infotainment screen is also slightly upgraded. Visually speaking, it looks better integrated and free of the piano black plastic bezel that mars the older one.</p>
<p>The interface is simple, with icons giving access to the radio, media sources, maintenance data and to call roadside assistance, as well as other integrated apps that may be installed, such as a music streaming services.</p>
<p>Apps can be arranged to preference but overall, it&#8217;s reliant on external devices to be truly functional. For the hyperconnected audience that this car is targeted for, there&#8217;s a sense that Toyota&#8217;s betting on most users to primarily utilize Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which is compatible on all models.</p>
<h2>Performance playground</h2>
<p>Heading onto the track with the GR 86 feels like returning a captive creature back to its native environment. Toyota brought the GR 86 and its predecessor for testing and back-to-back comparison to Monticello Motor Club, a 4.1-mile course with 20 turns to pit against the car&#8217;s performance. Though the GR 86 is very much a street car, it&#8217;s on the track where it can run wild and fully express its capabilities.</p>
<p>The power output of the previous car was a divisive issue, with fans feeling it right-sized for the intent of the vehicle while others found it lacking and hoped that Toyota would finally affix it with the turbocharger they felt it deserved.</p>
<p>The improvements to the GT 86&#8217;s boxer engine are palpable and should satisfy both camps.</p>
<p>The increased displacement and other enhancements does indeed up the power slightly and does so without adding a turbo, keeping things simple and uniform, particularly to application of the power.</p>
<p>More importantly, the power is usable earlier in the rev band, so the GR 86 gets up to speed with more immediacy. In comparison, the heavier GR 86 feels lighter while the outgoing car feels like it&#8217;s dragging a load of bricks.</p>
<p>All of the weight balancing and suspension refinement has given the car an increasing amount of control. One of the defining attributes to the older 86 was how it felt incredibly planted to the ground.</p>
<p>It was difficult to push the car beyond its limits and that was encouraging to drivers old and new to drive without worry that it would go out of sorts beneath them. This still holds true in the GR 86 but the sharper agility takes some adjustment.</p>
<p>It feels like playing your favorite video game and then upping the controller settings way higher than you&#8217;re used to. After getting a handle on it and combined with the rebalanced power output, the GR 86 can glide around corners in a wonderfully rewarding manner.</p>

<p>Steering and throttle may respond to a light touch, but when it comes to the brakes, it&#8217;s a different story. The otherwise lithe GT 86 demands a heavy foot when it comes to slowing or stopping to any significant degree. It&#8217;s not just for deep high-speed braking, either, but even in usual instances of a quick speed adjustment, stepping on the brakes elicits the same incredulity as pushing through a door that wasn&#8217;t as light as it appeared to be.</p>
<p>Between the different transmissions, it boils down to preference, either for the track or the streets.</p>
<p>The manual is slick and light, if a little loose-feeling. Like the car&#8217;s handling, the gearbox itself has been designed for quicker movement throughout the pattern, be that forward, back and diagonal, and the tradeoff for this slippery shifter is a drop in confident gear selection. Otherwise, it&#8217;s a manual, and thus the driver is in full control, as opposed to the automatic.</p>
<p>In general, the automatic transmission is fine for casual to sporty driving, but go beyond that and it starts to become a system to overcome rather than to work with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sport&#8221; mode handles the throttle response and gearbox behavior in the automatic-affixed GR 86s, and the difference is dramatic in practical application. Trying to drive fast in &#8220;normal,&#8221; nets drivers bursts of speed when the pedal is planted but the gearbox will hurry to return to higher gears as soon as it can, rather than staying low for the driver to maximize acceleration. Even in Sport, it&#8217;ll stay in gear for a bit longer, but will ultimately call its own shots, much to the frustration of the person behind the wheel.</p>
<h2>Street beat</h2>
<p>Taking a spirited drive on the street, the GR 86&#8217;s talents far outshine its shortcomings.</p>
<p>The transmission behavior is still intrusive with the automatic but backroad curves differ from track bends, and its boisterous acceleration and handling almost guarantee a good time no matter what the road ahead looks like.</p>
<p>In between the fun sessions, the Toyota feels competent. It drives better than what one would expect from a sub-$30,000 vehicle, but there&#8217;s no &#8220;wow&#8221; factor here. At worst it feels like an inexpensive commuter car with decent interior touch points, but it&#8217;s far from insufferable.</p>
<p>With the automatic, drivers can use its suite of driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control, which behaves with an eagerness to maintain the set speed in the face of elevation changes or when cars are detected.</p>
<p>Most other settings like lane departure warning are tucked away in a menu accessed through one section of the digital gauge cluster, and its usage is clumsy, particularly while on the move. When it&#8217;s activated, the detection is hit or miss, sometimes ignoring very clear and, in my case, deliberate lane deviation, only to be hyperactive on my journey back on the same road.</p>
<h2>Contenders</h2>
<p>At its price point, the GR 86 doesn&#8217;t have many other sports cars to compete with, apart from the obvious Mazda MX-5. They are similar in their accessibility, affordability and dynamic behavior, but they differ in mission and in attitude.</p>
<p>The Miata is a plucky roadster that endears itself to drivers with its playful drop-top energy. The GR 86 is just as playful, but it&#8217;s slightly more serious, without being comically so or intimidating.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s user preference and use case; I&#8217;d take the Miata on a coastal drive, but I would make the GR 86 my track toy.</p>
<p>Indeed, the GR 86 is only really competing against itself. In one regard, it does this as it endeavors to be better than its outgoing self, and I think most drivers will agree that it succeeds there.</p>
<p>In another, it does this as it goes head-to-head with the Subaru BRZ, its mechanical twin, as Toyota and Subaru famously partnered to make this and the car&#8217;s previous iterations happen. There are certain things that set the cars apart like looks and tuning, but not much else beyond that, and it will be interesting to see which way enthusiasts gravitate.</p>
<p>The GR 86 is an important vehicle to Toyota&#8217;s commitment to its current motorsport endeavors as well as its sports car heritage, which in turn carries a substantial cultural significance. Anyone questioning this need only look to the very top of the company&#8217;s structure. Toyota&#8217;s president Akio Toyoda is not only enthusiastic about sports cars, he&#8217;s an experienced driver and had a personal hand in the development of the GR 86. In short, the car wouldn&#8217;t move forward unless he himself was happy with it, and that degree of personal investment isn&#8217;t spent on things that are unimportant.</p>
<p>Being an entry point to the GR sub-brand (joining the Supra), the GR 86 gives new and experienced enthusiasts a great starting point for a performance driving journey. As drivers, the GR 86 comes with a one-year membership to the National Motor Sport Association, which includes one high performance driving event.</p>
<p>The 86 is also a blank slate for aftermarket tuners, who still modify and maintain cars like the Supra and even the AE86, the GR&#8217;s progenitor. At the end of the day, the GR 86 might not be the fastest or most powerful car on the road or on the track, but its accessibility in both learning curve and price point make it a winner.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Starday raised $4 million in seed funding to take on “big food” incumbents.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://stardayfoods.com/">Starday</a>, a healthy and sustainable food products company, raised $4 million in seed funding to take on “big food” incumbents.</p>
<p>Equal Ventures and Slow Ventures co-led the round and were joined by Haystack, Great Oaks Venture Capital, XFactor Ventures, ABV and a group of angel investors.</p>
<p>Chaz Flexman, co-founder and CEO, started the remote first company in late 2020 after leaving Pattern Brands. He watched digital grocery go from a single-digit market to double digits overnight.</p>
<p>“It feels like a ‘Napster moment’ in the way consumers are now coming online to discover and buy,” Flexman told TechCrunch. “We are measuring their interest and using data to drive outcomes so we can go up against the Nestlés of the world.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insights-on-the-food-and-beverages-global-market-to-2030---identify-growth-segments-for-investment-301202729.html">global food and beverages market</a> is expected to reach $7.5 trillion by 2023, with growing demand for foods that are more clean and sustainable, according to market research firm Research and Markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starday’s technology turns data like that into products based on current trends and customer preferences. It is able to test new concepts, gather feedback and make adjustments before putting new food items on the market, Flexman said. It is also able to cut the time a product takes from idea to market down to six months (from 18 months), while also using feedback to plan for other potential brands.</p>
<p>“We use data to let consumers tell us what they want now rather than how Big Food has operated over the years: to follow consumer demand and create nutritionally bad food that is also bad for the environment,” he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190133" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190133" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190133" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png 6912w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190133" class="wp-caption-text">Gooey Snacks. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Starday</p></div></p>
<p>Its first brand is <a href="https://gooeysnacks.com/?utm_campaign=preorder&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=ffoods">Gooey Snacks</a>, an all-natural, low-sugar chocolate hazelnut spread that is made without dairy or palm oil. Flexman expects to develop four or five brands in the next 12 months, including one more later this year.</p>
<p>Starday went after the seed round so that it could launch more brands like Gooey Snacks, grow the team, develop new retail partnerships and build out its data and forecasting capabilities. The company has four employees currently, and Flexman plans to be at seven in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Rick Zullo, partner at Equal Ventures, said he knew Flexman from his firm’s investment in Pattern and said Flexman’s vision for a new type of food company was aligned with what Equal’s vision was for the food industry.</p>
<p>Rather than being just a product company, Zullo sees Starday being a platform company, able to drive a new way of eating and way of bringing new products to market.</p>
<p>“Starday is able to provide granular data to understand what consumers want and what will perform best,” he added. “This wasn’t possible when digital grocery was still a nascent concept. They don&#8217;t have to do focus groups or testing launches, so it is truly a fraction of the time it takes and is cheaper.”</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: Forward Foods and Starday are separate companies and there was not a name change</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I watched a lot of skate videos growing up. At some point, failures became as important a fixture as perfectly executed tricks. The spills and the injuries could be downright gnarly (there’s a reason, after all, that skateboarding culture gave the world &#8220;Jackass&#8221;), but as an aggressively mediocre skater myself, there was something comforting in seeing the best in the world fall flat on their face and (short of actual injury) dusting themselves off and trying a trick for the fifteenth time.</p>
<p>For the dozens or even hundreds of perfectly choreographed videos we’ve seen from Boston Dynamics, we’ve very rarely gotten a glimpse at the slipped-footed tumbles that happen between takes. Today, the firm is pulling back the curtain a bit on what goes into making its humanoid Atlas robot look good in front of the camera.</p>
<p>There’s a reason, after all, so many of the company’s in-house systems bear scuffs, scratches and discoloration on their middle and lower bodies.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tF4DML7FIWk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“During filming, Atlas gets the vault right about half of the time,” the company<a href="https://blog.bostondynamics.com/atlas-leaps-bounds-and-backflips"> writes in a blog post</a>. “On the other runs, Atlas makes it over the barrier, but loses its balance and falls backward, and the engineers look to the logs to see if they can find opportunities for on-the-fly adjustments.”</p>
<p>The company challenges the robot to run a mini parkour course, noting in an accompanying video, “Parkour is a useful organizing activity for our team, because it highlights several challenges that we believe to be important.” Parkour is a challenge to both short-term and longer-term problem solving for the robot, which must both execute a series of individual moves and, more broadly, determine how to get from point A to point B by stringing them all together.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EezdinoG4mk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Boston Dynamics says these sorts of videos can take months to get Atlas to complete in one go. “Although this most recent attempt was nearly perfect, it was not precisely perfect, not quite,” the company writes. “After the robots completed their backflips, one was supposed to pump its arm like a big-league pitcher after a game-ending strikeout &#8212; a move that the Atlas team calls the ‘Cha-Ching.’ ”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2190181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Recording-2021-08-16-at-4.10.33-PM.2021-08-16-16_14_39.gif" alt="" width="800" height="417" /></p>
<p>In addition to the hashtag greatest Atlas fails video compilations that definitely don’t exist on the Boston Dynamics computers, missed footing can result in some pretty nasty injuries for the &#8216;bots &#8212; not unlike their human counterparts. Sometimes it gets back up again, like so many robotic Chumbawumbas. Sometimes not. The video is worth checking out for both of these, as well as some insight into what goes into making one of those videos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GSK Next, the innovation arm of GlaxoSmithKlein, is launching a new mentorship and business development program. Called the Re/Wire Health Studio, the program will eventually select six startups who will win access to nine weeks of mentoring, business development expertise, and cash grants. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://rewirehealthstudio.com/#focus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Re/Wire Health Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed for growth and early-stage startups focused on “everyday health.” That means products that aid in detecting long-term health problems, incentivize proactive care, or help someone manage a condition, for example. Under the umbrella of “everyday health” the studio will work with startups applying everyday health principals to three areas of focus: oral health, mental resilience, or women’s health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies from all over the world can apply, but they must be prepared to launch in the U.S. with a minimum viable product, or be ready to perform in-market development. Applications close September 20, 2021, and the full cohort will be announced in October. </span></p>
<p>The Re/Wire Health studio is a joint project between the GSK and R/GA Ventures – which will act as the Studio&#8217;s operational partner and help select the cohort.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch spoke with Nick Tate, the Vice President of Global Digital Innovation at GSK Consumer Healthcare and head of GSK Next, to talk about what he looks for in a startup, what selected companies will gain from participation, and the types of projects he’s excited to hear more about. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. </span></i></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: </b><strong>Just to start off, I’d love to have you expand on what you’re looking for in applicants to the GSK Re/Wire Health Studio. What are two or three things are you looking for?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>Tate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">GSK consumer healthcare is extremely ambitious when it comes to our consumers, the science we are trying to drive and the solutions we are trying to create. One of the big things we look out for is people who really have got an ambition to make a significant positive dent on the world, and have surrounded themselves with people to create that energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive and excitement is one aspect of it. Then there’s technical capability. We’re looking for companies that are prepared to launch in the US with at least a minimum viable product in service or in-market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for that is [Re/Wire Health Studio] is about taking a service or a platform and saying:  How can we genuinely help? How can we deliver value so these propositions can really live in the world and make an impact on everyday health?  </span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: What are the hard and soft skills you want to see in a leadership team?</b></p>
<p><b>Tate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think we’re looking for people who have that rare mix of ambition, and reality. You can look at their proposition and believe they’re excited about it – but as we all know [running a startup] is very hard stuff. The ability to be data driven in how they look at propositions is important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it&#8217;s absolutely important that the consumer experience is at the heart of what they do. Putting ‘care’ into everyday healthcare is incredibly important to the sorts of propositions we think are going to make a tangible difference today and into the future. </span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: What are two or three things that you hope companies will gain from participating? </b></p>
<p><b>Tate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d want them to have a genuine understanding of route to scale and what that means. At GSK I think we’re in a really unique position to offer a real perspective on what it takes to have a proposition that can travel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d also want them to leave with a better understanding of themselves, their business, their business model, and what it takes to succeed in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last 18 months have taught us amazing things do happen when partnerships really work. I&#8217;m excited about bringing this understanding of what it takes to really make something global through GSK. </span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: What elements do GSK and R/GA Ventures each bring to the Re/Wire Health Studio? </b></p>
<p><b>Tate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From a GSK perspective, we think about what it takes to get into the market in a very changing and dynamic environment of everyday health. We think about manufacturing, regulatory processes, designing for the right kind of outcomes, and of course the science – that’s what we’re known for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are things a business needs to think about down the line, but they don’t have the bandwidth to consider right now. These are very specific skills that the GSK does day in and day out with our existing brands that we think are incredibly important for startups to consider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an R/GA perspective, we talk about this notion of creative capital. They’re bringing this team of award winning strategists, technologists, designers, and consultants because we know that a business is just more than a brand, a product is just more than one interaction. </span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: I like to hear you expand a bit on why Re/Wire Health Studio is interested in propositions related to oral care, mental resilience and women’s health. Why did you highlight those three focus areas? </b></p>
<p><b>Tate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the expertise we believe we can bring to the table today, we see all of these areas as extremely exciting unmet needs with the ability to create a genuine impact on people’s everyday health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They address multiple issues for consumers across the world (both today and tomorrow) and will fundamentally be emboldened by better data, insights, and human-centric solutions.</span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: When was the last time you were really blown away by a pitch or proposition? What really made it stick in your head? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think, without naming and particular names, it’s when people have really taken a proposition and turned it on its head. Or, the nature of their endeavor is just so ambitious. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all been in those meetings where you meet people and you’re like ‘my goodness, what you are trying to achieve is absolutely incredible.’ I take a lot away from people from purpose, ambition, drive and the audacity to try something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I find so incredibly exciting about everyday health is that there’s nothing more important than it, and it’s one thing we tend to sleepwalk through. When it’s all said and done, you don’t sit on your deathbed wishing you had slightly different luggage or a nicer watch, you wish you had probably taken better care of your health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when I meet startups who have an ambition to solve those sorts of problems for people all around the world, the hairs at the back of my neck go up. I get incredibly excited about working with those types of people. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic pizza has proven a surprisingly popular goal for startups. Over the past several years, some of those dreams have been more successful than others. Zume is probably the most notable story of a company that fell short, ultimately abandoning its robotic pizza trucks in early 2020 to pivot to sustainable packaging.</p>
<p>Picnic has been making itself known more recently, announcing a $16.3 million raise back in May. Another $4.2 million back in July helped push the company north of $38 million. Today, the startup announced that it’s finally ready to launch its first device, after various pilots across various industries, including restaurants, hospitality, entertainment and theme parks. The announcement was made at the International Pizza Expo and Conference, which apparently is happening in Las Vegas, as we speak.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190148" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190148" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190148" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190148" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Picnic</p></div></p>
<p>“The team has been working tirelessly with customers and strategic partners over the past year to fine tune the Picnic Pizza System,” CEO said Clayton Wood said in a release. “We’re very proud of the solution that we have created. The validation we’ve received from industry partners and customers reaffirms the need for kitchen automation solutions like ours, and we are looking forward to an excellent year ahead.”</p>
<p>Pizza is a clear early target for food robotics systems, because 1) it&#8217;s relatively straightforward and reasonably uniform in its construction and 2) people eat a lot of it. In 2015, Americans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/01/20/we-eat-100-acres-of-pizza-a-day-in-the-u-s/">reportedly ate</a> 100 acres of the stuff &#8212; daily.</p>
<p>The company will be fulfilling existing customer orders through the end of 2021 and will start shipping new orders to customers next year. Pricing will be available as a robotics-as-a-service (RaaS) model, charging customers between $3,500-$5,000 a month to effectively rent the system. The sliding scale is dependent on things like specific configurations of the modular system and output. Fees include maintenance checks and remote monitoring.</p>
<p>The system is up for preorder starting today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Micromobility company Bird has officially joined the ranks of e-scooter and e-bike operators that are integrated with Google Maps, which now surfaces nearby vehicles for users in the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bird&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/spins-electric-scooters-and-bikes-are-now-on-google-maps/">comes just a day after Spin also announced its integration with Google Maps</a> and just a few weeks after Lime, which has been integrated with Google Maps since 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">announced an integration with transit planning app Moovit</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bird already works with mobility-as-a-service platforms including Skipr, Tranzer and soon Whim in Antwerp and throughout Belgium. The company has also recently partnered with major national rail companies SNCF in France and Trenitalia in Italy. It plans to expand its Google Maps integration with Bird&#8217;s partner cities outside of the U.S. in the future, according to a spokesperson for the company. These sorts of integrations are par for the course as micromobility companies seek to become further entwined with the broader transportation ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As demand for sustainable transportation increases, Bird is committed to meeting this need while simultaneously reducing street traffic in already congested cities and towns,&#8221; said Bird CEO and founder Travis VanderZanden, in a statement. &#8220;Through our integration with Google Maps, we are making it easier for individuals to embrace new modes of eco-friendly travel and to ultimately eliminate our collective reliance on congestion inducing, gas-powered cars – especially in urban settings across the globe where a majority of trips are under five miles.”</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">As with Lime and Spin, Bird&#8217;s vehicles will show up as an option under the bike toggle of the Google Maps app. The app will show information such as estimated travel time, cost and environmental impact. Bird did not respond in time for publication to a request for information on whether estimated battery range would also be available, which is displayed with Lime and Spin&#8217;s vehicles on the app.</p>

<p>Users who choose to take a trip with Bird will have to click on the &#8220;unlock&#8221; button displayed on the bottom of the Google Maps screen, which will direct them to the Bird app, available on iOS and Android, to unlock and pay for a vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bird&#8217;s news about its integration with Google Maps comes on the same day that the operator, along with Veo and Lime, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2021/pr21-030.shtml">launch New York City&#8217;s first e-scooter pilot in the Bronx</a>. The timing of this launch alone would make this integration beneficial for Bird, but the scooter company potentially stands to gain even more in NYC. Last month, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/google-maps-now-show-yorkers-131847888.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAH7zjBAW6fl0FzRmRMLIqFnBQ1NbTUAgfCHerbx4dH4bkmRXAiG_YQvutv7tbkaKC83yXyYvRd3yB97_5rHvvewEv07djFcKX6QchEMqbub6b6NI41aF2Dkv47LoI3yxkU5HB5P06UJ91LhLVEwCyg14IcgUZIHgz1BzNvyymrPK">Google Maps began trialling a feature in the big apple</a> to show users which train cars were the busiest in order to help riders social distance better. Now, those users can ostensibly choose to seek out a Bird or Lime vehicle via the app rather than cram into a packed subway car.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As developers build applications, they often want to test new functionality on a limited set of users to blunt any possible negative impact or to gauge user reaction to the change before rolling it out more broadly. They use a technique called a feature flag, and <a href="http://split.io">Split.io</a>, a startup that has built a platform to help manage feature flags, announced a $50 million Series D today.</p>
<p>Owl Rock was lead investor with participation from Northgate Capital and existing investors Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Harmony Partners, Microsoft’s venture capital fund M12, Atlassian Ventures, and ServiceNow. The company raised $110 million in total including its $33 million Series C last summer.</p>
<p>CEO Brian Bell, who came on board at the end of 2019, says the company helps development teams deliver controlled rollouts of new features. &#8220;What we provide is essentially a platform that allows development teams to separate the deployment of code from the release of the feature, so that you can turn the feature on and off as needed, essentially toggle the feature and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s called the feature flag,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bell says that when you can control the release of new features in this way, it can free up development teams to be more experimental. &#8220;The feature flag in many ways sounds so basic, but it&#8217;s an incredibly powerful concept and it allows development teams to turn features on for different users, and to control the rollout. And that fundamentally changes the way you build and release products,&#8221; Bell explained.</p>
<p>He says the real power of this approach comes into play when you combine this ability with data like performance data, user behavior data and business analytics to see the impact of a change on the application and users. What&#8217;s more, the platform helps manage flag bloat by alerting you to turn them off once a feature is rolled out to 100% of users and is no longer needed.</p>
<p>The company is growing fast and expects to be between 200 and 250 employees in the next 12 months. He says that it&#8217;s a tough hiring environment, but that he is cognizant of building a diverse and inclusive company in spite of the challenges. He says that when he came on board, he formed a DEI task force shortly after taking over, and brought in an outside consultant to help guide the conversation.</p>

<p>He believes that creating an inclusive environment will help drive diversity. &#8220;One of the things I believe in that I&#8217;ve learned is that if you focus on inclusion, you will create diversity because an inclusive culture will attract a diverse applicant pool because people will recognize that they can be successful in this company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bell says that with strategic investors on board like Microsoft, Atlassian and ServiceNow, all solid public companies, it gives him more credibility in the marketplace and should help him continue to grow the platform. And that doesn&#8217;t just involve money. These companies are also partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the developers that we serve want to make sure that we coexist within the workflow of those application development platforms. So for example, with JIRA which is part of Atlassian, we have a bi-directional integration that allows a ticket within JIRA to show a feature flag content right on the ticket.&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>While the company is a Series D, Bell isn&#8217;t thinking exit any time soon. He wants to continue to build the company. &#8220;If you think about markets, this is absolutely massive. So our focus right now is just on growth. My focus personally is on how do I scale the team, how do I hire the right people, and how do we deliver value to our customers and if we do that, there will be opportunities and strategic options moving forward, whether it takes the form of an IPO or being part of something larger.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/">Monte Carlo</a> has returned to the capital well for the second time this year, adding $60 million to its accounts thanks to a new, ICONIQ Growth-led Series C. The company helps customers monitor their data inflows, finding issues and errors that could foul downstream data analysis.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/monte-carlo-raises-25m-for-its-data-observability-service/">raised a Series B earlier this year</a>, a $25 million round led by GGV and Redpoint. Both Series B lead investors participated in Monte Carlo&#8217;s Series C, joined by Salesforce Ventures, a new investor in the company.</p>
<p>The company declined to share what it is now worth, but did tell TechCrunch that it is now worth 4x its previous valuation. Given that the company&#8217;s Series B likely sold for between 15% and 25% of the company, valuing it somewhere around the $100 million to $175 million range, we can infer a new valuation range of around $400 million to $700 million from its new investment. That&#8217;s back-of-the-envelope math, but it&#8217;s the best we can do.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190189" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190189" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190189 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png" alt="" width="1600" height="802" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=1536,770 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190189" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Monte Carlo. Shared as too often we cover enterprise software from a purely textual perspective. Here&#8217;s what it looks like!</p></div></p>
<p>In slightly more concrete terms, Monte Carlo told TechCrunch that it doubled its ARR in each of the last four quarters, or that it scaled its annual recurring revenue by around 8x from the one-year period between &#8220;summer 2020 [and] summer 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given its growth rate, it&#8217;s not hard to see how the startup managed to put together another round of capital.</p>
<p>However, as is common with young tech companies raising rapid-fire rounds of capital these days, Monte Carlo did not need the money. According to Monte Carlo co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/BM_DataDowntime">Barr Moses</a>, she was on the receiving end of investor interest and still had the majority of her company&#8217;s Series B in the bank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Monte Carlo has raised $101 million to date, and, given Moses&#8217;s comment, has north of $70 million in cash on hand.</p>
<p>Given the company&#8217;s dearth of impending cash-flow issues, we asked Moses why she raised more capital. She said that Monte Carlo is perceived as a market leader in its category and that she wants to build the biggest company that she can. Monte Carlo wants to pull on all available levers, she explained; with the new capital, it&#8217;s going to hire more folks, build more product, support more use cases and take on new markets.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s market is growing in tandem with the larger world of big data and data-focused analysis. More simply, Monte Carlo sits upstream from data lakes and the analytical tools that data scientists use to extract insights from reams of information.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch noted at the time of the company&#8217;s Series B, by monitoring data ingestion for its customers, Monte Carlo can prevent crunched data from being skewed due to inbound issues. Its software can detect various divergences from historical patterns, for example, alerting customers to which of their inbound data sources could be providing faulty information.</p>
<p>If we think of data science as a steering wheel of sorts, data observability is the work of keeping the car&#8217;s windshield clear. That way when you steer, you aren&#8217;t accidentally driving in the wrong direction. Into a wall, for example. Sure, it&#8217;s not a perfect analogy, but it&#8217;s workable.</p>
<p>Widening our lens, Monte Carlo is a good example of the current startup fundraising market. When an upstart technology company can demonstrate rapid growth, investors are willing to fund it far in advance of its needs, hoping to secure a share of its future success as early as possible. This practice goes against old-fashioned venture capital thought, in which too much capital was believed to engender focus risks. Excess capital for investment has shaken up venture logic, or at least venture behavior.</p>
<p>Regardless, the market for analytical work in the data world has proved to be a simply massive market. Databricks&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">latest valuation underscores that fact</a>.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo is riding a similar wave. Expect to hear from the company again in early 2022 if it keeps its growth rate even close to what it managed in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> acquired <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> at the end of last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">for almost $28 billion</a>, you had to figure that they had some big plans for the company, and today the CRM giant announced some initial integrations that should prove useful for Salesforce customers.</p>
<p>Rob Seaman, SVP for Slack at Salesforce sees Slack as the communications platform for Salesforce moving forward. &#8220;We really want Slack to be the primary engagement surface for our users, their communications, their work, their workflows and the processes and the apps they support,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re announcing are these new capabilities to support that Slack vision for sales, service, marketing and analytics. And for each of those areas what we&#8217;re doing is a combination of articulating, both in best practices and codifying, how you can and should model your sales, service and marketing organizations in this new world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The hope is that by taking advantage of Slack&#8217;s ability to integrate external enterprise apps inside the application, working together they can find ways to speed up and automate various Salesforce tasks, making it faster and easier to use without switching context to make it happen.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lPeaQkvo6f"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=lPeaQkvo6f" data-secret="lPeaQkvo6f" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For starters, the Sales Cloud gets dedicated deal rooms, where all of the parties involved in a complex sale, whether internal departments like finance and product people or external partners, can come together in Slack throughout the sales cycle and stay on top of the ebb and flow of all the sales activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the deal room is an expression of an opportunity from Salesforce into Slack in a way that makes it very simple to connect with everybody to effectively get a deal done, including customers and partners,&#8221; Seaman explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s where Slack Connect is extremely powerful [to connect with external partners]. We think we should be able to dramatically reduce sales cycle lengths as a result of this…&#8221; he said. Slack Connect is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/slack-announces-connect-an-improved-way-for-companies-to-talk-to-one-another/">the service introduced last year</a> that enables Slack users to connect with people outside of a company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition, through integrations members of the sales team involved in a more complex deal can get daily updates, which are automatically pulled together in Slack and include personalized daily task lists, meetings and priority deals.</p>
<p>Service teams can meet together in a room Salesforce is calling a swarm, a place for the team to help one another with specific questions or problems they may be having. In a company with a large product catalogue this could be particularly helpful to get an answer quickly. While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/salesforce-update-brings-ai-and-quip-to-customer-service-chat-experience/">Einstein recommendations</a> helps with related content, a swarm can come in handy when there is a more specific question involved and a human with that knowledge may be just the ticket. Service team members will also be able to search for experts to invite to the swarm, who may be able to help answer the question or solve the problem more quickly.</p>
<p>Not to be left out, marketing gets intelligent insights delivered with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-salesforce-com-m-a-datorama/salesforce-agrees-to-acquire-datorama-idUSKBN1K61U5">the help of Datorama</a>, the company Salesforce bought in 2018. Marketers also get regular updates inside of Slack when a change is made to a marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Finally there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/">integrations with Tableau</a>, the company that Salesforce bought in 2019 for $15.7 billion &#8212; Salesforce is a highly acquisitive company. In a similar way that marketers get updates to campaigns, other users can get Slack updates whenever data they consider important gets updated in Tableau, and they can also get daily digests of key metrics that matter to them right in Slack.</p>
<p>Seaman promised that these announcements were just the start, and we will be hearing about more integrations with Slack at the Dreamforce customer conference next month &#8212; and in the coming months. &#8220;This is just the beginning, and so you&#8217;ll continue to see expansion of the integrations between Salesforce and Slack for the four areas that we&#8217;re announcing today around sales, service, marketing and analytics, but also every single cloud and industry solution in [the] Salesforce [family of products] is working on this,&#8221; he said.</p>
