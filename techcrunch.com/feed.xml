<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity <del>Monday</del> Tuesday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>We are back from a long weekend here in America. But not break here in the States can stop the flow of global tech news. So, here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Weekend: </strong>Tata <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-tata-buys-majority-stake-online-grocer-bigbasket-2021-05-28/">bought BigBasket</a>, setting up a fascinating ecommerce war in India. China is cracking down on edtech companies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-30/china-wrecks-ipo-plans-for-high-flying-online-education-startups">leading to an IPO freeze</a>. And Wejo is going public via a SPAC. You can read its investor deck <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822888/000110465921074623/tm2117781d2_425seq1.htm">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>This Morning:</strong> The are a zillion funding rounds in Europe and globally this morning, the start of what could be a super busy week&#8217;s cycle. Private Equity is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">buying Cloudera</a>, which is a surprise. Nio had chip shortage issues that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/chinas-xpeng-motors-ev-deliveries-accelerate-and-nio-declines-in-may-.html">impacted its delivery cadence</a>. The Chinese EV company does expect to meet its Q2 delivery goal, however.</li>
<li><strong>Funding Rounds:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/truebill-raises-45-million-for-its-personal-finance-app/">Truebill raised $45 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/">Chipper Cash raised $100 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/singapore-based-d2c-dental-brand-zenyum-raises-40m-series-b-from-l-catterton-sequoia-india-and-other-investors/">Zenyum raised $40 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">WeFox raised $650 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">Malt raised $97 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-80m-at-a-1b-valuation/">Sennder raised $80 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/brazils-idwall-raises-38m-for-identity-validation-platform/">idwall raised $38 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/belvo-latams-answer-to-plaid-raises-43m-series-a-to-scale-its-api-for-financial-services/">Belvo raised $43 million</a>. And that was not even close to all the big ones.</li>
<li><strong>Riff:</strong> Late last week we missed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1569345/000119312521177215/d58050ds1.htm">the Sprinklr filing</a>. You can read it here. Quite a number of VCs have money riding on the IPO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Welcome back, America, to the week. It&#8217;s nice to see you, everyone else. Maybe Robinhood will file this week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With COVID-19 restrictions lifting and employees starting to make their way back into offices, hackers are being forced to change tack. While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/remote-work/">remote workers</a> have been scammers’ main target for the past 18 months due to the mass shift to home working necessitated by the pandemic, a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> campaign is attempting to exploit those who have started to return to the physical workplace.</p>
<p>The email-based campaign, <a href="https://cofense.com/blog/phishing-credentials-covid/">observed by Cofense</a>, is targeting employees with emails purporting to come from their CIO welcoming them back into offices.</p>
<p>The email looks legitimate enough, sporting the company’s official logo in the header, as well as being signed spoofing the CIO. The bulk of the message outlines the new precautions and changes to business operations the company is taking relative to the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If an employee were to be fooled by the email, they would be redirected to what appears to be a Microsoft SharePoint page hosting two company-branded documents. “When interacting with these documents, it becomes apparent that they are not authentic and instead are phishing mechanisms to garner account credentials,” explains Dylan Main, threat analyst at Cofense&#8217;s Phishing Defense Center.</p>
<p>However, if a victim decides to interact with either document, a login panel appears and prompts the recipient to provide login credentials to access the files.</p>
<p>“This is uncommon among most Microsoft phishing pages where the tactic of spoofing the Microsoft login screen opens an authenticator panel,” Main continued. “By giving the files the appearance of being real and not redirecting to another login page, the user may be more likely to supply their credentials in order to view the updates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another technique the hackers are employing is the use of fake validated credentials. The first few times login information is entered into the panel, the result will be the error message that states: “Your account or password is incorrect.”</p>
<p>“After entering login information a few times, the employee will be redirected to an actual Microsoft page,” Main says. “This gives the appearance that the login information was correct, and the employee now has access to the OneDrive documents. In reality, the threat actor now has full access to the account owner’s information.”</p>
<p>While this is one of the first campaigns that’s been observed targeting employees returning to the workplace (Check Point researchers uncovered another <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/06/25/as-organizations-get-back-to-business-cyber-criminals-look-for-new-angles-to-exploit/">last year</a>), it’s unlikely to be the last. Both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/google-campuses-reopening-covid-19/">Google</a> and Microsoft, for example, have started welcoming staff back to office cubicles, and the majority of executives expect that at least 50% of employees will be back working in the office by July, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/us-remote-work-survey.html">PwC study</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw threat actors follow the trends throughout the pandemic, and we expect they are likely to leverage themes of returning to work in their attacks in the coming months,&#8221; Tonia Dudley, a strategic advisor at Cofense, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We can expect remote workers to continue to be targeted as well. While employers begin to bring staff back to the office, it’s likely we’ll see a hybrid model of work moving forward. Both groups will be targets for phishing attacks.”</p>
<p>Threat actors typically adapt to exploit the global environment. Just as the shift to mass working over remote connections led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/what-you-need-to-know-about-covid-19-related-cyberattacks/">an increase in the number of attacks attempting to exploit remote login credentials</a>, it&#8217;s likely the number of attacks targeting on-premise networks and office-based workers will continue to grow over the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The cybersecurity industry has no shortage of technology to fight against network intruders, app corrupters, email hackers and other cyber criminals. Today a startup called <a href="http://redacted.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redacted</a> is coming out of stealth with a different approach to tackling malicious activity &#8212; it applies threat intelligence, and then proactively goes after the hackers to recover data loss and disrupt their activities announcing some funding to build out its business &#8212; and announcing $35 million in funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p>The Series B is being led by Ten Eleven Ventures, with participation from Valor Equity Partners and SVB Capital. (Ten Eleven is a VC specializing on cybersecurity that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/cyware-nabs-30m-to-help-organizations-detect-and-stop-advanced-cyber-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed a number of other startups</a>.) It brings the total raised by Redacted &#8212; which it specifically styles &#8220;[redacted]&#8221;&#8230;with brackets &#8212; to $60 million.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always interesting when a startup comes out of nowhere with a substantial about of VC backing, but it&#8217;s almost always because that startup has some interesting pedigree, and that is the case here. The company is led by Max Kelly, who was previously the chief security officer at Facebook and before that held roles at the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command. His co-founder, John Hering, was the founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Lookout. The startup is populated out with a bigger team that the startup likes to say has &#8220;more than 300 years of combined experience&#8221; in cyber defense with experience at Facebook, Amazon, NASA JPL, Symantec, Cisco, FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, Army, Air Force, Navy, US Marine Corps, US Cyber Command, the UK’s GCHQ.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I&#8217;d actually heard about the company before &#8212; it works with another cyber startup I&#8217;ve covered called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/cado-security-locks-in-10m-for-its-cloud-native-digital-forensics-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cado</a>, which provides cyber forensics tools to Redacted (among others) &#8212; but when I mentioned I&#8217;d heard of the company previously, they suggested it was because I&#8217;d covered Ocado and its move into the U.S. market, so while Redacted is not particularly forthcoming about its customers, I guess that this grocery giant might be one of them.</p>
<p>The core of what Redacted does comes out of direct experience that Kelly said he had while working at Facebook, where he both built in-house threat response tools but also worked with third-party vendors to secure the social networking giant&#8217;s systems, employees and users.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big focus of the industry in last 10 years was preventing the breach,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;But that was always a lie. There is nothing you can do to prevent a breach. The point is not to prevent the breach but the damage from it. Make sure people can’t get data out, and if they do, make sure you can get it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was also the issue of the size of Facebook itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn’t buy any security tools that worked because of the scale of the company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we thought about it and decided that the best approach would be to ask who is doing this, get them to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an environment where cybercrime has taken on the profile of some of the most advanced innovations in technology, with both bad actors and security apps and services leaning on artificial intelligence and automation to do their work, it sounds almost too human an approach. But from how Kelly describes it, it sounds like there is a very human face to cybercrime, and the mere fact of identifying bad actors can get them to retreat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a highly technical operation: the startup has also built tools, with some of its own tech and leaning on tech built by others, to find patterns in the work that cybercriminals do and eventually track them to where they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they’re in a place where they can be touched by law enforcement, that can be used to get them to stop,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But if not, then it’s just the awareness that they’d been seen and that generally causes them to retreat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mix of what Redacted has built to date, he says, is being aimed at smaller, mid-sized and slightly larger corporates, particularly those that are not capable of building tools like this themselves.</p>
<p>The name, meanwhile, in my opinion says something about the nimble, but also very focused, approach the startup is taking. It comes from a period when the company hadn&#8217;t yet come up with a name for itself but was already operating commercially while in stealth mode (which actually is very standard among cybersecurity startups, I&#8217;ve found, who don&#8217;t really want a lot of attention for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>&#8220;We used it as a placeholder, but I realized, as I talked to people, that they were using the name &#8220;Redacted&#8221; when referring to us,&#8221; Kelly said. He looked up redacted.com and saw it was available. &#8220;It was the universe telling me to use the name,&#8221; he said with a little smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the industry’s most advanced pursuit capabilities, Redacted has the power to teach attackers that companies will hold them accountable for attacks,&#8221; said Alex Doll, founder and managing general partner at Ten Eleven Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Redacted&#8217;s cloud-native security platform also enables them to protect and defend companies that run their operations within a modern cloud architecture. Together, these features enable [redacted] to offer the most holistic and proactive security solution for companies in today’s elevated threat environment.” Doll is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cloudera.com">Cloudera</a> was once one of the hottest Hadoop startups, but over time the shine has come off that market, and today it went private as KKR and Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, a pair of private equity firms announced they intended to purchase Cloudera for $5.3 billion. The company has a market cap of around $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>Cloudera and Hortonworks, two key startups in the Hadoop space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/cloudera-and-hortonworks-announce-5-2-billion-merger/">merged in 2018 for $5.2 billion.</a>Cloudera was likely under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who took <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/08/12/activist-investor-carl-icahn-shakes-cloudera/">an 18% stake in the company</a> in 2019 and now stands to gain from the sale, which the company stated represented a 24% premium for shareholders at $16 a share. Prior to the market opening this morning, the stock was sitting at $12.86.</p>
<p>Back in the day, about a decade ago, when Hadoop was <em>the way</em> to process big data, venture money was pouring into the space. Over time it lost some of its glow. That&#8217;s because it was highly labor intensive, and companies began moving to the cloud and looking at software services that did more of the work for them. More modern technologies like data lakes began replacing it and the company recognized that it must change its approach to survive in the modern data processing marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Cloudera CEO Rob Bearden sees the transaction as a way to do just that. &#8220;We believe that as a private company with the expertise and support of experienced investors such as CD&amp;R and KKR, Cloudera will have the resources and flexibility to drive product-led growth and expand our addressable market opportunity,&#8221; Bearden said in a statement.</p>
<p>While there is a lot of executive jargon in that statement, it basically means that the company hopes that these private equity firms can give it some additional financial resources to move towards a more modern approach for processing large amounts of data.</p>
<p>While it was at it, Cloudera also announced a couple of acquisitions of its own to help it move towards that modernization goal. For starters it grabbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/datacoral-raises-10m-series-a-for-its-data-infrastructure-service/">Datacoral</a>, a startup that abstracts away the infrastructure needed to build a data pipeline without using code. It also acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cazena/">Cazena</a>, a startup that helps customers build cloud data lakes, giving the company a more modern approach to processing big data.  Bearden sees both of these services helping Cloudera reposition itself in the big data self-service market</p>

<p>&#8220;Both businesses will enable our combined customers to enjoy a reduction in complexity and faster time to value for their data initiatives, leading to improved insights, faster innovation, and stronger engagements with their customers and partners,&#8221; Bearden said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cloudera <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/cloudera-finishes-up-20-in-stock-market-debut/">went public in 2018</a>, closing at $18.09 a share after raising a $1 billion. The vast majority of that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/31/intel-pours-740m-into-cloudera-in-exchange-for-an-18-stake/">a $740 million investment from Intel Capital</a> in 2014.</p>
<p>Hortonworks raised another $248 million. A third Hadoop startup, MapR raised $280 million. The company&#8217;s assets were sold rather unceremoniously <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/hp-enterprise-buys-assets-of-ai-startup-mapr-51565028280">to HPE in 2019</a> for a price pegged at under $50 million, showing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/with-mapr-fire-sale-hadoops-promise-has-fallen-on-hard-times/">just how far the market has fallen</a> since its earlier glory days.</p>
<p>The Cloudera deal includes a brief &#8220;go shop&#8221; provision that allows it continue to look for a better deal. It&#8217;s doubtful it will find one, and if it doesn&#8217;t the transaction with KKR and CD&amp;R is expected to close in the second half of this year subject to typical regulatory review. The company will announce earnings later today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just about every week there’s a blockbuster round coming out of South America, but in certain countries such as Ecuador, things have been more hush hush. However, </span><a href="https://kushkipagos.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kushki</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Quito-based fintech, is bringing attention to the region with today’s announcement of a $86 million Series B and a $600 million valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We never thought that we would return home [from the U.S.] and build a company that was more valuable in Ecuador than we had built in the U.S.,” said Aron Schwarzkopf, CEO and co-founder of Kushki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwarzkopf and his business partner, Sebastián Castro, had previously built and sold a fintech called Leaf in the U.S. in 2014. The two are originally from Ecuador but moved to Boston for college, where they met watching soccer.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike many other fintechs in Latam that are out to help the unbanked, Kushki works behind the scenes building the tech infrastructure that companies like Nubank use to transfer money. Some of the functionalities they build enable both local and cross-border payment players in credit and debit cards, bank transfers, digital cash, mobile wallets, and other alternative payment methods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized there was a gigantic opportunity to democratize and create infrastructure to move money,” Schwarzkopf told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which was founded in 2017, already has operations in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. The Series B will be used to accelerate growth and expand to Brazil and nine other markets in Central America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, expanding to Brazil is an expensive proposition, and therefore not a path that all companies can take, even though it can be an extremely profitable move if done right. Some of the challenges include the need to translate everything into Portuguese followed by the varying financial regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Kushki’s approach has to be somewhat custom in each country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focus on going into the markets and we basically rebuild an entire infrastructure, so we put everything into one API,” said Schwarzkopf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Products similar to Kushki have been successful in other regions around the world, such as in India with </span><a href="https://www.pinelabs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pine Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Africa with </span><a href="https://flutterwave.com/us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.checkout.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checkout.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that now has 15 international offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build all this infrastructure, Kushki, which means “cash” in a native Andes dialect, has raised a total of $100 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from SoftBank, an undisclosed global growth equity firm, as well as previous investors including DILA Capital, Kaszek Ventures, Clocktower Ventures, and Magma Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From now until 2060, people will need servers and ways to move money, and we knew that the existing payment infrastructure couldn’t support that,” said Schwarzkopf.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A technical system underpinning the European Union&#8217;s plan for a pan-EU &#8216;digital pass&#8217; for verifying COVID-19 vaccination or test status across the region has gone live today, with a handful of EU Member States connected to the gateway and more expected to follow ahead of a July 1 full launch.</p>
<p>The idea for the EU&#8217;s COVID-19 digital certificate is to offer a single system for securely verifying EU citizens&#8217; COVID-19 status &#8212; whether vaccination; a recent negative test; or proof of recovery from the virus &#8212; as they cross borders within the bloc to help facilitate safer travel.</p>
<p>The digital pass relies upon QR codes and digital signatures &#8212; verified using public key cryptography &#8212; to prevent falsification. Paper-based certificates can also be used by those who do have access to a device.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Member States that have passed technical tests and are ready to do so can start issuing and verifying certificates on a voluntary basis, the Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2721">said today</a> &#8212; with seven countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Croatia and Poland) intending to do so at this point.</p>
<p>Other countries have decided to launch the EU Digital COVID Certificate only when all functions are deployed nationwide, it added. Further details about Member States&#8217; status on activating the system are available via <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en">this webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Since 10 May, 22 EU countries have tested the gateway successfully, according to the Commission, which wants maximum update of the system by 1 July &#8212; when the associated regulation will apply.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s allowed a &#8220;phasing-in period&#8221; of six weeks for the issuance of certificates for Member States that need additional time to get everything hooked up. That means it&#8217;s possible the tardiest implementations could happen when summer is all but over. (An earlier goal of EU lawmakers that everything would be up and running everywhere by June always looked ambitious.)</p>
<p>The Commission says no personal data is &#8220;exchanged or retained&#8221; during the COVID-19 digital certificate verification process, noting that the signature keys for the verification are stored on servers at a national level. These keys can be accessed &#8212; via the gateway &#8212; by national verification apps or systems all across the EU.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s rush for a COVID-19 &#8216;digital pass&#8217; stirs concerns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/europes-rush-for-a-covid-19-digital-pass-stirs-concerns/embed/#?secret=AdMAkgSVK0" data-secret="AdMAkgSVK0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Commission has also developed reference software and apps for the issuance, storage and verification of certificates &#8212; which it&#8217;s published on <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates">GitHub</a> &#8212; to support the rollout by EU Member States. The Commission said 12 Member States have made use of this code so far.</p>
<p>National authorities in respective EU countries are in charge of issuing the COVID-19 digital certificate to individuals &#8212; with various potential routes for citizens to obtain one, such as from a COVID-19 test centre or from their local health authority or directly via a national eHealth portal.</p>
<p>Commenting on the gateway launch in a statement, Stella Kyriakides, the EU&#8217;s commissioner for health and food safety, urged Member States to get on and complete their implementations.</p>
<p>“The EU Digital COVID Certificate shows the value added of effective e-health solutions for our citizens,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is important that during the coming weeks, all Member States fully finalise their national systems to issue, store and verify certificates, so the system is functioning in time for the holiday season. EU citizens are looking forward to travelling again, and they want to do so safely. Having an EU certificate is a crucial step on the way.”</p>
<p>Also touching on the COVID-19 digital certification launch today, Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the system will only be in place for one year &#8212; presumably that&#8217;s assuming the pandemic is actually over by summer 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU certificate is a prime example of digital tools that represent our values,&#8221; she said, in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_2804">speech</a> addressing the 2021 Digital Assembly. &#8220;The EU values privacy. No personal data will be exchanged or retained. The EU is inclusive. Whoever is not vaccinated, can get a digital certificate for test or recovery. Whoever does not have a smartphone, can get it on paper. With the certificate, we want to help people to move freely in times of pandemic. This is why it will only be in place for one year. Europe is a front-runner here and can set standards at the global level.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the speech, the Commission&#8217;s president also trailed another incoming digital proposal which she said would provide Europeans with a trusted online ID they could use to interact with regional governments and businesses without being forced to hand over more data than is strictly necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to offer to Europeans a new digital identity. An identity that ensures trust and protects users online. We are about to present our proposal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It will allow everyone to control their identity online, and to interact with governments and businesses, across the EU. Nobody should be forced to give more data away, than is necessary for the purpose at hand. To book a hotel room online, no-one needs to know where I am from and who my friends are. With our proposal, we are offering an alternative to the models of big online platforms. We believe in a human-centred digital transition.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Personal finance startup <a href="https://www.truebill.com">Truebill</a> has raised a $45 million Series D funding round led by Accel. This comes just a few months after the company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/truebill-series-c/">$17 million Series C</a>. Overall, the startup has raised $85 million since its creation.</p>
<p>Existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Cota Capital and Eldridge Industries are also participating in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>Truebill offers several tools to help people living in the U.S. take control of their finances. One of the app’s key features is that you can track all your subscriptions in one place. Users can also cancel unwanted subscriptions. For cell phone and cable bills, Truebill can negotiate a discount for you.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More recently, the startup has been adding features to turn the app into a financial companion. You can see spending insights, create a healthy monthly budget and track it from the app, view your credit reports and more.</p>
<p>Truebill also lets you put some money aside automatically. The company analyzes your accounts to save some money when you have some money left.</p>
<p>Now, the company is working on a wealth management dashboard that centralizes all your assets and debt. Wealth management is a bit tedious as you need to connect to every single pocket of money otherwise you don’t see the full picture.</p>
<p>“More than 10,000 members sign up for Truebill every day seeking to better understand and improve their finances,” co-founder and CEO Haroon Mokhtarzada said in a statement. &quot;With this new capital, we’re transforming Truebill into an all-in-one, holistic platform that makes it easy for members to not only manage subscriptions and spending but also optimize their savings and make informed decisions to improve their financial health. Truebill is rapidly becoming the most valuable financial membership for everyday consumers.”</p>
<p>As you can see, the startup is growing at a rapid pace. The user base has doubled from 1 million to 2 million users since November 2020. The company analyzes $40 billion in monthly transaction volume.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://belvo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belvo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Latin American startup which has built an open finance API platform, announced today it has raised $43 million in a Series A round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mix of Silicon Valley and Latin American-based VC firms and angels participated in the financing including Future Positive, Kibo Ventures, FJ Labs, Kaszek, MAYA Capital, Venture Friends, Rappi co-founder and president Sebastián Mejía (Rappi), Harsh Sinha, CTO of Wise (formerly Transferwise) and Nubank CEO and founder David Vélez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing Crunchbase data, Belvo believes the round represents the largest series A ever raised by a Latin American fintech. In May 2020, Belvo raised a $10 million seed round c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o-led by Silicon Valley’s Founders Fund and Argentina’s Kaszek</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Belvo scores $10M from Founders Fund and Kaszek to scale its API for financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/belvo-scores-10m-from-founders-fund-and-kaszek-to-scale-its-api-for-financial-services/embed/#?secret=3P9CFzyEth" data-secret="3P9CFzyEth" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belvo aims to work with leading fintechs in Latin America, spanning across verticals like the neobanks, credit providers and personal finance products Latin Americans use every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s goal with its developer-first API platform that can be used to access and interpret end-user financial data is to build better, more efficient and more inclusive financial products in Latin America. Developers of popular neobank apps, credit providers and personal finance tools use Belvo’s API to connect bank accounts to their apps to unlock the power of open banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As TechCrunch Senior Editor Alex Wilhelm explained in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, Belvo </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">might be considered similar to U.S.-based Plaid, but more attuned to the Latin American market so it can take in a more diverse set of data to better meet the needs of the various markets it serves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So while Belvo’s goals are “similar to the overarching goal[s] of Plaid,” co-founder and co-CEO Pablo Viguera told TechCrunch that Belvo is not merely building a banking API business hoping to connect apps to financial accounts. Instead, Belvo wants to build a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">finance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> API, which takes in more information than is normally collected by such systems. Latin America is massively underbanked and unbanked so the more data from more sources, the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In essence, we’re pushing for similar outcomes [as Plaid] in terms of when you think about open banking or open finance,” Viguera said. “We’re working to democratize access to financial data and empower end users to port that data, and share that data with whoever they want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company operates under the premise that just because a significant number of the region’s population is underbanked doesn’t mean that they aren’t still financially active. Belvo’s goal is to link all sorts of accounts together. For example, Viguera told TechCrunch that some gig-economy companies in Latin America are issuing their own cards that allow workers to cash out at small local shops. In time, all those transactions are data that could be linked up using Belvo, casting a far wider net than what we’re used to domestically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s work to connect banks and non-banks together is key to the company’s goal of allowing “any fintech or any developer to access and interpret user financial data,” according to Viguera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viguera and co-CEO Oriol Tintoré founded in May of 2019, and was part of Y Combinator’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winter 2020 batch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Since launching its platform last year, the company says it has built a customer base of over 60 companies across Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, handling millions of monthly API calls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is important because as Alex noted last year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to other players in the API-space, Belvo charges for each API call that its customers use (in this sense, it has a model similar to Twilio’s). </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159187" style="width: 651px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159187" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2159187" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oriol_Tintore_Pablo_Viguera_Belvo.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="641" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oriol_Tintore_Pablo_Viguera_Belvo.jpg 1466w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oriol_Tintore_Pablo_Viguera_Belvo.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oriol_Tintore_Pablo_Viguera_Belvo.jpg?resize=300,235 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oriol_Tintore_Pablo_Viguera_Belvo.jpg?resize=768,601 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oriol_Tintore_Pablo_Viguera_Belvo.jpg?resize=680,532 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oriol_Tintore_Pablo_Viguera_Belvo.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159187" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Co-founders and co-CEOs Oriol Tintore and Pablo Viguera / Belvo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, over the past year, Belvo says it expanded its API coverage to over 40 financial institutions, which gives companies the ability to connect to over 90% of personal and business bank accounts in LatAm, as well as to tax authorities (such as the SAT in Mexico) and gig economy platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Essentially we take unstructured financial data , which an individual might have outside of a bank such as integrations we have with gig economy platforms such as Uber and Rappi. We can take a driver’s information from their Uber app, which is kind of built like a bank app and turn it into meaningful bank-like info which third parties can leverage to make assessments as if it’s data coming from a bank,” Viguera explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to scale its product offering, continue expanding its geographic footprint and double its current headcount of 70. Specifically, Belvo plans to hire more than 50 engineers in Mexico and Brazil by year’s end. It currently has offices in Mexico City, São Paulo, and Barcelona. The company also aims to  launch its bank-to-bank payment initiation offering in Mexico and Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belvo currently operates in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s seeing “a lot of opportunity” in other markets in Latin America, especially in Chile, Peru and Argentina, Viguera told TechCrunch. “In due course, we will look to pursue expansion there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fred Blackford, founding partner of Future Positive, believes Belvo represents a “truly transformational opportunity for the region’s financial sector.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicolás Szekasy, co-founder and managing partner of Kaszek, noted that demand for financial services in Latin America is growing at an exponential rate .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Belvo is developing the infrastructure that will enable both the larger institutions and the emerging generation of younger players to successfully deploy their solutions,” he said. “ Oriol, Pablo, and the Belvo team have been leading the development of a sophisticated platform that resolves very complex technical challenges, and the company’s exponential growth reflects how it is delivering a product that fits perfectly with the requirements of the market.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online fraud and identity theft is a global problem that has only been exacerbated with increased online transactions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it is estimated that Brazilian companies lose over $41 billion due to fraud every year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to tackle this problem head on, Lincoln Ando and Raphael Melo started idwall in mid-2016. São Paulo-based idwall started as an automated background check solution and has since grown into a suite of data and identity validation and risk analysis products. For the consumer market, its &#8220;MeuID&#8221; app is aimed at users who want to change the way they identify themselves and share their data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now the Brazilian regtech has raised $38 million in a Series C round led by Endurance.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GGV Capital, monashees, Canary, Qualcomm Ventures LLC, ONEVC, Peninsula and Norte also participated in the funding, bringing its total raised to nearly $50 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has grown 1,458% between 2017 and 2020, with average growth of 144% per year. Its more than 300 clients include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 unicorns, two out of the three biggest banks in Brazil and companies such as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> iFood, Claro, Cielo, Loggi, Ebanx, QuintoAndar and OLX, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs make up a significant portion of its client base, and in 2020, the company saw its revenue from clients in the financial industry alone climb by 588% compared to 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idwall uses machine learning and AI to automate the onboarding process via its face match, background check, risk analysis, ID validation and automated optical character recognition (OCR) offerings to help companies avoid fraud.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fraud prevention platform Sift raises $50M at over $1B valuation, eyes acquisitions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/fraud-prevention-platform-sift-raises-50m-at-over-1b-valuation-eyes-acquisitions/embed/#?secret=4XrGyLD3Sy" data-secret="4XrGyLD3Sy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said its APIs verify personal documents and information by searching in public and private databases “quickly and pursuant to the compliance rules.” Idwall does all this by first validating that an ID is authentic. Then it works to ensure the person using it is actually the owner of the ID. And lastly, it runs a full background check. It claims it does all this in less than three minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help them do all these onboarding processes in a safer, better and faster way,” said idwall co-founder and CEO Ando.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, idwall has generated more than 65 million data reports for its clients, a number that it says surged by 5,000 times between 2017 and 2020.Those reports, it claims, have helped its clients scale their operations, register more of their own clients and optimize compliance and KYC processes, as well as reduce fraud.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159094" style="width: 693px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159094" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2159094" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9326-idwall.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="683" height="455" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9326-idwall.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9326-idwall.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9326-idwall.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9326-idwall.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9326-idwall.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9326-idwall.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9326-idwall.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9326-idwall.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159094" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> idwall</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the pandemic’s drive to digital led to a massive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increase in the number of digital bank accounts, mobile payment services and also of companies adjusting to digital platforms and/or expanding their digital operations &#8212; leading to a boom in business for idwall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more digitized companies become, the more client expectations grow — and market competition grows stronger,” Ando said. “Our mission is to always stay ahead of innovation in our market, and that’s why we invest so much in growth and in building the best possible team to develop our products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of that includes using its new capital to recruit more developers, strengthen its existing products and release new ones. Idwall plans to increase its headcount from its current 200 to about 300 over the next few months. The company is also examining the possibility of expanding outside of Brazil to all of Latin America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of the identity validation and fraud problems faced in Brazil are seen in other Latin American countries as well,” Ando said. “Besides, places like Mexico and Colombia also have highly innovative companies pushing the envelope when it comes to identity and technology. We still have a lot to achieve in Brazil, but we see a big opportunity for us to take our mission even further.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, in its home country, recent regulatory changes in Brazil in recent years have also led to an increase in demand for idwall’s offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Brazil’s documentation databases are highly siloed, the company says, with each state having its own model for the most common identity document, the RG (“Registro Geral” or “General Registry”). Plus, each citizen can be issued a different RG document in each state.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Brazil’s Roaring 20s see the rise of early-stage startups?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/will-brazils-roaring-20s-see-the-rise-of-early-stage-startups/embed/#?secret=yBHmKyeFXR" data-secret="yBHmKyeFXR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s undeniable how much digital onboarding and automated identity validation processes are fundamental for the Latin American market to reach as far as it has the potential to,” Ando said. “It’s extremely difficult to understand and validate identification and personal data in Brazil.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in general, the company has observed how weary Brazilians are of having to show their IDs for routine events. Idwall helps with that via its aforementioned “MeuID” solution, which stores in a single wallet all the documents necessary for the onboarding processes of fintechs, startups, office buildings and other businesses.</span></p>
<p>Its investors are, naturally, bullish.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hans Tung, GGV Capital’s managing partner, said his firm </span>aims to invest in category leaders that are using technology to create positive impact for its users and for society.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He describes idwall as a “one-of-a-kind” startup. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The idwall founders are tackling a huge yet underserved problem in Brazil, and have led the company through terrific growth,&#8221; Tung told TechCrunch. &#8220;They have the ingredients to become the leading personal data platform in LatAm for the enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marcos Toledo, managing partner at Canary, notes that idwall was one of his firm&#8217;s first investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lincoln and Raphael&#8217;s abilities to build and scale a business solving a very relevant problem in Brazil have caught our attention,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Their culture, tech level and agility as a company also are very remarkable in the Brazilian market.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When two of Indonesia&#8217;s biggest companies &#8212; ride-hailing company Gojek and e-commerce marketplace Tokopedia &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/">joined forces</a> as GoTo Group last month, a key highlight from the merger was that the last-mile delivery space is still a huge global trend</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, the e-commerce and last-mile delivery market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is projected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be worth over $20 billion in the next five years. Big players like Jumia have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">considerable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market share yet smaller platforms are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carving out theirs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of such is ride-hailing-turned-logistics company <a href="https://www.gokada.ng/">Gokada</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/24/nigerias-gokada-raises-5-3m-round-for-its-motorcycle-ride-hail-biz/">Gokada launched</a> in 2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a ride-hailing company in Lagos, Nigeria. But i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n 2020, Gokada began offering logistics (Gsend) and food delivery services (GShop) after a ride-hailing ban by the Lagos State government affected its operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company is combining all these services (which have operated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">independently in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) into a single application.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In September and October, we launched GShop which is the food delivery platform for Gokada</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we realized from our customers was that while they were using the Gsend and GShop </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">separately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they came to us asking if we could put them together,&#8221; said Gokada CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/nikhilgoel91">Nikhil Goel</a> to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So doing this is more like a transition from other things we were doing and making it easier for our customers to have all our services in one platform and create a super app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gokada&#8217;s super app plans are coming off the back of an impressive year for the company despite a troubling first few months during the pandemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as February, the company downsized and <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/02/03/gokada-lays-off-staff/">laid off more than half its staff</a> after the ban on motorcycles in Lagos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pivoted to logistics and food delivery and hasn&#8217;t looked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past year, Gokada has crossed over $100 million in annualized transaction value. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has also helped more than 30,000 merchants on its platform to execute over 1 million food delivery and e-commerce orders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Before Gokada ventured into ride-hailing in Lagos, people questioned us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we entered the delivery space, it was the same question people asked. They said we didn&#8217;t have the experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But today, if you look at it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">critically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we&#8217;ve changed this market in a different manner,&#8221; Goel said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goel, who <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/03/17/gokada-announces-nikhil-goel-as-new-ceo/">took over the reins</a> at Gokada this March after founder Fahim Saleh </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-53420183"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tragically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-53420183"> passed on</a>, has been instrumental to the company&#8217;s impressive growth so far</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per information shared by Gokada, the company&#8217;s volume growth has increased 3x in the last six months while revenue increased 10x within the past year.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159332" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159332" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2159332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png?w=375" alt="Gokada" width="375" height="666" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gokada-Super-App1.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gokada</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before becoming CEO, Goel had three roles since joining the company in 2019 &#8212; VP of Rides, COO, and acting president. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he also co-founded Indian edtech startup Classplus and worked as a general manager at Indian food delivery giant Zomato</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His stint at Zomato and knowledge of the food-delivery and logistics space will be key to how Gokada pulls off its super app ambitions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gokada is only present in Lagos, the company is looking to launch its services across other cities including Abuja, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Ogun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And not only will the super app allow Gokada customers in these cities to access food delivery, e-commerce (medicines and groceries among other supplies), and logistics, but they will be able to use ride-hailing services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to start with neighbouring markets to Lagos &#8212; Ogun and Ibadan. In the latter, there&#8217;s already a ride-hailing platform in the form of SafeBoda. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which is present in Uganda and Nigeria, employs a super app model in the East African country but offers only ride-hailing services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Ibadan, the only Nigerian city where it operates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The motorcycle ride-hailing wars in Nigeria and Uganda are SafeBoda&#8217;s to lose&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/embed/#?secret=cJdFdWwlIL" data-secret="cJdFdWwlIL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For much of last year, SafeBoda has enjoyed dominance in the southwestern city but Gokada&#8217;s arrival, especially as it plans to offer other services, might threaten its commanding position</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started with its ride-hailing service in Lagos. We were mostly known as one of the pioneers of ride-hailing in Lagos before the ban. So far, we&#8217;ve not ventured outside Lagos, and the reason for that has been that we wanted to remain focused on our new business here. And it&#8217;s evident that when you move across Lagos, you will see our delivery bikes everywhere on the road. But ride-hailing will always stay with us wherever we go outside the city,&#8221; the CEO added. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gokada is in talks to secure operational licenses for ride-hailing but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has already acquired a NIPOST licence to mitigate future risks on the regulatory front</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow them to operate courier logistics services across the country.</span></p>
<p>While services in a super app can differ from one platform to another, payments is the defining functionality that ties those offerings together. For now, Gokada only provides a subset of that which is a wallet feature and a debit card option to pay for these services. On why this is the case, Goel said: &#8220;Before many of these companies like Grab and Gojek got into payments, they were providing other services. The idea for a super app is to provide customers with different services under one umbrella to ease their lives. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing but we&#8217;re open to a payments play in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other markets in Asia, Africa doesn&#8217;t have clear leaders in the super app race. Therefore, Gokada will join a growing <a href="https://techcabal.com/2020/08/21/factsheet-super-app-africa/">list of platforms</a> clamouring for supremacy in their respective markets, a spot OPay seemed to be gunning for before <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/07/02/opay-restructuring-plans/">shutting down its non-fintech verticals</a> last year to focus on its payment services. </span></p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/rise-of-digital-banks-in-indonesia-3-million-more-users-added-in-2020/">report by Momentum Works</a>, downloads of digital banking apps in Indonesia grew 7% in 2020, with apps from established banks like BTPN Jenius, OCBC Nyala and Permata leading. But Momentum Works also observed that “many Indonesian digital bank users tend to download multiple digital bank applications and explore around,” so a dominant player hasn’t emerged yet. Major tech companies like <a href="https://www.regulationasia.com/sea-group-to-establish-digital-banking-operations-in-indonesia/">Sea Group</a>, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Grab-and-others-see-big-chance-in-ASEAN-digital-banking">Grab</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/gojek-buys-slice-of-indonesian-bank-in-biggest-fintech-deal-yet">Gojek</a> are also working on their own neobank services.</p>
<p>Line <a href="https://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/global/2020/65">introduced banking services to its Thai users</a> last October, as part of a joint venture with Kasikorn Vision Company, a subsidiary of Kasikorn Bank. In Taiwan, its subsidiary Line Bank Taiwan was <a href="https://www.banking.gov.tw/en/home.jsp?id=30&amp;parentpath=0,3&amp;mcustomize=multimessage_view.jsp&amp;dataserno=202102240001&amp;dtable=News">granted a banking license</a> earlier this year by the Financial Supervisory Commission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freight forwarding &#8212; the process of organising how and where items will be shipped around the world, and specifically the technology that underpins that work &#8212; continues to be a huge area of the logistics market, not least because of the huge boom in e-commerce in the last year, and because of the Covid-19-mandated need to simply be more efficient in how things are being moved around. Today, one of the bigger players in that space is announcing more funding to capitalize on the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sennder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sennder</a>, a digital freight forwarder that focuses on moving cargo around Europe (and specifically focusing on trucks and &#8220;full truck load&#8221;, FTL, freight forwarding), has raised $80 million in funding, at a valuation that the company confirms is now over $1 billion.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based startup has been on something of a funding tear this year. In January, it announced a $160 million round, and this $80 million is closing out its Series D. Baillie Gifford has led this latest Series D extension, with Hedosophia, Accel, Lakestar, HV Capital, Project A and Scania all participating in the previous part of the Series D.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding makes Sennder, which has now raised some $350 million, one of the most well-funded of the freight forwarders, but it&#8217;s a hot area at the moment. Another player out of Europe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/zencargo-raises-42m-to-expand-its-digital-first-freight-forwarding-platform-internationally/">Zencargo, picked up $42 million</a> just last month. Other competitors include the likes of Flexport in the US.</p>
<p>Sennder is growing organically, but it&#8217;s also making some acquisitions to scale up &#8212; a mark not just of the activity in the market but also the fragmentation. In May, it <a href="https://www.sennder.com/press/sennder-acquires-dutch-based-cars-cargo-supplying-digital-offering-whilst-expanding-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired Cars&amp;Cargo</a> to give it a stronger presence in France and Benelux. Other companies that it has acquired have included Uber Freight Europe and Everoad in 2020, and it also operates a JV with Poste Italiane, Italy&#8217;s postal service. Altogether it now has eight hubs in Europe.</p>
<p>The plan will be to make more acquisitions of this kind, the company said, to expand a network that now covers 12,500 trucks that it says works with ten German DAX 30 and eleven Euro Stoxx 50 shippers and is expected to move more than 1 million truckloads in 2021.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have carried our momentum from 2020 into 2021, having already made one acquisition and signed several strategic partnerships,&#8221; said David Nothacker, CEO and Co-Founder of sennder, in a statement. &#8220;We look to expand our European footprint, bringing more carriers and shippers onto the sennder platform, while expanding our digital offering – such as SaaS. Acquisitions and strategic partnerships are part of this strategy – the additional funds give us the flexibility to capitalize on the right opportunities. Baillie Gifford has backed a wave of revolutionary tech companies; their commitment to sennder is a vote of confidence in our team, technology, and business model.”</p>
<p>Stephen Paice, Co-manager, Baillie Gifford European Growth Trust PLC, added: “We are delighted to join the sennder team on its journey to disrupt Europe’s logistics industry. We strongly believe its technology has the potential to create tremendous value for stakeholders and society in an industry plagued with inefficiencies and needless CO2 emissions. What’s particularly impressive, beyond the progress shown so far, is the purpose-driven and entrepreneurial mind-set instilled within the company. This will no doubt be an important factor for long-term success.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of professional services has long relied on contractors to fill in for assignments and projects that might not be a part of the course of daily work, but are essential work nonetheless. Today, a startup that’s built a marketplace to make it easier for freelance developers, designers and others with technical skills with those job opportunities is announcing a significant round of funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malt</a>, which provides a way for developers, data scientists, designers, project managers and others working in related fields to connect with fixed-term job opportunities in their fields, has picked up €80 million ($97 million at today&#8217;s rates), money that the company plans to use to expand its business to more markets.</p>
<p>We understand from sources that the investment &#8212; led by Goldman Sachs Growth Equity and Eurazeo &#8212; values Malt at €400 million ($489 million).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vincent Huguet, Malt&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Hugo Lassiège and Jean-Baptiste Lemée, said in an interview that the funding in part will be used towards continuing to expand the company across Europe with a view to, longer term, also breaking into the U.S. In Europe, the company was founded in Paris, and it currently has operations in France (Paris, Lyon), Germany (Munich), and Spain (Madrid). The plan is to extend that to Benelux next, with the UK and Italy company after that.</p>
<p>The company has to date amassed 250,000 freelancers in its community, with 30,000 businesses tapping this pool to fill jobs. End customers include the likes of Unilever, Lufthansa, Bosch, BlaBla Car, L&#8217;Oreal and Allianz, and it also partners with traditional consultancies like McKinsey to help them source people for projects. Altogether the company has handled some €300 million in business since being founded in 2013.</p>
<p>These numbers, it seems, are just the tip of the iceberg. It&#8217;s estimated that there are some 6 million people in Europe working as freelancers today, and Malt estimates that the freelance consulting market is worth some €350 billion annually in the region.</p>
<p>Although recruitment for many parts of the economy has largely gone digital in the last two decades, Malt is tackling a part of the temp economy that has ironically held a strong offline presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing is that we are a very open marketplace, an Airbnb-style search marketplace,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all really based on our search engine. In a market that is very opaque, where offline and online players [those connecting technical workers with jobs] are protecting their bases, we have opened the information.&#8221; It also provides payment services and advanced solutions for some of its customers once people are engaged, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Freelancer&#8221; is a pretty loaded term in the tech world today &#8212; it could mean anything from a gig worker delivering food, driving you around or cleaning a house, from the plethora of people who work on fixed-term contracts, and soemtimes the implications are not great. Critics will say companies lean on the freelancer model in order to skirt around having to provide extensive benefits to those doing the jobs.</p>
<p>Malt is working in a somewhat different area, focusing on a gap in the market that has been around for a long while, finding people with specific, valued technical skills to fill in for project-based work, but has often been a tough one to crack for employers, Huguet said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going after those who charge a few hundred dollars per day and connecting them with mid- and large-sized companies,&#8221; said Huguet, who described Malt as very different from the likes of Fiverr, which also lets people find skilled workers but focuses on finding the lowest bidder for a job. &#8220;You search for a specific freelancer as the employer. You don&#8217;t post a specific task for freelancers to respond.&#8221; The average time of engagement is around three weeks but might be as long as three months, he said.</p>
<p>What has been interesting &#8212; and has definitely had an impact on how Malt has grown, and the investment it&#8217;s announcing today &#8212; is how much the working world has shifted in the last year and a half. Not only has Covid-19 changed how people work in offices &#8212; if they are working in offices at all anymore &#8212; but the rapidly changing circumstances have somewhat played into the idea of building out work strategy on more concrete short- and medium-term goals, with longer-term remaining a conditional. This fits the kind of jobs that Malt typically helps fill requirements for, and the changes also has meant more workers coming into Malt&#8217;s universe looking for work.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we can see already and predict in the next quarters is that we will be a post covid winner,&#8221; Huguet said. &#8220;People are now considering different options. The idea of a full-time employee was that when everyone was in office people knew how to work 9-6, and that&#8217;s what was expected. Now that people are working on projects, employers are more open to consultants. This plus the bigger hiring freezes helped us grow much faster. The market and the mindset have changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, people who might have previously looked first for full-time employment are now feeling more secure putting their eggs into the freelance basket. &#8220;More than 90% of freelancers are joining us by choice,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>What will be interesting is to see how and if companies like LinkedIn, which has been a strong player in professional recruitment, make more headway in this space, on the back of a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-new-gig-a-linkedin-freelancer-market-rivaling-upwork-fiverr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of a freelancer marketplace earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We are watching what it&#8217;s doing, but we think it will be hard for them to do,&#8221; Huguet said. He pointed out that LinkedIn&#8217;s profiles today are dedicated to classic recruitment, so doing the matching for freelance is very different.</p>
<p>Regardless of how LinkedIn&#8217;s interest plays out, its activity there also points to a big opportunity, one big reason for why investors are backing Malt right now.</p>
<p>“Malt is at a pivotal time in its development. This new round of funding will allow the company to scale rapidly and drive even greater impact,&#8221; said Yann du Rusquec, a partner at Eurazeo. &#8220;We are excited to partner with Vincent and Alexandre—and offer the expertise of our Growth and Venture teams along with the depth of Eurazeo&#8217;s network in Europe—to drive Malt’s future success.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to support Malt to build the leading freelance marketplace in Europe,&#8221; added Alexandre Flavier, executive director at Goldman Sachs Growth Equity. &#8220;Malt is at the forefront of the future of work, promoting agility, innovation, impact, freedom of choice, making freelancing simpler and more reliable. We are excited to partner with Malt’s founders, empower their community of highly skilled freelancers, and give companies access to the world’s best freelance talents.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://www.wefox.com/en-de">Wefox</a> has raised a $650 million Series C funding round led by Target Global. Following this funding round, the company has reached a post-money valuation of $3 billion. Wefox is a digital insurer focused on personal insurance products, such as household insurance, motor insurance and personal liability insurance.</p>
<p>“It’s much more than we wanted to raise initially. It was a very fast process and essentially we were oversubscribed by 4x or so,” co-founder and CEO Julian Teicke (pictured right) told me.</p>
<p>In December 2019, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/wefox-unicorn/">reported</a> a $1.65 billion valuation. And the company says today’s funding round is one of the largest Series C rounds of all time — and likely the largest Series C round for an insurtech company more specifically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Almost all of the big existing investors are participating,” Teicke said. OMERS Ventures, G Squared, Mountain Partners, Merian, Horizons Ventures, Eurazeo, Mubadala Capital, Salesforce Ventures, Speedinvest, CE Innovation Capital, GR Capital and Seedcamp are all participating once again in this Wefox founding round. New investors include FinTLV, Ace &amp; Co, LGT and its affiliated impact investing platform Lightrock, Partners Group, EDBI, Jupiter and Decisive.</p>
<p>“Not only have we raised a super large amount but also in a very fast time. It took us a total of four weeks to get all commitments in,” co-founder an CFO Fabian Wesemann (pictured left) told me.</p>
<p>Wefox believes it can now iterate and generate more and more revenue as it scales — it just needs capital to reach the next level. “We’re tackling that $5.2 trillion industry that has been stuck in the pre-internet era. We nailed how to disrupt it in our core market,” Teicke said.</p>
<p>But what makes Wefox different from legacy insurance companies? Wefox isn’t a direct-to-consumer insurance company. Most insurance products are still sold by agents and the startup believes this isn’t going to change anytime soon.</p>
<p>That’s why Wefox has 700 agents selling Wefox products exclusively. It also partners with associate brokers — around 5,000 can distribute Wefox products.</p>
<p>“While the rest of the industry seems to say that human agents are dead, we think they’re more relevant than ever,” Teicke said.</p>
<p>In 2020 alone, the company generated $140 million in revenue. If you look at Wefox Insurance, the company’s insurance carrier, the company reported a profit for 2020. As for the group, “we’re going to show overall profitability by 2023,” Wesemann said.</p>
<p>That fast growth rate combined with a clear path to profitability means that Wefox has an ambitious roadmap. As a full-stack insurance company licensed in Lichtenstein, Wefox can passport its license to other European countries. The company is currently live in five markets right now and is working on expanding to Italy soon.</p>
<p>In addition to new markets, Wefox plans to sell new insurance products — property and casualty insurance, pet insurance, health insurance, life insurance… If you’re thinking about an insurance product, chances are Wefox is already working on it. “This year we’re launching around 20 new insurance products,” Teicke said.</p>
<p>While distribution is managed decentrally with local agents talking with local customers, insurance products are managed centrally. The startup prioritizes products by revenue potential and goes down the list one product at a time.</p>
<p>Finally, Wefox has ambitious plans when it comes to reducing administrative costs. The company has been investing in automation so that common processes are handled by an algorithm. Currently, 80% of its processes are handled automatically. It’s a never-ending process as you have to adapt your processes when you launch new products.</p>
<p>Wefox is also working on prevention. The company has put together an AI team in Paris to prevent bad things from happening in the first place. As always with insurance companies, it’s all about optimizing every layer and every step of the customer journey to build a product that stands out from what’s already out there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://zenyum.com/">Zenyum</a>, a startup that wants to make cosmetic dentistry more affordable, announced today it has raised a $40 million Series B. This includes $25 million from L Catterton, a private equity firm focused on consumer brands. The round’s other participants were Sequoia Capital India (Zenyum is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/19/sequoia-surge-inaugural-cohort-india-southeast-asia/">an alum of its Surge accelerator program</a>), RTP Global, Partech, TNB Aura, Seeds Capital and FEBE Ventures. L Catteron Asia’s head of growth investments, Anjana Sasidharan, will join Zenyum’s board.</p>
<p>This brings Zenyum’s total raised so far to $56 million, including <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/zenyum-secures-13m-fuel-expansion-plans">a $13.6 million Series A announced in November 2019</a>. In a press statement, Sasidharan said, “Zenyum’s differentiated business model gives it a strong competitive advantage, and we are excited to partner with the founder management team to help them realize their growth ambitions.” Other dental-related investments in L Catteron’s portfolio include Ideal Image, ClearChoice, dentalcorp, OdontoCompany, Espaçolaser and 98point6.</p>

<p>Founded in 2018, the company’s products now include ZenyumSonic electric toothbrushes; Zenyum Clear, or transparent 3D-printed aligners; and ZenyumClear Plus for more complex teeth realignment cases.</p>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Julian Artopé told TechCrunch that ZenyumClear aligners can be <a href="https://www.zenyum.com/sg-en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-braces-prices-in-singapore/">up to 70% cheaper than other braces</a>, including traditional metal braces, lingual braces and other clear aligners like Invisalign, depending on the condition of a patients’ teeth and what they want to achieve. Zenyum Clear costs $2,400 SGD (about $1,816 USD), while ZenyumClear Plus ranges from $3,300 to $3,900 SGD (about $2,497 to $2,951 USD).</p>
<p>The company is able to reduce the cost of its invisible braces by combining a network of dental partners with a technology stack that allows providers to monitor patients’ progress while reducing the number of clinic visits they need to make.</p>
<p>First, potential customers send a photo of their teeth to Zenyum to determine if ZenyumClear or ZenyumClear Plus will work for them. If so, they have an in-person consultation with a dentists, including an X-ray and 3D scan. This costs between $120 to $170 SGD, which is paid to the clinic. After their invisible braces are ready, the patient returns to the dentist for a fitting. Then dentists can monitor the progress of their patient’s teeth through Zenyum’s app, only asking them to make another in-person visit if necessary.</p>
<p>ZenyumClear is currently available in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan, with more markets planned.</p>
<p>Sequoia India principal Pieter Kemps told TechCrunch, “There are 300M customers in Zenyum’s core markets—Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Taiwan—who have increased disposable income for beauty. We believe spend on invisible braces will grow significantly from the current penetration, but what it requires is strong execution on a complex product to become the preferred choice for consumers. That is where Zenyum shines: excellent execution, leading to new products, best-in-class NPS, fast growth, and strong economics. This Series B is a testament to that, and of the belief in the large opportunity down the road.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thousands of electric vehicle charging stations will be built around the country over the next decade. <a href="https://www.chargerhelp.com/">ChargerHelp!</a>, founded in January 2020 by Kameale C. Terry and Evette Ellis, wants to make sure they stay up and running.</p>
<p>The idea for the on-demand repair app for EV charging stations came to Terry when she was working at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/electric-vehicle-charging-software-ev-connect-raises-12-million/">EV Connect</a>, where she held a number of roles including director of programs and head of customer experience. She noticed long wait times to fix non-electrical issues at charging stations due to the industry practice to use electrical contractors.</p>
<p>“When the stations went down we really couldn’t get anyone on site because most of the issues were communication issues, vandalism, firmware updates or swapping out a part — all things that were not electrical,” Terry said in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After Terry quit her job to start ChargerHelp!, she joined the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, where she developed a first-of-its-kind EV Network Technician Training Curriculum. Shortly after, Terry and Ellis were accepted into Elemental Excelerator’s startup incubator and have landed contracts with major EV charging network providers like EV Connect and SparkCharge.</p>
<p>The company uses a workforce-development approach to hiring, meaning that they only hire in cohorts. Workers receive full training, earn two safety licenses, are guaranteed a wage of $30 an hour and receive shares in the startup, Terry said.</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that Kameale Terry will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</strong></a>, a one-day virtual event that is scheduled June 9. We’ll be covering a lot of ground with Terry, from how she developed her EV repair curriculum to what she sees in the company’s future.</p>
<p>Each year TechCrunch brings together founders, investors, CEOs and engineers who are working on all things transportation and mobility. If it moves people and packages from Point A to Point B, we cover it. This year’s agenda is filled with leaders in the mobility space who are shaping the future of transportation, from EV charging to autonomous vehicles to urban air taxis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>For my American readers, you might be traveling — perhaps for the first time in more than a year — because of the Memorial Day holiday. While Memorial Day is meant to honor members of the U.S. military who died while serving, the three-day weekend has become the unofficial kick off to summer. This year, those traveling by car, truck or SUV will be met by the most expensive Memorial Day weekend gas prices since 2014, according to AAA. The organization also estimates that 37 million Americans will travel by plane and automobile over the holiday — a 60% increase over the same period last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Be safe out on these busy roads, frens.</p>
<p><strong>One story to highlight</strong>: Mark Harris dug into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/the-financial-pickle-facing-elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-system/">contracts for the Las Vegas Loop System</a>. He found that restrictions put in place by Nevada regulators are making it difficult for The Boring Company to meet contractual targets for its LVCC Loop, Elon Musk’s first underground transportation system. Shortly after publication, Steve Hill, president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), tweeted that a Loop test this week, with a few hundred participants, had demonstrated its planned 4,400 passenger per hour capacity, which could release $13 million in construction funds currently being held back. While this bodes well for TBC, the story lays out a number of other issues that could pose a challenge for the company. We will continue to dig into this story of tunnels and transport.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now a request, dear reader.

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Micromobility rivals <strong>Bird</strong> and <strong>Lime</strong> have come out with news this week that they&#8217;re both marketing as sustainability initiatives. Let&#8217;s start with Bird.</p>
<p>Bird has unveiled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/next-gen-bird-three-scooter-comes-with-bigger-battery-and-better-software/">next-generation scooter,</a> the Bird Three, that it will unveil in New York and Berlin this summer. It&#8217;s got a longer-range battery with 1kWh capacity and an improved diagnostic monitoring system to keep the battery lasting as long as possible. Bird says its better, smarter battery means it&#8217;s ultimately a more sustainable scooter because it has a longer life and needs to be charged a lot less.</p>
<p>Ideally, a better battery and better software will also help produce a longer-lasting vehicle so that Bird can cut down on depreciation and maintenance costs, which have really not helped the company in its push for profitability. Last week, Bird announced a SPAC merger with Switchback II. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">regulatory filings</a> that accompanied the announcement demonstrate just how difficult it is to turn a profit given the unit economics of shared scooters.</p>
<p>Lime is similarly positioning its updated subscription service, Lime Prime, as a sustainable initiative. With each new Prime member sign up, Lime promises to plant a tree through One Tree Planted. But more importantly, the subscription service helps the regular Lime rider perhaps save a bit of money. Members have access to waived unlock fees on any vehicle, and in markets with no start fees, the benefit will be 25% off the ride price. Additionally, riders can get free 30 minute reservations on any vehicle.</p>
<h2>Two-wheel swag news</h2>
<p><strong>Zaiser Motors</strong> announced the launch of its <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/19/2232729/0/en/Electric-motorcycle-manufacturer-Zaiser-Motors-launches-equity-crowdfunding-campaign-on-Wefunder.html">Wefunder campaign</a> to raise funds for development and production of its Electrocycle. It&#8217;s a good-lookin&#8217; vehicle, charcoal-black with a design that breaks away from a super traditional gasoline-era style and looks more like something a small Batman might ride. All of the components are designed to be recyclable within the first 10 years of production, the company says. The Electrocycle has 300 miles of range, swappable batteries and is less than $25,000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in scooter world, the <strong>Scotsman</strong>, a Silicon Valley-based electric scooter brand, has unveiled a scooter that&#8217;s 3D printed entirely in carbon fiber composite. And I don&#8217;t just mean some parts are composite. The whole frame, the handlebars, the stem and the baseboard are all made of this strong, sustainable, lightweight material. It also means the scooters are highly customizable, each frame printed depending on the owner&#8217;s height, weight, arm and leg lengths and riding position. At a starting price of $2,999, it&#8217;s not cheap, but that might be a signal from the industry that scooters are increasingly become viable transport options and not just toys. You can <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scotsman-electric-scooter#/">pre-order here</a>.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The march of IPOs appears to picking up pace. For instance, <strong>Full Truck Alliance</strong>, the Chinese digital freight platform known as Manbang Group, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1838413/000119312521175480/d260023df1.htm#rom260023_17">filed for an IPO</a>. The filing didn&#8217;t specify the exact amount it was aiming to raise. Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported that the company wants to <a href="https://whbl.com/2021/05/28/chinas-full-truck-alliance-files-for-1-5-billion-u-s-ipo/">raise up to $1.5 billion</a>, which would give it a valuation of $20 billion.</p>
<p>Full Truck Alliance&#8217;s S-1 provides a number of interesting details, including the how much money can be captured by effectively connecting truckers with shippers. The company reported that about 20% of all China&#8217;s heavy-duty and medium-duty truckers fulfilled shipping orders on our platform in 2020. (More than 2.8 million truckers fulfilled shipping orders on its platform last year.) Full Truck Alliance said last year it facilitated 71.7 million fulfilled orders with a gross transaction value of RMB173.8 billion (US$26.6 billion).  The first quarter number show it is growing. In the first quarter, the company had  22.1 million fulfilled orders, a 170.2% increase from the same period.</p>
<p>Full Truck Alliance raised $3.6 billion in private funding, most recently last fall at an $11.7 billion valuation, from firms like SoftBank Vision Fund (22.2% pre-IPO stake), Sequoia Capital China (7.2%), Permira, Tencent, Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners and Baillie Gifford.</p>
<p>The IPO about six months since the company raised $1.7 billion in a funding round that included backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital China, Permira, Fidelity, Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners, Tencent and Jack Ma&#8217;s YF Capital. A look at the S-1 shows that the principal shareholders are Softbank with a 22.2% stake, followed by 8.9% held by Full Load Logistics, a limited liability company owned by Full Truck Alliance CEO Hui Zhang. Sequoia has a 7.2% stake and Master Quality Group Limited, another organization controlled by Zhang, hold 6.6% of shares.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>E2open Parent Holdings Inc.</strong> said it will acquire logistics execution platform BluJay Solution, <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/e2open-to-acquire-blujay-solutions-deal-valued-at-1-7b">Freightwaves reported</a>. The deal could be valued at $1.7 billion, consisting of $760 million in cash and 72.4 million shares.</p>
<p><strong>First Move Capital</strong>, the Boulder-based venture firm that has invested in used car marketplaces Frontier Auto Group and Vroom as well as mobility-as-a-service startup Via, has c<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/fm-capital-steps-up-automotive-investments-with-new-150m-fund/">losed a new $150 million fund</a> that will focus on the automotive and transportation sectors. Proceeds from the round will be exclusively allocated to new investments; seven have already been made, including into autonomous vehicle startup Gatik, cloud-based automotive retail platform Tekion and e-commerce startup Revolution Parts.</p>
<p><strong>Hydra Energy</strong> received CAD$15 million ($12 million) from Just Business to expand beyond pilots and deliver hydrogen-powered trucking, the company announced. This funding is to support the further development of Hydra&#8217;s initial waste hydrogen capture plant in British Columbia, its fueling infrastructure and conversion kits. The Canadian company has raised CAD $22 million (USD $17.2 million) to date. One other update worth sharing, Hydra&#8217;s flagship hydrogen-as-a-service project, is scheduled to break ground later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Miles</strong>, the German car-sharing service has received investment from Delivery Hero CFO Emmanuel Thomassin, HelloFresh CFO Christian Gärtner, Chargepoint CFO Rex Jackson as well as Norwegian top manager Stine Rolstad Brenna. Thomassin has joined the company&#8217;s advisory board. The company disclosed to TechCrunch that it generated 20 million euros ($24.39 million) of revenue in 2020, quadruple the amount from the previous year. The results helped the company achieve profitability in October 2020. Miles is now focused on expansion. In the first four months in 2021, the company launched electric vehicles and expanded its car fleet to Munich. Miles intends to grow beyond Germany and is currently examining the best markets to launch in.</p>
<p><strong>MotoRefi </strong>raised another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/goldman-sachs-leads-45m-investment-into-auto-fintech-startup-motorefi/">$45 million in a round</a> led by Goldman Sachs just five months after investors poured $10 million into the fintech startup to help turbocharge its auto refinancing business. While the company didn&#8217;t give me specifics on its revenue — CEO Kevin Bennett cited a 7x growth year-over-year but didn&#8217;t provide the baseline — it did disclose it&#8217;s on track to issue $1 billion in loans by the end of the year. That&#8217;s a fivefold increase from the same period last year.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Eye</strong>, the publicly traded Swedish company that supplies driver monitoring systems for a dozen automakers, acquired emotion-detection software startup Affectiva for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/">$73.5 million in a cash-and-stock deal</a>. The startup, which says it developed software that can detect and understand human emotion, spun out of MIT Media Lab in 2009. Since then, it has landed a number of development and proof of concept deals as well as raised capital, but it never quite reached the mass-scale production contracts.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Smart Eye comes in. Smart Eye, which has won 84 production contracts with 13 OEMs, including BMW and GM, is keen to combine with its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The companies&#8217; founders see an opportunity to expand beyond driver monitoring systems &#8212; tech that is often used in conjunction with advanced driver assistance systems to track and measure awareness &#8212; and into the rest of the vehicle. Together, the technology could help them break into the emerging &#8220;interior sensing&#8221; market, which can be used to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant&#8217;s emotional state.</p>
<p><strong>Tritium</strong>, a Brisbane-based developer and producer of direct current fast EV chargers, announced a merger agreement with a special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp. II. The deal is expected to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/ev-fast-charger-developer-tritium-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-at-1-2b-valuation/">value the company at $1.2 billion</a>. The transaction is expected to generate gross proceeds of up to $403 million. Tritium will be listed under the ticker &#8220;DCFC.&#8221;</p>
<p>This particular SPAC deal is unusual in that it does not include private investment in public equity, or PIPE &#8212; a fundraising round that typically occurs at the time of the merger and injects more capital into the company. Tritium CEO Jane Hunter told us that the company didn&#8217;t need a PIPE because DCRN is a more than $400 million SPAC and its shareholder group agreed to a minimum cash closing of just $200 million, which significantly reduces redemption risk. &#8220;Also, our revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56% since 2016 as we expand our presence in major markets where we have a significant market share, such as the U.S. and Europe,&#8221; Hunter said. &#8220;This revenue growth helps to reduce our reliance upon new funds to implement our growth strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Wejo</strong>, the connected vehicle data startup backed by GM and Palantir, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/gm-palantir-backed-wejo-to-go-public-via-spac/">plans to go public</a> through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Virtuoso Acquisition Corp. The agreement, announced in a regulator filing, will give the combined company an enterprise valuation of $800 million, which includes debt. There were earlier reports that the SPAC deal was imminent. The filing confirms the news and provides more detail.</p>
<p>The deal raises $330 million in proceeds for Wejo, including a $230 million cash contribution from Virtuoso and a $100 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Previous strategic investors Palantir and GM anchored the transaction, according to Wejo. The company did not disclose the amounts of those investments. Current shareholders will retain 64% ownership of the company, according to its investor deck.</p>

<p>Senate Republicans released their response to Joe Biden&#8217;s sweeping $2 trillion investment plan, which would earmark $174 billion for electric vehicle investments. Their proposal would shrink it down to $928 billion. And that $174B for EVs? That would be reduced to just $4 billion, under the GOP plan.</p>
<p>It seems that the main point of contention between the President and his GOP colleagues is the definition of the word &#8216;infrastructure.&#8217; Republicans are sticking to a more traditional definition, so their counterproposal still contains plenty of money for things like roads, the water system, bridges and broadband.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s plan aimed to provide consumer tax incentives and incentives for EV chargers, incentives to boost domestic manufacturing and enough funds to install at least 500,000 public charging stations across the country by 2030. A memo obtained by <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/554820-biden-holds-firm-on-climate-provisions-in-infrastructure">The Hill</a> suggests Biden intends to hold firm to his proposal, so expect further negotiations in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The Senate Finance Committee on May 26 marked up the <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Clean%20Energy%20for%20America%20Act.pdf">Clean Energy for America Act</a>, an important step before it hits the Senate floor for a vote. Among other things, the bill would remove 200,000 unit cap on tax credits for consumers buying EVs &#8212; that means the tax credit could be used toward buying a Tesla, a manufacturer that hasn&#8217;t been eligible for the credit because they&#8217;ve sold over 200,000 cars in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Debbie Stabenow</strong> (D-MI) added an amendment to the bill that would create an additional $2,500 consumer credit for vehicles assembled in the U.S. and another $2,500 for vehicles assembled in a unionized facility. If it passes, the additions would bring the maximum consumer tax credit for EVs to $12,500 &#8212; no small sum! The credits would expire in 2025. &#8220;Electric vehicles are part of our transportation future,&#8221; Sen. Stabenow said. &#8220;The question is not when they will be built, it&#8217;s where they will be built: in Asia or America?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm</strong> sold her holdings in electric bus manufacturer Proterra after Republicans criticized her for a potential conflict of interest. The GOP&#8217;s complaint arose after Biden made a virtual visit to a Proterra factory in April. The sale provided Granholm with a net gain of $1.6 million, DOE told reporters.</p>

<h2>A little bird</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896211 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif" alt="blinky cat bird green" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I hear and see things, but we&#8217;re not selfish. Let me share.</p>
<p>This week, &#8220;a little bird&#8221; is all about big employment moves and departures and how one hire is connected to a potentially massive IPO.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s kick things off with <strong>Celina Mikolajczak</strong>, the now <em>former</em> vice president of battery technology at <strong>Panasonic Energy of North America</strong>. You might recall that Mikolajczak recently took a board seat at solid state battery company <strong>QuantumScape</strong>. Welp, she is now taking a job at the company as vice president of manufacturing engineering, beginning in July. She has resigned from the board in connection with accepting the offer. In her new role, Ms. Mikolajczak will lead the transition of the Company&#8217;s tools and manufacturing processes from research and development to production, <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-170075/">QuantumScape said in a regularly filing</a>.</p>
<p>Mikolajczak has a long history researching and developing better lithium-ion batteries. Her technical consulting practice at Exponent focused on lithium-ion cell and battery safety and quality. She then took a senior management position at <strong>Tesla</strong> that was focused on cell quality and materials engineering. During her time at Tesla, Mikolajczak developed the battery cells and packs for Tesla&#8217;s Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Roadster Refresh.</p>
<p>After leaving Tesla, Mikolajczak went on to serve as director of engineering focused on battery development for rideshare vehicles at Uber Technologies. And in 2019, she joined Panasonic Energy of North America, where she is vice president of battery technology. While at Panasonic, Mikolajczak led a team of more than 200 engineers and other technical staff to improve lithium-ion cell manufacturing and to bring the latest cell technologies to mass production for Tesla at the Gigafactory facility in Sparks, Nevada.</p>
<p>Speaking of <strong>Tesla</strong> &#8230; it looks like <strong>Scott Sims</strong>, director of engineering, left the company this month. His title doesn&#8217;t quite capture his role. Sims was the person leading the design and engineering for vehicle user interfaces, streaming, video games and mobile applications. Importantly, he was responsible for cloud computing as it related to the Tesla mobile app, a critical tool for any owner.</p>
<p>Finally, the big news on Friday (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/electric-truck-maker-rivian-is-said-to-select-ipo-underwriters">via Bloomberg</a>) is that <strong>Rivian</strong> has selected underwriters for an initial public offering. The company could seek an eye-popping value of $70 billion. I have confirmed some (but not all) of Bloomberg&#8217;s reporting. Obviously big news that I&#8217;ll be watching and digging into. I had heard rumbling about a potential Rivian IPO, but Bloomberg put together the critical deets.</p>
<p>To me, the biggest indication that Rivian was getting ready to make a move was <strong>Ger Dwyer</strong> taking the vp of business finance position at the company, which he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gerard-dwyer-5819832_the-next-chapter-this-is-my-first-week-activity-6803492501547307008-REU4/">posted about on LinkedIn</a>. You might recall, that I scooped the news a couple of weeks ago that Dwyer was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/waymos-cfo-and-head-of-automotive-partnerships-are-leaving-the-autonomous-vehicle-company/">leaving his post as CFO at <strong>Waymo</strong></a>. I noted at the time that Dwyer&#8217;s departure comes at a time when the demand for CFOs has rocketed alongside the continuous string of public offerings, including those done via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies.</p>

<p>Loads and loads of news. Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/developing-the-aurora-driver-to-move-millions-of-goods">published a blog post</a> that gives a few new details on its testing and self-driving trucks strategy in Texas. The autonomous vehicle company said its first commercial pilots will move goods on several &#8220;middle-mile&#8221; routes in Texas. A safety driver will be behind the wheel of these self-driving trucks, which will drive autonomously between hubs. The terminal or hub system is one that other AV companies have adopted — at least for now. The idea is that loads can be consolidated, which would theoretically make operations more efficient. Aurora did add, that &#8220;for shippers and carriers with existing hubs and large volumes of freight, we expect to ultimately drive the complete route with no need for an intermediate consolidation point.&#8221;</p>
<p>One other item that jumped out to me: the company is expanding into a second office in Texas, suggesting that they&#8217;re scaling up, at least in terms of people.</p>
<p><strong>Germany&#8217;s</strong> lower house of parliament <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/germany-gives-greenlight-to-driverless-vehicles-on-public-roads/">adopted legislation</a> that will allow driverless vehicles on public roads by 2022, laying out a path for companies to deploy robotaxis and delivery services in the country at scale. While autonomous testing is currently permitted in Germany, this would allow operations of driverless vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The bill still needs to pass through the upper chamber of parliament, or the Bundesrat. Included in the bill are possible initial applications for self-driving cars on German roads, such as public passenger transport, business and supply trips, logistics, company shuttles that handle employee traffic and trips between medical centers and retirement homes.</span></p>
<p><strong>PAVE</strong>, which stands for Partners for Autonomous Vehicle Education, piloted a workshop with local governments earlier this month throughout Ohio. The educational workshop, which was done in partnership with Drive Ohio, wasn&#8217;t open to the public. But my Autonocast podcast co-host Ed Niedermeyer, who also happens to be director of communications for PAVE, gave me the inside scoop on what went down.</p>
<p>PAVE says it doesn&#8217;t do any kind of policy advocacy; instead the aim is to arm public policymakers with the facts they need to make good policy. This pilot helped PAVE lay a foundation for a curriculum that can be used elsewhere; that might seem trivial, but the complexity of issues around AVs makes these workshops with elected officials potentially powerful tool.</p>
<p>Ed told me that one of the main challenges was educating on potentially controversial topics, like policy and regulation, &#8220;where we have to get facts across without imparting biases.&#8221; He noted that the organization&#8217;s public sector and academic advisory councils were both helpful as neutral authorities. Finally, he said that one of the most practical education PAVE did was around the best practices that its members and advisors have developed in early AV deployments.</p>
<p><strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, the U.S.-based self-driving truck startup, is partnering with South Korean conglomerate SK Inc. to explore the possibility of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-partnering-with-sk-group-to-expand-into-asia/">deploying its autonomous vehicle technology</a> in Asia. While Kodiak co-founder and CEO Don Burnette couched the initial agreement as a first step toward a commercial enterprise in Asia, the reach of SK shouldn&#8217;t be discounted. SK Inc., a holding company of SK Group, has more than 120 operating companies, including ones connected to the logistics industry.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of the partnership is to sell and distribute Kodiak&#8217;s self-driving technology in the region. Kodiak will examine how it can use SK&#8217;s products, components and technology for its autonomous system, including artificial intelligence microprocessors and advanced emergency braking systems. Both companies have also agreed to work together to provide fleet management services for customers in Asia.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong>, fresh off its splashy F-150 Lightning electric truck reveal, announced it is pushing its investment in EVs up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">$30 billion by 2025</a>, up from a previous spend of $22 billion by 2023. The company announced the fresh cashflow into its EV and battery development strategy, dubbed Ford+, during its investor day.</p>
<p>The company said it expects 40% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030. Ford sold 6,614 Mustang Mach-Es in the U.S. in Q1, and since it unveiled its F-150 Lightning last week, the company says it has already amassed 70,000 customer reservations.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai</strong> held the North American reveal of the upcoming all-electric Ioniq 5 crossover. One new detail that I found interesting: Hyundai developed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/hyundai-is-launching-in-car-payments-in-the-all-electric-ioniq-5/">in-car payment system</a> that will debut in the Ioniq 5. The feature will offer drivers the ability to find and pay for EV charging, food and parking. When the vehicle comes to North America in fall 2021, the payments system will launch with Dominoes, ParkWhiz and Chargehub.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors&#8217;</strong> cash-rich SPAC dreams have turned out to be nothin&#8217; more than wishes, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">Alex Wilhelm and Aria Alamalhodaei reported</a>. The upshot: a disappointing first-quarter earnings that was a pile-up of red-ink-stained negativity. The lowlights include higher-than-expected forecasted expenses, a need to raise more capital and lower-than-anticipated production of its Endurance vehicle this year &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000. In short, the company is set to consume more cash than the street expected and is further from mass production of its first vehicle than promised.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Motors</strong> revealed the in-cabin tech of its upcoming electric luxury Air sedan. I spoke to Derek Jenkins, who heads up design at Lucid, and he provided a detailed tour of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/lucid-motors-reveals-all-the-tech-inside-its-all-electric-air-sedan/">all the tech in the vehicle</a>. It goes far beyond the curved 34-inch display and second touchscreen, which received much of the attention. The user experience, particularly the underlying software, matters in all cars. But it can be the death of an electric vehicle model if not done properly.</p>
<p>It appears Lucid is on the right track. I won&#8217;t really know until I&#8217;m able to test the Air. Let&#8217;s hope that is soon.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> has delayed deliveries of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-the-r1t-launch-edition-by-one-month/">R1T Launch Edition</a>, the limited edition release of its first series of &#8220;electric adventure vehicles,&#8221; by a month. Customers who preordered can now expect to start receiving their pickup trucks in July instead of June, with Launch Edition deliveries to be completed by spring 2022. The one-month delay was due to a combination of small issues, including delays on shipping containers, the ongoing chip shortage as well as ensuring the servicing piece is properly set up. It&#8217;s worth noting that Rivian told me that it has been largely unaffected by the chip shortage compared to the rest of the industry because its products don&#8217;t require as many as other vehicles on the market today.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> had a number of news items this week, so I&#8217;ll just point to the most notable ones. Tesla has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/tesla-china-user-data-storage/">established a data center</a> in China to carry out the &#8220;localization of data storage,&#8221; with plans to add more data facilities in the future, the company announced through its account on microblogging platform Weibo. All data generated by Tesla vehicles sold in mainland China will be kept domestically. The move was in response to new requirements drafted by the Chinese government to regulate how cameras- and sensors-enabled carmakers collect and utilize data. One of the requirements states that &#8220;personal or important data should be stored within the [Chinese] territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, two safety-related pieces of Tesla news that seem in opposition to each other.</p>
<p>First, Tesla started delivering Model 3 and Model Y vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america/">without radar</a>, fulfilling a vision of CEO Elon Musk to only use cameras combined with machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and other active safety features. The decision has prompted blowback though from the National Traffic Highway and Safety Administration, Consumer Reports and IIHS over safety concerns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tesla finally — and after loud and frequent urging from industry and safety advocates, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot/">activated the in-cabin camera</a> in new Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. The camera will be used as a driver monitoring system. Tesla has been criticized for not activating the driver monitoring system within its vehicles even as evidence mounted that owners were misusing the system. Owners have posted dozens of videos on YouTube and TikTok abusing its advanced driver assistance system known as Autopilot &#8212; some of whom have filmed themselves sitting in the backseat as the vehicle drives along the highway.</p>
<h3>Other nugs (no not that kind)</h3>
<p><strong> Apex.AI</strong> hired Paul Balciunas as its CFO. Balciunas was the former CFO of Canoo. He also was an executive at Deutsche Bank, where he acted as a lead underwriter of the initial public offering for Tesla in 2010, and has since focused on auto tech and new mobility players.</p>
<p><strong>Blyncsy</strong>, a Utah-based startup movement and data intelligence company launched an AI-powered technology called Payver, that will use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/utah-dot-pilots-blyncsys-ai-powered-road-maintenance-technology/">crowdsourced video data</a> to give transport agencies up-to-date information on which roads require maintenance and improvements. Blyncsy is offering this service to governments at a reduced cost and with no long-term commitment. Utah&#8217;s DOT will be the first to pilot the program beginning June 1, deploying Payver in the Salt Lake County region, which covers more than 350 road miles. Blyncsy will be announcing other pilots in different states over the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Scale AI</strong> hired Mark Valentine to head up its federal-focused division. Valentine comes with experience and connections. He was  a commander in the U.S. Air Force, senior military advisor to FEMA and most recently, GM of national security for Microsoft. He will lead Scale&#8217;s government partnership efforts.</p>
<p>Scale has also hired Michael Kratsios, the former CTO of the White House, as managing director and head of strategy. The company said he is focused on accelerating the development of AI across industries. Michael joined at the end of Q1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://june.so">June</a>, a new startup that wants to make it easier to create analytics dashboards and generate reports even if you’re not a product analytics expert. June is built on top of your <a href="https://segment.com">Segment</a> data. Like many no-code startups, it uses templates and a graphical interface so that non-technical profiles can start using it.</p>
<p>“What we do today is instant analytics and that’s why we’re building it on top of Segment,” co-founder and CEO Enzo Avigo told me. “It lets you access data much more quickly.”</p>
<p>Segment acts as the data collection and data repository for your analytics. After that, you can start playing with your data in June. Eventually, June plans to diversify its data sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our long-term vision is to become the Airtable of analytics,” Avigo said.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a>, June may look familiar. The company has built a template library to help you get started. For instance, June helps you track user retention, active users, your acquisition funnel, engagement, feature usage, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159290" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159290" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png" alt="" width="1024" height="583" class="size-full wp-image-2159290" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=2048,1165 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159290" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> June</p></div></p>
<p>Once you pick a template, you can start building a report by matching data sources with templates. June automatically generates charts, sorts your user base into cohorts and shows you important metrics. You can create goals so that you receive alerts in Slack whenever something good or bad is happening.</p>
<p>Advanced users can also use June so that everyone in the team is using the same tool. They can create custom SQL queries and build a template based on those queries.</p>
<p>The company raised a seed round of $1.85 million led by Point Nine. Y Combinator, Speedinvest, Kima Ventures, eFounders and Base Case also participated, as well as several business angels.</p>
<p>Prior to June, the startup’s two co-founders worked for Intercom. They noticed that the analytics tool was too hard to use for many people. They didn’t rely on analytics to make educated decisions.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of companies using June every week and that number is growing by 10% per week. Right now, the product is free but the company plans to charge based on usage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is already underway on building its first floating spaceport platform, and the plan is for it to start hosting launches as early as next year. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared those details on the progress of its build for Deimos, one of two converted oil rigs that SpaceX purchased earlier this year in order to transform them into floating launch and landing sites for its forthcoming Starship reusable rocket.</p>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s purchase of the two rigs at the beginning of this year was for the creation of Deimos and Phobos, two floating spaceports named after the moons of Mars. They&#8217;ll act as offshore staging grounds for Starship launch activities, and the name is appropriate because the eventual plan is to have Starship provide transport for both people and goods to and from the red planet.</p>

<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399088815705399305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk and SpaceX have previously shared their vision for a future in which spaceports like Deimos are positioned within convenient reach of major hubs around the world, making it possible for SpaceX to operate a globe-spanning network of hypersonic point-to-point travel using Starships ferrying people from destinations as far flung as Beijing to New York in around 30 minutes. Before that, however, SpaceX will be looking to conduct orbital flight testing of the still in-development Starship, and its accompany booster, the Super Heavy.</p>
<p>Musk said earlier this year that it could b<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/spacexs-floating-oil-rig-spaceship-launch-pad-could-be-operating-later-this-year-according-to-elon-musk/">egin flying rockets from its offshore platforms as early as the end of 2021</a>. This new timeline indicates that rosy estimate has been pushed, which is pretty standard for the multi-CEO. The company has recently made good progress in its Starship program, however, with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/spacex-successfully-launches-and-lands-its-starship-prototype-rocket/">successful high-altitude launch and landing test</a> at its Texas &#8216;Starbase&#8217; development site.</p>
<p>SpaceX is now in the process of getting ready for its first orbital flight test, which will include flying Starship atop Super Heavy for the first time, and a recovery of the Starship following the test after it splashes down off the coast of Hawaii. It&#8217;s now doing longer fire Raptor engine ground tests to get ready for that next big milestone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of thousands of Chinese students enrolled in overseas schools are stranded as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt life and airlines worldwide. Learning at home in China, they all face one challenge: Their school websites and other academic resources load excruciatingly slowly because all web traffic has to pass through the country&#8217;s censorship apparatus known as the &#8220;great firewall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotting a business opportunity, Alibaba&#8217;s cloud unit worked on connecting students in China to their university portals abroad through an <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/partner/fortinet">arrangement</a> with American cybersecurity solutions provider Fortinet, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-cloud-vpn-idUSKCN24O356">reported</a> last July, saying Tencent had a similar product.</p>
<p>Details of Tencent&#8217;s offering have come to light. An app called &#8220;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E9%95%BF%E9%B9%85%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F-%E8%85%BE%E8%AE%AF%E6%B5%B7%E5%A4%96%E5%AD%A6%E6%9C%AF%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F%E5%99%A8/id1548408161">Chang&#8217;e Education Acceleration</a>&#8221; debuted on Apple&#8217;s App Store in March, helping to speed up loading time for a selection of overseas educational services. It describes itself in a mouthful: &#8220;An online learning free accelerator from Tencent, with a mission to provide internet acceleration and search services in educational resources to students and researchers at home and abroad.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alibaba said its technology works to speed up network connections for students while the optional VPN solutions are provided by partners including Fortinet.</p>
<p>Chang&#8217;e is not a VPN, Tencent told TechCrunch. The firm didn&#8217;t say how it defines VPN or explain how Chang&#8217;e works technically. Tencent said Chang&#8217;e rolled out on the app&#8217;s official website in October.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;VPN&#8221; is a loaded term in China as it often implies illegally bypassing the &#8220;great firewall.&#8221; People refer to its euphemism &#8220;accelerator&#8221; or &#8220;scientific internet surfing tool&#8221; otherwise. When Chang&#8217;e is switched on, iPhone&#8217;s VPN status is shown as &#8220;on&#8221;, according to a test by TechCrunch.</p>

Screenshot: TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>On the welcome page, Chang&#8217;e asks users to pick from eight countries, including the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., for &#8220;acceleration&#8221;. It also shows the latency time and expected speed increased for each region.</p>
<p>Once a country is picked, Chang&#8217;e shows a list of educational resources that users can visit on the app&#8217;s built-in browser. They include the websites of 79 top universities, mostly U.S. and the U.K. ones; team collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, Trello and Slack; remote-learning platforms UDemy, Coursera, Lynda and Khan Academy; research networks such as SSRN and JSTOR; programming and engineering communities like Stack Overflow, Codeacademy and IEEE; economics databases from the World Bank and OECD; as well as resources for medical students like PubMed and Lancet.</p>
<p>Many of these services are not blocked in China but load slowly on mainland China behind the &#8220;great firewall.&#8221; Users can request sites not already on the list to be included.</p>

Screenshot: TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Chang&#8217;e appears to have whitelisted only its chosen sites rather than all traffic on a user&#8217;s smartphone. Google, Facebook, YouTube and other websites banned in China are still unavailable when the Chang&#8217;e is at work. The app, available on both Android and iOS for free, doesn&#8217;t currently require users to sign up, a rare gesture in a country where online activities are strictly regulated and most websites ask for users&#8217; real-name registrations.</p>

<p>The offerings from Alibaba and Tencent are indicative of the inadvertent consequences caused by Beijing&#8217;s censorship system designed to block information deemed illegal or harmful to China&#8217;s national interest. Universities, research institutes, multinational corporations and exporters are often forced to seek censorship circumvention apps for what the authorities would consider innocuous purposes.</p>
<p>VPN providers have to obtain the government&#8217;s green light to legally operate in China and users of licensed VPN services are <a href="http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2011/content_1860856.htm">prohibited from</a> browsing websites thought of us endangering China&#8217;s national security. In 2017, Apple removed hundreds of unlicensed VPN apps from its China App Store at Beijing&#8217;s behest.</p>
<p>In October, TechCrunch reported that the VPN app and browser <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/new-chinese-browser-lets-users-get-around-great-firewall/">Tuber gave Chinese users a rare glimpse</a> into the global internet ecosystem of Facebook, YouTube, Google and other mainstream apps, but the app was removed shortly after the article was published.</p>
