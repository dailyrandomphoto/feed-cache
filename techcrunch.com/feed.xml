										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Email marketing is decades old, but it’s a category that has surprising life in it. Multiple generations of email marketing companies have come through and sustained success, from Constant Contact to Mailchimp. These brands often become household names — after all, you probably have hundreds of emails with their logos attached to the email footer.</p>
<p>Klaviyo is not as much of a household name right now, but it is absolutely on its way to the paramount of the next-generation of email marketing startups.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has raised $320 million in new capital in a Series D round, led by Sands Capital, a private and public equity investor that has, among many areas of focus, <a href="https://www.sandscapital.com/ecommerce-a-play-in-multiple-acts/">a thesis in ecommerce</a>. That brings the company’s total fundraising to $675 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/marketing-automation-platform-klaviyo-scores-200m-series-c-on-4-15b-valuation/">following a $200 million Series C round from just six months ago</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klaviyo was the subject of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">one of our most recent EC-1 analyses</a>, where we looked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-origin/">the company’s history of growth</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-business/">how it is rebuilding what’s been dubbed “owned marketing”</a> (i.e. marketing channels that a business owns like email rather than channels owned by platforms like Facebook and Instagram), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-marketing/">how marketers are using Klaviyo post-COVID</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-lessons/">some startup growth lessons from the business</a> as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VGAuasvUJ4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">The Klaviyo EC-1</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There is nearly 10,000 words of analysis packed into that whole story, so read that or save it for the weekend if you really want to get into the nitty-gritty of Klaviyo’s story and how it is fitting in to the wider email marketing space. But suffice it to say that the company’s secret sauce is perhaps obvious: it’s a marketing company that’s pretty damn good at marketing. That’s allowed it to pull in gargantuan numbers of new customers as many retailers and brick-and-mortar businesses fled online in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In its press statement, the company wrote that “Klaviyo’s customer base doubled over the past 12 months and the company now serves over 70,000 paying customers, a more than 110% increase from 2019 — ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies, in more than 120 countries.” It also said that it plans to increase its head count from 800 to 1,300 people this year.</p>
<p>The company is headquartered in Boston, and Klaviyo’s all-but decacorn valuation is a major win for the Boston enterprise ecosystem, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/what-pandemic-inside-bostons-scorching-vc-summer/">which continues to percolate on high</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As cloud-native apps continue to become increasingly central to how organizations operate, a startup founded by the creators of a popular open-source tool to manage authorization for cloud-native application environments is announcing some funding to expand its efforts at commercializing the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.styra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Styra</a>, the startup behind <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Policy Agent</a>, has picked up $40 million in a Series B round of funding led by Battery Ventures. Also participating are previous backers A. Capital, Unusual Ventures and Accel; and new backers CapitalOne Ventures, Citi Ventures and Cisco Investments. Styra has disclosed CapitalOne is also one of its customers, along with e-commerce site Zalando and the European Patent Office.</p>
<p>Styra is sitting on the classic opportunity of open source technology: scale and demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>OPA &#8212; which can be used across Kubernetes, containerized and other environments &#8212; now has racked up some 75 million downloads and is adding some 1 million downloads weekly, with Netflix, Capital One, Atlassian and Pinterest among those that are using OPA for internal authorization purposes. The fact that OPA is open source is also important:</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Developers are at the top of the food chain right now,&#8221; CEO Bill Mann said in an interview, &#8220;They choose which technology on which to build the framework, and they want what satisfies their requirements, and that is open source. It&#8217;s a foundational change: if it isn’t open source it won’t pass the test.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while some of those adopting OPA have hefty engineering teams of their own to customize how OPA is used, the sheer number of downloads (and potential active users stemming from that) speak to the opportunity for a company to build tools to help manage that and customize it for specific use cases in cases where those wanting to use OPA may lack the resources (or appetite) to build and scale custom implementations themselves.</p>
<p>As with many of the enterprise startups getting funded at the moment, Styra has proven itself in particular over the last year, with the switch to remote work, workloads being managed across a number of environments, and the ever-persistent need for better security around what people can and should not be using. Authorization is a particularly acute issue when considering the many access points that need to be monitored: as networks continue to grow across multiple hubs and applications, having a single authorization tool for the whole stack becomes even more important.</p>
<p>Styra said that some of the funding will be used to continue evolving its product, specifically by creating better and more efficient ways to apply authorization policies by way of code; and by bringing in more partners to expand the scope of what can be covered by its technology.</p>
<p>“We are extremely impressed with the Styra team and the progress they’ve made in this dynamic market to date,” said Dharmesh Thakker, a general partner at Battery Ventures. “Everyone who is moving to cloud, and adopting containerized applications, needs Styra for authorization—and in the light of today’s new, remote-first work environment, every enterprise is now moving to the cloud.” Thakker is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Email marketing has been with us for decades, but today it has been refined to a science and an art form.</p>
<p>If you’re an early-stage founder, it is one of the best ways to build and grow your direct relationship with your customer. You know how fickle the platforms can be. You can’t afford to mess this up.</p>
<p>So when and how should you think about doing email marketing, versus all of your other frantic priorities?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here at Extra Crunch, we’re helping you find the answers. Today, we’re launching a survey of founders who want to recommend a great email marketer or agency they have worked with to the rest of the startup world.</p>
<p><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/oYNNmGpd">Fill out the survey here.</a></p>
<p>If you have someone to recommend, make sure to let us know: We’ll use your answers to create a freely available public database of experts in this domain on TechCrunch. We’ll feature the most helpful responses (anonymously if requested) so other founders can find the right people for them to work with.</p>
<p>The next step might be even more useful: We&#8217;ll provide EC subscribers with our own coverage of email marketing how-to topics and issues in more detail, based on our ongoing conversations with these experts.</p>
<p>In the coming months, you’ll see us dig into topics from great content production to optimizing deliverability, flow, timing, and design. We’ll also examine how to use email together with other marketing funnels, to improve your ROI on paid advertising efforts.</p>
<p>We’ll cover ongoing changes to the technology that affect the space, including the state of the art in email tools, email service provider platform changes, privacy laws, and much more.</p>
<p>If you’re a founder and you respond to the survey, you’ll also receive a discount to a new Extra Crunch subscription.</p>
<p>We’re particularly interested in what the expert did in the early to middle stages of the startup’s journey. Usually before Series C, for venture-backed companies. Recommendations wanted for both individuals and agencies.</p>
<p>If you’re a growth marketing expert, you’re <em>encouraged</em> to share the survey with your founder clients.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who have been reading TechCrunch for at least a few years, you’ll remember a similar set of surveys we had begun around other categories of startup experts, including legal, brand and overall growth. After a hiatus to take care of a few other things, this survey marks the resumption of that initiative!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the absence of a real baseball league, it is perhaps not surprising that a simulated one should grow popular during the troubled year 2020. But even so, the absurdist horror and minimalist aesthetic of <em>Blaseball</em> seem an unlikely success. The text-based fantasy fantasy league has attracted hundreds of thousands of players and now $3.4 million in funding to build up the game and go mobile.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with <em>Blaseball</em>, feel free to go check it out now and sign up — it&#8217;s free. You&#8217;ll probably get a better idea of what the game is from 30 seconds of browsing than the next couple paragraphs.</p>
<p>For those of you who&#8217;d rather read, however, <em>Blaseball</em> is a web-based fictional baseball-esque league where players can bet in-game currency on the outcomes. But this is where things get weird. The teams aren&#8217;t the Mariners or the Mets but the Moist Talkers and the Worms; players have names like Chorby Soul and Peanutiel Duffy; their stats include things like allergies, pregame rituals, and an inventory of RPG-like items.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Likewise, games — told through simple text summaries of the action like you might see in the corner of a sports site — involve hits, balls, and stealing, but also incineration, shaming, and secret bases. &#8220;Weather&#8221; might involve spontaneous blood transfusions between players, or birds that interfere with play.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s totally ridiculous, utterly unpredictable, and very funny. This totally unique concoction of fantasy leagues, baseball satire, and cosmic horror has accrued a dedicated yet routinely puzzled fanbase over its 19 week-long seasons. And like so many hits, this one came as something of a shock to its creators.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153303" style="width: 849px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153303" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2153303 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png" alt="Activity feed from the game Blaseball showing various absurd and normal events like hits and incinerations." width="839" height="873" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png 839w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=288,300 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=768,799 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=654,680 654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Game Band</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re as surprised as you are,&#8221; said Sam Rosenthal, founder and CEO of The Game Band, which developed (and is developing) the game. &#8220;<em>Blaseball</em> was an experimental side project for the studio — we were in the middle of a pandemic, publishers were in a spending freeze, it was a scary time. We wanted to make a game that brings people together in this really isolating time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea for it came from banter at a real baseball game, where Rosenthal and a friend speculated about a league where the rules were &#8220;different and more chaotic.&#8221; Of course the rules of real-life baseball are continually being revised, but so far there haven&#8217;t been any resurrections of players incinerated by rogue umpires, free runs for home teams, or shrink rays.</p>
<p>While the resulting game-like product bears some resemblance to baseball, betting, and fantasy leagues, it&#8217;s much too weird and random to really be considered the same thing. That&#8217;s led to some friction as players who expect a more traditional experience lose coins on a game decided by, say, a bird pecking their team&#8217;s star hitter inside an enormous peanut shell, or a guaranteed home run because the batter ate magma.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153309" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153309" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153309" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png" alt="" width="1024" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png 1313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153309" class="wp-caption-text">The Hades Tigers&#8230; so hot right now. The roster shows a team&#8217;s current and permanent attributes, while players can work together to create change by voting weekly.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes we have to remind the fans that this is a horror game,&#8221; Rosenthal admitted. The gameplay, as players discover in time, consists more in cooperation and guiding the league itself than in precision oddsmaking. &#8220;This is not a game about individual success but collective success. The mechanics of the game reward organization, fans banding together with other fans of their team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using those coins to buy votes to determine how the most-idolized players are treated at the end of a season, for instance, could have huge repercussions on the next season. Ultimately the players are really participating in a sort of long-term alternative-reality game rather than a zany baseball sim, as the ominous announcements and events drive home now and again.</p>
<p>Next to the outcome of a match and the news that a player was walked to second base, you might learn that &#8220;Reality flickered in the Feedback&#8221; or see disembodied dialogue about the league or disordered cosmos.</p>
<p>It can be disconcerting and one may rightly wonder whether the creators have a narrative or goal in mind, or whether they&#8217;re just winging it and being weird for weirdness&#8217;s sake. I guessed the latter, but Rosenthal set me straight.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is going somewhere,&#8221; he assured me. &#8220;There are a lot of plans, we have a ton of lore written. We literally have a writers&#8217; room every day, usually about 3-4 hours long. But we need to stay flexible because there&#8217;s two other creators: the simulation, since we don&#8217;t know what will happen in the games themselves, and the fans. There are things we don&#8217;t know they&#8217;ll latch onto, emergent narratives like the reincarnation of Jaylen Hotdogs. We&#8217;re always learning, and we give ourselves a lot of room to backtrack or change things quickly if needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was never clear even to the developers, however, was whether the game would live long enough to see those plans come to fruition. <em>Blaseball</em>, being a side project built during strange days, was never envisioned as a big money maker. For a small game developer to have a runaway success on their hands but little ability to monetize that success, the stresses of continuing development and support can overtake the benefits of popularity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we didn&#8217;t really set it up from the get go to be profitable, we were just sort of slowly losing money,&#8221; said Rosenthal. &#8220;Fortunately our community has been really supportive through Patreon and sponsorships. But ultimately we wanted to make the game better and sustainable, and we wanted to pay our team what they deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153312" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2153312 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg" alt="Illustration showing how 51 percent of Blaseball players are on mobile." width="400" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Game Band</p></div></p>
<p>The $3M seed round keeps the lights on, to begin with, but also lets The Game Band staff up, so the writers don&#8217;t have to break up a meeting early because one of them is doubling as product support and the site is breaking. More importantly, however, the team plans to make a native mobile app. More than half of <em>Blaseball&#8217;s</em> players (that is, the real ones, not Baby Triumphant and Wyatt Mason IV) are on mobile and Rosenthal admitted the mobile experience is &#8220;not great.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company comes from a mobile development background, he noted, so they know what they&#8217;re doing, but saw the web as the easiest platform to deploy on during the pandemic. Now they want to get mobile up and running, since the live, constantly shifting nature of the game fits well with the kind of updates sports and fantasy aficionados tend to sign up for. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to know right away that their favorite team has entered Party Time, or that their idolized player found a new piece of armor, or that a new non-physical law has been ratified?</p>
<p>Rosenthal said they resisted seeking funding to begin with due to a desire for independence, but was enthused about their choice of investor, Makers Fund, saying they actually understand <em>Blaseball</em> and have been partners rather than parents when it comes to moving the operation towards making money.</p>
<p>&#8220;The know we can&#8217;t just copy monetization from another game and put it in <em>Blaseball</em>, that would ruin the experience right away. They have an amazing network of people in the games industry, and at the end of the day they&#8217;re not prescriptive,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>(They also gamely did not object to a line in the press release by the fictional Commissioner asserting that &#8220;Blaseball has acquired Makers Fund,&#8221; which says a lot.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very cognizant that there are ways that free games can monetize that are detrimental to the community,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;So it will always be free to play and it will never be pay to win. Like, the Crabs are never going to run away with it because they&#8217;re the richest team. When we think about monetization we think about how it can benefit the community as a whole, not individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime the league slouches on, morphing from week to week in a live dialogue between players and developers. Don&#8217;t expect it go get any less weird, because the creators know that constant disorientation is part of the game&#8217;s charm.</p>
<p>Amazingly, Rosenthal even managed to suggest that Blaseball was, in the parlance of game design tropes, the <em>Dark Souls</em> of baseball simulators — &#8220;it [<em>Dark Souls</em>] gives you so little, it asks you to interpret and put a thesis together, to go linger on forums and talk with others about it. We wanted to create that kind of experience, and see how people would interpret this sort of weird, unknowable entity.&#8221;</p>
<p>They certainly got the weird and unknowable part right. <a href="http://blaseball.com/">You can try Blaseball out for yourself here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly every social media experience today is built on the same premise: Humans identify with individuality. Users create a profile, upload an avatar picture, write a short biography and can then scream into the ether to other users on behalf of their digitally sculpted selves.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/najjmahal?lang=en">Naj Austin</a>, the founder behind Ethel’s Club, built <a href="https://www.somewheregood.com/">Somewhere Good</a> last year on an entirely different premise. She believes that humans crave collectivism more than individualism in a post-COVID world. So she’s in the process of reinventing how social media looks and feels, and with community and people of color at the core.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/ethels-club-somewhere-good/">Less than a year after launching</a>, Somewhere Good announced this morning that it has raised $3.75 million in a seed round led by True Ventures. Existing investors Dream Machine, Debut Capital and Canvas Ventures participated in the round, along with new investors, including Slauson &amp; Co., NextView Ventures and 2PM Inc. Notable angels include Ellen Pao of Project Include and actor Gabrielle Union. The money will be used for continued product innovation and expanding its nine-person team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I&#8217;m thinking about scale and trying to ensure that the most people have access to a safe and authentic community on their phones, and that means it has to be venture-backed in terms of being able to accomplish that in a way that also feels delightful,” Austin said. “To build a platform that allows for us to have consultants who are thinking about accessibility, safety and privacy, we have to pay them.”</p>
<h2><strong>Extracting the buzz from Community</strong></h2>
<p>Somewhere Good is a mobile app that connects people and then fosters that connection in a solely group setting, across a diversity of interests &#8212; such as a birdwatching collective for people of color or an anti-capitalist book club.</p>
<p>The platform arose from Austin’s other company, subscription-based community for people of color, Ethel’s Club. Members kept asking her for different things: a cooking club, a therapist recommendation, a wellness group. She said she became a de facto Google for members, and that Ethel’s Club began to “frankenstein” into different groups and needs.</p>
<p>“Which is, you know, not scalable,” she said. “We thought ‘Why don&#8217;t we build a technology layer that communities like Ethel’s club need?’&#8221; Somewhere Good is now a social search platform for people to join, chat and discover new communities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152845" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152845" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2152845" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png" alt="" width="1024" height="701" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png 1900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=1536,1051 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152845" class="wp-caption-text">Somewhere Good</p></div></p>
<p>Users can visit and drop into different “worlds” or communities that fit their interests, she explained. Once a user has entered a world, they can view and post content and have real-time audio conversations with others. People are encouraged to cite content in order to promote content and nuance.</p>
<p>“If I add an Angela Davis article in ‘Abolition World’ I can also see that you added it to ‘Black Feminists’ world and so on,” Austin explained. “This is likely to encourage you to look into the Black Feminists world and further your discovery.”</p>
<p>Austin stressed that no one person or host controls the experience, instead putting focus on the community as a whole to create a world that is living and breathing. It’s her response to the rise of community in every startup right now.</p>
<p>“Communities become a buzzword that everyone&#8217;s trying to tap into their platforms now,” she said. “Things I know about community and what I&#8217;ve learned over the last year-and-a-half is that you need intimacy, you need nuance, you need collaboration and you need this magical collision of people who have shared identities.”</p>
<p>How Somewhere Good actually executes this mission will rely heavily on its product, which is still in its infancy. Right now, Austin shared that they have made intentional choices to remove what she sees as the “empty noise” of other social media platforms. At this point, there are no advertisements on Somewhere Good, no user profiles, no friending, no following and no feed.</p>
<p>Notably, this differentiation is also one of Somewhere Good’s biggest challenges.</p>
<p>“When building something new, it potentially feels like we are taking it away from the users,” she said. “For example, taking profiles away may feel like it is a less than, versus that it is additive in the long run because you no longer have to have a perfect profile and worry about users.”</p>

<p>The startup is testing out user reaction to these sorts of fundamental structural changes over the next couple of weeks. Somewhere Good also launched <a href="https://workingnotworking.com/projects/246091-somewhere-good-shift-fellowship">SHIFT</a>, a $50,000 year-long fellowship program, to invite people to join the team and create a feedback loop on product, team and community, as well as explore some of the ideas that Austin is experimenting with today.</p>
<p>“We still aren&#8217;t going to be able to make the most perfect platform for everyone on Earth to start, and we know that, but in doing so we&#8217;ve created a fellowship to help inform us, and kind of heads down and deploy that occurs when you&#8217;re building a product.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Entering the Clubhouse</h2>
<p>The app was meant to go into beta in January 2020 but that has now been pushed to the second half of 2021 so the team could continue to tweak the product. The beta will be invite-only to start, including 50 to 75 communities and their members that Somewhere Good has vetted beforehand and the some 5,000 people on its waitlist.</p>
<p>Somewhere Good’s monetization plan is also in the early innings, and the founder says it will focus on that more when the app reaches scale.</p>
<p>Clubhouse, an app valued at $1 billion that is similarly focused on community and spontaneity, could be seen as competition to Somewhere Good. Clubhouse has an exploration page that helps users discover different clubs, and it also built out a creator network to bring high-quality, recurring content to its platform.</p>
<p>“It’s a solid company,” Austin said. “But I think they’ve struggled with really big questions and I think that there are solutions and answers out there that Clubhouse has chosen not to embed to their platform, and that was simply a choice that they made.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, she doesn’t seem fazed.</p>
<p>“I feel like most of the platforms that exist are taking what already exists and kind of putting a veneer on it,” she said. “There’s nothing wrong with repainting, but then it’s just repainting.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/startups-dont-repaint-reinvent/">Reinventing feels like an outsized opportunity.</a></p>
<p>“I believe if we get Somewhere Good right, it can replace many of the apps on your phone,” she said. “When you think about it, where you receive the most value, outside of the calculator app, is with your friends and the people you know and trust.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The events of the past year and a half could well mark the beginning of a sea change for the world of restaurant robotics. The essential industrial was slammed amid the pandemic, leaving many companies searching for a decent automated option that could both keep things running and potentially avoid transmission vectors.</p>
<p>Seattle-based Picnic is the latest to benefit from that interest, announcing a $16.3 raise this week. Led by Thursday Ventures &#8212; with participation from Creative Ventures, Flying Fish Partners and Vulcan Capital – the Series A includes <a href="https://thespoon.tech/picnic-raises-3m-for-its-robot-powered-pizza-assembly/">a $3 million bridge filed last fall</a>.</p>

<p>The company is one of a handful looking to automate the pizza-making process. It’s an obvious target for this technology, given both the food’s popularity and the relative uniformity, versus other meals. XRobotics debuted its own system late-late year, while Zume – possibly the best-known of the bunch – has long since exited the category.</p>
<p>Picnic, meanwhile, says interest in its own pizza system has ramped up of late, announcing a number of industry partnerships, including Orion Land Mark, Ethan Stowell Restaurants, National Service Cooperative  and Baseline Hardware Financing. The plan is to roll the technology out to both restaurants and other public gathering spaces, including schools, stadiums and hospitals. The company says this latest round will go toward headcount and expanding operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last September we concluded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/apple-27-inch-imac-review/">our 27-inch iMac review thusly</a>,</p>
<p>&#8220;The big open question mark here is what the future looks like for the iMac — and how long we’ll have to wait to see it. That is, of course, the perennial question for hardware upgrades, but it’s exacerbated by the knowledge of imminent ARM-based systems and rumors surrounding a redesign.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was, as these things go, less than a full-throated endorsement of Apple’s latest all-in-one. We certainly weren’t alone in the assessment. It was a weird liminal zone for the computer &#8212; and Macs in general. At WWDC in June, the company had taken the unusual step of announcing its move from Intel to its own in-house chips without any hardware to show for it.</p>

<p>The reasoning was sound. The company was looking to help developers get out ahead of launch. It was going to be a heavy lift &#8212; the first time the Mac line had seen such a seismic shift since 2005. Fifteen years is a long time, and that’s a lot of legacy software to contend with. While the move wouldn’t outright break every piece of MacOS software, it was certainly in devs&#8217; best interest to optimize for the new hardware, by way of the Mac Mini developer kit the company was offering. The full transition to the new silicon, Apple noted, would take two years.</p>

<p>In November, the company debuted the first M1 Macs: a new Mac Mini, MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/">We spent several thousand words reviewing all three systems</a>, but ultimately Matthew put it pretty succinctly, “Apple&#8217;s new M1-powered MacBook shows impressive performance gains that make Intel&#8217;s chips obsolete overnight.”</p>
<p>Which is, you know, a rough look for an all-in-one launched a mere two months before. That goes double for a system that hadn’t seen a fundamental redesign in some time. Two months after launch, the 2020 iMac was already starting to feel old.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153067" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153067" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Recording-2021-05-17-at-10.25.32-AM.2021-05-17-10_31_28.gif" alt="" width="800" height="56" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153067" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Fast-forward to last month, when Apple announced the new iMac amid a flurry of hardware news. This, it seems, was the iMac we’d been waiting for. The new system brought the most fundamental redesign in a decade, with an ultra-compact new form factor, improvements to audio and video (a big sticking point in the remote work era) and, perhaps most importantly, the new M1 chip.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153037" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153037" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153037" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153037" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The biggest thing the 2020 system has going for it is that it’s, well, big. Having used a 27-inch iMac for much of my day-to-day work throughout the pandemic, I’m honestly surprised by how much I miss those extra three inches. I’d initially assumed that added bit of screen real estate was going to be fairly negligible once you’ve passed the 20-inch threshold, but turns out, like anything else, it takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>There’s an immediate upside, too, of course. I was genuinely surprised by how compact the new design is, compared to past iMacs. In spite of adding 2.5 inches to the display size over the 21.5-inch, the new system is an extremely thin 11.5 mm (or 14.7 when the stand is factored in).</p>
<p>The overarching theme for the system is “cute.” This is not a word I often apply to technology. Words like “cool” or “sleek” are generally go-tos here. But I’m at a loss for a better word to describe what feels like a true spiritual successor to the iMac G3. The colorful line of all-in-ones ushered in Steve Jobs’ second triumphant stint with the company, arriving at the tail end of a decade in a year personified by the Volkswagen’s New Beetle.</p>
<p>Of course, the design language has evolved dramatically in the nearly quarter-century since the first iMac arrived, owing to changing styles and, of course, ever-reducing component sizes. The flat-panel design arrived early this century and settled into the most recent design around 2012. Sure, there have been plenty of updates since then, but nine years is a long time for an Apple design to go without a major refresh.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153030" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153030" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153030" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153030" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It finds the company moving from what was ostensibly an industrial design to something more warm and welcoming. The color is the thing here. It was the most frequently discussed question around the TechCrunch (virtual) offices. Everyone wants to know which we’d be getting. Mine landed with a yellow hue — something nice, light and spring. Honestly, it’s more of a gold than I expected, with a bright and shiny glean to it. I will advise that anyone who plans to buy one of these systems visit an Apple Store if there’s one nearby if you’re comfortable doing so. It’s really the sort of thing that really benefits from being seen in person, if possible.</p>
<p>That goes double here — since, boy howdy, is Apple on theme. The keyboard matches, the cables match, the desktop wallpaper matches, the adorable packaging matches (it&#8217;s a fun unboxing experience, as those things go) and even little touches like the OS buttons match. The latter two, obviously, are something you’re able to futz around with a bit. But the system and even the keyboard is a bit more of a commitment, really. After all, this is probably the kind of thing you’re going to want to hold onto for a number of years, so lighting and interior decorating are both worth considering before you make your decision. I recognize this is an odd thing to think about when talking about a desktop computer, but, well, it’s the iMac.</p>
<p>The company is offering <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/apple-website-lets-you-visualize-airtag-and-redesigned-imac-in-ar/">an AR iOS app</a> for seeing how the new iMac will fit in with its surroundings, which is a clever &#8212; and probably useful &#8212; touch. The system also weighs in at less than 10 pounds. This is admittedly not something I’ve given much thought to with desktops. “Portable” is a weird way to describe the form factor, but particularly compared to other desktop systems, it kind of fits? At the very least, it’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility that you can occasionally move the thing from room to room, as needed.</p>

<p>In broad strokes, the front of the system is similar to that of the past iMacs, though the bottom panel and its large Apple logo have been swapped out of a streak of color. The pane of glass lies flush with the screen and a not insignificant white bezel that frames it. The bezel, combined with the panel, comprises a not insignificant amount of real estate below the display, likely owing to the placement of components and the downward-firing speaker grille that runs the full length of the computer’s bottom. Up top is the newly upgraded 1080p HD Webcam — the first on any Mac.</p>
<p>As with past iMacs, the system sits atop a stand. In the case of the yellow model, at least, the stand is a notably darker hue than the front of the system. There’s a VESA mount option configurable upon purchase, but the stand itself is very much not designed to be user replaceable. The hinge’s action is smooth. I found myself pivoting the system up and down semi-regularly to better frame myself in the webcam, and did so with ease.</p>

<p>There’s a 3.5 mm headphone jack on the left — hello, old friend. I much prefer this placement to the rear of the device, which requires the cable to wrap around the side or bottom.</p>

<p>A hole inside the stand is designed for cables to be run through — specifically power. Magsafe — er, the magnetic charging connector — really popped up unexpectedly here. It’s less about the quick release that you would find on the old MacBooks and more about the ease of simply snapping the cable in place. I suspect that people are less likely to trip over a desktop cable that never (or at least rarely) moves.</p>

<p>The big update to the power cable situation is, of course, the addition of ethernet to the brick. The brick is quite a bit larger &#8212; especially if you’re accustomed to dealing with MacBooks. But likely it will be out of the way. What it does bring is the removal of some additional clutter on the back of the system and helps keep the computer itself that much thinner. For most people in most cases that can access a hardwired connection, it’s a nice addition.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153033" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153033" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153033" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153033" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The port situation, on the other hand, is decidedly less so. I like ports. I have lots of stuff that need plugging in to the back of the computer and ports are probably the best case to plug &#8217;em. The entry-level system has two Thunderbolt/USB ports. You can upgrade that to four. Definitely do this. Seriously. You’re not going to regret it.</p>
<p>I’m someone who keeps the wireless keyboard and trackpad/mouse plugged in most of the time. I know, it kind of defeats the purpose, but worrying about charging accessories is not another stress I need in my life right now. So that’s two ports right there. I also have some AV accessories and suddenly, boom, you’re out of ports.</p>
<p>The $1,299 version of the system ships with the Magic Keyboard. It’s pretty much the same as other Magic Keyboards of recent vintage. It’s not for everyone, I know. Those who love mechanical keyboards will find something to be desired in the tactility, but it’s a step up from MacBooks and I’ve certainly grown accustomed to using it. There’s no number pad on the base model, but the coloring coordinates with the Mac.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153027" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153027" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153027" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9193.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9193.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9193.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9193.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9193.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9193.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9193.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9193.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9193.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153027" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>With the $1,699 model, you get upgraded to a version with Touch ID &#8212; something that’s been a long time coming on the desktop system. Like other Macs (and older iPhones), the fingerprint scanning login is nearly instantaneous. As has been the case for a while, if you’re an Apple Watch wearer, that will log you in as well, but the addition of Touch ID on the desktop is great. The base version comes with the Magic Mouse. It’s $50 to upgrade to a Trackpad and $129 for a combo. I’ve grown fond of the Trackpad, so that’s where I’d probably land here (I doubt many people will have a need for both).</p>

<p>As ever, I understand the many reasons the company has pushed its line to USB-C &#8212; it’s especially obvious when you see how much room has been freed up on the rear of the device. But man, I miss having those legacy USB-A ports on the 2020 iMac. Meantime, you might want to toss a couple of A to C USB adapters into your basket before check out. That’s kind of just life with Apple, though. Courage, and all that.</p>
<p>I do wonder if this means the company is positioning the M1 line for the return of an iMac Pro. Stranger things have happened. For now, of course, the company is more focused on the Mac Pro at the much higher end.</p>

<p>As expected, the new M1 chip breathes new life into the system. Take our Geekbench 5 scores: 1,720 Single and 7,606 multi-core. That blows the average of 1,200 and 6,400 for the 21.5-inch system out of the water. Things understandably take a dip with the Rosetta (Intel) version at 1,230 and 5,601, respectively, but it’s still solid performance running through a translation layer. But it also points to why Apple was so proactive about getting developers on-board with the new silicon. On the whole, the gains are in-line with the the other new M1 systems we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; which is to say a nice, healthy leap forward into the future of the Mac.</p>

<p>If you want to know how much of your workflow will be impacted,<a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com"> this resource is a good place to start</a>. On the whole, I found that most of my day to day apps were fine. There are outliers, of course. Spotify and Audacity are right there. Performance is impacted in both case, but on a whole, they worked okay through Rosetta. Usage is more resource-intensive, though.</p>

<p>Spotify is probably a question of how many resources the Apple Music competitor wants to put into a new version, while Audacity is likely more of an issue of how many resources the organization has at its disposal. The further you move away from big names like Microsoft and Adobe, the more of a crapshoot it is. But there are some support issues with bigger names still, as well. For instance, I upgraded to the Apple silicon version of Zoom, but downgraded when I discovered it doesn’t work with the Intel-only version of the Canon EOS webcam software I use.</p>

<p>I recognize this is an extremely specific issue, but, then, workflows are extremely specific. As M1 systems become the mainstream of Macs, however, developers ultimately won’t really have much of a choice. Support Apple Silicon or risk becoming obsolete. Growing pains are essentially unavoidable with this sort of shift, but the results really speak for themselves. Apple Silicon is the future of Macs and it’s a fast-booting, smooth-moving future, indeed.</p>
<p>I can practically see the Apple team shouting at me when I mention the external mics and cameras I use to record video for work. After all, the new iMac sees the biggest upgrade to these things in some time. The best time for a new microphone system and the first 1080p HD camera on a Mac would have been last year, as the pandemic was beginning to transform the way we work and meet. The second best time, of course, is now.</p>
<p>Apple did tout an improved camera system on last year’s MacBook, but that was more to do with the image signal processing on the chips. That goes a ways toward improving things like white balance, but a truly meaningful improvement to imaging generally also requires new camera hardware. Take a look at the below images.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153069" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153069" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153069" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>That’s the 2020 iMac on the left and new M1 iMac on the right. Forgetting (hopefully) for a moment my droopy, partially paralyzed face (2020, am I right?), the image is night and day here &#8212; and not just because I’m slightly better put together all of these pandemic months later. The change that comes from upgrading from 720p to 1080p is just immediately apparent in term of image quality. I anticipate Apple upgrading its systems across the board, because teleconferencing is just life now.</p>
<p>i<strong>Mac 2020:</strong></p>

<p><strong>iMac 2021:</strong></p>
<p><audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-2153300-2" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/white-noise.m4a?_=2" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/white-noise.m4a">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/white-noise.m4a</a></audio></p>
<p>Along with camera, the mic system got a nice upgrade. I’ve re-recorded the same audio that I did back in November on the old system. The three microphone array is crisper and much clearer, eliminating much of the background noise hiss. The six-speaker audio system is an improvement, as well. I found it worked well with music and movies, but could be less clear for teleconferencing, depending on the quality of the other attendee&#8217;s mic. The audio could be a bit bass-heavy for my taste.</p>
<p>On the whole, for most people, day to day, I think the audio and video upgrades are plenty. If you use your system for the occasional Zoom calls and some music listening, you should be fine. Depending on what you&#8217;re looking to get out of these things, though, a decent external camera, mic or speaker is never a bad investment.</p>
<p>The new iMac represents a nice leap forward for the desktop all-in-one in some key fundamental ways, breathing new life into one of the company&#8217;s most popular systems that&#8217;s long been in need need of a makeover. I miss some ports and now feel spoiled having had an SD reader on the 2020 model. I would also love to see a 27-inch version of the system on the market at some point (iMac Pro reboot, anyone?). On the whole the system is less targeted at creative pros than other models have been in the past &#8212; though the M1 and its on-board ML are still capable of impressive audio, video and still image editing.</p>
<p>But a cute, color coordinated design and some long overdue upgrades to teleconferencing elements aside, Apple Silicon is rightfully taking centerstage here as it did with the MacBooks and Mac Mini before it. The pricing on the systems was a source of some confusion around these parts when first announced. The very base-level version runs $1,299, while the tip-top level goes up to $2,628 with all the bells and whistles.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, there are three main configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,299 gets you an 8-core CPU and 7-Core GPU, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, two USB ports, standard Magic Keyboard</li>
<li>$1,499 upgrades the GPU to eight cores, adds ethernet and two USB ports and brings Touch ID to the keyboard</li>
<li>$1,699 upgrades storage to 512GB (Our configuration as tested)</li>
</ul>
<p>The systems are available for pre-order now and will start arriving in customers&#8217; homes this Friday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As publishers face up to whatever might be their next existential crisis &#8212; there are so many options from which to choose, including Substack stealing all their writers; or Clubhouse pulling in people through audio-based conversations where news and analysis intermingle seamlessly with networking &#8212; a startup that&#8217;s helping them build more tools to keep their businesses and audiences intact, and hopefully grow, is announcing a growth round of its own.</p>
<p>Piano, which provides analytics and subscription services to publishers, has closed a round of $88 million, funding that it will be using to continue building out the technology that it provides to its customers, as well as forge into newer areas where it can better connect audiences online.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of a strong period for Piano. The company works with around 1,000 customers &#8212; they include CNBC, Wall Street Journal, NBC Sports, Insider, The Economist, Gannett, Le Parisien, Nielsen, MIT Technology Review, The Telegraph, South China Morning Post and (disclaimer) TechCrunch; and it has seen revenues grow 400% since 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Piano has an interesting new backer in this round that might point to what form those newer areas of development might take. LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned social networking site aimed at the working world, is participating in this Series B, which is being led by previous backer Updata Partners. Rittenhouse Ventures, which is based in Piano&#8217;s hometown of Philadelphia, is also participating.</p>
<p>(Piano is not disclosing valuation with this round but I understand it&#8217;s operating on a $75 million annual run rate currently. It has now raised just over $241 million.)</p>
<p>Trevor Kaufman, Piano&#8217;s CEO, would not be drawn out on how it specifically will be working with LinkedIn, but it&#8217;s notable that the latter company has long held back from leveraging the profiles it holds on its 740 million users to do much outside of the core LinkedIn experience.</p>
<p>That could be applied in a number of ways, for example similar to Facebook and Google logins to third-party sites; or for providing an identity layer to comment on stories; or even building a way to manage logins via a LinkedIn profile, which could then potentially be used to help people manage and read/consume all the content they subscribe to. Or something totally different: LinkedIn has a lot of unrealised potential that Piano could help tap.</p>
<p>“Members are increasingly turning to LinkedIn to stay informed on the news and views that shape their respective industries &#8211; critical to this is the work we do with trusted publishers and journalists,” said Scott Roberts, VP and Head of Business Development at LinkedIn, in a statement. “The opportunity to collaborate with Piano to help unlock more value for publisher content on LinkedIn makes it a natural strategic investment opportunity.”</p>
<p>The last year has seen many of us spending significantly more time indoors, and for a number of us that has also meant more reading, especially of smaller and more digestible formats such as periodicals. In a way, it&#8217;s no surprise that models like Substack&#8217;s have emerged and apparently thrived in this period, where writers are looking for different approaches and ways of connecting with readers while publishers by and large are conserving costs and strategies to weather out the storm.</p>
<p>Piano&#8217;s rise in that context is especially interesting, as in many cases it&#8217;s not reinventing the wheel for publishers but providing them with the tools to better leverage the content production that they already have in place. What&#8217;s notable is that in the process, it&#8217;s been able to capitalize on changing sentiments in the publishing industry. Whereas paywalls and subscriptions have in the past been seen as a drag on traffic (and the ads that get sold against it) and only useful for those in the world of B2B, now they are increasingly becoming more commonplace in a much wider range of settings, Kaufman said.</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">Piano&#8217;s tools are notable not just as basic levers to manage subscriptions (free and paid) but a more sophisticated set of analytics that provide more insight into how content is being read, which can in turn be used to develop those subscription tiers and determine the likelihood of people subscribing (Nieman Lab has good article on how that works <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/08/how-piano-built-a-propensity-paywall-for-publishers-and-what-its-learned-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).  </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">To add to that, now another area where Piano is likely to develop more products is in the area of newsletters. No, not the Substack kind, but building tools for publishers to help them build out newsletter businesses that they can monetize if they choose. Indeed, the other kind of newsletter venture is far from Piano&#8217;s agenda.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can’t imagine a more damaging entity for journalism than Substack,&#8221; Kaufman told me. &#8220;I think it’s gotten a tremendous amount of attention from writers because it is a fantasy come true for journalists, this idea that you can make $500k a year for writing on occasion. But nothing can be farther from the truth.&#8221; He believes the model is so &#8220;pumped up venture funding&#8221; that it&#8217;s not a viable one for the long haul.</p>
<p>That remains to be seen, I suppose, and of course Piano has a strong vested interest in supporting its publisher customers. What it mainly says to me is that there are still some innings left in this game, and maybe some more games in a longer series.</p>
<p>The company may also be dipping into more M&amp;A, given how fragmented the audience development, analytics and measurement space is. In March of this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/piano-acquires-analytics-company-at-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company acquired AT Internet</a>, a French company, to better manage and crunch analytics from across a number of silos, including traffic, advertising, subscriptions, engagement and more.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Piano&#8217;s recent growth has been outstanding, and we continue to be impressed by the expanding set of capabilities they bring to both media companies and brands looking to drive more revenue from their audiences,” said Jon Seeber, general partner at Updata Partners and a member of Piano’s board, in a statement “They now have a true end-to-end platform that can power all aspects of the customer journey, allowing their clients to incorporate only the highest-quality data from across touchpoints to create the best experiences for users.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One thing is clear in the cloud native world. Developers use a lot of services to create applications, and while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/15/solo-io-wants-to-bring-order-to-service-meshes-with-centralized-management-hub/">service meshes</a> define how these services work together, just getting a grip on the services a team uses is usually tracked manually in spreadsheets. That&#8217;s where <a href="https://getcortexapp.com/">Cortex</a>, a new startup, comes in. It can help engineers create a catalog of services automatically.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $2.25 million seed investment from Sequoia with help from Y Combinator and several individual technology industry executives. It also announced a couple of key new features.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Anish Dhar says that he experienced the pain of tracking services as a developer at Uber in a former job. His team spent a lot of time and effort trying to keep track of the 200-300 services they were using in Excel, trying to understand who owned the service, while making sure they were built with security and operational best practices. It was a part of the job nobody relished and he decided to build a tool to automate much of this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So the combination of the data not being up to date and SRE teams having to bug engineers to keep all this information up to date, it just creates a lot of problems around incident response and engineering velocity. And so I started Cortex late last year to solve some of those problems,&#8221; he said. The tool tracks the services by integrating with development tools like Jira and DataDog, pulling this information into a catalog for the team.</p>
<p>Dhar and his two co-founders, Ganesh Datta and Nikhil Unni launched the company in October 2019, and spent the next several months building the product, They launched in March 2020 and spent that winter participating in Y Combinator, a good way to ride out the early part of the pandemic.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, which actually closed last year, the company has continued to build out the product and today it&#8217;s announcing Scorecards, a way for engineering managers to enforce services best practices. It&#8217;s also releasing Cortex Query Language (CQL), which lets companies define the rules for building services as mathematical expressions. These rules and how well the owner of the service adheres to them, are the basis of the scores on the scorecards.</p>

<p>Bogomil Balkansky, a partner at Sequoia, who will be joining the Cortex board under the terms of this deal, says that his firm has been bullish on the micro services trend as it has developed over the last five years or so. He liked the fact that the Cortex team was solving a pain point for developers that nobody seems to have looked at before.</p>
<p>&#8220;The moment I met the Cortex team it was just so intuitive to me that that a product like this will be needed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The team is small right now with just two full time engineers along with the founding team, but it plans to add 10-15 employees before the end of 2021. As he builds his company, Dhar says diversity and inclusion is a big priority for him and his co-founders and he is aiming to build a diverse company.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so important having a team that comes from different backgrounds. It just leads to building a better product. It&#8217;s definitely something we constantly think about, and it&#8217;s a part of our hiring process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With just five employees, and a company that came of age during the pandemic, it doesn&#8217;t have an office right now, and the plan is to remain remote, while possibly opening up a small office in San Francisco later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When antitrust accusations close in on Google the tech giant loves to fire back a riposte that competition is just &#8220;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/10/google-gets-closer-to-a-court-date/">one click away</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s a disingenuous retort from an online advertising behemoth whose power and profits stem from its expertise in capturing markets by manipulating and monopolizing Internet users&#8217; attention.</p>
<p>Indeed, the entire brand is arguably a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/squint-and-youll-click-it/">dark pattern</a>.</p>
<p>Behold the child-like colors! The friendly babble of syllables! The tempting freebies! The tall talk of missions and moonshots! And tucked quietly beneath that Googley exterior: The adtech giant tracking Internet users en masse to sell their attention. The business model that makes money through mass surveillance and people profiling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google&#8217;s &#8216;other bets&#8217; have always been PR pocket change beside its ads profit machine. The fun stuff is simply how Google primes its people data pump.</p>
<p>So what if Google&#8217;s infamous &#8216;one-click competition&#8217; claim were to <em>actually</em> be made true in the arena of Android search engine choice? A market where Google&#8217;s activity is being closely monitored by EU competition regulators &#8212; after a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">2018 antitrust decision</a>.</p>
<p>Three years ago the tech giant hit with a $5BN penalty and an order to stop using Android (aka its freebie for mobile device makers) to lock in the dominance of its own-brand search engine (and other Google services) on mobile, where its operating system is massively dominant.</p>
<p>It went on to adopt a so-called &#8216;choice screen&#8217; on Android in the region &#8212; which prompts device users to pick a default search engine from a selection of options (Google auctions slots to rivals).</p>
<p>But the choice is more of a one-shot than a dynamic, ongoing possibility to switch the default for Android users &#8212; as they are only asked to choose their default choice on set up of a new device or after a factory reset.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means, for all practical purposes, if you want to change your default device search engine again easily, you can’t,&#8221; writes DuckDuckGo in its <a href="https://t.co/eQq7pmEPft?amp=1">latest blog post</a> pushing for reform of Google&#8217;s self-serving Android &#8216;remedy&#8217;.</p>
<p>By DDG&#8217;s count <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/one-click-away/">it takes 15+ clicks</a> (not one) to switch default search engine on an Android device at any other point (i.e. after initial set up or factory reset). And it says it knows &#8220;from experience&#8221; that this over-15-clicks method &#8220;trips up almost everyone&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, one click competition becomes in fact &#8216;one factory reset away&#8217;,&#8221; it goes on. &#8220;The only reasons we can think of for setting up a preference menu this way are anti-competitive ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pro-privacy search engine has been banging the drum on this point <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/one-click-away/">for months</a> (if not years) at this point. Nor is it alone in complaining about Google&#8217;s remedy. And complaints aren&#8217;t limited to how hard it is to switch search engines at any other point after set-up, either.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google to auction slots on Android default search &#8216;choice screen&#8217; in Europe next year, rivals cry &#8216;pay-to-play&#8217; foul&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/embed/#?secret=Gz9ge5TqKa" data-secret="Gz9ge5TqKa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Notably, Google&#8217;s decision to opt for a &#8216;pay-to-play&#8217; model by auctioning slots on the choice screen has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/">widely criticized</a> &#8212; with multiple search rivals arguing that an auction isn&#8217;t fair and does not result in a level playing field for competition (Google&#8217;s own search engine always appears as a choice, of course, and it doesn&#8217;t have to pay anyone to appear).</p>
<p>Not-for-profit search engine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/europes-android-choice-screen-keeps-burying-better-options/">Ecosia</a>, for example, points out that the auction format essentially discriminates against non-profit search engines, undermining the public good they may be trying to do (in its case it uses ad revenue from search to plant trees to try to help reduce global carbon emissions &#8212; so money paid to Google to win the auction means less money it can spend planting trees).</p>
<p>DDG has also been a critic of the paid auction model from the start. But with its latest blog post it told TechCrunch it&#8217;s trying to make sure the &#8216;ease of switching&#8217; issue doesn&#8217;t get lost in criticism of the auction.</p>
<p>It continues to argue that multiple components need to be reformed if the choice screen is to have the pro-competition effect EU antirust regulators are seeking.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s increasing clear that the current implementation isn&#8217;t working for anyone other than Google &#8212; which has been able to maintain its grip on the mobile search market, almost three years after the Commission&#8217;s antitrust intervention.</p>
<p>Its share of the search engine market on mobile devices has not declined since 2018. Indeed, as of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/europes-android-choice-screen-keeps-burying-better-options/">February</a> it was actually <em>up</em> slightly on the marketshare it had when the antitrust ruling was made, per Statista data.</p>
<p>That can&#8217;t be what market rebalancing success looks like.</p>
<p>Previously when we&#8217;ve put rivals&#8217; criticisms to the Commission it tends to offer a few stock responses &#8212; saying it&#8217;s monitoring Google&#8217;s implementation and is committed to an effective implementation of the 2018 decision &#8212; while avoiding engaging with the substance of the criticisms or specific suggestions to fix Google&#8217;s remedy.</p>
<p>The Commission reiterated the same lines when we contacted it now about DuckDuckGo&#8217;s call for true &#8216;one-click&#8217; competition on Android by easier default search engine switching.</p>
<p>But there are signs EU regulators may finally be preparing to do something.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/eus-vestager-actively-working-on-google-android-antitrust-fix">Bloomberg</a> reported on comments made by antitrust chief and Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager, who said regulators are “actively working on making” Google’s Android choice screen for search and browser rivals work.</p>
<p>She is also reported to have said that market share “is changing a bit but we’re working on it”.</p>
<p>In additional comments to us, the Commission reiterated that it&#8217;s &#8220;committed to a full and effective implementation of the decision, saying: &#8220;We are therefore monitoring closely the implementation of the choice screen mechanism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been discussing the choice screen mechanism with Google, following relevant feedback from the market, in particular in relation to the presentation and mechanics of the choice screen and to the selection mechanism of rival search providers,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo declined to go into detail on any chats it&#8217;s having with EU regulators on how to reform the choice screen &#8212; saying that it can&#8217;t comment on discussions with the Commission. But founder Gabriel Weinberg pointed out other jurisdictions are eyeing how to remedy Google&#8217;s dominance, adding that &#8220;major countries are actively considering search preference menus right now&#8221;.</p>
<p>The US Justice Department, meanwhile, filed its antitrust lawsuit against Google last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">October</a>. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">US states are also challenging the tech giant</a> in court.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe a &#8216;choice screen&#8217; that only appears once at start up will not meaningfully increase market competition or give consumers the freedom and simplicity they deserve to chose Google alternatives,&#8221; Weinberg also told us. &#8220;On the other hand, a properly designed preference menu gives users true one-click access to making Google competitors the default search on their device, without having to take the absurd step of factory reseting their phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its blog post, DDG has some plain words of advice for how regulators can beat Google at its own game and prevent it gaming search competition on Android.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sensible approach is to give users an easy pathway to the search preference menu by letting them tap a link from a search engine app or website within the default browser (e.g., Chrome). With that simple tap, the user is whisked directly to the search preference menu,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not allowing competing search engines to easily guide consumers back to the search preference menu is a pretty big dark pattern because it is requiring users to make an important choice when they often aren’t ready to do so, and then not giving them the option to easily change their mind later while using a competing search engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, to anyone considering implementing a search preference menu, or drafting regulations covering search preference menus, please ensure that consumers can access it at any time, especially after a consumer has just chosen to use a competing search engine,&#8221; it adds. &#8220;Functionality that allows competing search engines to guide consumers directly to the preference menu is necessary for consumer empowerment and search market competition.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automation is extending into every aspect of how organizations get work done, and today comes news of a startup that is building tools for one industry in particular: life sciences. <a href="https://www.artificial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artificial</a>, which has built a software platform for laboratories to assist with, or in some cases fully automate, research and development work, has raised $21.5 million.</p>
<p>It plans to use the funding to continue building out its software and its capabilities, to hire more people, and for business development, according to Artificial&#8217;s CEO and co-founder David Fuller. The company already has a number of customers including Thermo Fisher and Beam Therapeutics using its software directly and in partnership for their own customers. Sold as <a href="https://www.artificial.com/alab-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aLab Suite</a>, Artificial&#8217;s technology can both orchestrate and manage robotic machines that labs might be using to handle some work; and help assist scientists when they are carrying out the work themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The basic premise of what we&#8217;re trying to do is accelerate the rate of discovery in labs,&#8221; Fuller said in an interview. He believes the process of bringing in more AI into labs to improve how they work is long overdue. &#8220;We need to have a digital revolution to change the way that labs have been operating for the last 20 years.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A is being led by Microsoft’s venture fund M12 &#8212; a financial and strategic investor &#8212; with Playground Global and AME Cloud Ventures also participating. Playground Global, the VC firm co-founded by ex-Google exec and Android co-creator Andy Rubin (who is no longer with the firm), has been focusing on robotics and life sciences and it led Artificial&#8217;s first and only other round. Artificial is not disclosing its valuation with this round.</p>
<p>Fuller hails from a background in robotics, specifically industrial robots and automation. Before founding Artificial in 2019, he was at Kuka, the German robotics maker, for a number of years, culminating in the role of CTO; prior to that, Fuller spent 20 years at National Instruments, the instrumentation, test equipment and industrial software giant. Meanwhile, Artificial&#8217;s co-founder, Nikhita Singh, has insight into how to bring the advances of robotics into environments that are quite analogue in culture. She previously worked on human-robot interaction research at the MIT Media Lab, and before that spent years at Palantir and working on robotics at Berkeley.</p>
<p>As Fuller describes it, he saw an interesting gap (and opportunity) in the market to apply automation, which he had seen help advance work in industrial settings, to the world of life sciences, both to help scientists track what they are doing better, and help them carry out some of the more repetitive work that they have to do day in, day out.</p>
<p>This gap is perhaps more in the spotlight today than ever before, given the fact that we are in the middle of a global health pandemic. This has hindered a lot of labs from being able to operate full in-person teams, and increased the reliance on systems that can crunch numbers and carry out work without as many people present. And, of course, the need for that work (whether it&#8217;s related directly to Covid-19 or not) has perhaps never appeared as urgent as it does right now.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of advances in robotics &#8212; specifically around hardware like robotic arms &#8212; to manage some of the precision needed to carry out some work, but up to now no real efforts made at building platforms to bring all of the work done by that hardware together (or in the words of automation specialists, &#8220;orchestrate&#8221; that work and data); nor link up the data from those robot-led efforts, with the work that human scientists still carry out. Artificial estimates that some $10 billion is spent annually on lab informatics and automation software, yet data models to unify that work, and platforms to reach across it all, remain absent. That has, in effect, served as a barrier to labs modernising as much as they could.</p>
<p>A lab, as he describes it, is essentially composed of high-end instrumentation for analytics, alongside then robotic systems for liquid handling. &#8220;You can really think of a lab, frankly, as a kitchen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the primary operation in that lab is mixing liquids.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it is also not unlike a factory, too. As those liquids are mixed, a robotic system typically moves around pipettes, liquids, in and out of plates and mixes. &#8220;There&#8217;s a key aspect of material flow through the lab, and the material flow part of it is much more like classic robotics,&#8221; he said. In other words, there is, as he says, &#8220;a combination of bespoke scientific equipment that includes automation, and then classic material flow, which is much more standard robotics,&#8221; and is what makes the lab ripe as an applied environment for automation software.</p>
<p>To note: the idea is not to remove humans altogether, but to provide assistance so that they can do their jobs better. He points out that even the automotive industry, which has been automated for 50 years, still has about 6% of all work done by humans. If that is a watermark, it sounds like there is a lot of movement left in labs: Fuller estimates that some 60% of all work in the lab is done by humans. And part of the reason for that is simply because it&#8217;s just too complex to replace scientists &#8212; who he described as &#8220;artists&#8221; &#8212; altogether (for now at least).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our solution augments the human activity and automates the standard activity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We view that as a central thesis that differentiates us from classic automation.&#8221;</p>
<p>There have been a number of other startups emerging that are applying some of the learnings of artificial intelligence and big data analytics for enterprises to the world of science. They include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/turing-cpg-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a>, which is applying this to helping automate lab work for CPG companies; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/paige-the-computational-pathology-startup-targeting-cancer-closes-series-b-at-70m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paige</a>, which is focusing on AI to help better understand cancer and other pathology.</p>
<p>The Microsoft connection is one that could well play out in how Artificial&#8217;s platform develops going forward, not just in how data is perhaps handled in the cloud, but also on the ground, specifically with augmented reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see massive technical synergy,&#8221; Fuller said. &#8220;When you are in a lab you already have to wear glasses&#8230; and we think this has the earmarks of a long-term use case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fuller mentioned that one area it&#8217;s looking at would involve equipping scientists and other technicians with Microsoft&#8217;s HoloLens to help direct them around the labs, and to make sure people are carrying out work consistently by comparing what is happening in the physical world to a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; of a lab containing data about supplies, where they are located, and what needs to happen next.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this and all of the other areas that have yet to be brought into our very AI-led enterprise future that interested Microsoft.</p>
<p>“Biology labs today are light- to semi-automated—the same state they were in when I started my academic research and biopharmaceutical career over 20 years ago. Most labs operate more like test kitchens rather than factories,” said Dr. Kouki Harasaki, an investor at M12, in a statement. “Artificial’s aLab Suite is especially exciting to us because it is uniquely positioned to automate the masses: it’s accessible, low code, easy to use, highly configurable, and interoperable with common lab hardware and software. Most importantly, it enables Biopharma and SynBio labs to achieve the crowning glory of workflow automation: flexibility at scale.”</p>
<p>Harasaki is joining Peter Barratt, a founder and general partner at Playground Global, on Artificial&#8217;s board with this round.</p>
<p>“It’s become even more clear as we continue to battle the pandemic that we need to take a scalable, reproducible approach to running our labs, rather than the artisanal, error-prone methods we employ today,” Barrett said in a statement. “The aLab Suite that Artificial has pioneered will allow us to accelerate the breakthrough treatments of tomorrow and ensure our best and brightest scientists are working on challenging problems, not manual labor.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of digital payments is very fragmented, with different types of online bank accounts, digital wallets and money transfer services used in different countries. Singapore-based <a href="https://www.thunes.com/">Thunes</a>, a fintech focused on making cross-border money transfers easier, announced today it has raised a $60 million growth round led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>. One of the world’s largest venture capital firms, Insight is known for working closely with growth-stage companies, helping them expand through its ScaleUp program.</p>
<p>The round included participation from existing shareholders. Thunes’ last funding announcement was in September 2020 a $60 million Series B led by Helios Investment Partners. Other investors include GGV Capital and Checkout.com.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Thunes raises $60 million for cross-border payments in emerging markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/thunes-a-fintech-startup-serving-emerging-markets-raises-60-million-led-by-africa-focused-helio-investment-partners/embed/#?secret=4TFKHn2Fkk" data-secret="4TFKHn2Fkk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Founded in 2016, Thunes’ customers include Grab, PayPal, MPesa, the Commercial Bank of Dubai, Western Union, Remitly and Singaporean insurance firm NTUC Income. Its technology serves a similar purpose for online payments platforms as the SWIFT system does for commercial banks, acting as a hub to transfer money online to recipients in different countries, even if they use a different financial institution, digital wallet or mobile money account. For example, Western Union uses Thunes so it can move money into digital wallets and bank accounts. Thunes monetizes per transaction through a fixed fee and a small currency exchange fee. It is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Peter De Caluwe told TechCrunch that Thunes looks for active investos who can help it work with banks and regulators in new markets and connect it with potential clients. For example, Helios focuses on African companies and Thunes used part of its funding from the firm to build teams in Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia. Likewise, GGV Capital, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/05/thunes-raises-10m/">led its Series A</a>, helped Thunes’ operations in China.</p>
<p>When Insight approached Thunes, it was not planning to raise more funding.</p>
<p>“The important note here is that we were actually not planning to do another round and Insight was pretty persistent in knocking on our door,” De Caluwe said. “Since we last spoke in September, we more than doubled our workforce, our revenues, everything just became bigger and more scaled. So at the end, we decided getting extra funding from a very solid investor makes sense if they can help us.”</p>
<p>Insight’s portfolio also includes Twitter and Shopify and its ScaleUp program focuses on supporting software companies with high growth potential. For example, it recently became the first outside investor in Octopus Deploy, which had been bootstrapped for almost a decade, to help grow its enterprise market over the next five to 10 years.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After a decade of bootstrapping, Octopus Deploy raises $172.5M from Insight Partners&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/after-a-decade-of-bootstrapping-octopus-deploy-raises-172-5m-from-insight-partners/embed/#?secret=5MAzz5byfS" data-secret="5MAzz5byfS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>De Caluwe said Insight’s resources, including its talent network, will help Thunes expand in North and South America, build its engineering and product teams and decide what new services to offer customers. Thunes has doubled its team from about 70 people to 160 over the past half year, including engineers in the United Kingdom, Singapore and China, and business development teams in Latin America and Africa.</p>
<p>“Geographically, this is an important step for us that ticks a big box,” De Caluwe said. For example, Insight can help Thunes onboard larger U.S. retailers and fintech companies, especially ones that want to collect payments from emerging countries.</p>
<p>“Our ambition now is if we have a large U.S.-based retailer, service or game company who uses us to pay somebody in emerging markets, like suppliers or partners, to let our API also collect from someone. So if are you are a U.S.-based player, you can also collect payments and that is something we have been working very aggressively on,” he added.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Deven Parekh, managing director at Insight Partners, said, “Taking an innovative approach to solving the problems of an extremely fragmented and complex payments ecosystem, Thunes has created a unique platform that provides accessible, fast and reliable payment solutions. We see the company as poised for massive growth as it expands its infrastructure. We are looking forward to helping them scale up.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook wants to whet consumers&#8217; appetite for live streamed shopping with this week&#8217;s launch of &#8220;Live Shopping Fridays&#8221; event series, which will see larger brands live streaming beauty, skincare, and fashion content on a weekly basis. The event begins Friday, May 22nd and runs through mid-July, with streams from brands like Abercrombie and Fitch, Bobbi Brown, Clinique, Sephora, Dermalogica, Alleyoop, and Zox.</p>
<p>The events are meant to encourage larger brands to try out live shopping as a medium, as well as generally raise awareness about live shopping on Facebook among consumers.</p>
<p>The brands will use their live shopping events in a number of ways. They may give a behind-the-scenes look at their business or they may partner with creators to showcase their products in &#8220;how-to&#8221; style videos, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the live streams, viewers can comment and ask questions which brands can read and respond to. Shoppers can also tap on the products displayed in the stream to learn more without having to leave the video. If they want to buy, they can add them to the cart and check out at any time &#8212; during or even after the event has wrapped. The brands receive the customer&#8217;s shipping information, and if the consumer opts in, they can gain access to other details as well, like email and phone number.</p>
<p>Live stream video shopping became publicly available on Facebook last summer, following a series of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/06/facebook-live-shopping/"> smaller trials</a> and beta tests, where the format initially found traction with smaller to medium-sized businesses and digital-first brands, Facebook says.</p>
<p>The Covid pandemic also pushed adoption of the format, in some cases, as creative business owners turned to live shopping to reach their customers when lockdowns closed non-essential businesses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153179" style="width: 364px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153179" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2153179" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LSF-newsroom-shop-tab.gif?w=354" alt="" width="354" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153179" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>More recently, larger brands like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=309290224038403&amp;ref=watch_permalink">Petco</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=846869585902908&amp;ref=watch_permalink">Bobbi Brown</a> have run live shopping events &#8212; the former as part of a charity effort, and the latter with a live stream featuring tips from makeup artist Michele Shakeshaft. (Pictured)</p>
<p>&#8220;The way that we&#8217;re thinking about this is that e-commerce has made buying incredibly convenient. So when you have a need, you pull out your phone, purchase, and your order is on its way,&#8221; explains Yulie Kwon Kim, who leads product for Facebook App Commerce.</p>
<p>&#8220;But buying is not shopping. And so, a lot of what people do is window shop to see what&#8217;s new, for entertainment. You discover something cool that you didn&#8217;t know about. When you&#8217;re shopping, people often want to hear from a live person, get suggestions, and see the product and context,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And increasingly, people are discovering and deciding what to buy through social media,&#8221; Yulie adds.</p>
<p>She also notes that almost three-quarters of consumers globally are getting shopping ideas through Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, and almost two-thirds agree that social media has now become as important as other information sources when making purchase decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2153177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LSF-newsroom-news-feed-QP.gif?w=354" alt="" width="354" height="680" /></p>
<p>Facebook says the live events will be presented to consumers in a number of ways during the summer. If you follow a brand, you&#8217;ll be notified of their participation. You&#8217;ll also see News Feed announcements where you&#8217;ll be notified when events are starting (see above). And the Facebook Shop tab will offer a schedule of upcoming live shopping streams taking place across the platform.</p>
<p>Facebook, of course, is not the only one to realize the potential in live shopping.</p>
<p>Startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/ntwrk-moves-into-live-events/">NTWRK</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">Popshop Live</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/talkshoplive-seed-funding/">Talkshoplive</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/dote-shopping-party/">Dote</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a>, and others brought the live shopping model <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/h-and-m-millennial-brand-bets-on-livestream-shopping">already popular in China</a> to the U.S. and other markets, many months before the pandemic. TikTok has been testing live shopping, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">with Walmart in the U.S.,</a> as well.</p>
<p>Amazon, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/amazon-live-is-the-retailers-latest-effort-to-take-on-qvc-with-live-streamed-video/">live streams to its website,</a> and YouTube <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">announced earlier this year</a> its beta tests of an integrated e-commerce experience.</p>
<p>As for Facebook, a live shopping platform could ultimately serve as a significant revenue stream, thanks to selling fees <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/223030991929920?id=533228987210412">applied at checkout</a>. While Facebook did waive those selling fees through June 2021 &#8212; a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/lets-talk-about-why-personalized-ads-matter/">decision it claims</a> was to help support small businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic &#8212; that move also conveniently helps Facebook stake its place in the live stream shopping market land grab now underway. Facebook also needs to diversify its revenue, given that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/preparing-our-partners-for-ios-14-launch">Apple&#8217;s privacy push</a> around third-party tracking <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/facebook-could-take-a-multibillion-revenue-hit-from-apples-idfa-changes/">will hurt Facebook&#8217;s ad business. </a></p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Live Shopping Fridays series will roll out across both mobile and desktop in the U.S. this week, and will also pop on Facebook&#8217;s Shop Tab for easy access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office (FCO) is seeking to make swift use of a new competition tool to target big tech &#8212; <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2021/18_05_2021_Amazon_19a.html?nn=3591568">announcing</a> today that it&#8217;s opened a proceeding against ecommerce giant Amazon.</p>
<p>If the FCO confirms that Amazon is of &#8220;paramount significance for competition across markets&#8221; &#8212; as defined by an amendment to the German Competition Act which came into force in January (aka, the GWB Digitalisation Act) &#8212; the authority will have greater powers to proactively impose conditions on how it can operate in order to control the risk of market abuse.</p>
<p>Section 19a of the GWB enables the FCO to intervene earlier, and the idea is more effectively, against the practices of large digital companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The provision gives the authority the power to prohibit digital giants from engaging in anti-competitive practices like self-preferencing; or using tying or bundling strategies intended to penetrate new markets &#8220;by way of non-performance based anti-competitive means&#8221;; or creating or raising barriers to market entry by processing data relevant for competition.</p>
<p>The FCO already has two other proceedings ongoing against Amazon &#8212; one looking at the extent to which Amazon is influencing the pricing of sellers on Amazon Marketplace by means of price control mechanisms and algorithms; and a second examining to agreements between Amazon and brand manufacturers to check whether exclusions placed on third-party sellers on Amazon Marketplace constitute a violation of competition rules &#8212; but a finding of &#8220;paramount significance&#8221; would enable the authority to &#8220;take early action against and prohibit possible anti-competitive practices by Amazon&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>Amazon has been contacted for comment on the FCO&#8217;s latest proceeding. <strong>Update: </strong>An Amazon spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We cannot comment on ongoing proceedings and will fully cooperate with the FCO. Amazon employs 23,000 people in Germany, has invested €28 billion in the country since 2010 and is working closely with local research. We continue to focus on innovating for both our customers and the businesses in Germany that sell in our store.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the second such application by the Bundeskartellamt to determine whether it can apply the new law to a tech giant.</p>
<p>In January the authority sought to extend the scope of an existing abuse proceeding, opened against Facebook in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts/">December</a> &#8212; related to Facebook tying Oculus use to Facebook accounts &#8212; saying it would look at whether the social media giant is subject to the GWB&#8217;s &#8220;paramount significance&#8221; rules, and whether, therefore, its linking of Oculus use to a Facebook account should be assessed on that basis.</p>

<p>Commenting on its latest move against Amazon in a statement, FCO president Andreas Mundt said: &#8220;In the past few years we have had to deal with Amazon on several occasions and also obtained far-reaching improvements for sellers on Amazon Marketplace. Two other proceedings are still ongoing. Parallel to these proceedings we are now also applying our extended competences in abuse control.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this particular case we are first of all examining whether Amazon is of paramount significance for competition across markets. An ecosystem which extends across various markets and thus constitutes an almost unchallengeable position of economic power is particularly characteristic in this respect,&#8221; he added. &#8220;This could apply to Amazon with its online marketplaces and many other, above all digital offers. If we find that the company does have such a market position, we could take early action against and prohibit possible anti-competitive practices by Amazon.&#8221;</p>
<p>In January Mundt made stronger comments vis-a-vis Facebook &#8212; describing its social networking ecosystem as &#8220;particularly characteristic&#8221; of the bar set by the new digital law for proactive interventions, and adding that: &#8220;In view of Facebook’s strong market presence with the eponymous social network, WhatsApp and Instagram such a position may be deemed to exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FCO proceeding to confirm whether or not Facebook falls under the law remains ongoing. (It also has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court/">pioneering case against Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;superprofiling&#8217; of users</a> that&#8217;s headed for Europe&#8217;s top court &#8212; which could result in an order to Facebook to stop combining EU users&#8217; data without consent, if judges agreed with its approach linking privacy and competition.)</p>
<p>Zooming out, the Bundeskartellamt&#8217;s moves to acquire more proactive powers at the national level to tackle big tech foreshadow planned updates to pan-European Union competition law. And specifically the ex ante regime which is set to apply to so-called &#8220;digital gatekeepers&#8221; in future &#8212; under the Digital Markets Act (DMA).</p>
<p>The DMA will mean that Internet intermediaries with major market power must comply with behavioural &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; set by Brussels, risking major penalties if they don&#8217;t play by the rules.</p>

<p>In recent years lawmakers across Europe have been looking at how to update competition powers so regulators can respond effectively to digital markets &#8212; which are prone to anti-competitive phenomena such as networking effects and tipping &#8212; while continuing to pursue<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/europe-is-now-formally-investigating-amazons-use-of-merchant-data/"> antitrust investigations</a> against big tech. (The Commission laid out a first set of charges against Amazon in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/europe-lays-out-antitrust-case-against-amazons-use-of-big-data/">November</a>, for example, relating to its use of third party merchant data.)</p>
<p>The problem is the painstaking pace of competition investigations into digital business vs the blistering speed of these players (and the massive market power they&#8217;ve amassed) &#8212; hence the push to tool up with more proactive antitrust powers.</p>
<p>Earlier, EU lawmakers also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/europe-asks-for-views-on-platform-governance-and-competition-tools/">toyed with the idea of a new competition tool</a> for digital markets but quietly dropped the idea &#8212; going on propose their ex ante regime for gatekeeper platforms, under the DMA, at the end of last year. However the proposal is in the process of being debated by the other EU institutions under the bloc&#8217;s co-legislative approach &#8212; which means it&#8217;s still likely years away from being adopted and applied as pan-EU law.</p>
<p>That in turn means German&#8217;s FCO could have an outsized role in clipping big tech&#8217;s wings in the meanwhile.</p>
<p>In the UK, now outside the bloc &#8212; where it too may have an influential role in reforming regional competition rules to rebalance digital market power &#8212; the government is also working on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition regime</a> aimed at big tech.</p>
<p>This year it set up a dedicated unit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">the DMU</a>, within the national Competition and Markets Authority which will be tasked with overseeing a regime that will apply to platforms which are identified as having &#8220;strategic market status&#8221; (akin to the German approach of &#8220;paramount significance for competition across markets&#8221;). And while the UK is taking a similar tack to the EU&#8217;s DMA, it has said the domestic regime will not sum to a single set of rules for all gatekeeper-style platforms &#8212; but rather there will be bespoke provisions per platform deemed to fall under the ex ante regulations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a month after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/gogoro-partners-with-indias-hero-motocorp-one-of-the-worlds-largest-two-wheel-vehicle-makers/">announcing a partnership with India’s largest two-wheeled vehicle maker</a>, Gogoro is taking another big step in its global expansion plans. This time the market is China, where Gogoro’s technology, including its swappable smart batteries, will be used in scooters made by <a href="https://www.haojue.com/about.html">Dachangjiang Group </a>(DCJ), one of the country&#8217;s biggest motorcycle makers, and <a href="https://www.yadea.com/">Yadea</a>, one of it top electric two-wheel companies. DCJ and Yadea will jointly invest $50 million in an operating company to develop new two-wheel vehicles with their own branding that use the Gogoro Network, including its batteries, drivetrains, controllers and other components.</p>
<p>“Think of it as DCJ and Yadea combining to create an AT&amp;T,” Gogoro co-founder and chief executive officer Horace Luke told TechCrunch. “Gogoro will be the technology that powers them, so think about it like we’re the Ericsson.”</p>
<p>Last month, Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp announced a strategic partnership to build a battery-swapping network and electric two-wheeled vehicles in India. Gogoro&#8217;s new deals in India and China are the biggest steps it has taken for its global strategy since launching the first Gogoro Smartscooter in 2015.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Gogoro’s swappable batteries, its signature technology, means riders can replace their batteries for new ones at charging stations that are small enough to fit on a sidewalk. In Taipei City, where Gogoro is based, its swapping stations are a common sight, usually tucked against storefronts or by the side of gas stations and parking lots. Since Gogoro’s batteries are swappable, electric vehicles that use them don’t need to be parked to be charged. This addresses “range anxiety,” or consumer concerns about how far an electric vehicle can go before it needs to be charged again. The main challenge is making sure there are enough swapping stations to be convenient for riders of two-wheeled vehicles powered by the Gogoro Network.</p>
<p>DCJ and Yadea’s joint venture will launch first in Hangzhou, its pilot city, before expanding into other cities in 2022. Vehicle availability and pricing will be announced later.</p>
<p>Last year, China’s government <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/china-bans-fossil-fuel-vehicles-electric/">introduced new regulations</a> that require all new cars sold by 2035 to use “new energy” instead of fossil fuel. Combined, DCJ and Yadea have 47,000 retailers, covering 358 cities, or more than half the cities in China. Luke said this means once the joint venture expands beyond Hangzhou, it will be able to grow quickly.</p>
<p>Gogoro positions itself as a turnkey solution for other electric mobility companies, and its own brand was a way to develop its charging infrastructure and reputation. In Taiwan, where Gogoro-powered two-wheeled vehicles now account for <a href="https://www.gogoro.com/news/2019-25-of-total-taiwan/">nearly a quarter of monthly sales</a>, its swappable batteries were first used in Gogoro Smartscooters before the technology was licensed to other makers like Kymco, Yamaha and Aeon.</p>
<p>“It was almost like a roundabout way to prove that the platform is feasible,” said Luke. “We had to build our own vehicles, our own retail chain and now we support 400,000 customers and 2,000 stations. That proof case enabled us to work with these larger partners, so when they asked us to pull up data, we could show them the unit economics, durability, stations and how it works. It took many years, but we were getting ready in the biggest way possible.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DCJ ships about two million motorcycles a year and the joint venture marks the first time it will build an electric motorcycle. “They’ve been looking for technology to transition to electric, and we’ve been talking to them for almost two years to prove that our platform is the right platform for them to start the transition to electric vehicles,” said Luke.</p>
<p>Yadea sold more than 10 million electric two-wheelers in 2020, but wanted an alternative to lithium-ion batteries, he added. Along with Aima, Yadea is one of the best-known affordable electric two-wheeler brands in China, while Niu dominates the premium market.</p>
<p>Gogoro has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gogoro">raised about $480 million</a> in funding since it was founded in 2011, with investors including HTC, Temasek Holdings and Generation Investment Management (GIM), the green-tech investment firm co-founded by former United States vice president Al Gore.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Gore, who is GIM’s chairman, said, “Gogoro’s partnership with Yadea and DCJ in China, which builds upon their existing work with Hero MotoCorp in India, sends a clear signal that the world’s two-wheel leaders are helping to fuel the sustainability revolution in Asia with smart battery swapping.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A technical violation is one of those Orwellian terms used by the U.S. government to occlude the absurd morass of process and procedure that is the modern criminal justice system in this country. After an offender has served their sentence, they are often placed under probation, which is accompanied by scores of rules on everything from where the person can go to who they can see. If a person commits a technical violation, they often are sent back to prison — perhaps months or years for an action as simple as being minutes late to a parole hearing.</p>
<p>Technical violations are expensive for all of us. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Technical-parole-violations-cost-state-at-least-16015598.php">New York’s capital newspaper the Times Union</a> reported that “New York imprisons more people for technical parole violations than any other state, and at a rate almost three times higher than the national average” and “The re-incarceration of those individuals cost taxpayers at least $683 million…” based on a <a href="https://justicelab.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Cost_of_Parole_Violations_in_New_York.pdf">report</a> by Columbia University and The Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform.</p>
<p>It’s Orwellian, and also Kafkaesque. And it’s a disastrous waste of public resources. Yet, it’s also a problem that lends itself to potential solutions, and that’s where Uptrust wants to make a difference.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://uptrust.co">Uptrust</a> is a service that connects people returning to society with their public defenders and court records, ensuring that they have the calendars, appointments, rules, and procedures they need to avoid technical violations — improving their re-entry into normal life while saving significant expenses for taxpayers.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has raised $2 million in seed funding from a trio of lead investors: the <a href="https://www.decarcerationfund.com/team">Decarceration Fund</a>, <a href="https://luminategroup.com">Luminate</a>, and <a href="https://stventureslab.com">Stand Together Ventures Lab</a>. That’s on top of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/uptrust-raises-new-money-to-fight-mass-incarceration-with-technology/">$1.3 million round we reported on last year</a>.</p>

<p>The company, which came together in 2015 and launched its first product in 2016, was co-founded by Jacob Sills and Elijah Gwynn as they explored how to improve the criminal justice system. They looked at areas like bail bonds, but kept coming back to a fundamental issue: many people were stuck in the system because of missed appointments or other technical violations. “There are way too many people not exiting the system … and they are circling back through,” Sills said.</p>
<p>Uptrust works through text messaging or its own app. Often, it’s linked with a public defender, since a defense attorney is more likely to get through to their clients than other members of the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>The company has been on a growth spree after years of trialing various iterations of its product, and it’s now located in 150 sites in 28 states, up from 30 sites just 18 months ago according to Sills. The state of Virginia, which currently uses the service in two sites, will expand it statewide by the end of this year or early next year.</p>
<p>Currently, the company charges a fee to governments to use the service, with the goal of limiting any financial costs to its end users who often lack the funds to pay. Longer term, however, the company sees a large opportunity in connecting its growing population of users to new services as they re-enter society. “More than half of them have challenges accessing health care,” Sills said, and he sees opportunities in areas as diverse as health care, finance and banking, and housing where the app could play a role in the future.</p>
<p>Yet, he acknowledged that this is still a “new market” that isn’t attractive to many traditional venture capital firms. So with this fundraise, Sills and his team decided to target funds that were deeply steeped in criminal justice issues who would understand both the problem being solved and how Uptrust could both succeed in its mission and also succeed as a business.</p>
<p>They also wanted what Sills described as “good diversity of thought.” Decarceration Fund invests in precisely what it says it does, and Luminate, which is part of the progressive-leaning Omidyar Network, is a philanthropy focused on civic engagement. Meanwhile, Stand Together Ventures Lab is funded by <a href="https://standtogether.org/about-us/">Stand Together</a> which was founded by Charles Koch, who in addition to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/koch-brothers-fortune-power-conservative-crusade-american-politics-2019-8">widely funding Republican and conservative causes</a>, has in recent years also <a href="https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/issue-areas/criminal-justice-policing-reform/">increasingly pursued criminal justice reform</a> to minimize the government’s power over private citizens.</p>
<p>Chris Bentley, managing principal at Decarceration Fund, picked Uptrust as the firm’s first investment because he believed that the company understood precisely what this unique population needed. There’s a “very significant history of well-intended companies in this space causing unintended consequences,” he said. The fund is focused on investing in companies with clear guardrails and business models that are aligned with positive outcomes. “Half of our investment committee are founders themselves but are also returning citizens with real, lived experience with the system,” he said.</p>
<p>Uptrust has now grown to 15 people, centered in San Francisco and also scattered up and down the Eastern Seaboard. The “track record of for-profit companies is pretty bad, since most of them just build what the criminal legal system wants,” Sills said. “We are trying to prove that you can make money and do good and have real impact.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Order and pay” platform for bars and restaurants <a href="https://ordr.menu/">Ordr</a> has raised a €10m ($12M) Series A round from Idekapital and OpenOcean.</p>
<p>Launched in Norway in 2020 it now counts IKEA, Nordic Choice, REKOM and Color Line as customers.  The company is now launching in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Ordr’s competitors include FlipDish, Onvi.com and WeOrder.</p>
<p>Ordr has a platform for digital menus, order-placement, and payment which, it claims, increases sales and reduces and queues at bars and restaurants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its branded phone solution consists of a ‘virtual POS’, replacing existing POS for restaurants and hotels to take orders and payment. The waiter can also use it. The company says customers don’t have to download a new app, while hotels and pubs can do deals with local restaurants and offer their menus on site.</p>
<p>founder and CEO Edwin Fjeldtvedt said: &#8220;Contrary to cash register systems that charge far too much and locks customers in, we’ve created the next generation cash register system that eliminates the need for old-fashioned POS systems and makes them virtual. At the same time, we’ve created an entirely new customer journey with the guest in the center based on the experience they are seeking.” He added that the app &#8220;took off&#8221; when the pandemic demanded new infection-control measures in the hotel, restaurant and catering industry.</p>
<p>Kristian Øvsthus Managing Partner at Idekapital said: “We have really been impressed by the vision, solution, management and the people they recruit as well as implementation ability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrik Backman, General Partner, OpenOcean sai: &#8220;Ordr has proven that their platform works very well, is a scalable solution that is applicable across a multitude of markets, and the company is now in a great place for an international venture. The catering industry desperately needs a new technology to stay competitive in the future and this is it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.shein.com/">Shein</a>&#8216;s quiet rise has reached a crescendo as the fast fashion e-commerce app takes the crown from Amazon as the most downloaded shopping app on <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/878577184/rank-history?app_slug=878577184&amp;market_slug=ios&amp;vtype=day&amp;countries=US&amp;device=iphone&amp;view=rank&amp;date=2021-02-18~2021-05-18&amp;legends=22">iOS</a> and <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/google-play/app/20600002127947/rank-history?app_slug=20600002127947&amp;market_slug=google-play&amp;vtype=day&amp;countries=US&amp;view=rank&amp;date=2021-04-19~2021-05-18&amp;legends=222">Android</a> in the United States, according to data from app tracking firm App Annie.</p>
<p>Its ascent is quiet because the startup, despite<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fBfGBjmzGy9CxB7VsoYjEA"> reportedly exceeding a $15 billion valuation</a>, maintains an unusually low profile and doesn&#8217;t try to make itself known to the media. The app, dubbed the &#8220;TikTok for e-commerce&#8221; by China-focused internet analyst Matthew Brennan in this <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/shein-the-tiktok-of-ecommerce?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NTAwNywicG9zdF9pZCI6MzY0ODM2OTMsIl8iOiJGaXpTUiIsImlhdCI6MTYyMTI1Njc5OCwiZXhwIjoxNjIxMjYwMzk4LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTAwMjUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.OCvxt-9N69bHLrOkzuTh0e4Eo6UMn6HCBwNuLFOHuys">thorough piece </a>on the startup, manufactures in China as many apparel retailers do.</p>
<p>The difference is Shein controls its own production chain, from design and prototype to procurement to manufacturing. Each step is highly digitized and integrated with another, which allows the company to churn out hundreds of new products tailored to different regions and user tastes at a daily rate. The strategy is not unlike TikTok matching content creators with users by using algorithms to understand their habits in real-time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s Black Lake raises $77M to give factories a digital upgrade&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/black-lake-fundraise-77-million/embed/#?secret=62HLb4xlL9" data-secret="62HLb4xlL9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On May 11, Shein became the most installed shopping app on Android in the U.S., and six days later took the top spot on iOS as well. It briefly topped the Android chart in late April.</p>
<p>The origin of Shein, which was previously named &#8220;She Inside,&#8221; is little understood. On its <a href="https://asia.shein.com/About-Us-a-117.html">official website</a>, it describes itself as an &#8220;international B2C fast fashion e-commerce platform&#8221; founded in 2008. There is no mention of its founder and CEO Chris Xu. In a 2018 <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-l9qvuRmq4bGF-4G_KSajg">corporate blog</a> posted on WeChat, it wrote that it was headquartered in Nanjing, an eastern Chinese city home known for its historical heritages and home to Chinese appliance giant Suning. It also opened offices in other major Chinese cities as well as the U.S., Belgium and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Shein&#8217;s low profile is perhaps expected in times of geopolitical tensions and heightened regulatory scrutiny over China-related tech companies around the world. Shein owns its sales channel and user data, which distinguishes it from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">swathe of generic consumer brands relying on Amazon</a> for customer acquisition without meaningful access to user data.</p>
<p>Last June, the Indian government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned Shein among 59 apps</a>, including TikTok and WeChat, that it deemed &#8220;prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of May 17, Shein was the top iOS shopping app in 54 countries and ranked top in the category on Android devices across 13 countries.</p>
<p>Shein has not announced who its investors are, but Chinese media reports have listed Capital Nuts, JAFCO Asia, Greenwoods Asset Management, IDG Capital, Sequoia Capital China, Tiger Global, and Xiaomi founder&#8217;s Shunwei Capital among its backers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Shein for comments on the story. Sequoia Capital China confirmed it&#8217;s an investor in Shein.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span><a href="https://www.creandum.com/">Creandum</a>, a European early-stage VC, is bringing on board two new key team members: Ex-Kry CSO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabinawizander/">Sabina Wizander</a> joins as Partner and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemmabloemen/">Gemma Bloemen</a> as Principal. Both will joins this summer. <a href="https://www.creandum.com/">Creandum</a> has previously backed the likes of Spotify, Klarna, Depop, Kahoot!, Trade Republic, among others. </span></p>
<p><span>Former engineer Wizander was previously at the firn in 2015</span>and worked on Kry’s seed round before joining the digital health startup in 2017. As Partner, she’ll be based in Stockholm.</p>
<p><span>“I am very excited to rejoin the Creandum team”, says Sabina Wizander. “Creandum has developed very impressively the last few years and I know I’m coming back to an even stronger team, brand and portfolio. I’m also coming in with different goggles than last time, both having been on the other side of the investor table for Kry’s series A to D, and being part of scaling a company +100X in  revenue and team. Given my background from Kry, health tech will be an area of focus for me, and anything climate related is very close to my heart.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Former McKinsey consultant and Uber executive</span> <span>Bloemen joins at Principal from the post of COO Elder, the UK-based home care specialist, and worked on their Series B fundraising process in 2019.</span></p>
<p>Bloemen said: “I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work with many different, talented entrepreneurs across a wide range of industries. As a VC-backed startup executive and angel investor I know how important it is to have the right partner along the journey, especially in the early years, and the Creandum team has an impeccable track record and reputation of adding true value as an investor. I am keen to help founders with the operational expertise I gained from my time at Uber and Elder and I’m looking forward to supporting Creandum’s efforts in further establishing their activity in the UK ecosystem and expanding their already very impressive portfolio.”</p>
<p>Staffan Helgesson, General Partner and founder of Creandum added: “Both Sabina and Gemma have an outstanding track record of deep operational expertise and an impact-driven mindset, which will provide additional value to our advisory team, offering the best support to the early-stage company founders we work with. With these two new hires in two different geographies, Creandum has reached another important milestone on its path to become the premier venture capital firm serving entrepreneurs across Europe, helping them scale into global winners.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most parts of Africa and the Middle East, a consumer journey and experience in buying furniture is not fun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical shopping process would entail looking out for the best price and quality and asking for recommendations and checking offline stores, one after another</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is rare to find one-stop shops, especially large offline ones, that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cater to the needs of consumers in the MENA region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home goods and furniture marketplaces have launched in the last three years around the region to meet this need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt&#8217;s <a href="https://homzmart.com/">Homzmart</a> is one such, and today the company is announcing it has closed its $15 million Series A investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mahmoud-ibrahim-889ab553">Mahmoud Ibrahim</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-mohamed-670ba4143">Ibrahim Mohamed</a>, but it didn&#8217;t launch until the first quarter of 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This round of financing follows a $1.3 million seed investment raised in February last year. According to the company, this brings the total amount raised to $17.2 million. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&#8217;s MSA Capital, one of the investors in Homzmart&#8217;s seed round, co-led this Series A investment alongside Nuwa Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other participating investors include EQ2 Ventures, Impact46, Outliers Capital, and Rise Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The furniture industry in Egypt has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> characterized by poor accessibility for consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homzmart&#8217;s marketplace collects designs, price ranges and other details of its retailers&#8217; products and solves high distribution costs for them by providing access to consumers who have flexible financing options</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, Homzmart said it incorporates AI to optimize content for retailers and intelligent tools to help customers with their purchasing decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a marketplace, we stand between the supply and demand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we connect furniture and home goods suppliers with consumers,&#8221; CEO Mahmoud Ibrahim told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like a big hassle to buy furniture in Africa and the Middle East. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s a pain all over the world when it comes to having a place that you can shop all your needs when it comes to home products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last 12 months, Homzmart claims to have grown 30x in sales. It also showcases more than 55,000 products from thousands of brands and merchants. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The online marketplace is tapping into the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding $80 billion industry where 14 million customers in the region search online for furniture monthly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Homzmart kicked off its hard launch and raised its seed round, it was right at the start of the pandemic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ibrahim said the company was uncertain that it would survive due to anticipated behavioral changes in consumer spending</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the opposite happened. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers in Egypt grew to like the product, resulting in more sales like most marketplaces and e-commerce platforms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this past year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the beginning, we were very worried and not sure how customers would react to buying furniture during the pandemic in the Middle East online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we&#8217;re actually amazed by the traction as it seemed like the region was waiting for something like this to happen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth experienced within the pandemic was one reason MSA Capital decided to double down on the startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As stated by Ben Harburg, the firm&#8217;s general partner, “The pandemic exposed the extreme vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of the Middle East’s archaic offline retail ecosystem, logistics and supply chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Into the void stepped Homzmart as the next-generation, digitally enabled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online marketplace and optimized logistics provider for large-item retail addressing both consumer and enterprise customers.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another reason behind the investment, the firm said, is the vast experience of both founders in e-commerce and fulfillment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mahmoud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the VP of Operations for Jumia Egypt before becoming the Group COO of Daraz, a Southeast Asian company acquired by Alibaba in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohamed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a Jumia alumnus and was part of the logistics development and expansion team in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although their experience with different verticals in everyday commerce in Jumia and Daraz was invaluable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the founders chose to launch in the niche furniture market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instead of building a similar model as their former employers. &#8220;We decided this was a really good vertical that we needed to focus on and hold ourselves accountable to digitizing in the region,&#8221; Mahmoud said about developing the niche product.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homzmart&#8217;s first year in business was all about understanding supply and demand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next couple of years is a strategy to expand across the MENA region, helping fulfill demand from a young and fast-growing consumer middle class</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whatever we did in Egypt, we need to do across the region. Homzmart isn&#8217;t looking to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an Egyptian platform, rather a regional platform,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched operations close to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Damietta City, Egypt, to focus on this regional market opportunity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be one of the largest furniture manufacturing hubs in the Middle East and thus allows Homzmart to streamline the region’s vertical industry supply chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An integral part of this supply chain is handling logistics and the movement of products from merchants to buyers. The company said a sizeable tranche of investments would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this effort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s next for the company when logistics is handled?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll say the thing that keeps me awake at night is the fact that our business is growing very fast. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we need to make sure that we&#8217;re building the right institutional infrastructure for that business, to make sure that after two or three years, we&#8217;re building like a very solid, multi-billion dollar business,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Mahmoud remarked.</span></p>
