										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even before the leaks, we all saw the Galaxy Buds Pro coming. It was a given that the company was planning to deliver its own take on Apple’s AirPods Pro, with improved sound quality and active noise canceling. The real secret weapon here, however, may be the price.</p>
<p>This morning’s S21 announcement found Samsung dropping $200 off the price of its flagship smartphone, and here the Galaxy Buds come in at $50 cheaper than the AirPods’ asking price. It’s not clearance-bin pricing exactly, but $199 is a pretty reasonable starting price. And Samsung’s earbud track record is a pretty good indication that the headphones will be solid.</p>
<p>The buds get a stated five hours of on-board battery life. That bumps up to eight hours with active noise canceling and Bixby Voice off &#8212; one of those things I can fairly easily live without. The case bumps things up to 18 and 28 hours, respectively. Pretty impressive claims for a quite small case.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The buds’ design improves on the Galaxy Buds Live’s bean design, trading it for something a bit more ergonomic that’s designed to reduce the contact area between the device and the ear. Per Samsung’s claims, the ANC is capable of reducing ambient sound up to 99%. You can tweak the settings from there. They sport an 11 mm woofer and 6.5 mm tweeter, along with three microphones for calls.</p>
<p>There are a couple of features specifically for Samsung devices, including auto switching between phones and tablets, as well as Dolby head tracking and microphone capabilities for video recording on the Galaxy S21.</p>
<p>The buds are available in three colors and go up for order today. They’ll hit retail tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung wasted no time this year. With Mobile World Congress pushed back six or so months, the hardware maker hitched its wagon to the tail end of the CES whirlwind &#8212; though unlike its press conference earlier in the week, the company is very much on its own for the latest Unpacked.</p>
<p>And why not? In spite of broader issues with the mobile industry (certainly not helped by the COVID-19 pandemic), the Galaxy line is still very much a draw. People may not be as eager to buy a flagship as they were a couple of years ago, but when they do, it’s frequently a Samsung device.</p>
<p>I tend to save pricing for the end of these kinds of posts, but it really bears mention up front. Samsung’s launching three key iterations of the S21 line today: the S21, S21+ and S21 Ultra. Those are priced at $799, $999 and $1,119 respectively, here in the States. That’s down from $999, $1,199 and $1,399 last year. While it’s true we’re still very much in the flagship price range here, a $200 drop is not insignificant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2096151" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096151" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2096151" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03_galaxys21_violet_pink_gray_white_1_201230030423.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="613" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03_galaxys21_violet_pink_gray_white_1_201230030423.jpg 2819w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03_galaxys21_violet_pink_gray_white_1_201230030423.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03_galaxys21_violet_pink_gray_white_1_201230030423.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03_galaxys21_violet_pink_gray_white_1_201230030423.jpg?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03_galaxys21_violet_pink_gray_white_1_201230030423.jpg?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03_galaxys21_violet_pink_gray_white_1_201230030423.jpg?resize=1536,920 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03_galaxys21_violet_pink_gray_white_1_201230030423.jpg?resize=2048,1226 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03_galaxys21_violet_pink_gray_white_1_201230030423.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096151" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>Rather, it points to a very conscious correction &#8212; one that goes beyond simply introducing a budget flagship or flagship lite to appease that segment of the market. Smartphone sales were already lagging before the pandemic, and the routine pricing of flagships above $1,000 was a considerable piece of that. Obviously the pandemic has only exacerbated the situation for myriad reasons, and 5G, which was expected to lead to a sales rebound didn’t move the needle nearly as much as anticipated.</p>
<p>Of course, 5G was a headliner feature for Samsung all the way back in 2019. The company has been all-in with the Galaxy line for a while now, and frankly, the feature is just kind of expected now. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Samsung is going back to imaging as a key differentiator.</p>
<p>Here’s what Mobile head TM Roh has to say about the new handsets:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are living in a mobile-first world, and with so many of us working remotely and spending more time at home, we wanted to deliver a smartphone experience that meets the rigorous multimedia demands of our continuously changing routines. We also recognize the importance of choice, especially now, and that’s why the Galaxy S21 series gives you the freedom to choose the best device for your style and needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>I absolutely understand why companies continue to go the “in these challenging times” route with these announcements, though I will say that, for the most part, the notion of device upgrades as a response to COVID-19 is really overstated here, beyond the aforementioned price drop. And I suspect that, with fewer people leaving the house these days, the dream of a smartphone as a primary productivity device has probably dampened of late.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096133" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096133" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2096133" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07_galaxys21_ultra_handson_spen_cover_201230064723.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07_galaxys21_ultra_handson_spen_cover_201230064723.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07_galaxys21_ultra_handson_spen_cover_201230064723.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07_galaxys21_ultra_handson_spen_cover_201230064723.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07_galaxys21_ultra_handson_spen_cover_201230064723.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07_galaxys21_ultra_handson_spen_cover_201230064723.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07_galaxys21_ultra_handson_spen_cover_201230064723.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07_galaxys21_ultra_handson_spen_cover_201230064723.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07_galaxys21_ultra_handson_spen_cover_201230064723.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096133" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>Still, the S21 Ultra, in particular, has one very important trick up its sleeve. Samsung is further blurring the line between the Galaxy S and Note by making the Ultra S Pen compatible. The experience will vary to some degree, but users will be able to use the stylus to write and draw on the handset. It’s sold separately and there’s no in-device housing for the pen, though Samsung will be offering a case that will hold it. It will be interesting to see if the company goes out of its way to distinguish the new Note, but it seems equally possible that the lines are simply converging. After all, the S Pen has long been the key distinguishing factor.</p>
<p>The devices also get Ultra-wideband capabilities, which will bring a number of capabilities, including the ability to unlock car doors and AR messages to find lost items. More detail on that soon, no doubt.</p>
<p>Visually, the biggest change here is the camera housing, which gets streamlined. I’m holding off judgement until I see it in person, but the new “Contour Cut” housing feels a bit more brutalist or perhaps industrial than the prior generation. The device also drops the expandable memory. A strong argument could be made that current on-board storage has made microSD redundant for many or most, but it was always a nice little differentiator.</p>
<p>The company has also removed the headphones charging adapter from the box, a move the world saw coming when the company deleted ads ribbing Apple from dropping accessories over what it said were environmental concerns. It’s the headphone jack all over again, because history rhymes.</p>
<p>Hardware-wise, the triple-camera situation is similar. On the S21 and 21+ you get a 12-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel wide and 64-megapixel telephoto with 30x space zoom. The Ultra bumps that up to a 12-megapixel ultra-wide, 108-megapixel wide and a dual-telephoto lens system with 3x and 10x optical zoom. That’s the first time Samsung has offered a dual-telephoto setup. The Ultra also sports improved low-light shooting, courtesy of the Bright Night sensor.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096139" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096139" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2096139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_galaxys21_series_all_colors_201230060017.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="465" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_galaxys21_series_all_colors_201230060017.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_galaxys21_series_all_colors_201230060017.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_galaxys21_series_all_colors_201230060017.jpg?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_galaxys21_series_all_colors_201230060017.jpg?resize=768,349 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_galaxys21_series_all_colors_201230060017.jpg?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_galaxys21_series_all_colors_201230060017.jpg?resize=1536,698 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_galaxys21_series_all_colors_201230060017.jpg?resize=2048,931 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_galaxys21_series_all_colors_201230060017.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>Software imaging updates include the ability to pull stills from 8K shooting, improved image stabilization and new modes like “Vlogger view,” which shoots from the front and rear camera simultaneously. I see limited use for that last bit in my own life, but I’m sure folks will find a creative use for it.</p>
<p>The screens measure in at 6.1, 6.7 and 6.8 inches (that last one is a decrease from the S20 Ultra’s 6.9 inches). All sport a 120Hz refresh rate that adapts based on usage. The phones also get the new Eye Comfort Shield, which reduces blue light as the day goes on.</p>
<p>Here in the States, all three phones sport the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. The S21 and S21+ start at 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the Ultra starts at 12GB and 256GB. The batteries are pretty healthy, clocking in at 4000, 4800 and 5000mAh. They’re all available for pre-order now and start shipping January 29.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security flaw in Ring&#8217;s Neighbors app was exposing the precise locations and home addresses of users who had posted to the app.</p>
<p>Ring, the video doorbell and home security startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/amazon-is-buying-smart-doorbell-maker-ring/">acquired by Amazon for $1 billion</a>, launched Neighbors in 2018 as a breakaway feature in its own standalone app. Neighbors is one of several neighborhood watch apps, like Nextdoor and Citizen, that lets users anonymously alert nearby residents to crime and public-safety issues.</p>
<p>While users’ posts are public, the app doesn’t display names or precise locations &#8212; though most include video taken by Ring doorbells and security cameras. The bug made it possible to retrieve the location data on users who posted to the app, including those who are reporting crimes.</p>
<p>But the exposed data wasn’t visible to anyone using the app. Rather, the bug was retrieving hidden data, including the user’s latitude and longitude and their home address, from Ring’s servers.</p>
<p>Another problem was that every post was tied to a unique number generated by the server that incremented by one each time a user created a new post. Although the number was hidden from view to the app user, the sequential post number made it easy to enumerate<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the location data from previous posts — even from users who aren&#8217;t geographically nearby.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095857" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095857" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095857" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ring-data-exposed.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1042" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ring-data-exposed.jpg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ring-data-exposed.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ring-data-exposed.jpg?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ring-data-exposed.jpg?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ring-data-exposed.jpg?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ring-data-exposed.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095857" class="wp-caption-text">Ring Neighbors app (left), and the data it was pulling in, including location data (right). (Image: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>The Neighbors app appeared to have about 4 million posts by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Ring said it had fixed the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Ring, we take customer privacy and security extremely seriously. We fixed this issue soon after we became aware of it. We have not identified any evidence of this information being accessed or used maliciously,&#8221; said Ring spokesperson Yassi Shahmiri.</p>
<p>Ring currently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/23/amazon-ring-camera-hack-lawsuit-threats">faces a class-action suit</a> by dozens of people who say they were subjected to death threats and racial slurs after their Ring smart cameras were hacked. In response to the hacks, Ring put <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21028092/amazon-ring-camera-hack-password-security-privacy-access-2fa">much of the blame on users</a> for not using &#8220;best practices&#8221; like two-factor authentication, which makes it harder for hackers to access a user&#8217;s account with the user&#8217;s password.</p>
<p>After it emerged that hackers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3a88k5/how-hackers-are-breaking-into-ring-cameras">were reportedly creating tools</a> to break into Ring accounts and over 1,500 user account passwords were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/ring-doorbell-passwords-exposed/">found on the dark web</a>, Ring made two-factor authentication <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/ring-slightly-overhauls-security-and-privacy-but-its-still-not-enough/">mandatory</a> for every user.</p>
<p>The smart tech maker has also faced increasing criticism <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/over-30-civil-rights-groups-demand-an-end-to-amazon-rings-police-partnerships/">from civil rights groups</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/u-s-senator-demands-answers-from-amazon-ring-over-its-police-partnerships/">lawmakers</a> for its cozy relationship with hundreds of U.S. police departments that have partnered with Ring for access to homeowners&#8217; doorbell camera footage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside its other announcements at Samsung&#8217;s event today, the company introduced its new Galaxy SmartTag Bluetooth locator, a lost item beacon for Samsung owners and a competitor with Tile. Like Tile and Apple&#8217;s forthcoming AirTags, the beacon can be attached to keys, a bag, a pet&#8217;s collar or anything else you want to track. Initially, these SmartTags will use Bluetooth to communicate with a nearby Samsung device, however, the company confirmed a ultra-wideband (UWB) powered version called the SmartTag+ will arrive later this year.</p>
<p>The latter would allow the SmartTag to better compete with Apple&#8217;s AirTags, which are also expected to take advantage of newer iPhones&#8217; UWB capabilities. Tile, in anticipation of this news, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">already developed</a> a UWB tracker arriving later this year, as well.</p>
<p>The SmartTag announced today, the Galaxy SmartTag11, will use Bluetooth and there is only one main SKU &#8212; not a range of products in different sizes or configurations. However, the tracker will be sold in two color variations: Black and Oatmeal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The tracker works with any Galaxy device, a Samsung rep told us, as long as the device runs Android 10 or later.</p>
<p>Device owners can then locate the missing item with the SmartTag attached using the SmartThings Find app.</p>
<p>This works similar to Tile and other BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) trackers. When the SmartTag is offline &#8212; meaning, disconnected from the Galaxy S21 or other device &#8212; it sends a BLE signal that can be detected by nearby Galaxy devices. When detected, the device will send the nearby location information to the SmartThings Fine app so you can locate the item. Samsung says the SmartThings Find user data is encrypted and securely protected, so your location and personal information is safe when you lose your device and use the app to search for it.</p>
<p>The app will also offer a variety of locating tools, including a &#8220;Notify me when it&#8217;s found&#8221; option, as well as &#8220;Search Nearby,&#8221; &#8220;Search,&#8221; and &#8220;Ring&#8221; tools. Like Tile, you can also use a SmartTag to locate a missing phone. In this case, you push the Galaxy SmartTag button twice to receive an alert to help locate the missing phone.</p>
<p>The tag can also be customized to do other things when pushed once, so you could easily turn on your lights or TV when you return home, for example.</p>
<p>Ahead of the announcement, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/samsung-smarttag-price-release-date-features-and-leaks">regulatory documents showed</a> the tracker as a slightly chunkier version of Tile&#8217;s trackers, powered by a C2032 cell battery, with Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<p>A Samsung rep could not provide us with the official and detailed tech specs for the device ahead of its announcement today, but we&#8217;ll update if the company figures it out. Unfortunately, without the confirmed details like whether the battery is user-replaceable, for example, or what the range is, it&#8217;s difficult to make a proper comparison to the existing trackers on the market. (You can&#8217;t always go off leaks alone here, either, as they aren&#8217;t always an indication of the final product. But the regulatory filings are likely a good starting point.)</p>
<p>To promote adoption, Samsung is giving away the new trackers pre-orders. From Jan. 14 to Jan. 28, 2021, consumers who pre-order the Galaxy S21 Ultra will get a $200 Samsung Credit plus a free Galaxy SmartTag. That could help the devices gain a little more traction, as Samsung&#8217;s previous investments in tracking gadgets, including its<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/10/17841570/samsung-smartthings-tracker-gps-lte-m"> 2018 LTE-based SmartThings tracking fobs,</a> never really caught on.</p>
<p>Outside the pre-order promotion, the SmartTags will cost $29.99 individually and will be sold starting Jan. 29th.</p>
<p>This is slightly steeper than Tile&#8217;s entry-level Bluetooth tracker, the <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/store/tiles/mate">Tile Mate</a>, which retails for $24.99.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Privacy concerns that have been driving app users to alternative chat apps like Signal and Telegram in recent weeks, since Facebook-owned WhatsApp announced a T&amp;Cs change, appear to also be generating some uplift for end-to-end encrypted email providers.</p>
<p>Two Europe-based <a href="https://protonmail.com">Protonmail</a> and <a href="https://tutanota.com">Tutanota</a> have reported an uptick in sign ups in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Protonmail founder Andy Yen told TechCrunch it&#8217;s seen a 3x rise in sign ups for its end-to-end encrypted webmail service &#8220;in recent weeks&#8221;. While Germany&#8217;s Tutanota <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/whatsapp-privacy-policy-signal-growth/">said</a> usage has doubled since privacy concerns about WhatsApp&#8217;s new T&amp;Cs sharing data with Facebook started circulating online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to see so many new users coming in. We already said in 2017 that the privacy-era has started, and we have been proven right ever since. People around the world are increasingly understanding that privacy matters and are no longer okay with fuelling the surveillance capitalism and the exploitation of their data by big tech such as Facebook. That&#8217;s why alternatives like Signal and <span class="il">Tutanota</span> are constantly growing,&#8221; said Tutanota co-founder Matthias Pfau in a statement.</p>
<p>The fully e2e encrypted chat app Signal hasn&#8217;t disclosed how many new users it&#8217;s racked up in recent weeks but WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton &#8212; who joined forces with Signal after he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/after-selling-his-company-to-facebook-for-19-billion-brian-acton-joins-deletefacebook/">left Facebook in 2018</a> &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">told us</a> earlier this week that usage has &#8220;exploded&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/halhod/status/1349490016045694976">Anecdotal reports</a> of newbies to the app &#8212; whose tagline is &#8220;say &#8216;hello&#8217; to privacy&#8221; &#8212; abound.</p>
<p>In my case, among the UK contacts joining what had previously been a tight clique of privacy nerds, I can report a couple of ex London neighbours, an old university acquaintance, an antique Tinder date and two former colleagues &#8212; while my India-based TC colleague, Manish Singh, showed me three full screenshots of sign-ups his Signal app had alerted him to in just &#8220;the last few days&#8221;.</p>

<p>Telegram, another long-standing WhatsApp chat app alternative, has also reported a huge influx of new users in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The platform offers end-to-end encryption as an option for one-to-one chats (via its &#8216;Secret Chats&#8217; feature), although unlike Signal e2e encryption is not the default rule. Nonetheless its founder, Pavel Durov, has been a very vocal critic of how Facebook treats users and their data. And that reputation baiting looks to be paying off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear Facebook has an entire department devoted to figuring out why Telegram is so popular,&#8221; Durov wrote in his Telegram Channel on January 8, seeking to capitalize on concerns about the looming WhatsApp&#8217;s T&amp;Cs change. &#8220;Imagine dozens of employees working on just that full-time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy to save Facebook tens of millions of dollars and give away our secret for free: respect your users,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>A few days later Durov posted again to report Telegram&#8217;s user-base had surpassed 500M monthly actives in the first week of this year &#8212; adding 25M new users &#8220;in the last 72 hours alone&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;These new users came from across the globe &#8212; 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA,&#8221; he went on, implying around 6% of the new sign-ups came from North America (where there have also been reports of Trump supporters turning to Telegram as an alternative channel to organize protests as mainstream social networks have closed down accounts and pages linked to threats of violence and insurrection).</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5M new users signed up every day,&#8221; he also said, adding: &#8220;We&#8217;ve had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Durov has posted another update today &#8212; saying sign ups have &#8220;only accelerated&#8221; (and welcoming a couple more heads of state to the platform).</p>
<p>The privacy-flavored mass migration of users to WhatsApp alternatives has pushed the Facebook-owned company to attempt a public firefight this week &#8212; over what it couches as &#8220;rumours&#8221; about the looming T&amp;Cs changes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We want to address some rumors and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption. <a href="https://t.co/6qDnzQ98MP">pic.twitter.com/6qDnzQ98MP</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A Facebook spokesperson told us there are no changes to WhatsApp’s data sharing practices anywhere in the world with this update &#8212; which they said is about providing clearer, more detailed information to users on how and why the company uses their data, and also provides information about how businesses can use WhatsApp to connect with their customers.</p>
<p>But Facebook&#8217;s problem is it&#8217;s spent 15+ years torching user trust around privacy. And all those broken promises are coming home to roost as users fly elsewhere &#8212; searching for a platform whose business model isn&#8217;t predicated on exploiting their attention.</p>
<p>Whatever the specific detail of the latest WhatsApp T&amp;Cs change, there&#8217;s no escaping the ugly truth that Facebook is an adtech giant. And it did <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/"><em>already</em> screw over WhatsApp users&#8217; privacy</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; when it U-turned on data-sharing with Facebook just a few short years after it shelled out </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/?_ga=2.9295926.201458190.1609746167-1757155993.1533833482">$19BN</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to line up all those extra eyeballs for its surveillance business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s why e2e encryption in the hands of Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s advertising empire simply can&#8217;t protect users&#8217; privacy in the same way that a not-for-profit app like Signal can. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And all those &#8216;personalized&#8217; Facebook features &#8212; be they stickers, filters, lens or whatever &#8212; are just a distraction from the underlying truth that Facebook makes money by removing users privacy through an interconnected mesh of apps and tools that are dedicated to tracking Internet users and linking digital activity to eyeballs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The techie obscurity that cloaked Facebook&#8217;s surveillance for years is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">steadily being unpicked</a>. And it&#8217;s clear that plenty of people don&#8217;t at all like what they see. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the pond, <a href="https://blog.google/products/devices-services/fitbit-acquisition/?utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=og&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=">Google this morning announced</a> that it has completed its acquisition of wearables pioneer, Fitbit. Google’s use of the vast amount of user health data has long been the key sticking point of regulatory concern of the deal. After all, targeted advertising continues to be at the heart of much of what the tech giant does.</p>
<p>As such, it’s unsurprising that both Google and Fitbit are looking to address concerns in their respective statements on the acquisition. Google, in particular is quick to insist that the deal is all about hardware – which has admittedly been a struggle in this particular vertical. Google’s efforts to compete with Apple in the fitness and wearable categories have been, at best, uneven.</p>

<p>Google SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh notes,</p>

We worked with global regulators on an approach which safeguards consumers&#8217; privacy expectations, including a series of binding commitments that confirm Fitbit users’ health and wellness data won&#8217;t be used for Google ads and this data will be separated from other Google ads data.</p>
<p>We’ll also maintain access to Android APIs that enable devices like fitness trackers and smart watches to interoperate with Android smartphones, and we’ll continue to allow Fitbit users to choose to connect to third-party services so you’ll still be able to sync your favorite health and fitness apps to your Fitbit account. These commitments will be implemented globally so that all consumers can benefit from them. We’ll also continue to work with regulators around the world so that they can be assured that we are living up to these commitments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park <a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/2021-update/?utm_source=go_mar&amp;utm_medium=glacier&amp;utm_country_code=en_US&amp;utm_campaign=blog">echoed the sentiment</a>, writing,</p>
<blockquote><p>The trust of our users will continue to be paramount, and we will maintain strong data privacy and security protections, giving you control of your data and staying transparent about what we collect and why. Google will continue to protect Fitbit users’ privacy and has made a series of binding commitments with global regulators, confirming that Fitbit users’ health and wellness data won’t be used for Google ads and this data will be kept separate from other Google ad data. Google also affirmed it will continue to allow Fitbit users to choose to connect to third party services.</p></blockquote>
<p>The levels and intimacy of data collected by these sorts of consumer devices has increased significantly over the past decade. Adding fuel to that fire is the push from companies like Fitbit and Apple to have their products taken more seriously as medical devices &#8212; or at least medically adjacent. Both companies have commissioned health studies, sought FDA clearance and worked with insurance companies. This push will no doubt only intensify.</p>
<p>The $2.1 billion deal&#8217;s completion comes with a number of concessions The EU in particular presented a number of caveats when it finally greenlit the acquisition last month. It noted at the time, &#8220;The commitments will determine how Google can use the data collected for ad purposes, how interoperability between competing wearables and Android will be safeguarded and how users can continue to share health and fitness data, if they choose to.”</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Google agreed to not use Fitbit data for ads for 10 years &#8212; which the Commission reserved the rights to extend by another 10 years. Google also agreed to maintain third-party developer access to Android APIs, in order to maintain some competition.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007, Fitbit became synonymous with the wearable fitness tracker space. Ultimately, however, the company struggled to maintain dominance with the arrival of the smartwatch, eventually ceding significant marketshare to the Apple Watch. The company eventually made headway in the category with devices like the Versa, but by then it was seemingly too late to continue on its own.</p>
<p>The deal certainly makes sense for Google, given its continued struggles to make a dent with Android Wear/wear OS. With Fitbit, the company&#8217;s getting an established hardware maker. It&#8217;s not entirely dissimilar from its purchase of HTC assets to help grow the Pixel line of phones, though there&#8217;s still enough cache in the Fitbit brand to keep it alive. Notably, Fitbit&#8217;s own growth in the smartwatch space was spurred on by several of its own acquisitions, including smartwatch pioneer and crowdfunding darling, Pebble.</p>
<p>In late 2019, Google also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/google-is-buying-fossils-smartwatch-tech-for-40-million/">acquired Timex smartwatch technology</a> for $40 million, making it extremely likely that the company will be taking on the Apple Watch directly. Understandably so, the product has not only been a massive hit for Apple, it&#8217;s opened the door to all sorts of health offerings, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat/">recently launched Fitness+</a>. If this year&#8217;s CES proved anything, it&#8217;s that home workouts are a huge business with lots of upside, with even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/companies-rush-to-replace-the-gym-at-ces/">Samsung getting into the act</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emergency services continue to be a major force when it comes to coping with the Covid-19 health pandemic, and today a company that is building technology to help them run better is announcing a round of funding to continue expanding its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://carbyne911.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbyne</a> &#8212; an Israeli startup that has built a cloud-based platform aimed at emergency services to help them pinpoint more complete information about the people who are calling in, and to provide additional telemedicine services to start responding faster &#8212; has picked up $25 million.</p>
<p>The plan will be to take the service &#8212; which was already seeing strong growth before the pandemic &#8212; to the next level in terms of the technology it is building and the markets and organizations it is serving.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Carbyne was not founded last year: we were already pushing cloud services and video and location to 911 for quite a while and had served 250 million people before the pandemic,&#8221; said Amir Elichai, the CEO, in an interview. &#8220;But cloud solutions for emergency services went from nice to have to must have with Covid.&#8221; The company has partnerships with public health providers as well as with groups like CentralSquare and Global Medical Response (GMR), and says that in the U.S. it is on target to cover some 90% of the market.</p>
<p>The Series B1 is being led by Hanaco Ventures and ELSTED Capital Partners, with former CIA Director General David Petraeus, Founders Fund, FinTLV, and other past investors also participating.</p>
<p>The fact that this is a B1 round points to more funding on the way for the company in coming months. In any case, the $25 million is more than the company had planned to raise.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plan was to raise $15 million in 2020. After Covid started I decided we didn’t want to let anyone go, but we didn’t know what the situation would be. So we cut salaries instead across the board,&#8221; said Elichai. &#8220;But then we started to double revenues starting in Q2, and then in Q3 and Q4 grew 160%. It was straightforward to raise this money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is coming on the heels of very strong growth for the company, in particular in the last year.</p>
<p>Carbyne&#8217;s services now cover about 400 million people, with a new implementation launching every 10 days since March of last year.</p>
<p>Elichai, who co-founded the company with Alex Dizengoff (CTO) and Yony Yatsun (engineering lead), said in an interview that in the last nine months, Carbyne has provided some 155 million location points to emergency medical services teams. Newer products are also growing. The services for EMS teams to provide help remotely have racked up 1.3 million minutes of video in that time, he said.</p>
<p>From what we understand, the funding puts Carbyne&#8217;s valuation at over $100 million. Although Elichai declined to give a specific figure, for some context, the company was valued at &#8220;around&#8221; $100 million when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/carbyne-raises-15m-for-its-next-gen-911-service-as-founders-fund-invests-in-its-first-israeli-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last raised in 2018</a>, a $15 million round that marked the first time that Founders Fund had invested in an Israeli startup.</p>
<p>The growth of the last year, and the ongoing demands on the business, point to that &#8220;over&#8221; being strong. Indeed, since its last round, the world at large, and the startup itself, have undergone some significant changes.</p>
<p>2018 and whatever dramas we were experiencing back then now feel like a distant, almost halcyon?, past when compared to some of the crises of the moment. One in particular, the coronavirus pandemic, has a direct connection to Carbyne.</p>
<p>Covid-19, the illness the results from the virus, has proven to be a pernicious and dogged ailment, often hitting people with its most dire and serious symptoms &#8212; the inability to breathe and organ failure &#8212; just when they start to think that they might be recovering. (Of course, that&#8217;s not the case for everyone, thankfully, but still it happens much too often to ignore.)</p>
<p>That has put a huge strain on emergency response services, from those that are fielding initial callouts, through to those making first contact with patients, and those at the hospitals bringing in and caring for the most serious cases. In many cases, those working these services have been stretched to overcapacity. The situation in many cities is nothing short of dire.</p>
<p>Carbyne&#8217;s technology has come into its own as a way not just to help those people do their jobs better by providing them with more data, but by becoming a means to those services channelling data back to those people calling in.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, the company has undergone some significant shifts in how it delivers its services: when I covered the startup&#8217;s last funding round in 2018, for example, it provided some services directly to EMS organizations, but mainly it needed users to install an app, or provide that technology through another app, in order to work. Now, Elichai says that the company has integrated some location services from companies like Google to remove the need to use an app to connect users to its platform.</p>
<p>Similarly, the startup has taken a strong lead in how it collaborates with municipalities not just to provide services to make their operations more efficient, but to help offset them getting overwhelmed. A project in that vein was a <a href="https://carbyne911.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GT20_CASE_STUDY_AWS_JPS_v.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent undertaking in New Orleans</a>, which Elichai said played a part in helping the city from really buckling under and managing the Covid-19 outbreak. More on that here:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rvc4pjPR1AY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Longer term, in countries like the US and elsewhere, there is a strong argument to be made for a lot of legacy services in 911-style emergency response finally getting the updates they have needed for years.</p>
<p class="p1">Specifically, earlier this month, a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill approved in Congress earmarks $12 billion in funding for next-generation 911 deployments.</p>
<p>Carbyne believes that by 2023, it will be serving some 1.5 billion people, and it&#8217;s moves like this in the U.S. that point to why that might not be so far-fetched, Covid-19 or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://x1creditcard.com">X1 Card</a> is raising a $12 million funding round. The company is building a credit card that sets limits based on your current and future income, not your credit score.</p>
<p>Spark Capital is leading the round with Jared Leto, Aaron Levie, Jeremy Stoppelman, Max Levchin and Ali Rowghani also participating. American Express veteran Ash Gupta is also joining the company as an advisor —&nbsp;he was the Chief Risk Officer of American Express.</p>
<p>The company says that it has attracted nearly 300,000 signups on its waitlist. I covered X1 Card <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/x1-card-is-a-credit-card-based-on-your-income-not-your-credit-score/">back in September</a> and it attracted a lot of readers. So that number doesn’t surprise me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The X1 Card is a stainless steel Visa credit card with a different origin story. When you apply for a card, instead of determining your limits based on your credit score, the company wants to see your current and future income.</p>
<p>The startup believes the credit score system is outdated and doesn’t reflect your creditworthiness. That’s why it doesn’t use it to calculate limits. Your credit score still affects your variable APR (from 12.9% to 19.9%), but that’s it.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of software features that work with the credit card. For instance, you can track your subscriptions from the X1 app, you can also generate an auto-expiring virtual card for free trials that require a credit card. You also get notifications for refunds.</p>
<p>As for rewards, you get 2X points on all purchases. If you’re a heavy user and you spend more than $15,000 on your card per year, you’re upgraded to a new tier and earn 3X points. There’s also a viral element as you get a boosted reward level when you refer a friend —&nbsp;you get 4X points for a month. You can then spend your points with retail partners.</p>
<p>The company has promised a lot of features and now has enough cash in its bank account to deliver. Let’s see if the company can live up to the hype once the first customers get their cards. But it’s clear that the credit score system is outdated.</p>

<p>Blue Origin is launching its New Shepard suborbital rocket for the first time in 2021, with a liftoff planned for 9:45 AM CST (10:45 AM EST/7:45 AM PST) [Update: Now targeting 10:57 AM CST (11:57 AM EST/8:57 AM PST)] from its launch facility in West Texas. This is the 14th flight of New Shepard, and it includes some key testing activities for Blue Origin in preparation for its first human spaceflight missions.</p>
<p>The company has been flying a crew capsule on board its rocket for quite a while now, albeit empty (or rather, loaded with scientific and other cargo, rather than people). This version includes some key systems that will be used when astronauts are inside, however, including communications systems, and cabin environment regulation technologies that will make the trip for private spacefarers more comfortable and safe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Blue Origin has had 13 previous successful New Shepard launches before, so one can reasonably expect things to go well today. But the company&#8217;s focus on that crew cabin and gathering data around systems crucial to human spaceflight is an exciting indicator that people could be on board that spacecraft sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The stream above will being 30 minutes before the liftoff time, so at around 10:15 AM EST/7:15 AM PST.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency exchange company <a href="https://www.gemini.com/">Gemini</a> is acquiring <a href="https://www.blockrize.com/">Blockrize</a> and announcing a new product today based on Blockrize’s work. Later this year, the company is launching a credit card that works like a regular credit card — but you earn bitcoin rewards based on your purchases.</p>
<p>The credit card will work like any other credit card and will be available in the U.S. Customers will earn up to 3% in bitcoin rewards (again, <em>up to</em> 3%). You&#39;ll be able to earn other crypto assets as well. Those rewards will be deposited on your Gemini account.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the first time a company is announcing a credit card with bitcoin rewards. BlockFi already announced its own card <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-announces-early-2021-launch-for-bitcoin-rewards-credit-card">back in December</a>. Both companies have yet to launch their cards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a comparison, BlockFi promises 1.5% rewards on fiat purchases. There&#39;s a $200 annual fee but you get $250 back if you spend at least $3,000 with the card in the first three months.</p>
<p>This new category of credit cards could be interesting for people who want to slowly acquire cryptocurrencies without going through an exchange. Similarly, some crypto enthusiasts don&#39;t want to use a debit card tied to a cryptocurrency wallet as they don&#39;t want to spend their crypto assets — HODL, as they say.</p>
<p>You could consider those credit cards as an alternative to credit cards that give you cashback. Sure, you don&#39;t get points that you can exchange for perks. But you get crypto assets without having to think about it.</p>
<p>Gemini customers can sign up to the <a href="https://gemini.com/credit-card/waitlist">waitlist</a> today. Blockrize has been working on a credit card for some time. While it is now part of Gemini, people who previously signed up to Blockrize’s waitlist are still on the waitlist.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors in the round included George Kurtz, the president and chief executive of CrowdStrike, and George Roberts, a partner at OpenView Venture Partners and the former executive vice president of North American sales at Oracle.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Value Management [sic] as a practice is now a C-suite priority and increasingly considered an enterprise-critical function alongside software systems like CRM, marketing automation, and project management,” said Sameer Gandhi, Partner, Accel, in a statement. “In 2019, we invested in a SAFE round in DecisionLink because we believed in the market opportunity for scalable [value management]. Now, we have been so impressed by DecisionLink’s execution and its ability to drive this transformation on behalf of customers, that we are excited to lead its Series A round.”</p>
<p>Businesses are constantly looking for ways to benchmark themselves against their competitors or find new ways to better service them. Most of these strategies don&#8217;t take off, or are variations on a theme, but value management seems to have legs &#8212; especially given the accessibility of all kinds of benchmarking data points that are publicly available.</p>
<p>Accel-backed portfolio companies like CrowdStrike, PagerDuty, and DocuSign are using the service and so are companies like ServiceNow, Marketo, NCR, and VMWare.</p>
<p>These are big names in enterprise software, and the signal that their adoption of DecisionLink&#8217;s software provided must have played a role in Accel&#8217;s decision to invest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s use of dark patterns that add friction to the process of terminating a Prime subscription is being targeted by 16 consumer rights groups in Europe and the US which are taking coordinated action to urge regulatory intervention.</p>
<p>One of them &#8212; Norway&#8217;s Consumer Council (NCC) &#8212; has also published a <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf">report</a> calling out what it describes as <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the ecommerce giant&#8217;s </span>&#8220;manipulative&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">unreasonably cumbersome&#8221; unsubscribe process for Prime. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The report has been punningly titled &#8216;<a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf">You can log out, but you can never leave</a>&#8216;.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It should be as easy to end a subscription as it was to subscribe in the first place. Amazon should facilitate a good user experience instead of hindering customers and tricking them into continuing paid services they do not need or want,&#8221; said NCC director of digital policy, Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In our view, this practice not only betrays the expectations and trust of consumers but breaches European law,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Prime subscription is a key tool in Amazon&#8217;s arsenal, generating reliably recurring revenue while simultaneously encouraging users to lock themselves in to making additional purchases via the carrot of unlimited &#8216;free&#8217; fast shipping (which applies to a subset of qualifying items on the marketplace). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Other perks Amazon throws in to juice Prime membership include streaming movies, TV shows, music and games, plus exclusive shopping programs and discounts (though the exact bundle varies by market).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">However a lock-in vibe also applies when trying to end a Prime subscription, per the complaints, because Amazon requires users to successfully navigate multiple menus, select from confusingly worded multiple-choice options and scroll past various distracting and/or irrelevant interstitials and dead space in order to locate the button that actually ends their subscription.  </span></p>
<p>And, don&#8217;t forget, this is the same company that famously patented a &#8216;1-click&#8217; button for consumers&#8217; cash to pour into its coffers&#8230;</p>
<p>The NCC has made the below video illustrating the various dark patterns Amazon deploys to try to nudge Prime subscribers away from unsubscribing &#8212; including a cartoon of a dog barking because, uh, we have no idea tbh&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpEQ4OWNO4Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Complaints against Amazon&#8217;s click-heavy process for Prime unsubscribing are being filed by consumer groups in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Switzerland and Norway and the US &#8212; so a variety of national and regional consumer protection laws are involved.</p>
<p>The NCC&#8217;s <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/complaint-against-amazon-prime.pdf">complaint</a>, for example, makes reference to Norway&#8217;s Marketing Control Act &#8212; which implements the EU&#8217;s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive &#8212; providing a framework for &#8220;what marketing, commercial practices and terms of service the service providers are allowed to use in different markets&#8221;, as it explains in the complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Marketing Control Act section 6 implements the general clause in Article 5 of the Directive which states that an unfair commercial practice is banned. What constitutes an unfair commercial practice is defined in the second paragraph of section 6, which states that a commercial practice is unfair if it breaches &#8216;good business practices&#8217; toward consumers, and is able to significantly alter a consumer’s financial conduct, so that the consumer makes a decision that they would not otherwise have made,&#8221; the NCC argues.</p>
<p>Some of the coordinated complaints will be less formal, taking the form of letters written to consumer protection agencies urging them to investigate. In the US, for example, the FTC will be urged to &#8220;investigate Amazon’s practices and analyze whether they violate Section 5 of the FTC Act&#8221;.</p>
<p>While in Germany the VZBV consumer protection agency told us it&#8217;s currently assessing Amazon&#8217;s cancellation process for Prime &#8212; which it noted &#8220;looks a bit different&#8221; to the one in the Norwegian complaints &#8212; saying it&#8217;s not yet clear whether or not it will file a court injunction over the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike the other consumer organisations taking part in this concerted action, we’re not sending complaints to authorities,&#8221; the VZBV spokesperson added. &#8220;My employer, the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv) is able to send legal warnings and, if demands to cease and desist are not being met, sue companies infringing consumer protection laws in its own capacity. We will do so if there is enough legal merit to this case. But as I said, it is not completely decided yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>We contacted Amazon for comment on the complaints against the Prime unsubscribe process and it denied making it unclear and difficult for members to cancel their subscription, arguing that it only takes &#8220;a few clicks&#8221; online or &#8220;a quick phone call&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s its full statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon makes it clear and easy for Prime members to cancel their subscription at any time, whether through a few clicks online, a quick phone call or by turning off auto renew in their membership options. Customer trust is at the heart of all of our products and services and we reject the claim that our cancellation process is unfair or creates uncertainty. We take great pride in the Prime service and the number of ways it makes our members lives easier, but we make it easy for customers to leave whenever they choose to. The information we provide in the online cancellation flow gives a full view of the benefits and services members are cancelling.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consumer groups banding together to apply pressure on tech giants to change dubious practices is not a new phenomenon. Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/google-faces-gdpr-complaint-over-deceptive-location-tracking/">2018</a>, for example, a number of European groups coordinated complaints against Google&#8217;s &#8216;deceptive&#8217; harvesting of location data. Just under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/googles-location-tracking-finally-under-formal-probe-in-europe/">a year ago</a> the Irish Data Protection Commission opened a formal investigation &#8212; which remains ongoing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.upgrade.com">Upgrade</a> has been positioning itself as a neobank. And yet, the company has mostly been focused on personal loans and more recently credit cards. You couldn&#8217;t just replace your bank account with Upgrade. Upgrade is adding two important missing pieces of the puzzle with <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/rewards-checking/">checking accounts and debit cards</a>.</p>
<p>With today’s launch, Upgrade competes more directly with other challenger banks, such as <a href="https://www.chime.com">Chime</a>, <a href="https://n26.com">N26</a> and others. You can open a checking account, control it from a mobile app, send and receive money from that account.</p>
<p>There are no monthly fees and no minimum account balance. Under the hood, Cross River Bank provides FDIC-insured checking accounts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You also get a debit card with your checking account. When it comes to ATM withdrawals, Upgrade will reimburse ATM fees for its most loyal customers up to five times a month. You need to maintain a minimum balance or set up direct payroll deposit for that feature.</p>
<p>Debit card payments on subscriptions and common everyday expenses let you earn 2% cash back. Eligible purchases include convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants, food deliveries, etc. Your earn 1% on other debit charges.</p>
<p>Rewards on debit card transactions are somewhat uncommon. Most financial companies focus on credit card rewards as the interchange fees on credit card transactions are much higher. Debit cards don’t generate as much interchange revenue.</p>
<p>“Neobanks in particular cannot pay high rewards (or any rewards at all) on debit cards because the interchange fee is often their only source of revenue,” Upgrade CEO Renaud Laplanche told me in an email.</p>
<p>And interchange fees can add up if you manage to attract millions of customers. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-14-5-billion-chime-proved-silicon-valley-investors-wrong">According to The Information</a>, Chime generated more than $600 million in revenue last year thanks to interchange fees.</p>
<p>The company still plans to generate the vast majority of its revenue from credit products. “Our strategy is to monetize our base through credit,” Laplanche said.</p>
<p>Upgrade also offers a credit card with 1.5% cash back on all purchases. If, for one reason or another, you can’t pay your monthly balance payment, the company helps you combine monthly charges into installment plans that you can pay back over 24 to 60 months. You pay down your balance at a fixed rate with equal monthly payments. Upgrade customers who use the company’s checking account will get lower rates on Upgrade loans.</p>
<p>You can also get a personal loan from Upgrade without a credit card or a checking account. And maybe you’ll end up discovering Upgrade’s other products after signing up to a personal loan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tresl.co/">Tresl</a>’s flagship product, e-commerce intelligence platform Segment Analytics, is designed to give small brands on Shopify access to the same kind of analytics larger online retailers have. Founded by former LinkedIn data scientists, Tresl is <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/2a93c8ef-f501-491b-9d88-86cea40f4dc7?index=1">currently exhibiting at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena</a>.</p>
<p>Segments Analytics analyzes a Shopify store’s data and then automatically sorts visitors into more 30 pre-built customer segments based on their browsing habits, spending and how likely they are to make repeat purchases.</p>
<p>This means that brands can identify specific groups of shoppers and use Segments Analytics&#8217; suggestions for targeted campaigns without spending too much on data analytics, marketing or user acquisition. For example, one of the segments the platform identifies are people who have made one purchase already, but are unlikely to buy again unless they are see an ad or promotion soon. Segments Analytics can be used for advertising across multiple channels, including email, Facebook and Google.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tresl claims that brands using Segments Analytics have increased their clickthrough rates on abandoned cart flows (or reminders sent to customers who have unpurchased items) by 30% and grown sales by 40% month-over-month within one month of implementing the platform.</p>
<p>Segments Analytics is currently available through the Shopify App Store, with subscriptions starting from $79 a month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.3drens.com/">3Drens</a>’ IoT mobility management platform not only lets fleet operators track where their vehicles are, but also produces data that helps them make business decisions. The company began operating in Taiwan, where it is based, before expanding into Southeast Asia. Currently <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/2befd832-75d3-4057-adaa-29a67d822747?index=1">presenting at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena</a>, 3Drens is focused on the increased demand for logistics during COVID-19. For example, its tech can potentially be used to enable smaller e-commerce retailers to rent unused capacity on delivery vehicles from larger platforms.</p>
<p class="p1">The company’s clients also come from the vehicle rental, ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Founded in 2017, one of 3rens’ first clients was a electric scooter company that mostly serves tourists. It installed 3Drens’ IoT box onto scooters to send alerts if scooters were potentially involved in accidents or if a user went over the time they had paid for. It also generated a heat map of where the scooters traveled the most often, so the company was able to make partnerships with popular venues and attractions.</p>
<p class="p1">3Drens’ platform can also help logistics services pick the right type of vehicle for a delivery, predict the best routes and assign new tasks for drivers on their way back after an order is fulfilled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.oflo.io/">OFLO</a> is a voice communication system designed to replace traditional walkie talkies. Its hardware is more compact and lightweight, with a bone conduction headset, and capable of covering unlimited distances and multiple channels. Created by Origami Labs, OFLO is also connected to software that features auto logging and productivity tools for teams who don’t have access to screens while they are working.</p>
<p>The startup, whose clients include property management company JLL and luxury hotel chain The Peninsula, is currently <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/4156af83-7ac4-45f4-9716-3120e13bb1ed?index=1">showcasing OFLO</a> at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion.</p>
<p>OFLO was created for the millions of frontline workers in health care, hospitality, security, manufacturing and other sectors who can’t sit in front of a computer or look down at mobile screens frequently. The walkie talkies many of them currently use cover only limited distances and have a single channel that is shared by multiple workers. OFLO’s advantages include letting users call specific co-workers and it is also cross-platform, so someone talking on a smartphone can call a person on a OFLO walkie talkie. Its software includes features like live chats, transcriptions, task management and GPS location.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>OFLO is available on a subscription plan for $6 per user a month. Wong said its monthly recurring revenue is currently increasing 20% a month, with a target of $100,000 a month by the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The system builds on Origami Labs’ other tech, including <a href="https://orii.io">Orii</a>, a voice-powered ring. Co-founder and chief executive officer Kevin Johan Wong told TechCrunch the company sees OFLO as &#8220;almost a screenless smartphone alternative.&#8221; One of the reasons Wong became interested in working on voice technology is because his father, Peter Wong, is a visually-impaired programmer who helped develop Microsoft’s accessibility tools.</p>
<p>“Our company’s mantra is to try to create devices that are equalizing, that allow people to interact with computers screenless-ly,” said the younger Wong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the proliferation of subscription services, combined with our lives becoming almost 100% digital, there’s a rising need to be able to manage these services. But most banks don’t have much of an answer. Step in <a href="https://minnatechnologies.com/">Minna Technologies</a>, which sells in its subscription management services into banking apps.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $18.8 million (€15.5m / £14m) in Series B fundraising from Element Ventures, MiddleGame Ventures, Nineyards Equity and Visa, to expand its open banking technology to banks globally.</p>
<p>Founded in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2016, Minna enables customers to manage subscription services via their existing bank’s app. Using Minna, customers can terminate subscriptions just from their banking app, automatically, cutting the data and financial ties between the merchant and customer. The platform can also notify customers when a free trial is about to end and facilitates utilities switching allowing them to find better deals. So far, Minna has partnerships with Lloyds Banking Group, Swedbank and ING.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Minna’s technology reduces the burden on a bank’s call centers, plus banks can also benefit financially from Minna’s role in facilitating utility switching, raising the prospect of banks becoming marketplaces.</p>
<p>The appearance of Minna suggests that the first wave of neo-banks is about to be accompanied by a second wave of overlayed services such as this. The average European is spending £301 (€333) a month on 11 subscriptions, which is predicted to increase to £459 (€508) a month on 17 subscriptions by 2025. IDC predicts that by 2050, 50% of the world’s largest enterprises will focus the majority of their businesses on digitally enhanced products, services, and experiences. Subscriptions are even coming from car makers such as Volvo.</p>
<p>Joakim Sjöblom, CEO and co-founder of Minna Technologies, said: “Over the past four years the subscription economy has exploded from Spotify and Netflix to even iPhones and cars. It&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to keep track of the payments and harder for banks to handle inquiries to shut them down. Minna’s tech improves the procedure for banks by simplifying the process, as well as providing an in-demand digital product that consumers are starting to expect from their financial institutions.”</p>
<p>Sjöblom told me that by largely working with incumbent banks, Minna is providing them with a way to fight back against challenger banks.</p>
<p>Pascal Bouvier, Managing Partner, MiddleGame Ventures said: “We strongly believe in a vision where banks develop their checking account offerings into “connected and intelligent” platforms and where retail clients are able to interact in many more ways than in the recent past.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google said on Thursday it has pulled some personal loan apps from Play Store in India and was implementing stronger measures to prevent abuse following reports that said several firms were targeting vulnerable borrowers in the country and then going to extreme lengths to recover their money.</p>
<p>The Android-maker said users and government agencies in India recently flagged several personal loan apps and the company reviewed hundreds of them. The review found an identified number of apps violated Play Store’s safety policies and they were immediately removed from the Store.</p>
<p>Google, whose Android operating system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/indian-startups-explore-forming-an-alliance-and-alternative-app-store-to-fight-googles-monopoly/">powers 98% smartphones in India</a>, said it has asked the developers of the remaining identified apps to demonstrate that their apps are in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations. (In an email reviewed by TechCrunch, Google had asked a developer to provide documentation within five days.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Apps that fail to do so will be removed without further notice. In addition, we will continue to assist the law enforcement agencies in their investigation of this issue,” the company said.</p>
<p>Users have identified several lending apps including 10MinuteLoan and Ex-Money in India in recent months that granted small ticket loans (typically in the range of $50 to $200) to people for short tenures without much verification to determine their eligibility and then <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-instant-loan-apps-drained-crores-from-borrowers/articleshow/80170284.cms">charged steep processing fees</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid such abuse, Google said Play Store will only allow personal apps that require customers to make their repayment in 60 days or longer.</p>
<p>When borrowers struggled to repay their debt in the short period, collection agents on behalf of some lending apps <a href="https://the-ken.com/story/indias-instant-loan-app-crisis-is-made-in-china/">among other ill tactics</a>, threatened to embarrass them in front of their friends, colleagues and family. In November, local newspaper Indian Express <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2020/nov/25/bullied-online-by-money-lending-app-company-chennai-man-kills-self-2227722.html">reported</a> that a 23-year-old man committed suicide after being bullied by a money lending app. It&#8217;s not the only reported suicide case linked to such harassment in recent months.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Local media also <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-instant-loan-apps-drained-crores-from-borrowers/articleshow/80170284.cms">reported</a> that police in the city of Hyderabad recently froze bank accounts holding $58 million for alleged scams conducted through 30 lending apps, none of which had approval from the nation&#8217;s central bank. A preliminary investigation found that these apps had processed nearly $2.9 billion through 14 million transactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/logic">Srikanth L</a> of CashlessConsumer, a consumer collective on digital payments, told TechCrunch that Google took too much time to turn its attention to this issue. Srikanth, who has been tracking online lending apps in India for several quarters, said more than 100 apps in the last 10 days and about 450 in recent months had disappeared from Google Play Store, citing his <a href="https://twitter.com/logic/status/1349679647340994562">own analysis</a>.</p>
<p>He also criticized Google for not doing enough to stop apps from gleaning a wide range of data from a customer&#8217;s Android phone. &#8220;They still don&#8217;t mandate these apps to disclose their website and physical address,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>“To protect user privacy, developers must only request permissions that are necessary to implement current features or services. They should not use permissions that give access to user or device data for undisclosed, unimplemented, or disallowed features or purposes,&#8221; wrote Suzanne Frey, Vice President, Product, Android Security and Privacy, <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/01/protecting-against-harmful-financial.html">in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developers must also only use data for purposes that the user has consented to, and if they later want to use the data for other purposes, they must obtain user permission for the additional uses,” she added.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s move comes months after Google stepped up its efforts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/google-pulls-indias-paytm-app-from-play-store-for-repeat-policy-violations/">crack down on fantasy sports apps in India</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small enterprises remain one of the most underserved segments of the business market, but the growth of cloud-based services &#8212; easier to buy, easier to provision &#8212; has helped that change in recent years. Today, one of the more promising startups out of Europe building software to help SMEs run online businesses is announcing some funding to better tap into both the opportunity to build these services, and to meet a growing demand from the SME segment.</p>
<p><a href="https://xentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xentral</a>, a German startup that develops enterprise resource planning software covering a variety of back-office functions for the average online small business, has picked up a Series A of $20 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform today covers services like order and warehouse management, packaging, fulfillment, accounting and sales management, and the majority of its 1,000 customers are in Germany &#8212; they include the likes of direct-to-consumer brands like YFood, KoRo, the Nu Company and Flyeralarm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Benedikt Sauter, the co-founder and CEO of Xentral, said the ambition is to expand into the rest of Europe, and eventually other geographies, and to fold in more services to its ERP platform, such as a more powerful API to allow customers to integrate more services &#8212; for example in cases where a business might be selling on their own site, but also Amazon, eBay, social platforms and more &#8212; to bring their businesses to a wider market.</p>
<p>Mainly, he said, the startup wants &#8220;to build a better ecosystem to help our customers run their own businesses better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Sequoia Capital, with Visionaires Club (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/visionaries-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2B-focused VC out of Berlin</a>) also participating.</p>
<p>The deal is notable for being the prolific, high-profile VC&#8217;s first investment in Europe since officially opening for business in the region. (Sequoia has backed a number of startups in Europe before this, including Graphcore, Klarna, Tessian, Unity, UiPath, n8n and Evervault &#8212; but all of those deals were done from afar.)</p>
<p>Augsburg-based Xentral has been around as a startup since 2018, and &#8220;as a startup&#8221; is the operative phrase here.</p>
<p>Sauter and his co-founder Claudia Sauter (who is also his co-founder in life: she is his wife) built the early prototype for the service originally for themselves.</p>
<p>The pair were running a business of their own &#8212; a hardware company they founded in 2008, selling not nails, hammers and wood, but circuit boards they they designed, along with other hardware to build computers and other connected objects. Around 2013, as the business was starting to pick up steam, they decided that they really needed better tools to manage everything at the backend so that they would have more time to build their actual products.</p>
<p>But Bene Sauter quickly discovered a problem in the process: smaller businesses may have Shopify and its various competitors to help manage e-commerce at the front end, but when it came to the many parts of the process at the backend, there really wasn&#8217;t a single, easy solution (remember this was eight years ago, at a time before the Shopifys of the world were yet to expand into these kinds of tools). Being of a DIY and technical persuasion &#8212; Sauter had studied hardware engineering at university &#8212; he decided that he&#8217;d try to build the tools that he wanted to use himself.</p>
<p>The Sauters used those tools for for years, until without much outbound effort, they started to get a some inbound interest from other online businesses to use the software, too. That led to the Sauters balancing both their own hardware business and selling the software on the side, until around 2017/2018 when they decided to wind down the hardware operation and focus on the software full-time. And from then, Xentral was born. It now has, in addition to 1,000 customers, some 65 employees working on developing the platform.</p>
<p>The focus with Xentral is to have a platform that is easy to implement and use, regardless of what kind of SME you might be as long as you are selling online. But even so, Sauter pointed out that the other common thread is that you need at least one person at the business who champions and understands the value of ERP. &#8220;It&#8217;s really a mindset,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The challenge with Xentral in that regard will be to see how and if they can bring more businesses to the table and tap into the kinds of tools that it provides, at the same time that a number of other players also eye up the same market. (Others in the same general category of building ERP for small businesses include online payments provider Sage, Netsuite and Acumatica.) ERP overall is <a href="https://www.marketresearchengine.com/reportdetails/erp-enterprise-resource-planning-software-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forecast</a> to become a $49.5 billion market by 2025.</p>
<p>Sequoia and its new partner in Europe Luciana Lixandru &#8212; who is joining Xentral&#8217;s board along with Luciana Lixandru and Visionaries’ Robert Lacher &#8212; believe however that there remains a golden opportunity to build a new kind of provider from the ground up and out of Europe specifically to target the opportunity in that region.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see Xentral becoming the <em>de facto</em> platform for any SMEs to run their businesses online,&#8221; she said in an interview. &#8220;ERP sounds a bit scary especially because it makes one think of companies like SAP, long implementation cycles, and so on. But here it’s the opposite.&#8221; She describes Xentral as &#8220;very lean and easy to use because you an start with one module and then add more. For SMEs it has to be super simple. I see this becoming like the Shopify for ERP.&#8221;</p>
