										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deliveroo has had another win in the UK courts, beating back an appeal by the <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk">IWGB</a> union which has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/19/gig-economy-ruling-deliveroo-riders-equipment-basic-employment-rights">sought for years</a> to challenge the gig platform over couriers&#8217; rights but has continued to fail to overturn the company&#8217;s classification of riders as self-employed.</p>
<p>The latest appeals court ruling is the fourth judgment in the UK that supports Deliveroo&#8217;s contention that its riders are self-employed, following earlier judgments by the Central Arbitration Committee and two at the High Court.</p>
<p>The on-demand food delivery platform operates a different gig model to ride-hailing giant Uber &#8212; which has, by contrast, failed to prevent UK courts from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/"> judging its drivers to be workers not self-employed contractors</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Deliveroo, for example, allows riders to use a substitute to fulfil a shift with only limited restrictions on the practice. And the interpretation of how exactly employment law applies typically hinges on exactly such nuanced details as the level of flexibility being offered to platform workers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Rb2WMf1PHs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">Uber loses gig workers rights challenge in UK Supreme Court</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber loses gig workers rights challenge in UK Supreme Court&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/embed/#?secret=Rb2WMf1PHs" data-secret="Rb2WMf1PHs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite a string of legal loses against Deliveroo over the years, the IWGB did not give up its fight. Most recently honing in on the issue of collective bargaining, and seeking to challenge the platform giant&#8217;s stance under the European Convention on Human Rights &#8212; by arguing riders have a legal right to form or join a union.</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t had much success with this line of argument against Deliveroo either, though.</p>
<p>And today the UK Court of Appeal dismissed its latest appeal &#8212; ruling that riders do not fall under the scope of the trade union freedom right set out in the European Convention of Human Rights.</p>
<p>Although the Court did suggest that riders do fall under &#8220;the more general right of freedom of association under article 11 [of the ECoHR]&#8221;.</p>
<p>In conclusion the judges also make a point of noting that other gig economy legal challenges may have a different outcome, writing that: &#8220;It may be thought that those in the gig economy have a particular need of the right to organise as a trade union. So I quite accept that there may be other cases where, on different facts and with a broader range of available arguments, a different result may eventuate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IWGB&#8217;s president, Alex Marshall, seized on this element of the ruling &#8212; commenting in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The judgment recognises that riders would benefit from organising collectively to represent their interests and admits the conclusion reached in the judgment might seem counter intuitive. We will now consider our legal position, but one thing is for sure: We will continue to grow in numbers and fight on the streets until Deliveroo give these key worker heroes the pay and conditions they more than deserve.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In further remarks, Marshall attacked Deliveroo&#8217;s stance toward riders &#8212; claiming it has sought to &#8220;silence&#8221; their voices and deny them opportunities to negotiate better terms:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Deliveroo couriers have been working on the frontline of the pandemic and whilst being applauded by the public and even declared heroes by their employer, they have been working under increasingly unfair and unsafe working conditions. The reward they have received for their Herculean effort? Deliveroo continuing to invest thousands of pounds in litigation to silence workers&#8217; voices and deny them the opportunity to negotiate better terms and conditions. A recent investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism revealed riders were making as little as £2 per hour. Is this the kind of pay workers would accept if they really were their own boss? It appears that when Deliveroo talk about flexibility and being your own boss, it is talking about the flexibility of choosing when to make poverty wages and work in unsafe conditions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement welcoming the appeal court ruling, Deliveroo claimed the contrary &#8212; saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Today is good news for Deliveroo riders and marks an important milestone. UK courts have now tested and upheld the self-employed status of Deliveroo riders four times.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our message to riders is clear. We will continue to back your right to work the way you want and we will continue to listen to you and respond to the things that matter to you most.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Deliveroo’s model offers the genuine flexibility that is only compatible with self-employment, providing riders with the work they tell us they value. Those campaigning to remove riders’ flexibility do not speak for the vast majority of riders and seek to impose a way of working that riders do not want. Deliveroo will continue to campaign for companies like ours to be able to offer the full flexibility of self employment along with greater benefits and more security.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Visa has announced <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623006027/en/Visa-To-Acquire-European-Open-Banking-Platform-Tink">plans</a> to acquire <a href="https://tink.com">Tink</a> for €1.8 billion, or $2.15 billion at today’s exchange rate. Tink has been a leading fintech startup in Europe focused on open banking application programming interface (API).</p>
<p>Today’s move comes a few months after Visa abandoned its acquisition of <a href="https://plaid.com">Plaid</a>, another popular open banking startup. Originally, Visa planned to spend $5.3 billion to acquire the American startup. But the company had to call off the acquisition after running into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">regulatory wall</a>.</p>
<p>Tink offers a single API so that customers can connect to bank accounts from their own apps and services. For instance, you can leverage Tink’s API to access account statements, initiate payments, fetch banking information and refresh this data regularly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While banks and financial institutions now all have to offer open banking interfaces due to EU’s Payment Services Directive PSD2, there’s no single standard. Tink integrates with 3,400 banks and financial institutions.</p>
<p>App developers can use the same API call to interact with bank accounts across various financial institutions. As you may have guessed, it greatly simplifies the adoption of open banking features.</p>
<p>300 banks and fintech startups use Tink’s API to access third-party bank information — clients include PayPal, BNP Paribas, American Express and Lydia. Overall, Tink covers 250 million bank customers across Europe.</p>
<p>Based in Stockholm, Sweden, Tink operations should continue as usual after the acquisition. Visa plans to retain the brand and management team.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tink">Crunchbase data</a>, Tink has raised over $300 million from Dawn Capital, Eurazeo, HMI Capital, Insight Partners, PayPal Ventures, Creades, Heartcore Capital and others.</p>
<p>“For the past ten years we have worked relentlessly to build Tink into a leading open banking platform in Europe, and we are incredibly proud of what the whole team at Tink has created together,” Tink co-founder and CEO Daniel Kjellén said in a statement. “We have built something incredible and at the same time we have only scratched the surface.”</p>
<p>“Joining Visa, we will be able to move faster and reach further than ever before. Visa is the perfect partner for the next stage of Tink’s journey, and we are incredibly excited about what this will bring to our employees, customers and for the future of financial services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remittances &#8212; specifically when people in developed countries send money to family or friends in emerging markets &#8212; continues to be a huge lever to help those in more challenging economies survive and improve their lot. Today, a startup that has built a remittance platform that it believes is the most economically sympathetic and useful to the people who use those services the most is announcing some funding to continue growing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.taptapsend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taptap Send</a>, which provides a &#8220;free&#8221; mobile money transfer service from eight countries to 15 others, has raised $13.4 million, money that it will be using to continue expanding its scope and the services that it provides to its customers.</p>
<p>The 15 receiver countries include some of the poorest countries in the world that are the hardest to service, plus emerging markets with some of the poorest populations &#8212; DR Congo, Mali, and Madagascar among them &#8212; while the eight originator countries include some of the most common places to which people from these countries emigrate &#8212; United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada, France and Italy among them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A was co-led by Canaan Partners and Reid Hoffman, with other unnamed investors also participating.</p>
<p>There is a reason that a lot of companies launch and build services in countries like the U.S. or regions like Western Europe: there is a lot of money there, and specifically consumers and businesses with the kind of income that allows them to invest in new technologies and simply to do more. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean that other, less wealthy demographics don&#8217;t exist, or don&#8217;t also need new technology; but building for them is usually less lucrative and more risky.</p>
<p>Taptap Send is among the startups that is trying to approach the promise of tech with this in mind, and with a view to bucking that trend. The company&#8217;s business model works by way of charging no commission or any other fees for transfers, instead making a cut on foreign exchange. It has built its whole tech stack from the ground up and says that this lets it pass on lower exchange rates to its customers, typically lower than others that might be serving the same markets. On top of this, there is an economy of scale principle at play here: having better rates will drive more users, which in turn might not mean better margins but a higher volume of transacting and more returns overall.</p>
<p>The startup is the third entrepreneurial outing for Michael Faye, a development economist who previously worked for the United Nations. Before Taptap Send, Fay founded <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href="https://www.thesegovia.com/">Segovia</a>. In each business, he&#8217;s tried to take the same approach: building financial technology to improve the lot of people living in emerging markets. GiveDirectly (still going strong) did this for philanthropic donations &#8212; it&#8217;s an NGO that sets up donation campaigns where individuals and big businesses can contribute, and people in receiving countries can directly get the funding via mobile money transfers. Segovia (acquired by <a href="https://www.crownagentsbank.com/crown-agents-bank-acquires-segovia-to-strengthen-its-frontier-markets-payment-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crown Agents Bank</a>) did this for B2B use cases &#8212; it built a mobile-money-transfer-as-a-service, which other money transfer companies could use to power their businesses, by way of an API.</p>
<p>Taptap Send can be thought of as Faye&#8217;s hat trick in the space, taking the bigger concept of remittances used to help people, and building it as a C2C business: aimed at individuals who are sending people &#8220;back home&#8221; money to live on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taptap Send is taking advantage of this structural change in mobile money and other distribution networks to offer what we hope is the fastest and best price service to customers,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Taken together, cross-border remittances is a massive market, worth some $540 billion annually when you consider the established channels, with more &#8220;informal&#8221; methods (which can be as analogue as passing money via a person making a trip from one country to the other) estimated to be of nearly the same size. They are also, in fact, more valuable even than foreign direct investment: the <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/money-sent-home-workers-now-largest-source-external-financing-low-and-middle-income" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Bank has tracked</a> that remittances overtook the money donated by states in 2019.</p>
<p>Mobile technology has played a big part in that, making it easier both to send and receive money, but it&#8217;s also opened the door to a lot of potential exploitation by bad actors, preying on people who might use a service for convenience and not be fully clear on how the actual pricing breaks down.</p>
<p>For that reason, the UN has set a goal for remittance pricing and commissions to be no higher for any company than 3% of the total sent &#8212; one way to ensure that players focus more on volume and less on margins. Taptap send says that it&#8217;s the only company in the space that has publicly committed to that goal (it has yet to hit it, it seems).</p>
<p>The company is not yet disclosing many numbers on its size or customers served but Faye tells me business overall grew 5x in the last year, and is posting a gross profit. &#8220;Even with everything happening you did see this massive increase in digitization,&#8221; he said of Covid-19 and its impact on business. He&#8217;s also undeterred by the vast amounts of competition in the space, which includes not just companies like Western Union and Money Gram but lots and lots of smaller remittance startups like Remitly, World Remit, and many more without the word &#8220;remit&#8221; in their names. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to look at remittance and say it’s crowded, but so was video conferencing before Zoom or social networking before Facebook,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is also why investors are interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company has a nuanced, yet powerful strategy that Michael has put into place to allow [it] to be the lowest-cost provider in every market they enter. As the world rapidly shifts toward digital wallets and e-money, it creates an opportunity for remittance companies to create an even more magical experience by sending funds directly to those wallets,&#8221; noted Brendan Dickinson, a general partner at Canaan. &#8220;Taptap Send gives as much of cost savings as possible to the customer, and as a result, is almost always the cheapest player in the market. All of that makes it economically viable to send smaller remittances – and in doing so, expands the total market and volume of remittances sent. This approach is strongly resonating with customers, as Taptap Send’s massive growth has been 90+% organic.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s most recent hype wave seems to be dying down after a spectacular rise, Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s crypto arm is reaffirming its commitment to startups building blockchain projects with a hulking new $2.2 billion crypto fund.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the firm&#8217;s largest vertical-specific fund ever &#8212; by quite a bit.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s 2018 crypto fund ushered in $300 million of LP commitments and its second fund, which it closed in April of last year, clocked in at $515 million. The new multi-billion dollar fund not only showcases how institutional backers are growing more comfortable with cryptocurrencies, but also how Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s assets under management have been quickly swelling to compete with other deep-pocketed firms including the ever-prolific Tiger Global.</p>
<p>With this announcement, Andreessen now has some $18.8 billion assets under management.</p>
<p>LPs are likely far less wary to take a chance on crypto after Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s stake in Coinbase equated to some $11.2 billion at the time of the direct listing&#8217;s first trades, though the stock has slid back some 30% in recent months as the crypto market has shrunk.</p>
<p>Some of the firm&#8217;s other major crypto bets include NBA Top Shot maker Dapper Labs which <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=11543929116_112520154917&amp;utm_content=477036477316&amp;utm_term=dsa-19959388920&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwt8uGBhBAEiwAayu_9ZEFl0gcMnTGBqg_eKHTKkYSNwNoBx1AJA_1tf0hBlqrLIxPSjmrAhoC-I4QAvD_BwE">hit a $7.5 billion valuation</a> this spring. Blockchain infrastructure startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/dfinitys-valuation-soars-to-9-5bn-after-revealing-its-governance-system-and-token-economics/">Dfinity</a> raised at a $9.5 billion valuation this past September. Last year, the firm <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-raise/">led the Series A of Uniswap, </a>which is poised to be a major player in the Ethereum ecosystem. In addition to equity investments, a16z has also made major bets on the currencies themselves.</p>
<p>An earlier report from <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/a16z-crypto-fund-balloons-to-2-billion">Newcomer</a> last month reported a16z was targeting a $2 billion crypto fund and that they had already unloaded some of their crypto holdings before most cryptocurrencies took a major dive in recent weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snowflake changed the conversation for many companies when it comes to the potentials of data warehousing. Now one of the startups that&#8217;s hoping to disrupt the disruptor is announcing a big round of funding to expand its own business.</p>
<p>Firebolt, which has built a new kind of cloud data warehouse that promises much more efficient, and cheaper, analytics around whatever is stored within it, is announcing a major Series B of $127 million on the heels of huge demand for its services.</p>
<p>The company, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/firebolt-raises-37m-to-take-on-snowflake-amazon-and-google-with-a-new-approach-to-data-warehousing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only came out of stealth mode in December</a>, is not disclosing its valuation with this round, which brings the total raised by the Israeli company to $164 million. New backers Dawn Capital and K5 Global are in this round, alongside previous backers Zeev Ventures, TLV Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Angular Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nor is it disclosing many details about its customers at the moment. CEO and co-founder Eldad Farkash told me in an interview that most of them are US-based, and that the numbers have grown from the dozen or so that were using Firebolt when it was still in stealth mode (it worked quietly for a couple of years building its product and onboarding customers before finally launching six months ago). They are all migrating from existing data warehousing solutions like Snowflake or BigQuery. In other words, its customers are already cloud-native, big-data companies: it&#8217;s not trying to proselytize on the basic concept but work with those who are already in a specific place as a business.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re not using Snowflake or BigQuery already, we prefer you come back to us later,&#8221; he said. Judging by the size and quick succession of the round, that focus is paying off.</p>
<p>The challenge that Firebolt set out to tackle is that while data warehousing has become a key way for enterprises to analyze, update and manage their big data stores &#8212; after all, your data is only as good as the tools you have to parse it and keep it secure &#8212; typically data warehousing solutions are not efficient, and they can cost a lot of money to maintain.</p>
<p>The challenge was seen first-hand by the three founders of Firebolt, Farkash (CEO), Saar Bitner (COO) and Ariel Yaroshevich (CTO) when they were at a previous company, the business intelligence powerhouse Sisense, where respectively they were one of its co-founders and two members of its founding team. At Sisense, the company continually came up against an issue: When you are dealing in terabytes of data, cloud data warehouses were straining to deliver good performance to power its analytics and other tools, and the only way to potentially continue to mitigate that was by piling on more cloud capacity. And that started to become very expensive.</p>
<p>Firebolt set out to fix that by taking a different approach, re-architecting the concept. As Farkash sees it, while data warehousing has indeed been a big breakthrough in big data, it has started to feel like a dated solution as data troves have grown.</p>
<p>“Data warehouses are solving yesterday’s problem, which was, ‘How do I migrate to the cloud and deal with scale?’ ” he told me back in December. Google’s BigQuery, Amazon’s RedShift and Snowflake as fitting answers for that issue, believes, but “we see Firebolt as the new entrant in that space, with a new take on design on technology. We change the discussion from one of scale to one of speed and efficiency.”</p>
<p>The startup claims that its performance is up to 182 times faster than that of other data warehouses with a SQL-based system that works on academic research that had yet to be applied anywhere, around how to handle data in a lighter way, using new techniques in compression and how data is parsed. Data lakes in turn can be connected with a wider data ecosystem, and what it translates to is a much smaller requirement for cloud capacity. And lower costs.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the company says the concept is gaining a lot of traction with engineers and developers in industries like business intelligence, customer-facing services that need to parse a lot of information to serve information to users in real-time, and back-end data applications. That is proving out what investors suspected would be a shift before the startup even launched, stealthily or otherwise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I’ve been an investor at Firebolt since their Series A round and before they had any paying customers,&#8221; said Oren Zeev of Zeev Ventures. &#8220;What had me invest in Firebolt is mostly the team. A group of highly experienced executives mostly from the big data space who understand the market very well, and the pain organizations are experiencing. In addition, after speaking to a few of my portfolio companies and Firebolt’s initial design partners, it was clear that Firebolt is solving a major pain, so all in all, it was a fairly easy decision. The market in which Firebolt operates is huge if you consider the valuations of Snowflake and Databricks. Even more importantly, it is growing rapidly as the migration from on-premise data warehouse platforms to the cloud is gaining momentum, and as more and more companies rely on data for their operations and are building data applications.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Illumio, a self-styled zero trust unicorn, has closed a $225 million Series F funding round at a $2.75 billion valuation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The round was led by Thoma Bravo, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">bought cybersecurity vendor Proofpoint by $12.3 billion</a>, and supported by Franklin Templeton, Hamilton Lane, and Blue Owl Capital.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The round lands more than two years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/illumio-series-e/">Illumio’s Series E funding round</a> in which it raised $65 million, and fueled speculation of an impending IPO. The company’s founder, Andrew Rubin, still isn’t ready to be pressed on whether the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/meet-5-cybersecurity-unicorns-that-could-ipo-in-2020/">plans to go public</a>, though he told TechCrunch: “If we do our job right, and if we make our customers successful, I&#8217;d like to think that would be part of our journey.”</p>
<p>Illumio’s latest funding round is well-timed. Not only does it come amid a huge rise in successful cyberattacks which show that some of the more traditional cybersecurity measures are no longer working, from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">SolarWinds hack</a> in early 2020 to the more recent attack on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a>, but it also comes just weeks after President Joe Biden issued an executive order pushing federal agencies to implement significant cybersecurity initiatives, including a zero trust architecture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“And just a couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/bidens-cybersecurity-dream-team-takes-shape/">Anne Neuberger</a> [deputy national security adviser for cybersecurity] put out a memo on White House stationary to all of corporate America saying we’re living through a ransomware pandemic, and here’s six things that we’re imploring you to do,&#8221; Rubin says. &#8220;One of them was to segment your network.”</p>
<p>Illumio focuses on protecting data centers and cloud networks through something it calls micro-segmentation, which it claims makes it easier to manage and guard against potential breaches, as well as to contain a breach if one occurs. This zero trust approach to security — a concept centered on the belief that businesses should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters — has never been more important for organizations, according to Illumio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Cyber events are no longer constrained to cyber space,” says Rubin. “That’s why people are finally saying that, after 30 years of relying solely on detection to keep us safe, we cannot rely on it 100% of the time. Zero trust is now becoming the mantra.”</p>
<p>Illumio tells TechCrunch it will use the newly raised funds to make a “huge” investment in its field operations and channel partner network, and to invest in innovation, engineering and its product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The late-stage startup, which was founded in 2013 and is based in California, says more than 10% of Fortune 100 companies — including Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas SA and Salesforce — now use its technology to protect their data centers, networks and other applications.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> It saw 100% international growth during the pandemic, and says it&#8217;s also broadening its customer base across more industries. </span></p>
<p>The company has raised more now raised more $550 million from investors include Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst and Formation 8.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jio Platforms, run by India’s richest man (Mukesh Ambani), and Google on Thursday unveiled the JioPhone Next, an affordable Android smartphone, as the top Indian telecom operator and the American giant make further push to expand their reach in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The Indian firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">secured $4.5 billion investment from Google</a> (and another $15.5 billion from Facebook and others) last year and shared plans to work on low-cost smartphones, said the JioPhone Next is aimed at helping roughly 300 million users in India who are still on 2G network upgrade their gadget to access faster networks.</p>
<p>The phone, which is &#8220;powered by extremely optimized Android&#8221; mobile operating system, will first launch in India on September 10 ahead of the festive season in the country, and will eventually be made available outside of India, said Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, at its annual general meeting Thursday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The JioPhone Next will be an &#8220;ultra-affordable 4G smartphone,&#8221; claimed Ambani, though he didn&#8217;t reveal the price or the hardware specifications of the handset.</p>
<p>In a virtual appearance at Reliance AGM, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company has also entered into a 5G cloud partnership with Jio Platforms. &#8220;It will help more than a billion Indians connect to a faster and better internet, support businesses in their digital transformation, and help Jio build new services in sectors like health, education and more &#8212; laying a foundation for the next phase of India’s digitization,&#8221; said the chief executive of Google, which last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">committed to invest $10 billion in India</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the 5G cloud partnership, Google is also winning a major Google Cloud customer in Reliance, said Pichai.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be able take advantage of Google’s AI and machine learning, e-commerce, and demand forecasting offerings. Harnessing the reliability and performance of Google Cloud will enable these businesses to scale up as needed to respond to customer demand,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169666" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169666" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2169666 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=768,382 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=680,338 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169666" class="wp-caption-text">Ambani unveils the JioPhone Next at Reliance&#8217;s Annual General Meeting on Thursday.</p></div></p>
<p>The JioPhone Next will ship with a range of features, including Read Aloud and Translate Now that will work with any text on the phone screen, including web pages, apps, messages, and even photos.</p>
<p>It also features a &#8220;fast, high-quality camera&#8221; which will support HDR, and the JioPhone Next will be protected by latest Android releases and security updates, Google said, though it didn&#8217;t share the precise duration for this coverage. (Smartphone vendors typically offer security and new Android software support for about two years after the launch.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked closely with the Jio team on engineering and product development on useful voice-first features that enable these users to consume content and navigate the phone in their own language, deliver a great camera experience, and get the latest Android feature and security updates,&#8221; Google said in a statement.</p>
<p>Even as most smartphones that ship in India, the second largest market, are priced at $150 or less, customers looking for a smartphone priced under $100 are left with little choice. And that choice has shrunk in recent years.</p>
<p>Research firm Counterpoint told TechCrunch that the sub-$100 smartphones accounted for just 12% of the Indian smartphone market, down from 18% in 2019 and 24% in 2018. Sub-$50 smartphones represented just 0.3% of the entire market in 2020, down from 4.3% in 2018.</p>
<p>Smartphone makers are aware of this whitespace in the market, but have found it incredibly challenging to meet the demand. Some, including Jio Platforms earlier explored a range of feature phones to reach people in small cities and towns of India. Jio Platforms&#8217; KaiOS-powered feature phone, called JioPhone, had amassed 100 million customers as of late February this year.</p>
<p>In a recent report to clients, analysts at UBS said that after factoring in the recent price surge of memory component, any smartphone priced at or under $50 is likely selling at cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this move by Jio will accelerate 2G to 4G migration, we evaluated how interesting this space would be for other smartphone manufacturers, especially key players like Xiaomi. Xiaomi, the unit market leader in smartphones in India, is unlikely to follow up with a $50 smartphone, in our view,&#8221; they wrote in the report, obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Google, too, has previously made several efforts &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/android-one/">$100 Android One smartphones</a> program in 2014 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/googles-lightweight-os-android-go-launches-as-android-oreo-go-edition/">low-resource intensive Android Go</a> operating system in 2017 &#8212; to expand the reach of Android. The company has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/kaios-raises-50m-more-hits-100m-handsets-powered-by-its-feature-phone-os/">backed KaiOS</a>, which powers popular feature phones.</p>
<p>The JioPhone Next is a &#8220;momentous step in our Android mission for India, and is the first of many that our Android product and engineering teams will embark on in India,&#8221; Google said in a statement. &#8220;We are also actively expanding our engineering teams in India, as we continue to work on finding ways to answer the unique needs of India’s smartphone users.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">US/Israeli startup, <a href="http://www.getsorbet.com/">Sorbet</a> &#8211; which helps companies de-risk themselves against accrued paid time off (PTO) by employees — has raised another $15M, in a round led By Dovi Frances’ Group 11, not long after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/sorbet-raises-6m-seed-led-by-viola-ventures-to-tackle-the-thorny-financials-of-paid-time-off/">a $6 million seed round</a> only last April.</p>
<p>Sorbet says it removes the burden of PTO from employers, allowing employees to ‘spend&#8217; it in offers and other types of deals, giving employers far more control over the whole process and the ability to forecast ahead. It does this by buying out PTO liabilities from employees and loading the cash value of the PTO on prepaid Credit Cards. It then refinances these liabilities for employers, hence the forecasting advantage.</p>
<p>Veetahl Eilat-Raichel, founder and CEO, said: “It&#8217;s clear that we’re in the midst of a tectonic shift in employer-employee dynamics and with inbound global interest exceeding our wildest expectations, I had the great privilege of picking and choosing the best investors to help us expand and accelerate. I can think of no better partner than Dovi and the entire Group 11 team to join us, and am thrilled and humbled to have them alongside our already stellar group of investors.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dovi Frances, Founding Partner, Group 11 said: “At Group 11 we pride ourselves in our unique ability to uncover the unicorns of tomorrow. Veetahl and the team did something exceedingly difficult which is to uncover a massive market inefficiency hiding in plain sight. With a $270B market opportunity, it was crystal clear to me this was the time to push forward and not look back.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following Wise&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/wise-announces-plans-to-go-public-via-direct-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this month</a> that it planned to go public by way of a direct listing on the LSE, today the company made the news formal with a <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/market-news/intention-to-float/15030546?showDisclaimer=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory filing</a>. The London-based company &#8212; formerly known as TransferWise and primarily in the business of transferring money across different currencies &#8212; with 10 million users said it plans to list in &#8220;early July 2021&#8221; but did not provide further details on pricing of its class A shares, in keeping with how direct listings work. It&#8217;s been reported, however, that the plan is for the valuation to be in the range of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wise-ipo-idUSKBN2BO69F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6 billion to $7 billion</a> with the listing.</p>
<p>(Overall, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wise has put in place a dual-class share structure in place with two classes of shares in issue, class A shares and class B shares, in order to support Wise’s focus on its mission as it transitions into the public markets, it noted. Class B shares are not tradeable.)</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Company will not set a price in respect of the class A shares or offer any class A shares in connection with the direct listing,&#8221; it noted in the statement. &#8220;The opening price of the class A shares will be determined in the opening auction on the date of Admission.&#8221; While direct listings have somewhat taken off as a route for tech companies to go public in the U.S. &#8212; a trend spearheaded by another European juggernaut, Spotify &#8212; this is a new turn for the LSE, which <a href="https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/live_cds_-_001_-_17062021_-_revised_initial_opening_auction_arrangements_for_new_admission_-_wise_gb00bl9yr756.pdf." target="_blank" rel="noopener">published its own new rules</a> on the process the same day that Wise announced its plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the meantime, we can watch for more details around the public offering, and updates about the company&#8217;s business, will be coming out in a prospectus and other related statements in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Bypassing the big investment banks and the related roadshow of a more conventional listing can be a bold move, one that companies who want to avoid the volatility and commitment of that process might opt to take if they feel they have enough momentum to hit the market directly. Wise in its statement today hinted that there has been some early interest, based on its share <a href="https://wise.com/owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offering to Wise customers</a>.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to confirm our plans for a direct listing in London. This process will broaden the ownership of Wise, in support of our mission to move money around the world faster, cheaper and more conveniently,&#8221; said Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder of Wise, in a note in the statement. &#8220;Since announcing our expected intention to float last week, we’ve had over 60,000 expressions of interest in our customer shareholder programme, OwnWise, which is designed to reward customers who buy Wise shares and stick with us for the longer-term. This direct listing is about further aligning our mission and our shareholder base and I’m enormously proud that customers want to be a part of that.”</p>
<p>Wise has been one of the huge success stories for fintech coming out of Europe, and London &#8212; founded by Estonians Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus, the company&#8217;s been based out of London and has stuck with that even through all the financial turmoil of Brexit. Its 10 million customers currently process around $7 billion (£5 billion) in cross-border transactions every month, which remains its primary business even as it diversifies into newer, related areas of financial services. In its most recent financial year, Wise&#8217;s revenue grew to $586 million, up from $422 million. That represents $57 million (£41 million) in profit before tax, and the company says it has been profitable since 2017.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Class B shares will hold 9 votes per share, are strictly non-transferable and, amongst other voting right cancellation events, expire on the fifth anniversary of any listing, the company confirmed. Wise’s shareholders and holders of vested options as at 23 May 2021 are entitled to elect to receive 50% of their class A share holding in the Company with additional corresponding class B shares on a 1:1 basis (save for Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder of Wise, who is entitled to elect to receive 100% of his class A share holding in the Company with additional corresponding class B shares on a 1:1 basis), it added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The voting rights attaching to the class B shares are, subject to certain regulatory approvals, capped so that no shareholder can, by virtue of the class B shares they hold, cast more than one vote less than 35% of the eligible votes in respect of any shareholder decision (save for Kristo Käärmann who, for so long as he is CEO of the Company, will be capped in respect of his class B shares at one vote less than 50% of the eligible votes in respect of any shareholder decision and if, at any time, he is not CEO of the Company he will be capped at one below 35% of the eligible votes in respect of any shareholder decision). The class B shares are non-tradeable and will not be listed.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/apple-to-introduce-search-ads-on-app-store-along-with-changes-to-app-review-discovery-and-splits/">launching five years ago</a> in the United States, Apple&#8217;s search advertising service finally arrived in mainland China this week.</p>
<p>The feature, called Apple Search Ads, lets developers bid on an advertising slot based on users&#8217; keyword search in the App Store, similar to how Google search ads work. JPMorgan previously estimated the giant&#8217;s annual ad revenue could <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-advertising/apple-could-raise-annual-ad-income-to-11-billion-by-2025-jpmorgan-idUSKBN1XP17L?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29">top $11 billion by 2025</a>, though the forecast didn&#8217;t have a breakdown for the search ad business.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">“It’s likely that the long delay in launching Search Ads in China was due to Chinese government restrictions on the operation of advertising business in China. It seems that Apple has found a way around this, but at the cost of having to accept payments in foreign currencies and not being able to provide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/apple-expands-its-ad-business-with-a-new-app-store-ad-slot/">Search Tab ads</a>,” says Rich Bishop, founder and CEO of AppInChina, a publisher that helps international apps launch in China.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple has itself been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">reining in on personalized advertising</a>, letting users turn off data tracking by apps, a move that will inevitably roil the business models of Facebook and others dependent on third-party data to target ads.</p>
<p>China has historically been a strong market for Apple, but iPhones are increasingly losing their luster as a status symbol in the country with the rise of local offerings like Huawei. In the first quarter, however, Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/apple-record-china-2021/">smartphone shipment saw a rebound</a> thanks to Huawei&#8217;s slipping sales and the launch of the iPhone 12 family. The Chinese App Store is another important source of income for Apple.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://searchads.apple.com/v/help/b/docs/apple-advertising-guidelines-for-mainland-china.pdf">five-page guideline</a>, Apple outlines the qualifications for developers targeting ads at mainland Chinese users. There is a stack of industry-specific licenses that advertisers must obtain, which practically excludes most foreign entities from directly advertising in mainland China, as noted in a blog post by <a href="https://www.appinchina.co/apple-search-ads-in-mainland-china">AppInChina.</a></p>
<p>To bid for search ads in China, apps would have to find local partners with all the government approvals in place.</p>
<p>The requirements for apps importing goods into China, for example, include not just a general license to run value-added internet businesses but also registrations with the relevant trade and customs authorities. Apple may even start asking for these permits from apps that simply want to <em>publish </em>in China, wrote AppInChina, as Apple continues to enforce rules set by the Chinese government as evident from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/china-roundup-apple-closes-app-store-loophole/">crackdown on gaming apps</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industries like real estate, automotive, and financial services have long and offline sales cycles and digital advertising tends not to perform well in these areas. The conversion rates are low and because the real-world assets are offline the temptation of advertisers is to buy leads and clicks, which can inflate customer acquisition costs. People are browsing but they end up buying offline, basically.</p>
<p>A new startup, <a href="http://Tomi.ai">Tomi</a> plans to address this issue by processing a user’s behavior on a company&#8217;s website (using a tracking pixel, combined with ad APIs and CRMs) to help companies reach customers more in the way an ecommerce business would.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $1M seed round from investors including Begin Capital and Phystech Leadership Fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Konstantin Bayandin — a former senior director of digital marketing and technology at Compass and chief marketing officer at Ozon, ‘Russia’s Amazon’ —  Tomi competes against similar AdTech companies such as Anytrack, Sociaro, Meetotis, Alytics and Postclick.</p>
<p>However, the difference, Bayandin says, is that Tomi &#8220;focuses on offline conversions and  works with multiple ad channels, such as Facebook, Instagram and Google.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bayandin says: &#8220;Real-estate companies would love to leverage online ads in order to sell their inventory but it turns out to be too expensive and difficult. People like to browse but rarely convert and most of these transactions happen offline. So real-estate clients don’t know how to optimize for their real buyers. Tomi uses machine learning to analyze the way real buyers browse the website and optimize ad campaigns towards conversions.”</p>
<p>The background to all this is that with Apple closing down IDFA, Google planning to remove third-party cookies from its Chrome browser, and the latest iOS 14.5 update allowing users opt out of “personalized ads”, the entire ad business is in flux, so new tools are going to be required. Bayandin says Tomi is part of this new wave of AdTech.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 23, 2021. The value of leading cryptocurrencies has rebounded some in the last day or so. Congrats to the hodlrs out there. If you are a nocoiner, don’t worry; stocks are also up. If you want more on the topic, the TechCrunch crew held a Twitter Space recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/how-many-lives-does-bitcoin-have/">on the current state of crypto</a>. Now, the news. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/weride-310-million-series-c/"><strong>Robotaxis are coming (slowly)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Alphabet’s self-driving unit, Waymo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/the-station-waymo-nabs-more-capital-cruise-taps-a-5b-credit-line-and-hints-about-argos-future/">has been busy lately</a>, but it’s not the only company in its market generating headlines. Chinese robotaxi player WeRide bagged $600 million in less than half a year, TechCrunch reports. The company is now worth $3.3 billion. Let’s hope that all the capital and activity in this particular market works out when<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span>the rubber hits the road.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/autonomous-trucking-startup-embark-to-go-public-in-5-2b-spac-deal/">Soon, even regular folks can get in on the autonomous action</a></strong><strong>: </strong>Love the idea of self-driving cars, but don’t have $100 million or more to pour into one of the industry’s leading private players? Good news! You can put your $100 into Embark soon, as the self-driving truck company is going public via a SPAC. You are welcome for this PSA.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/edtech-culture-memo/">Tech’s cultural discussion continues</a></strong><strong>: </strong>If you follow the tech industry, you’ve seen news about its evolving cultural discussion. From <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/working-for-social-justice-isnt-a-distraction-for-mission-focused-companies/">banning “politics”</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/basecamp-employees-quit-ceo-letter/">public culture memos</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">private missives that became public</a>, there’s a lot going on at both startups and public companies alike. A new document from the edtech sector takes a rather pointed stand in the larger conversation in favor of not backing down from controversial topics, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> wrote for the site. It won’t be the last memo we see on the matter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/investors-thirst-for-growth-could-bode-well-for-sentinelones-ipo/"><strong>The exit market for growth-focused startups is still hot</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That’s the lesson from recent IPO filings in the tech space. If you are an investor or startup employee, it’s good news. If you are a wealthy tech company looking to buy smaller firms, the news is less good because you will probably have to pay a large premium to snag startups.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/snackpass-gobbles-up-70m-at-a-400m-valuation-as-its-social-food-ordering-platform-crosses-500k-users/"><strong>Snackpass scoops up $70M</strong></a><strong>: </strong>You may have seen Snackpass signs at food spots in your city. The startup focuses on pickup orders inside of restaurants rather than delivery, and, per our reporting, has seen its growth explode in recent months as people have gone back outside. It’s now worth more than $400 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/pairtree-speeds-adoption-process-with-an-online-self-matching-platform-and-2-25m-seed/"><strong>PairTree raises $2.25M to make adoption easier</strong></a><strong>:</strong> There are lots of tech deals with business problems. Sometimes startups build businesses to solve human problems. PairTree is one such company. Per Devin, it wants to make part of the adoption process easier with an “online matching platform where expectant mothers and hopeful adopters can find each other without the facilitation of an agency or other organization.” I love it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/drata-raises-25m-series-a-to-expand-its-security-compliance-platform/"><strong>Drata raises $25M to make security compliance easier</strong></a><strong>: </strong>If you run a company, you have to deal with security compliance. Drata wants to make securing SOC 2 compliance easier. That way, your startup won’t lose a deal over lack of compliance certification, a situation that might lead to you exclaiming “drata!” while smacking your own forehead.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform/">Vercel raises $102M for its next.js service</a>: </strong>You’ve probably heard of next.js, a React framework for front-end development work. Vercel built it with Facebook and Google. Now the company has $102 million more in the bank thanks to a Series C that valued the company at more than $1 billion. Per TechCrunch, traffic to apps and websites on Vercel’s network doubled since October of last year. That’s the sort of usage growth that investors love to see.</li>

<h2>Why Amazon should pay attention to Shein</h2>
<p>In the last year, online apparel shopping app Shein grew active daily users by 130%, reports Apptopia.</p>
<p>Each day, thousands of new products arrive on the app&#8217;s virtual shelves. Items are rapidly designed and prototyped before Shein&#8217;s contractors put them into production in Guangzhou factories — two weeks later, those SKUs arrive in fulfillment centers around the globe.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reporter Rita Liao examined how the company&#8217;s agile supply chain has become hot talk among e-commerce experts, but beyond a strong logistics game and data-driven product development, Shein&#8217;s close relationships with suppliers are integral to its success.</p>
<p>She also tried to answer a question many are asking: Is Shein a Chinese company?</p>
<p>“It’s hard to pin down where Shein is from,&#8221; answered Richard Xu from Grand View Capital, a Chinese venture capital firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a company with operations and supply chains in China targeting the global market, with nearly no business in China.”</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>We’re taking a break from politics today, so if you wanted even more updates about how India is taking on one American tech company or another, we are sorry. A lot of other stuff happened, however, that is pretty neat:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/ford-micromobility-subsidiary-spin-launches-first-in-house-built-e-scooter/"><strong>Ford is keeping scooter dreams alive</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Remember when Ford bought Spin? It was a great moment for the micromobility space. Today, Spin launched its first in-house scooter. So, if you need two small wheels and a battery pack, Ford has you covered. Recall that Ford is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">investing heavily</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/">electric cars</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">trucks</a> as well.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/salesforce-aws-announce-extended-partnership-with-further-two-way-integration/">Amazon and Salesforce buddy up even more</a>: </strong>The growing partnership between Amazon and Salesforce took a new step today, with the two major American tech companies announcing “a new set of integration capabilities to make it easier to share data and build applications that cross the two platforms.” Amazon competes with Microsoft in the public cloud world, and Salesforce competes with Microsoft in the CRM space. So to see the pair of them hold hands is not a huge surprise.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/tiktoks-chinese-nemesis-kuaishou-hits-1-billion-monthly-users-worldwide/">TikTok has real competition</a>: </strong>TikTok’s chief rival in China just hit the 1 billion monthly active user (MAU) mark. That’s a real accomplishment, given that the world only has 8 billion or so folks in it. Kuaishou, the app in question, has only 150 million non-Chinese MAUs, for what it’s worth, making it more of a giant domestic player in China than an international heavyweight. That may change, of course, if it keeps growing as it has been.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a little thing, but one worth savoring.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re tired of your Instagram feed mostly being a chaotic mashup of screencapped tweets and reshared TikToks, well, those things probably aren&#8217;t going away but one is about to look a lot better.</p>
<p>Twitter just added the capability to share a tweet directly to Instagram Stories, letting you port over your clever cross-platform moments properly. You can&#8217;t tap the tweets to hop back to Twitter, but they look nice now. Unfortunately for Android users, it&#8217;s iOS-only for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Skip the screenshots –– sharing Tweets to Instagram Stories right from the share menu is now rolling out to everyone on iOS!</p>
<p>Tap the share icon on a Tweet and select “Instagram Stories”. Once your Instagram app opens, you can resize/reposition the Tweet sticker before posting. <a href="https://t.co/R1qayqMwYl">https://t.co/R1qayqMwYl</a> <a href="https://t.co/yp82IH5Tuk">pic.twitter.com/yp82IH5Tuk</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The new cross-platform feature is just a tiny sample of Twitter&#8217;s refreshing recent flurry of product activity — a result of mounting pressure from investors who accused the company of stagnating and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/twitter-elliott-silver-lake/">planned to oust its CEO, Jack Dorsey</a>. The company also just added two more major features to empower users to monetize their tweets:<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/"> paid subscriptions known as &#8220;Super Follows&#8221; and ticketed events</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter users have long waited for a laundry list of small quality-of-life tweaks to manifest, a phenomenon that often materializes as an entire cohort of journalists complaining about how you still can&#8217;t edit tweets. But if it can keep the pace, Twitter might finally be ready to deliver.</p>
<p>See, doesn&#8217;t that look nice?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird has announced the launch of shared e-bikes to its fleet of e-scooters, which it says can be found in over 250 cities around the world. The shared micromobility provider is also launching a so-called ‘Smart Bikeshare’ platform that allows local shared bike and e-moped providers and transit apps to integrate with Bird’s app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shared e-scooters catapulted shared micromobility to the center stage of eco-friendly</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">transportation in cities by providing more than 150 million zero-emission trips globally,” said</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, in a statement. “We are launching our shared Bird Bike and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Bikeshare platform to meet fast-growing demand from cities and riders for more</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainable transportation options while expanding our serviceable addressable market by 5</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">billion trips per year.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This announcement comes just a month after Bird dropped</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/next-gen-bird-three-scooter-comes-with-bigger-battery-and-better-software/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its new Bird Three scooter with better battery life</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The micromobility giant&#8217;s shared e-bike will roll out later this year, with Cleveland, Ohio, being one of the first markets, according to a spokesperson for the company. In a statement, Bird said the bike will be available in select cities throughout North America, Italy, Spain, Germany, Ireland and France this year. Bird did not say how many e-bikes it would be launching or give a more specific launch date.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird also did not respond to whether or not the e-bike is designed or manufactured by the company, and if not, which manufacturer the company is working with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bird Bike is built on a 75-pound frame with a step-through design that can drive riders up hills with as much as a 20% grade, according to the company. It’ll have a front basket, large pneumatic tires and all the on-board geofencing and diagnostics that you’d expect from a Bird vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bird Bike is not Bird’s first bike. In the summer of 2019, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/bird-is-launching-a-two-seater-electric-vehicle-to-become-more-than-a-kick-scooter-startup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company unveiled its Bird Cruiser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an electric cross between a bike and a moped that could seat up to two people. But they decided to pause the pilot last year at the onset of the pandemic, according to a spokesperson for the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird’s bikeshare platform has already kicked off in Italy with local e-moped company <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/italy-bird-zig-zag-local-multimodal-mobility/">Zig Zag</a>, displaying the Italian company’s vehicles alongside its own in the Bird app. Bird says it wants to collaborate with other micromobility companies around the world and is in talks with groups like the North American Bikeshare Association to do so in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird did not answer questions about whether it would receive a cut of local operators’ profits if booked through the Bird app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement from the company, Bird’s bikeshare platform makes the company “the first scooter operator to integrate with local shared bike and e-moped providers.” Bird does not currently have plans to integrate third party, e-scooter providers into their app, according to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Bird isn’t collaborating with local e-scooter providers, sharing its platform with e-bike and e-moped providers allows it the chance to have more of a multi-modal presence without doing the heavy lifting of actually launching multi-modal fleets. At the very least, these collaborations will also give Bird a better idea of where and how riders are using different vehicles, which could help the company decide on new mobility modes to invest in, while also informing its own expansion plans, especially in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird did not confirm whether this is a part of its bikeshare platform strategy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI has been filling in the gaps for illustrators and photographers for years now — literally, it intelligently fills gaps with visual content. But the latest tools are aimed at letting an AI give artists a hand from the earliest, blank-canvas stages of a piece. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/23/studio-canvas-app/">Nvidia&#8217;s new Canvas tool</a> lets the creator rough in a landscape like paint-by-numbers blobs, then fills it in with convincingly photorealistic (if not quite gallery-ready) content.</p>
<p>Each distinct color represents a different type of feature: mountains, water, grass, ruins, etc. When colors are blobbed onto the canvas, the crude sketch is passed to a generative adversarial network. GANs essentially pass content back and forth between a creator AI that tries to make (in this case) a realistic image and a detector AI that evaluates how realistic that image is. These work together to make what they think is a fairly realistic depiction of what&#8217;s been suggested.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty much a more user-friendly version of the prototype <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/nvidia-ai-turns-sketches-into-photorealistic-landscapes-in-seconds/">GauGAN</a> (get it?) shown at CVPR in 2019. This one is much smoother around the edges, produces better imagery, and can run on any Windows computer with a decent Nvidia graphics card.</p>
<p>This method has been used to create very realistic faces, animals and landscapes, though there&#8217;s usually some kind of &#8220;tell&#8221; that a human can spot. But the Canvas app isn&#8217;t trying to make something indistinguishable from reality — as concept artist Jama Jurabaev explains in the video below, it&#8217;s more about being able to experiment freely with imagery more detailed than a doodle.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlZYRwJ2oJg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>For instance, if you want to have a moldering ruin in a field with a river off to one side, a quick pencil sketch can only tell you so much about what the final piece might look like. What if you have it one way in your head, and then two hours of painting and coloring later you realize that because the sun is setting on the left side of the painting, it makes the shadows awkward in the foreground?</p>
<p>If instead you just scribbled these features into Canvas, you might see that this was the case right away, and move on to the next idea. There are even ways to quickly change the time of day, palette, and other high-level parameters so they can quickly be evaluated as options.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169471" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/canvas-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169471" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169471" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/canvas-1.gif" alt="Animation of an artist sketching while an AI interprets his strokes as photorealistic features." width="700" height="337" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2169471" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvidia</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of blank canvas any more,&#8221; said Jurabaev. &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to make very big changes, because I know there&#8217;s always AI helping me out with details&#8230; I can put all my effort into the creative side of things, and I&#8217;ll let Canvas handle the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/google-has-created-an-ai-powered-nightmare-creature-generator/">Google&#8217;s Chimera Painter</a>, if you remember that particular nightmare fuel, in which an almost identical process was used to create fantastic animals. Instead of snow, rock and bushes, it had hind leg, fur, teeth and so on, which made it rather more complicated to use and easy to go wrong with.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2075466" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075466" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2075466" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg 1525w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2075466" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / Google</p></div></p>
<p>Still, it may be better than the alternative, for certainly an amateur like myself could never draw even the weird tube-like animals that resulted from basic blob painting.</p>
<p>Unlike the Chimera Creator, however, this app is run locally, and requires a beefy Nvidia video card to do it. GPUs have long been the hardware of choice for machine learning applications, and something like a real-time GAN definitely needs a chunky one. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/canvas/">You can download the app for free here.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You&#8217;ve likely seen the headlines surrounding the pretty major decline in NFT sales from the market&#8217;s recent peak, with some reports indicating as much as a 90 percent decline in recent weeks. And while plenty of crypto speculators are on the losing end of that rapid decline, others see a future where digital collectible and digital goods take over the internet.</p>
<p>NFT marketplace <a href="https://rarible.com/">Rarible</a> announced Wednesday that they&#8217;ve closed a $14.2 million Series A from Venrock Capital, CoinFund and 01 Advisors. The startup allows users to buy and auction off digital art. The firm also has its own Rarible governance token which allows users to make and vote on proposals around the platform&#8217;s features and fees.</p>
<p>The startup says it has reached $150 million in sales on the platform since launching 18 months ago.</p>
<p>NFT startups have raised major sums in recent months as investors coalesced around backing early players in the digital collectibles space. OpenSea, one of the most popular NFT hubs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">raised a $23 million funding round</a> in early spring from Andreessen Horowitz and Naval Ravikant. In March, invite-only NFT marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nft-art-marketplace-superrare-closes-9-million-series-a/">SuperRare raised a $9 million Series A</a>. Last month,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/bitski-raises-19-million-from-a16z-to-become-the-shopify-for-nfts/"> Bitski raised $19 million</a> in bid to become the &#8220;Shopify of NFTs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alongside the funding announcement, Rarible shared that they&#8217;ve officially partnered with NBA Top Shot maker Dapper Labs to bring their NFT marketplace to Dapper&#8217;s Flow blockchain. Dapper Labs has begun building out a wider coalition of NFT platforms on its proprietary blockchain which is more energy efficient and less costly than transactions on the Ethereum network, though it is also much more centralized. Rarible says they will make this transition in the &#8220;next couple of months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has broad goals for making the NFT space more approachable to everyday web users, saying in a a <a href="https://rarible.medium.com/nfts-for-everyone-rarible-raises-14-2-million-88abee23b764">blog post</a> that they hope to use this funding to explore more user-friendly developments like accepting credit card payments. &#8220;We need a world where an indie creator can effortlessly create an NFT and sell it for $5 to his community of supporters, as well as where a pop icon can use NFTs to establish close contact with her multi-million audience in a sustainable way,&#8221; the post reads.</p>

	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I firmly believe that principles as much as products drive a company’s success. A startup may have a persuasive brand story and good public relations, but if it’s internally inconsistent &#8212; if its employees and executives cannot identify its central values &#8212; sooner or later there will be trouble.</p>
<p>At Heap, the analytics solution provider I lead, a defining principle is that good ideas should not be lost to top-down dictates and overrigid hierarchies. Although I’m the CEO, I recognize that I don’t always have the best view simply because I’m on top of (the) Heap. The best results come when you approach leadership like you would create a great product — you hypothesize, you test and iterate, and once you get it right, you grow it.</p>

			Most of us have had the experience of receiving a sudden decree “from above” that makes little consideration for the actual, as opposed to the theoretical, situation of people on the ground.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>One-and-done decrees versus agile, iterative change</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve used this method in the businesses I’ve managed. The scientific method, with its cycle of observation, reporting, hypothesizing, experimenting, analyzing and reporting, is a powerful tool for product and process development.</p>
<p>While my process isn’t <em>quite </em>as rigorous as the scientific method and tends to sprint where science slowly marches, it’s based on similar principles. Before I describe the system, a warning: Although it&#8217;s a simple way to iterate new concepts and evaluate new designs, my method requires a genuine commitment to the principles of cooperation and collaboration. In an organization predicated on hierarchy and strict structure, it could be a recipe for groupthink and unearned consensus. Iteration is not, however, a justification for delay: There may be several iterations of a project, but those iterations follow each other quickly.</p>
<p>Most of us have had the experience of receiving a sudden decree “from above” that makes little consideration for the actual, as opposed to the theoretical, situation of people on the ground. You know the kind of thing I mean: The sales team in the saturated territory is told they must increase revenue by 20%, the already lean division is told to cut costs by 10%. Moves like this are bad for morale; they inspire resentment and cut corners. It’s precisely to avoid this kind of top-down debacle that Heap takes a collaborative and iterative approach to change.</p>
<h2>Passing ideas back and forth</h2>
<p>We put our business’ best minds to work to devise an initial prototype of whatever our business may need. That prototype might be a minimum viable product for commercial release, polished messaging for our forthcoming releases, or even a compendium of internal workflows.</p>
<p>But we can’t consider a project perfect if it’s never been exposed to the world outside the office. Whether we’re crafting a project, tweaking our messaging or establishing pricing tiers, we test in the real world. We show products to consumers, prospects and advisers, who invariably have needs that we hadn’t anticipated. The testers’ concerns may send us rushing back to the drawing board, but that’s accepted and expected. It’s the testing and refining that leads to the best product. While some businesses prefer a rush to market, we’ve observed that doesn’t work. A rushed product will frustrate users, lose word-of-mouth enthusiasm and provide an opportunity to our competitors.</p>
<p>But this isn’t just for product releases; we adopt a similar strategy for determining changes inside the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon revolutionized one-click shopping, and it has a nearly $2 trillion market cap to show for the effort.</p>
<p>Now, a 10-person startup founded by JD Maresco, who previously cofounded the public safety app Citizen, says it plans to make it a lot easier for retailers who sell directly to their customers to make re-ordering their products just as fast and simple through its QR codes. Indeed, Maresco&#8217;s new startup, <a href="https://www.getbatch.com/">Batch</a>, is already working with numerous products and brands that use Shopify, promising their customers &#8220;one-tap checkout&#8221; when it&#8217;s time to reorder an item as long as the retailer has slapped one of Batch&#8217;s codes on their items or incorporated the codes directly into their packaging.</p>
<p>For the moment, New York-based Batch is wholly reliant on Apple&#8217;s App Clip technology, which produces a lightweight version of an app to save people from having to download and install it before using it. (Users can instead load just a small part of an app on demand, and when they’re done, the App Clip disappears.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Maresco &#8212; whose company just raised $5 million in seed funding co-led by Coatue and Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six, with participation from Weekend Fund, Shrug Capital, and the Chainsmokers, among others &#8212; says Batch will eventually work on both iOS and Android phones. We talked with him yesterday to learn more about Batch&#8217;s ambitions to make the physical world &#8220;instantly shoppable.&#8221; Our chat has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Citizen and Batch are very different companies. Is there a unifying thread?</strong></p>
<p>JM: I&#8217;ve spent a good portion of my career, trying to change the way people think about and interact with their physical environment. With Citizen, we were questioning why everyone doesn&#8217;t have immediate access to information about what the police are doing in our neighborhoods. With Batch, we&#8217;re asking a simpler question but something that matters to me as a consumer: Why isn&#8217;t it easier for me to get more of a product I love and use?</p>
<p>With subscriptions in general, I&#8217;ve found myself constantly frustrated because every few weeks I&#8217;m emailing to either pause a subscription,  or restart it. I wanted an easier way to use my phone to reorder in 10 seconds on the spot. Our phones are capable of much more than we put them to use for and, so we set out to tackle that problem.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Right now, Batch integrates with Shopify alone, correct?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We have a Shopify plugin that brands can connect into the Batch platform, and then we integrate the experience, all the way from the physical world wherever this QR code lives, through the purchase experience on the mobile side of things into their fulfillment on the back end. But we&#8217;re also expanding to other e-commerce platforms.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And Batch takes a per-transaction fee from every item that&#8217;s purchased using your codes?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We&#8217;re developing our pricing model over time, but currently we&#8217;re taking a service percentage-based fee.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How are you getting brands to partner with you?</strong></p>
<p>JM: Brands are starting to wake up to this idea that they can actually create a new retail channel off their physical packaging, where a customer can effectively shop throughout their home or their place of work or anywhere where they interact with these products the moment they run out of an item. So we&#8217;ve been able to spend time with dozens of brands now, and work with them to actually reengineer their packaging and say, &#8216;Let&#8217;s put QR codes front and center and figure out how to make this a really important customer touchpoint.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many brands are using the codes currently?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We&#8217;re launching dozens of brands this summer. We&#8217;ve had overwhelming demand, to be honest, and we haven&#8217;t really even fully launched yet.</p>
<p><strong>TC: These are physical codes that you&#8217;re sending off to your retail partners &#8212; stickers, magnets. Are you also creating digital QR codes?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We have customers that are integrating QR codes into out-of-home advertisements, into direct mail, into T shirts, into promotional vans, so we&#8217;re not just limited to packaging. There&#8217;s a wide range of places that you can integrate QR codes for your customers.</p>

<p><strong>TC: It&#8217;s interesting that Coatue led your round. We&#8217;ve seen the firm delve more into early-stage deals but a seed round seems anomalous. How did you connect?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We met during the seed process. They reached out to me and I developed a relationship with Andy Chen and Matt Mazzeo and it was a great opportunity to work with their platform &#8212; the way they support the go-to-market motion around B2B companies; they have a great data platform.</p>
<p>Alexis [Ohanian&#8217;s] experience in the consumer space was really appealing, too.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Your company makes sense, but I wonder what&#8217;s special about these codes. What&#8217;s to prevent countless other startups from doing what you&#8217;re doing?</strong></p>
<p>JM: QR codes are all over the place. The product we&#8217;re building makes it really easy for brands to create high converting shopping experiences and a native mobile interface. It&#8217;s a combination of our Shopify integration and our native product design experience and the relationships we have with these brands and how we help them with their packaging that&#8217;s not something you can spin up overnight.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I have to ask about Citizen, which was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">in the headlines</a> recently for all the wrong reasons. Is there anything you want to say about the company or the app or some of that recent coverage?</strong></p>
<p>JM:  I&#8217;m not going to comment on the recent press, but I continue to be proud of what the company is continuing to do to help communities stay safe and understand what police and first responders are doing in their neighborhoods.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For many companies in the United States, a board of directors is a fact of doing business. While sole proprietorships and LLCs are not obligated to have one, C and S corporations must. The board’s goal is to ensure the best is done for the company and its shareholders. While many entrepreneurs see board meetings as a chore, they can be a powerful tool if used well.</p>
<h2>Communicate often</h2>
<p>While board meetings usually happen quarterly, it’s good practice to keep the conversation going in between them. Sending a monthly email update to the board offers multiple advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shorter updates</strong>: Business professionals’ attention spans are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/infographic-shrinking-attention-span-n110801">shrinking</a>. Shorter content is easier to digest, and therefore more likely to be read.</li>
<li><strong>Timely feedback</strong>: A quarter can be a long time, especially for young startups or during challenging times. The monthly format allows the company to receive help or feedback from the board earlier. In business, speed of iteration is key!</li>
<li><strong>Keep them posted</strong>: Keeping directors up to date will avoid lengthy updates during board meetings, ensuring focus remains on strategic conversations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reach out when in need</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When meeting online, founders should pause often and regularly ask if there are questions — even if moments of silence feel awkward at times — to give directors a better opportunity to speak up.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Board members can also be solicited on an ad-hoc basis &#8212; founders should keep in mind that board members are here to help the company. If you have doubts about a project decision or want a second, informed opinion, reach out to a board member. This is especially true of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/the-hidden-benefits-of-adding-a-cto-to-your-board/">directors</a> who have expertise on a specific topic. A quick five-minute call can be a game changer.</p>
<p>Being a founder can be a lonely experience because it can be difficult to discuss sensitive matters with the team. Board members should sign nondisclosure agreements, allowing entrepreneurs to share confidential information and get a different perspective on things.</p>
<h2>Discuss goals for the next fundraising event</h2>
<p>Founders should make sure to regularly discuss business goals to ensure they reach their next round of funding. Because the industry landscape or economy evolved or the competition stepped up, investors may reconsider their expectations to further fund the company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a Battery Ventures associate in 1999, I used to spend my nights highlighting actual magazines called Red Herring, InfoWorld and The Industry Standard, plus my personal favorites StorageWorld and Mass High Tech (because the other VC associates rarely scanned these).</p>
<p>As a 23-year-old, I’d circle the names of much older CEOs who worked at companies like IBM, EMC, Alcatel or Nortel to learn more about what they were doing. The companies were building mainframe-to-server replication technologies, IP switches and nascent web/security services on top.</p>
<p>Flash forward 22 years and, in a way, nothing has changed. We have gone from command line to GUI to now API as the interface innovation. But humans still need an interface, one that works for more types of people on more types of devices. We no longer talk about the OSI stack &#8212; we talk about the decentralized blockchain stack. We no longer talk about compute, data storage and analysis on a mainframe, but rather on the cloud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problems and opportunities have stayed quite similar, but the markets and opportunities have gotten much larger. AWS and Azure cloud businesses alone added $23 billion of run-rate revenue in the last year, growing at 32% and 50%, respectively &#8212; high growth on an already massive base.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The size of the cybersecurity market has gotten infinitely larger as software eats the world and more people are able to sit and feast at the table from anywhere on Earth (and, soon enough, space).					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The size of the cybersecurity market, in particular, has gotten infinitely larger as software eats the world and more people are able to sit and feast at the table from anywhere on Earth (and, soon enough, space).</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few months, my colleague Spencer Calvert and I released a series of pieces about why this market opportunity is growing so rapidly: <a href="https://ventureinside.com/how-the-shared-responsibility-model-complicates-cloud-security-cb8a7b307195">the rise of multicloud environments</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/">data being generated and stored faster than anyone can keep up with it</a>, <a href="https://ventureinside.com/securing-the-everything-as-a-service-world-eaf5c327c004">SaaS applications powering virtually every function across an organization</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/bring-cisos-into-the-c-suite-to-bake-cybersecurity-into-company-culture/?tpcc=ECTW2020">CISOs’ rise in political power and strategic responsibility.</a></p>
<p>This all ladders up to an estimated &#8212; and we think conservative &#8212; $100 billion of new market value by 2025 alone, putting total market size at close to $280 billion.</p>
<p>In other words, opportunities are ripe for massive business value creation in cybersecurity. We think many unicorns will be built in these spaces, and while we are still in the early innings, there are a few specific areas where we’re looking to make bets (and one big-picture, still-developing area). Specifically, Upfront is actively looking for companies building in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data security and data abstraction.</li>
<li>Zero-trust, broadly applied.</li>
<li>Supply chains.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Data security and abstraction</h2>
<p>Data is not a new thesis, but I am excited to look at the change in data stacks from an initial cybersecurity lens. What set of opportunities can emerge if we view security at the bottom of the stack &#8212; foundational &#8212; rather than as an application at the top or to the side?</p>

<p>For example, data is expanding faster than we can secure it. We need to first know where the (structured and unstructured) data is located, what data is being stored, confirm proper security posture and prioritize fixing the most important issues at the right speed.</p>
<p>Doing this at scale requires smart passive mapping, along with heuristics and rules to pull the signal from the noise in an increasingly data-rich (noisy) world. <a href="https://www.openraven.com/">Open Raven</a>, an Upfront portfolio company, is building a solution to discover and protect structured and unstructured data at scale across cloud environments. New large platform companies will be built in the data security space as the point of control moves from the network layer to the data layer.</p>
<p>We believe Open Raven is poised to be a leader in this space and also will power a new generation of “output” or application companies yet to be funded. These companies could be as big as Salesforce or Workday, built with data abstracted and managed differently from the start.</p>

<p>If we look at security data at the point it is created or discovered, new platforms like Open Raven may lead to the emergence of an entirely new ecosystem of apps, ranging from those Open Raven is most likely to build in-house &#8212; like compliance workflows &#8212; to entirely new companies that rebuild apps we have used since the beginning of time, which includes everything from people management systems to CRMs to product analytics to your marketing attribution tools.</p>
<p>Platforms that lead with a security-first, foundational lens have the potential to power a new generation of applications companies with a laser-focus on the customer engagement layer or the “output” layer, leaving the data cataloging, opinionated data models and data applications to third parties that handle data mapping, security and compliance.</p>

<p>Put simply, if full-stack applications look like layers of the Earth, with UX as the crust, that crust can become better and deeper with foundational horizontal companies underneath meeting all the requirements surrounding personally identifiable information and GDPR, which are foisted upon companies that currently have data <em>everywhere</em>. This can free up time for new application companies to focus their creative talent even more deeply on the human-to-software engagement layer, building superhuman apps for every existing category.</p>
<h2>Zero-trust</h2>
<p>Zero-trust was first coined in 2010, but applications are still being discovered and large businesses are being built around the idea. Zero-trust, for those getting up to speed, is the assumption that anyone accessing your system, devices, etc., is a bad actor.</p>
<p>This could sound paranoid, but think about the last time you visited a Big Tech campus. Could you walk in past reception and security without a guest pass or name badge? Absolutely not. Same with virtual spaces and access. My first in-depth course on zero-trust security was with Fleetsmith. I invested in Fleetsmith in 2017, a young team building software to manage apps, settings and security preferences for organizations powered by Apple devices. Zero-trust in the context of Fleetsmith was about device setup and permissions. Fleetsmith was acquired by Apple in mid-2020.</p>
<p>About the same time as the Fleetsmith acquisition, I met Art Poghosyan and the team at <a href="https://www.britive.com/">Britive</a>. This team is also deploying zero-trust for dynamic permissioning in the cloud. Britive is being built under the premise of zero-trust Just-in-time (JIT) access, whereby users are granted ephemeral access dynamically rather than the legacy process of “checking out” and “checking in” credentials.</p>
<p>By granting temporary privilege access instead of “always-on” credentials, Britive is able to drastically reduce cyber risks associated with over-privileged accounts, the time to manage privilege access and the workflows to streamline privileged access management across multicloud environments.</p>
<p>What’s next in zero-based trust (ZBT)? We see device and access as the new perimeter, as workers flex devices and locations for their work and have invested around this with Fleetsmith and now Britive. But we still think there is more ground to cover for ZBT to permeate more mundane processes. Passwords are an example of something that is, in theory, zero-trust (you must continually prove who you are). But they are woefully inadequate.</p>

<p>Phishing attacks to steal passwords are the most <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/solutions/secure-your-business/business-security-tips/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ent:security:8003162844&amp;utm_term=verizon%20breach%20report&amp;utm_medium=knc&amp;utm_source=ggl&amp;utm_campaign=security&amp;utm_content=ac:ent:8003162844&amp;utm_term=verizon%20breach%20report&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8cCGBhB6EiwAgORey9NsEHC9r5lkOJjXY3z4hn5kmXuHGwTvd-l4GRA3psPS4cGDhFExrRoCdYoQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">common path to data breaches</a>. But how do you get users to adopt password managers, password rotation, dual-factor authentication or even passwordless solutions? We want to back simple, elegant solutions to instill ZBT elements into common workflows.</p>
<h2>Supply chains</h2>
<p>Modern software is assembled using third-party and open-source components. This assembly line of public code packages and third-party APIs is known as a supply chain. Attacks that target this assembly line are referred to as supply chain attacks.</p>
<p>Some supply chain attacks can be mitigated by existing application-security tools like <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> and other SCA tools for open-source dependencies, such as Bridgecrew to automate security engineering and fix misconfigurations and Veracode for security scanning.</p>
<p>But other vulnerabilities can be extremely challenging to detect. Take the supply chain attack that took center stage &#8212; the SolarWinds hack of 2020 &#8212; in which a small snippet of code was altered in a SolarWinds update before spreading to 18,000 different companies, all of which relied on SolarWinds software for network monitoring or other services.</p>

<p>How do you protect yourself from malicious code hidden in a version update of a trusted vendor that passed all of your security onboarding? How do you maintain visibility over your entire supply chain? Here we have more questions than answers, but securing supply chains is a space we will continue to explore, and we predict large companies will be built to securely vet, onboard, monitor and offboard third-party vendors, modules, APIs and other dependencies.</p>
<p>If you are building in any of the above spaces, or adjacent spaces, <a href="https://twitter.com/karanortman">please reach out</a>. We readily acknowledge that the cybersecurity landscape is rapidly changing, and if you agree or disagree with any of the arguments above, I want to hear from you!</p>
