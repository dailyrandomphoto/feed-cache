										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic isn&#8217;t over yet, according to Apple. The iPhone maker has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=i71db0mv">once again pushed back a Covid-era deferral</a> of an App Store rule that allowed app developers to bypass Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase system for specific services that had been forced to go virtual due to ongoing Covid outbreaks. Specifically, Apple will continue to defer its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#3.1.1">App Store Review Guideline 3.1.1</a>, which requires apps offering &#8220;paid online group services&#8221; to do so via in-app purchases.</p>
<p>The impacted developers &#8212; whose original business models were built around in-person events, not virtual ones &#8212; have been able to forgo Apple&#8217;s requirement to use its in-app purchase system during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Initially, Apple had only dropped the in-app purchase requirement on person-to-person services &#8212; like those involving a medical consultation between a doctor and patient, a tutoring session between a teacher and student, a real estate tour between a realtor and client, or a fitness training session between a trainer and client, for example. But Apple was soon publicly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/facebook-says-apple-in-app-fees-hurt-businesses-during-covid/2020/08/14/2ce1cd80-de6f-11ea-b4f1-25b762cdbbf4_story.html">criticized by Meta (Facebook)</a>, for continuing charge commissions on group services events that could hurt small businesses during a global pandemic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook, of course, had an ulterior motive. It wanted Apple to give it permission to use Facebook Pay, its own payments system, where it was waiving fees, instead of Apple&#8217;s in-app purchases. Even if Apple had only temporarily agreed, Facebook would have been able to onboard many thousands of customers into its own payments ecosystem.</p>
<p>Instead, Apple temporarily deferred its own fees for online group services, including one-to-few and one-to-many services, like online seminars or group yoga classes. This addressed Meta&#8217;s criticism that it was profiting off the backs of small businesses being crushed by the pandemic, while also not giving Facebook Pay any advantages.</p>
<p>As the pandemic continued, however, Apple has had to keep pushing back the deadline that would have ended the deferral and returned these businesses to Apple&#8217;s in-app payments system. In November 2020, Apple extended the deadline for the deferral&#8217;s end to June 2021. And in April 2021, it extended it again to December 31, 2021. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=yeyd5xuh">Last November, Apple reminded developers</a> the deadline was soon approaching.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the impacts of the omicron variant caused Apple to push that deadline yet again.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, the company says impacted developers will have until June 30, 2022, to return to Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase system &#8212; a date Apple clearly hopes will be a more palpable time frame to start tapping back into its lost revenue stream.</p>
<p>The company also noted it&#8217;s extending the deadline to implement account deletion functionality inside apps that allow for account creation, due to &#8220;the complexity of implementing this requirement. In other words, it&#8217;s a change that&#8217;s time-consuming and difficult to implement, but even more so when businesses are again struggling with office closures, staff out sick with Covid, and kids attending virtual school at home.</p>
<p>The extensions, announced quietly over the weekend with a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=i71db0mv">post</a> on Apple&#8217;s Developer site, come at a time when Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase business model is under attack from many sides. The company is engaged with a lawsuit with Epic Games, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/22/this-week-in-apps-commission-battles-twitter-nfts-and-epics-appeal-begins/">now under appeal</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/acm-apple-fine/">was just fined by a Dutch regulator</a> for not complying with antitrust rules as Apple continues to force developers to use its in-app purchase infrastructure for third-party payments. The company also had to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/third-party-app-store-payments-korea/">recently comply</a> with a similar rule over in-app payments in South Korea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mentorship is a crucial ingredient to a student’s success. The demand for a platform to make the art of advice more accessible is thus easy for entrepreneurs to identify then pitch, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">but the serendipity &#8212; or the chasm between what makes someone an effective mentor versus just a speed dial for questions &#8212; is harder for them to scale.</span></p>
<p>Startups that want to scale mentorship across different industries need to build up a supply of mentors diverse, and present, enough to click with the variety of students in today’s society: ranging from the part-time graduate student who is busy with parent duties, to the burnt out, first-generation Ivy League star, to the engineer who just broke into tech but is struggling with work/life balance.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.mentorcollective.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mentor Collective</a>, a Boston-based startup founded in 2014, answers to the challenges and opportunities within scaled mentorship have taken time to figure out. The startup, founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-boyar-29b04333/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackson Boyar</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameslmorrissey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Lu Morrissey</a>, began by pairing up students with mentors virtually, and over time has added more structure and management to its marketplace. It approaches the human questions of &#8220;how do you support intrinsic motivation&#8221; through participant surveys and algorithmic matching &#8212; while tackling diversity of student needs by building different curriculums for first-generation individuals, adult learners, veterans, BIPOC and others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261454" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To date, Mentor Collective has 165 institutional, higher-education customers, including University of Colorado Denver, Penn State and Dartmouth. It also works with corporations such as Wells Fargo. On the supply side, Mentor Collective says it has trained more than 50,000 mentors since first launching.</p>
<p>While companies and competitors, including BetterUp and Sounding Board, have cumulatively raised hundreds of millions of dollars, Mentor Collective decided to bootstrap for the past seven years. CEO and co-founder Jackson Boyar believes the long game was necessary so they didn’t take too much money too early, like some other early-stage edtech companies he’s seen launch fast, and fail faster.</p>
<p>“Even though it took a really long time to get to where we are, we feel confident to spend this money and know it won’t negatively impact students,” Boyar said. “It did take us half a decade to figure this out, and if somebody thinks that it takes half a year, it’s a little audacious and not realistic…if your mission is about doing good, you probably need to adapt that mindset.”</p>
<p>Boyar announced today that his company has raised $21 million in a Series A round led by Resolve Growth Partners and continued investment from Lumina Foundation, an Indianapolis-based foundation focused on making lifelong learning more accessible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Boyar initially started the company thinking that it would be a nonprofit. While that has since obviously changed, he thinks that starting a company by aggressively focusing on “product efficacy with the expectation that maybe it wouldn&#8217;t make that much money” helped build a key foundation.</p>
<p>“If you’re trying to convince a college dean or provost to buy something and you don’t have a randomized control trial that shows the impact on students, it’s kind of ridiculous that you’d ask me to spend $100,000 on your product,” he said.</p>
<p>The founder decided that it was time to take serious money when the company doubled in revenue last year, now nearing $10 million in annual recurring revenue. The more important milestone? Mentor Collective finally began offering more predictable outcomes for students, he claims.</p>
<p>According to an analysis conducted by Dr. Jenna Harmon, mentorship research lead and Dr. Joe Sutherland, head of data science, Mentor Collective helped power a 3.84% increase in student retention and a 14% increase in sense of belonging.</p>
<p>“These numbers might initially appear low, but even just 1% retention is significant in education…4% across a class of 5,000 students is 200 fewer students dropping out of school,” said Boyar. The magic metric for the company, as he just explained, is how it lowers drop-out rates for schools through giving students more subjective-based support. In money terms, if Mentor Collective can prove that a mentor increases a student’s likelihood of graduating, it cloud show that the university will gain more tuition revenue by using its service.</p>
<p>Another company, EdSights, has raised millions for a chatbot that connects students to resources or support services. “In a perfect world [where] we somehow had a magic wand that allowed us to collect the data on whatever we want on our fingers, what would we want to know to prevent [college] students from dropping out?,” co-founder Claudia Recchi<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/edsights-gets-a-5-million-series-a-for-student-retention-services/"> said in a previous interview. </a></p>
<p>“Our form of mentoring is finding someone who does, or at least can, relate, and connecting them to you at the right moment in that journey, so that you can build a greater sense of belonging, that you&#8217;re more likely to graduate, that you get all the social mobility that college promises, but ultimately isn’t delivered to students who don’t look like the traditional college student,” Boyar said.</p>
<p>Currently, more than 50% of Mentor Collective’s mentor cohort is non-white, and 36% identify as first-generation college students. For now, the company is relying on volunteer mentors to support its mission, but now, with venture backing, could be under pressure to start paying the people it makes money off of. The COVID-19 pandemic helped the company secure 83,000 mentorships in 2021, double the year prior and up from 19,874 in 2019.</p>
<p>Looking back, Boyar thinks that his company could have been even more disciplined in focus during its earlier days. The demand for mentoring means that there are dozens of use cases for the platform, and the company often gets inbound from a variety of customers, from libraries to the military. While saying yes could work for short-term growth, the true efficacy of mentorship in those fields looks very different from person to person.</p>
<p>Now, with new incentives laid atop the company, Mentor Collective will need to make a series of choices on how to stay thoughtful and ambitious on the way it grows.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[IBM reported revenue for Q3 2021 &#8212; and the news wasn&#8217;t just &#8220;good.&#8221; For a company that has seen negative or low revenue growth for almost a decade, it was great.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IBM <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-releases-fourth-quarter-results-301466868.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported revenue for Q3 2021</a> &#8212; and the news wasn&#8217;t just &#8220;good.&#8221; For a company that has seen negative or low revenue growth for almost a decade, it was great. Big Blue reported $16.7 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 6.5% year over year (8.6% on a constant-currency basis; the strengthening dollar is making a number of companies deal with FX fluctuations).</p>
<p>The solid results come <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-10-20-IBM-Reports-2021-Third-Quarter-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quarter after IBM posted</a> far more modest 0.3% growth in the third quarter of 2021, on slightly higher $17.6 billion. The good news also comes in the wake of the company spinning out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/kyndryl-officially-launches-as-ibm-spins-out-infrastructure-services-biz-as-separate-company/">its $19 billion infrastructure services business</a>. It may seem slightly counterintuitive to see a company lose a large chunk of business and have it work out in its favor so quickly, but that would appear to have been a big part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">CEO Arvind Krishna&#8217;s thinking</a> in making that move to focus almost entirely on the cloud.</p>
<p>We watched the company flounder for years, at one point <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/business/ibm-revenue.html">recording 22 straight quarters</a> of negative revenue growth. When former CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/ginni-rometty-leaves-complex-legacy-as-she-steps-away-as-ibm-ceo/">Ginni Rometty left in 2019</a> and was replaced by Krishna, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">he made it clear</a> there were changes coming and he was going to cut the parts of the business that were not part of his vision.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261498" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That included<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/ibm-plans-to-spin-off-infrastructure-services-as-a-separate-19b-business/"> kicking Kyndryl to the curb</a> and selling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/francisco-partners-scoops-up-remains-of-ibms-watson-health-unit/">the bulk of the company&#8217;s Watson Health division</a>, an area where Rometty had made a big bet and spent billions to build it into a substantial business. When it didn&#8217;t work out, Krishna was not afraid to cut his losses, selling off the assets on Friday to Francisco Partners in a deal that was far below the money Rometty had plowed into the division, with reports putting the deal at around $1 billion.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tWzEeDNXFc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/red-hat-ceo-looks-to-maintain-double-digit-growth-in-second-year-at-helm/">Red Hat CEO looks to maintain double-digit growth in second year at helm</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Red Hat CEO looks to maintain double-digit growth in second year at helm&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/red-hat-ceo-looks-to-maintain-double-digit-growth-in-second-year-at-helm/embed/#?secret=tWzEeDNXFc" data-secret="tWzEeDNXFc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Krishna has made it clear he wants to build the company around Red Hat now, the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/"> IBM bought in 2018 for $34 billion</a>. Hybrid cloud revenue, the division where Red Hat lives, reported $6.2 billion in revenue for the quarter &#8212; up 18% year over year, giving the company the kind of growing revenue it was hoping for.</p>
<p>The CEO has made it known he&#8217;s looking for steady growth moving forward, not eye-popping, but the kind of steady growth you would expect from a mature company like IBM, and certainly not quarter after quarter of negative growth. This would appear to put them on that road.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s three straight quarters of positive growth for fiscal 2021 &#8212; 3%, 0.3% and 6.5% &#8212; and while those are not the type of growth numbers that make you scream from the rooftops, they are a positive trend for a venerable corporation that desperately needs it</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategies, says the report is at the very least a good sign for the company. &#8220;While one good quarter doesn&#8217;t make a trend, I believe three do and at a minimum, I believe we will see mid-single-digit growth in the near future.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Other bright spots</h2>
<p>While hybrid cloud revenue growth was the obvious outlier result from the company’s matrix of Q4 outcomes, there were other bright spots worth considering. Software revenues were up 8% (10%, constant currency), and consulting-derived top line was up a strong 13% (16%, constant currency).</p>
<p>The result of the generally positive results was a strong profit outcome. IBM reported gross profit of $9.5 billion, up a slim 2.5%. However, that figure converted into $2.9 billion in net income at Big Blue, up a shocking 183% on a pre-tax basis. The company’s profit, after taxes, still came to a strong $2.5 billion, up a slightly more modest 107% compared to the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>In simple terms, IBM’s business remains a very lucrative one. And one that, finally, after years and years of stagnation and decline from a volume (revenue) basis, has not only managed a string of growth, but, in its most recent quarter, pretty solid top line expansion, to boot.</p>
<p>IBM did not survive this long by accident, so perhaps we should have had more faith. But its epic run of negative growth did engender a pretty strong cadre of doubters. Investors are impressed, at least, with IBM shares up sharply in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Now let’s see if the company can repeat the feat this year. Then we can really call it a comeback.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Talk of NFTs may be filling board rooms and news feeds, but their complex and new nature makes it hard for investors to determine which projects show promise. In fact, only a small portion of investors are reaping the most profits from NFTs, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/small-group-is-reaping-most-of-the-gains-on-nfts-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study</a> by Chainalysis.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been involved in more than 50 NFT and cryptocurrency deals, and am committed to scaling the DAO (decentralized autonomous organizations) ecosystem. However, the unfamiliarity of the NFT space is why many investors fear dipping their toes.</p>
<p>NFTs are more than famous artworks, songs and tweets — they serve as part of the broader decentralization movement. From copyright enforcement to buying real estate and identity verification, NFTs play a big role in the remote,= digital world. In the first half of 2021, the NFT market cap grew 2,100%, reaching <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nft-sales-volume-surges-25-bln-2021-first-half-2021-07-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.5 billion in sales volume</a>. Meanwhile, the creator economy boom has opened more doors for NFTs, as people don&#8217;t have to go through aggregators or intermediaries to create a token.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If you&#8217;re speaking with a founder who doesn&#8217;t delve into the details of the business model, the tech and competitors, consider it a red flag.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors need to know the basics of NFTs and their potential, but they don’t need deep technical knowledge. That’s because the real value of any NFT project lies with the people building it. They are the ones who will sustain promising NFT projects as they face inevitable moments of volatility.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to conduct the ultimate litmus test on an NFT project through its creators:</p>
<h2>Check if both the founder and tech are open</h2>
<p>The first NFT was created in 2014 and <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/652671/kevin-mccoy-quantum-first-nft-created-sells-at-sothebys-for-over-one-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was sold</a> only last year. The NFT marketplace is still in its infancy, and investors shouldn&#8217;t expect NFT projects to undergo the same vetting process as other tech initiatives. There aren&#8217;t sufficient data points available, nor the tools to track NFT performance. Instead, investors should be looking for transparency in a project’s leadership and tech infrastructure. It&#8217;s less about assessing the destination, and more about trusting that there&#8217;s a window to observe the journey.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Okay, now that we&#8217;re alone &#8212; all the curmudgeons have closed out of the article &#8212; let&#8217;s talk about Wordle. Today&#8217;s puzzle was particularly challenging, but when you typed &#8220;wordle&#8221; into the Google search bar to find that strange <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powerlanguage.co.uk</a> website, you might have noticed a fun Easter egg. The Google icon in the upper right corner looks like Wordle! The animation even enacts someone guessing words like &#8220;column&#8221; and &#8220;goalie&#8221; before arriving at &#8220;Google.&#8221; It&#8217;s cute, okay! (And in other news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/google-lawsuit-location-dc-privacy/">Google is being sued</a> by Washington, DC and three states over a user privacy issue.)</p>

<p>As the cultural significance of a Google Easter egg proves, Wordle is still very popular, and it&#8217;s not just on your Twitter feed. When TechCrunch spoke to the game&#8217;s creator Josh Wardle two weeks ago, he said that two million people were playing the game each day. If you&#8217;re decidedly not a curmudgeon and still think Wordle is fun (It is! If you don&#8217;t like it, just don&#8217;t play!), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/">check out our conversation with Wardle</a> (yep, that&#8217;s his name) about the game&#8217;s sudden virality, venture capital interest and why he doesn&#8217;t want to monetize the game.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wardle told TechCrunch:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>It’s not like I think that everyone needs to give away the things they create online for free, it was just that because that’s how I started this, it’s made it easier for me to continue it this way. I made something that felt really authentic to me, and now when people are asking like, “Do you want to monetize it? Why aren’t you doing X, Y and Z?”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s really easy for me to say… No, I was really happy with it when it was just my partner and me playing together. It’s really easy to get seduced by all that stuff, but I try and instead be like… I was happy then, and I think I’ll be happy in the future if that’s where it ends. If at the end of the day with Wordle, it’s just her and me playing again, I think I’ll be totally happy for that to be the outcome.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Washington, DC, Texas, Washington state and Indiana announced the latest lawsuit against Big Tech Monday, alleging that Google deceived users by collecting their location data even when they believed that kind of tracking was disabled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access,&#8221; DC Attorney General Karl Racine said. &#8220;The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Racine described Google&#8217;s privacy practices as &#8220;bold misrepresentations&#8221; that undermine consumer privacy. His office began investigating how Google handles user location data after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting from the Associated Press in 2018</a> found that many Google apps across iOS and Android recorded location data even when users have chosen privacy options that explicitly say they won&#8217;t. The AP coordinated with computer science researchers at Princeton to verify its findings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261279" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Google’s support page on the subject states: &#8216;You can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored,'&#8221; the AP reported. &#8220;That isn’t true. Even with Location History paused, some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit argues that Google created a location tracking system that&#8217;s impossible for users to opt out of and that it misled users about how privacy settings could protect their data within apps and at the device level on Android. It also accuses Google of relying on deceptive dark pattern design to force users into making choices counter to their own interests.</p>
<p>Those practices may have run afoul of state laws protecting consumers. In Washington, DC, the <a href="https://oag.dc.gov/consumer-protection/other-consumer-help-agencies-and-websites/submit-consumer-complaint/district-columbia-consumer-protection-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Protection Procedures Act (CPPA)</a> outlaws &#8220;a wide variety of deceptive and unconscionable business practices,&#8221; and is enforced by the attorney general.</p>
<p>Racine&#8217;s office is pursuing an injunction against Google as well as seeking to force the company to pay out profits that it made from user data collected by misleading consumers about their privacy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA&#8217;s Spinoff magazine is one of the things I look forward to reading every year. The space agency&#8217;s research trickles down to the rest of the world in surprising and interesting ways, which it tracks and collects in this annual publication. This year is no different, and NASA tech can be found in everything from hiking gadgets to heavy industry and, funnily enough, space.</p>
<p>There are dozens of technologies that have made their way to everyday use in a variety of places <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff-2022-release">highlighted in this year&#8217;s issue</a>, which you can <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-01/Spinoff.2022.pdf">browse here</a>. (It&#8217;s about 60 pages long, so pour some coffee and settle in.)</p>
<p>I talked with Daniel Lockney, the head of NASA&#8217;s Tech Transfer Program overseeing the deployment of its tech and research among terrestrial companies looking to put it to good use.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261213" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Typically what happens is: NASA develops something, they report it to my office, and we look at it to figure out, first, does it work? And second, who else can use it? And if someone can, we figure out how to get it to them,&#8221; Lockney explained. &#8220;I try to give as much away for free as I can. I&#8217;ve got no direction to generate revenue or bring something back to the U.S. treasury. The 1958 NASA act that created us says to disseminate our work — nothing in there about making a dime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result is cheap or free licensing of interesting tech like compact, long-lasting water filters, unusual mechanical components, and other tech that was needed for space or launch purposes but might find a second use on the ground.</p>
<p>Lockney highlighted a couple items in the latest batch that he thought were especially interesting.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a partnership with GM to develop the Robo-Glove, a functional glove that astronauts will wear to help reduce strain during repetitive tasks and increase grip strength,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Squeezing something on a spacewalk, you can do it a couple times, but if you&#8217;re gripping a tool for the whole afternoon&#8230; so we developed this glove to assist in that work, and now it&#8217;s being used at factories around the world.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2261392" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bioservo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261392" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2261392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bioservo.jpg" alt="Two images of people wearing a robotic glove at work." width="1024" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bioservo.jpg 1249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bioservo.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bioservo.jpg?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bioservo.jpg?resize=768,376 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bioservo.jpg?resize=680,333 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bioservo.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2261392" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bioservo Technologies</p></div></p>
<p>The Swiss company Bioservo licensed the NASA patents for Robo-Glove and has been iterating on the concept for years, and the latest version of its Ironhand device came out last summer. Its most common use case is by employees with hand injuries that might cause them to lose work, but can use the glove to return to the job faster as well as reduce pain medication.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always just a single company licensing a tech. Lockney noted how NASA was the first organization to look into the question of precision agriculture under totally artificial conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;NASA has a lot of experiments for keeping crews healthy on long distance spaceflight. One thing we have to do is grow our own food, plus there&#8217;s the psychological benefits of seeing plants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we needed to find ways to grow crops without a heavy growing medium like soil, or even hydroponics — water is so heavy, and so valuable. And you have to get he lighting right, but you can&#8217;t use too much energy. So we made these farming techniques to grow a lot of plants in a small space. If you control the plants&#8217; stress, you can really dial in precision growth conditions and improve yield; we actually use a nutritive film that covers the roots, LEDs to give the right spectrum of light, and of course there&#8217;s sensors everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a similar situation in cities, how do you provide food to this population without the resource waste of farmland? But we led this research because no one else had the need for it — it ended up being the direct result of the demands of spaceflight. And now there are a handful of companies doing vertical farms in dense urban areas, actually providing grocery stores with vegetables,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve actually covered a few, and they&#8217;re still in early days, but the appetite is clearly there for both consumers and investors to have food grown efficiently and within a few blocks of them rather than shipped a thousand miles overseas.</p>

<p>NASA work makes its way to leisure as well as life-sustaining industries. At least three of the items in this year&#8217;s Spinoff have to do with outdoors activities like hiking and camping. One, a thin-film radiant barrier originally used to line spacecraft, has made its way to jackets by <a href="https://13-one.com/">13-One</a> and others as super-light insulating layer. Aerogel research from the &#8217;90s has made its way to new gear from Seattle-based Outdoor Research (a brand I covet when I walk by their store). And a material called NanoCeram is used in a new <a href="https://nkdlife.com/">portable water filter bottle</a>.</p>
<p>One new application you wouldn&#8217;t expect to find in a publication about spinoff techs is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/spacexs-falcon-heavy-rocket-to-deliver-an-astrobotic-lander-and-nasa-water-hunting-rover-to-the-moon-in-2023/">Astrobotic&#8217;s Peregrine Moon lander</a>. In the past such things have been exclusively the domain of nationally-backed programs, but with the commercial space sector expanding quickly NASA tech is valuable to spacefaring companies as well.</p>
<p>Not all of these are new — some are decades old and still finding new applications or companies to sell them.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time we&#8217;ve done all the work and we&#8217;ve found a partner doing the commercial stuff, manufacturing, marketing&#8230;. next thing you know, 10 years have passed,&#8221; Lockney said. &#8220;The R&amp;D timeline is long and the commercialization timeline is long.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that means there&#8217;s always something fresh coming out even when the papers or materials are years old. There are dozens more techs and companies worth looking at in this year&#8217;s Spinoff, so take a look. And if you&#8217;ve got time, <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff/archives">head to the archives</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mark Cuban&#8217;s announcement over the weekend of an online pharmacy selling over a hundred generic drugs at near cost was totally unexpected but will likely be welcomed by millions who struggle to afford medication. The billionaire told TechCrunch that the business model is refreshingly simple: &#8220;Lower pricing reduces patient stress, and that will lead to more customers.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://costplusdrugs.com">The Cost Plus Drug Company</a> aims very simply to provide as many common medications as possible in generic form at as low a price as possible. All cash, no IP deals, no insurance companies — just buy pills for what they cost to make, plus 15 percent to cover overhead.</p>
<p>Asked about ROI, Cuban admitted there isn&#8217;t much to speak of, by design.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261311" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I want to be above break even while maximizing the number of people who can afford their medications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Shoot. I would be happy if we can make a little, but push pricing of generics sold elsewhere down significantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our challenge is to keep pushing prices lower,&#8221; not compete with anyone, he continued. &#8220;Our KPI is how much we can reduce the stress of our patients who buy generic meds. When people save a lot of money on their medications, they often will tell others they know that have the same challenges. That word of mouth impacts our growth the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company currently offers generic versions of medications <a href="https://costplusdrugs.com/medications/">for everything from migraines to HIV to birth control</a>, but there&#8217;s no particular priority to the ones on the list except that they can and should be offered cheaper, explained Cuban. There&#8217;s no board deciding which conditions are next on the list or anything like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as the process, we choose drugs that we can offer at a price that is lower than what is out there already,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;It&#8217;s like any business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ultra-straightforward business plan of undercutting middle men and offering a proven product for a better price than anyone else seems almost quaint today, but Cuban knows what he&#8217;s doing — in a generic way, at least. Asked what advice he had for any startups looking to get into the online pharmacy space, he offered a virtual shrug: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any. I&#8217;m still learning.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A newly launched recipe app called <a href="https://pestlechef.app/">Pestle</a> aims to do more than provide a place to save and organize your favorite recipes. The app, from indie developer Will Bishop, also helps you plan meals, create shopping lists, keep up with new recipes from creators, and even cook hands-free or with friends and family remotely over Apple&#8217;s SharePlay feature for FaceTime.</p>
<p>The result is a well-built recipe app that provides a better experience for the end user, and one which tries to respect the creator content it organizes by offering source links, tools to discover more recipes from the same creator as they&#8217;re published, and a feature that encourages repeat visits to recipe sites. But some of Pestle&#8217;s other features make it almost too easy to bypass creators&#8217; websites, which could cause concerns.</p>
<p>Like many people who use the web to find cooking inspiration, Bishop grew frustrated with the clutter common to today&#8217;s recipe websites where you have to scroll all the way to the bottom to find the actual recipe steps &#8212; a format <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/war-peace-bacon-eggs-understanding-the-endless-recipe-site-preamble-a890b3c55ad">designed to capture </a>more Google Search traffic. Also like many home chefs, Bishop found himself copying and pasting recipes into Apple&#8217;s Notes app so he could annotate them with his own tweaks and tips. This wasn&#8217;t the ideal solution, of course &#8212; as it involved many manual steps and resulted in a disorganized system, given that Notes isn&#8217;t designed to be a recipe database. So he decided to create his own solution with Pestle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261165" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The app integrates with Safari, so you can save any recipe you find on the web by tapping on the &#8220;Share&#8221; button from your iOS browser, like Safari or Chrome, then tapping on Pestle from the list of apps that appears. Pestle will automatically import the recipe, including the list of ingredients and instructions. This is similar to how other popular recipe-saving apps work, like Whisk or <a href="https://www.paprikaapp.com/">Paprika</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>However, where other apps may highlight the source directly on the recipe&#8217;s page, making it obvious who to credit, Pestle&#8217;s attribution link is tucked under its 3-dot &#8220;more&#8221; menu at the top of the recipe&#8217;s page. This isn&#8217;t likely an issue for the end user, who can easily seek out the link if they need to refer back to the website for more information. But it could cause complaints from the recipe&#8217;s creator, given that it takes an extra tap to get to the link, and feels a bit hidden.</p>
<p>In addition, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/whisks-a-i-powered-recipe-app-lets-you-send-the-ingredients-to-your-door/">competitor Whisk</a> even goes so far as to <em>not</em> import a recipe&#8217;s instructions &#8212; forcing users to visit the recipe site, where they can then choose to copy and paste instructions into the app for later reference &#8212; Pestle automatically imports the instructions alongside the ingredient list and nutritional info. Again, handy for the end user; less so for the creator.</p>
<p>Finally, while premium users can enjoy smart suggestions of new recipes from the recipe sites they like to visit, these can also be browsed and saved without a website visit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bishop, however, says he tried to be careful about the implementation here with regard to creator content.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2261327" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261327" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2261327" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cookbook.jpg?w=336" alt="" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cookbook.jpg 1061w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cookbook.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cookbook.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cookbook.jpg?resize=768,1556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cookbook.jpg?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cookbook.jpg?resize=758,1536 758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cookbook.jpg?resize=1011,2048 1011w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cookbook.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2261327" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pestle</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately I think Pestle compliments recipe websites as opposed to simply taking. Firstly, when you share a recipe to Pestle, you have to already be on their page. Meaning you’ve loaded their ads, their ranking improves, etc,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;Pestle is akin to clicking the print button in recipe websites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, he notes, the sources are attributed and linked to, and the app also prompts you to revisit the website after you finish cooking to leave a review, which is an interesting idea in terms of recirculating traffic from the app back to the creator&#8217;s original content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, recipes are not redistributed en-mass,&#8221; Bishop adds. &#8220;Pestle users can share recipes with one another, but if they share the recipe to someone who doesn’t have Pestle it’ll simply load the original site.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the end user&#8217;s perspective, there are few complaints as Pestle offers an easy-to-use app with a lot of helpful features. Though you can create your own folders, Pestle will automatically organize recipes for you by category and cuisine, so you can quickly find recipes without having to come up with your own foldering system.</p>
<p>As you cook, you can switch into a guided experience where you move through the recipe on a step-by-step basis. You can also set multiple timers along the way, and tap on links within each to be reminded of the quantities you need. Many other apps force you to switch back and forth between ingredient lists and the steps, which can complicate matters when the recipe&#8217;s steps have to be implemented quickly or when hands are messy.</p>
<p>And if dirtying your screen is a concern, you can navigate the app hands-free using voice commands like &#8220;Back&#8221; and &#8220;Next.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2261328" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261328" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2261328" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Guided-Cooking.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="493" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Guided-Cooking.jpg 2552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Guided-Cooking.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Guided-Cooking.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Guided-Cooking.jpg?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Guided-Cooking.jpg?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Guided-Cooking.jpg?resize=1536,1115 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Guided-Cooking.jpg?resize=2048,1486 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Guided-Cooking.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2261328" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pestle</p></div></p>
<p>Pestle also supports Apple&#8217;s SharePlay, so you can place a FaceTime call with family or friends, and cook together while using the app.</p>
<p>Premium users gain access to a few more features, like the discover section for finding new cooking inspiration, handoff and sync between iPhone and iPad devices, 14-day meal planning support, and shopping lists with Apple Reminders integration. (It won&#8217;t go so far as to help you order the ingredients through a shopping site like Instacart, however).</p>
<p>The paid subscription is on sale during its launch where a &#8220;lifetime&#8221; subscription will cost just $4.99, rather than the $9.99 per year (or $0.99/mo) subscription that will otherwise be available. After launch, the lifetime subscription will later cost $25.</p>
<p>Bishop, a 19-year old indie developer and former WWDC scholar, had built other apps before Pestle, including an Apple Watch Reddit app <a href="https://t.co/Ueb9YvmBZq">Nano for Reddit</a> and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/chirp-debuts-a-faster-feature-filled-twitter-app-for-apple-watch/">Apple Watch Twitter app, Chirp</a>, among others. But Pestle is his main focus as the others are largely self-sufficient.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d like to bring Pestle to other platforms, but for the time being, that may not be possible as a one-person operation, he says.</p>
<p>Pestle is a free download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1574776971">on the App Store</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://codenotary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codenotary</a>, a service that makes it easier for development teams to build transparent software supply chains (and also the company behind the popular open source <a href="https://codenotary.com/technologies/immudb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immudb</a> immutable database), today announced that it has raised a $12.5 million Series B round from new and existing investors like Bluwat, Elaia and others. This new round brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $18 million, including last July&#8217;s $5.5 million Series A round.</p>
<p>Founded by CEO Moshe Bar, who previously co-founded Qumranet, and CTO Dennis Zimmer, Codenotary helps people identify and track all of the components in their DevOps cycle. This means that when there is an attack on the supply chain or a vulnerability like Log4j, it&#8217;s far easier for a company to figure out where these libraries are being used and mitigate the potential blast radius. Because all of this sits on top of immudb, a ledger database that provides a tamper-evident history system (without any blockchain voodoo), users should be able to fully trust this information. After adding Codenotary to their software supply chain, the service automatically creates a bill of materials based on what it is seeing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2261273" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261273" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2261273" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg 2435w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg?resize=768,351 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg?resize=680,311 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg?resize=1536,702 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg?resize=2048,936 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/codenotary.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2261273" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Codenotary</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261207" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to make sure that we can trust the artifacts that we use in the development of applications throughout any organization, whether it&#8217;s open source or an internal enterprise organization,&#8221; Bar said. &#8220;When we started the company, we were looking for ways to make sure that the information that we store &#8212; about who worked on which artifact, when and how and what did they do to it &#8212; will be safe from tampering.&#8221; Since there was no database available at the time that fulfilled Codenotary&#8217;s requirement, the team wrote its own. Bar noted that immudb provides the same cryptographic verification you could get from a blockchain, but in the form of a far more performant database.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQ4iZAM14m0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“<span class="il">Codenotary</span> offers a solution which allows organizations to quickly identify and track all components in their DevOps cycle and therefore restore trust and integrity in all their myriad applications,&#8221; said Pascal Blum, senior partner at Bluwat AG in Switzerland, an early investor in <span class="il">Codenotary</span>. &#8220;Combined with <span class="il">Codenotary</span>’s leading immutable database, <a href="https://immudb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://immudb.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643134697155000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2tNr3O1O6e4-m3oa-O6aX8">immudb</a>, the company has achieved a leader position in this new market.&#8221;<u></u></p>
<p>The service currently has more than 100 customers and, while it is not able to disclose most of these names, the team noted that it includes some of the world&#8217;s largest banks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to Zimmer, most of Codenotary&#8217;s customers first implement the service in the software pipeline to be able to establish the provenance of their software from source to production. That customer base, he also noted, varies from small software development shops to large ERP companies, which often use the service to disclose the quality assurance work they put into a new release, for example, and to provide a bill of materials for external customers that use their software. As Bar added, it&#8217;s often financial organizations and government agencies that are at the forefront of thinking about these issues.</p>
<p>Codenotary plans to use the new funding to accelerate its product development and expand its marketing and sales worldwide.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline, MSFT Exchange — these names have become synonymous with infamous cybersecurity events. We keep calling every new zero-day exploit a “wake-up call,” but all we have been doing is collectively hitting the snooze button.</p>
<p>But the discovery of the newest widespread critical vulnerability, Log4Shell, ruined the industry’s holiday season. It&#8217;s the biggest cybersecurity threat to emerge in years, thanks to the near ubiquity of Java in web applications and the popularity of the Log4j library. Due to its unprecedented scale, compounded by the fact that it is not easy to find, getting rid of this bug from your IT environment isn’t a “one-and-done” activity.</p>
<p>Security teams across the globe are once again racing to remediate a software flaw, even as attackers have begun targeting the low-hanging fruit — public web servers — at a recently reported rate of <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/12/11/protecting-against-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2-versions-2-14-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 attempts per minute</a>. A mere seven days after its discovery, <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/12/11/protecting-against-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2-versions-2-14-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1.8 million attacks</a> had been detected against half of all corporate networks.</p>
<p>Are you awake now?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve participated in many urgent Log4Shell briefings with Qualys customers (who include 19,000+ enterprises worldwide, 64% of Forbes Global 100), and it’s clear that dealing with a constant barrage of zero-day vulnerabilities is one of the greatest challenges faced by today’s security teams.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Just like inventorying, gathering and analyzing threat intelligence is crucial to provide the necessary foundation for security teams to take calculated and intentional steps.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It can be overwhelming to prioritize fixes and patches when responding to a zero-day exploit like Log4Shell. Here are a few steps to respond to security threats that we have learned and cataloged over the years:</p>
<h2>Establish a standard operating procedure</h2>
<p>Create a detailed standard operating procedure that includes step-by-step activities tailored to the vulnerability type.</p>
<p>For a zero-day response, the following information must be included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process flow for responses. If you need help, the U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has created an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent guide</a>.</li>
<li>Categorize the vulnerability by the type, severity and required response times. There should be a specific category for critical zero-day vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Pre-determined service-level agreements for each response team.</li>
<li>Procedure for declaring and communicating an incident (this could be a reference to the incident response standard operating procedure).</li>
<li>Steps for tracking, reporting, and concluding the incident and returning to normal operations.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we have started to see the light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel, food delivery has shaped up to continue to be a major business. In England, for example, some 76% of people order at least one takeaway a week, whereas it was 60% pre-pandemic. Now, a startup called <a href="https://www.deliverect.com/us-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deliverect</a> that has built a platform to integrate the many moving parts that go into ordering and delivery for the average restaurant is announcing a big round of funding to pursue the opportunity. The startup has raised $150 million, a Series D round of funding that values the company at over $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Coatue Management and Alkeon Capital Management are leading the round, with OMERS Ventures, DST Global, Redpoint Ventures, Newion and Smartfin also participating. The round comes less than a year after its previous round &#8212; a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/deliverect-gobbles-up-65m-for-a-platform-that-streamlines-online-and-offline-food-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $65 million Series C</a> that it raised last April.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first time that Deliverect is disclosing its valuation but the company has grown at a pretty torrid rate since that last round. It now has its software in use in 20,000 locations across 40 markets, with the number of locations doubling in less than a year. It has also tripled its year-on-year growth (and CEO Zhong Xu, who co-founded the company with Jan Hollez (CTO), Jelte Vrijhoef (CIO) and Jerome Laredo (CRO) said in an interview that in fact the valuation has also roughly tripled since then). It&#8217;s fast heading to processing some 100 million orders globally, he added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company plans to use the funding to hire more people, and to build out more functionality on its platform, including an app store to make it easier to integrate more companies as and when they are used by one of their customers. Today it&#8217;s biggest market is Europe, but it&#8217;s growing the fastest in North America, so it will also be investing to continue expanding there. (Xu actually called me from a plane about to take off to New York.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One thing that Deliverect sees is that demand for its services is definitely not slowing down. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are preparing for the age after Covid,&#8221; Xu said. &#8220;We are preparing to scale to meet all of the digital opportunities in the food hospitality industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The business started in 2018 with serving independent restaurants &#8212; born, as we recounted previously, in Ghent, Belgium, out of Xu&#8217;s experience with his father, who had started a business selling point of sale systems to Chinese restaurants after immigrating to the country from China; Xu saw the fragmentation in the business and struck out on his own to fix that gap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the years since, Deliverect has moved into also work with large chains like Pret A Manger, Taco Bell and many others. Today Deliverect&#8217;s business is split roughly 50-50 between the two categories.</p>
<p>In either case, the challenge is the same: restaurants and others in the food industry typically work with a number of suppliers and need better ways to organize that into a single platform.</p>
<p>For restaurants, it might be several ordering and delivery systems that come into a kitchen that send in orders to be filled.</p>
<p>For delivery services, it might be a number of restaurants that it needs to organize for drivers.</p>
<p>Consumer packaged goods companies, a newer category of customers for Deliverect (Unilever is one such customer today), might be working directly with grocery delivery companies to supply them and thus may need their own platforms to manage how much, where and when to send of a specific product.</p>
<p>The opportunity that the company has addressed is that while a number of aggregating platforms have emerged for other parts of the hospitality industry &#8212; Booking.com, for example, for travel &#8212; restaurants and food in general had yet to be addressed.</p>
<p class="p4">&#8220;Food is the last frontier,&#8221; Xu said. &#8220;If there were no pandemic things would have moved quite slowly because the infrastructure for a restaurant is very fragmented. We’re allowing for a new age of digital solutions and we are building a new system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pret A Manger is an apt example of how Deliverect is expanding its business with customers: initially helping with deliveries, it is now also powering the company&#8217;s order management in store, too.</p>
<p>The fact that the pandemic has pushed along the growth of Deliverect in the market has also worked in the reverse, it seems.</p>
<p>Hollez recounted how one restaurant was so grateful for getting through the pandemic, crediting Deliverect for its success in handling orders for delivery, that the proprietor bought the company&#8217;s team dinner one night. &#8220;T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">his is why we do it,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Deliverect says that longer term, it might potentially consider an IPO, but that is not something on the cards at the moment. It does see an opportunity to make acquisitions selectively to add more tech and talent into the mix.</p>
<p>One area where it&#8217;s less concerned is in the area of competition, say from a point of sale provider who might want to own the bigger experience. Xu describes Deliverect as a &#8220;Switzerland&#8221; that plays nice with everyone, but doesn&#8217;t compete directly with anyone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Deliverect is streamlining the on-demand ordering economy with its industry leading, omni-channel platform that connects consumers to leading restaurants and brands,” said Mark McLaughlin, general partner at Alkeon Capital, in a statement. “Deliverect’s co-founders – all veterans of next generation commerce – have assembled the strongest team in hospitality to steer Deliverect’s ambitious road map and disruptive technology into new markets and use cases.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The multi-billion dollar market for restaurant-side technology is being fueled by multiple tailwinds including a change in consumer habits related to the ongoing pandemic, the need to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of delivery networks, and shifts in foodservice retail such as dark kitchens and virtual restaurant brands,&#8221; added Sebastian Duesterhoeft, a general partner at Coatue. “We believe Deliverect is capitalizing on these trends with its goal to become a category leader with a mission to empower restaurants globally. We are thrilled to partner with Zhong and the team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the Winter Games in Beijing on the horizon, NBCUniversal will team up with TikTok for an advertising partnership to promote the network&#8217;s coverage of the Olympics. NBCUniversal told TechCrunch that its advertising partners will be the first brands to pilot a new, creative ad experience on TikTok.</p>
<p>TikTok and NBCUniversal did not elaborate on how these ads will be different from existing ones, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/nbcuniversal-checkout/">both companies</a> have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">explored social shopping</a> as of late, which could be a potential avenue for their partnership. NBCUniversal will still work with other social platforms such as Twitter, which will hosts a live show and highlights.</p>
<p>According to NBCUniversal, Olympics-related content has garnered over 18 billion views on TikTok, so the network directly invited TikTok to collaborate on 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics content. This includes daily content across NBC TikTok handles, as well as a three-episode livestream show hosted by a yet-to-be-named TikTok creator.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Tokyo 2020 Games highlighted our community&#8217;s appetite for sports-adjacent content that shows a different side of the Games and the athletes, creating new avenues and content strategies for brands &#8212; including NBC &#8212; to engage with and entertain them,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;While this partnership does present unique opportunities for NBCUniversal advertisers, it also includes a robust slate of content that NBC will share across its TikTok accounts, including daily posts showcasing everything from highlights to topical trends, and three livestreams hosted by a TikTok creator. The athletes’ stories and journeys are an integral part of NBC’s coverage of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, so fans can expect to see them on TikTok across their handles.&#8221;</p>
<p>This summer at the Tokyo Games &#8212; which were pushed back a year due to COVID-19 &#8212; TikTok emerged as an unlikely hub for behind-the-scenes content from international athletes. When Suni Lee placed first in the all-around gymnastics competition at the Olympics last summer, how did she celebrate the achievement of a lifetime? She ordered pizza and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sunisalee_/video/6990385652596608262?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en">danced on TikTok</a> with her gold medal, garnering 31 million views. The prevalence of Olympians on TikTok garnered an unlikely audience for the global event. You might not have ordinarily paid attention to Olympic Rugby, but after following athlete <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ilonamaher?lang=en">Ilona Maher</a> on TikTok, maybe you&#8217;d tune in to the NBC broadcast.</p>
<p>In that regard, this partnership makes sense &#8212; TikTok has proven to be a unique way for fans to experience the international competition. But from a tech perspective, NBCUniversal&#8217;s TikTok partnership raises some questions. Headquartered in China, Bytedance is the parent company of TikTok, but TikTok is not available in China (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/short-video-search-douyin-tiktok/">Douyin</a> is Bytedance&#8217;s China-specific version of the app). Typically, people in China wouldn&#8217;t be able to use TikTok due to internet censorship in the country. But Olympic athletes and foreign media in Beijing are <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-crack-open-great-firewall-for-winter-olympic-athletes-/6356402.html">allegedly</a> being granted special SIM cards that offer uncensored internet access. Even if athletes have access to social media, they may not be posting carefree videos &#8212; the United States Olympic organizing committee <a href="https://www.axios.com/beijing-china-olympics-internet-censorship-35e1cd8e-0af4-4175-825b-19ee68fd8e34.html">warned athletes</a> to assume that &#8220;personal communications will be difficult at best while operating in China.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia have announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/diplomatic-boycott-olympics.html">diplomatic</a> <a href="https://time.com/6129154/beijing-olympics-boycott/">boycotts</a> of the games in Beijing, protesting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/diplomatic-boycott-olympics.html">human rights abuses</a> against mostly Muslim ethnic minorities like the Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region of China. After urging from human rights groups, NBCUniversal has said it will provide &#8220;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/nbcuniversal-says-will-cover-geopolitical-issues-during-beijing-olympics-2022-01-19/">geopolitical context</a>&#8221; during its broadcast of the controversial Games.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German publishers are the latest to band together to try to derail or at least delay Google&#8217;s &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; plan to end support for tracking cookies in Chrome via a complaint to the European Commission.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eccf5514-8b83-4d85-8305-f882adf5dac3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial Times</a> reports that hundreds of German publishers, advertisers and media and industry groups &#8212; including local powerhouse Axel Springer (which publishes titles like Bild and Politico) &#8212; have submitted a complaint to the bloc’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, arguing that Google&#8217;s plan to phase out support for third party cookies from its Chrome browser and replace tracking infrastructure with alternative (and it claims) more privacy-respecting alternatives for ad targeting breaches EU competition law.</p>
<p>This is not a novel argument. The U.K.&#8217;s competition watchdog, the CMA, has been considering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/digital-marketing-firms-file-uk-competition-complaint-against-googles-privacy-sandbox/">similar complaints since 2020</a> &#8212; and is in the process of consulting on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">a series of behavioral and oper</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">ational commitments</a> offered by Google in a bid to avoid a full ban on the migration in that market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261149" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, the regulatory attention to Privacy Sandbox has already contributed to delay the implementation timeline by up to a year, as Google said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">last summer</a> that the switch would not now happen until the second half of 2023 vs an earlier announcement, in January 2020, when it said it wanted to make the shift &#8220;within two years&#8221;.</p>

<p>While the U.K. is no longer in the EU, Google has said that if the country&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority accepts its Privacy Sandbox commitments it will apply them globally &#8212; meaning they would also apply in and be relevant for the EU (which is not the same as saying they would be automatically acceptable to the bloc&#8217;s own regulators, however).</p>
<p>German publishers and advertisers don&#8217;t seem impressed by Google&#8217;s offer, though.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At least not judging by the 108-page complaint reviewed by the FT &#8212; in which it reports that Axel Springer, along with the country&#8217;s federal association of digital publishers and a number of others argue the planned changes will damage their businesses while allowing Google&#8217;s ads-based search business unaffected as it will collect to be able to collect vast amounts of user data.</p>
<p>Per the FT&#8217;s report of the document, the companies argue they must be allowed to continue to ask users for consent to process their data for ad targeting &#8220;without Google capturing this decision&#8221;; as well as urging that &#8220;Google must respect the relationship between publishers and users without interfering&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the report of the complaint, a Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People want a more private, secure web and we&#8217;ve proposed ideas to help build it with new digital advertising tools to protect privacy and prevent covert tracking, while supporting a thriving ad-funded open web.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In further background remarks, the tech giant argued that web users&#8217; expectations and regulations are both changing so there&#8217;s a need for adtech infrastructure to adapt.</p>
<p>It also pointed out that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/mozilla-flips-the-default-switch-on-firefox-tracking-cookie-blocking/">other browsers</a> have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/apple-defends-new-ad-tracking-prevention-measures-in-safari/">already withdrawn support</a> for tracking cookies. (Albeit, Google&#8217;s market power here, via Chrome, is far more substantial than alternative browsers like Firefox and Safari.)</p>
<p>The tech giant also claimed its Privacy Sandbox proposal are being designed in the open &#8212; in consultation with a cross-section of the web community, including publishers.</p>
<p>Although, here again, there&#8217;s no doubt Google remains in the driving seat, directing and steering these proposals (and what &#8216;consultation&#8217; there is and has been to date, certainly does not sum to co-design, let alone Google taking a more minor role in shaping the future).</p>
<p>Moreover, a perceived lack of transparency/openness in Google&#8217;s approach has also led the company to dial up the commitments it has offered the U.K. competition regulator on Sandbox &#8212; such as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/"> around testing</a> and taking market feedback &#8212; which suggests, contrary to Google&#8217;s background claims, that a <em>lack</em> of openness is a particular bone of contention for advertisers and publishers (at least in the U.K. market).</p>

<p>In Germany, Google/Alphabet currently has two open antitrust investigations against it by the country&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office (FCO): One focused on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">News Showcase product</a>; and another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">digging into its data terms</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/germany-fco-google-decision/">earlier this month</a> the German regular found Mountain View meets the threshold for ex ante regulatory interventions to be applicable &#8212; which quickly led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/google-news-showcase-fco-offers/">an offer from Google to try to settle the News Showcase complaint</a>. So it&#8217;s interesting to speculate whether the FCO has received a copy of the German publishers complaint against Privacy Sandbox.</p>
<p>If so &#8212; and if the FCO agrees there&#8217;s a problem &#8212; that would offer (very likely) the swiftest option for local behavioral relief, given Germany is ahead of other European countries (and the Commission) in updating its domestic competition rules with an eye on curbing tech giants&#8217; market power. (The U.K., for example, intends to bring in a &#8220;pro-competition&#8221; reform to tackle Big Tech&#8217;s market power too, but has yet to legislate, meaning the CMA is limited to its existing regulatory toolbox.)</p>
<p>However a spokeswoman for the FCO declined to confirm whether/if the regulator has received a Privacy Sandbox complaint from German publishers &#8212; saying only: &#8220;We don’t communicate about possible complaints we have received.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Commission spokeswoman also declined to comment on the FT&#8217;s report and any potential impacts the complaint could have on its own ongoing investigation of Google&#8217;s adtech practices.</p>
<p>The Commission has hit Google with a series of enforcements under Vestager&#8217;s tenure at the competition unit.</p>
<p>But it was not until<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/"> last summer</a> that Vestager finally turned her attention to Google&#8217;s adtech practices &#8212; saying then that the unit would examine whether Google is distorting competition by restricting access by third parties to user data for advertising purposes on websites and apps, while reserving such data for its own use.</p>
<p>The terms of reference of the investigation do explicitly refer to Privacy Sandbox &#8212; with the Commission saying it would look at the plan to replace third party ‘cookies’ on Chrome with a stack of alternatives ( including considering &#8220;the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets&#8221;).</p>
<p>The EU probe also covers scrutiny of a Google plan to stop making the advertising identifier available to third parties on Android devices when a user opts out of personalised advertising to similarly assess the wider ad market effects, among other areas of investigation.</p>
<p>On this, the Commission spokeswomen told us: &#8220;<span lang="EN-IE">As part of its in-depth investigation, the Commission is examining, among others,</span><span lang="EN-IE"> </span><span lang="EN-IE">Google&#8217;s announced plans to prohibit the placement of third party ‘cookies&#8217; on Chrome and replace them with the “Privacy Sandbox” set of tools, including the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;This investigation is ongoing,&#8221; she added. </span></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s own set of ex ante rules for tech giants &#8212; aka, the Digital Markets Act &#8212; is currently making its way through the bloc&#8217;s co-legislative process. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">MEPs recently voted to beef up restrictions</a> on gatekeepers&#8217; ability to track Internet users for ad targeting. Although the full detail of the future pan-EU law has yet to be hammered out.</p>
<p>So, whether or not Google gets its way with Privacy Sandbox, it&#8217;s clear adtech is facing substantial regional pressure to reform.</p>
<p>The outgoing U.K. information commissioner warned the industry <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">last fall</a> it&#8217;s past time for a big reset, emphasizing the need to move away from current methods of online tracking and profiling, and bake in data protection and privacy from the start.</p>
<p>The German publishers&#8217; apparent focus on maintaining the ability to ask users for consent to track looks, well, interesting in light of long-standing G<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">DPR complaints against current &#8216;consent request&#8217; methods. (Also last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">November</a> the ad industry body, the IAB Europe, warned it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of the pan-EU regulation &#8212; along with its industry standard Transparency and Consent Framework, which is used by scores of websites to gather consent for ad targeting.)</span></p>
<p>One thing is clear: There won&#8217;t be a sticking plaster fix for <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">systematic, high velocity trading of web users&#8217; personal data for ad targeting purposes &#8212; a meaningful alternative will be required to pass muster under robust EU privacy laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whether this alternative gets designed by Google &#8212; or by the wider adtech and publishing industry engaging in good faith with privacy concerns &#8212; is a whole other question. And, well, so far Google does rather look streaks ahead in this regard&#8230; </span></p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Google has followed up the Financial Times&#8217; reporting today by going on the offensive in a <a href="https://twitter.com/googleeurope/status/1485712797539487747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mini tweet storm</a> in which it accuses the newspaper specifically, and the publishing industry more generally, of failing to pay any mind to the privacy problems associated with current methods of tracking and profiling for ad targeting, arguing that &#8220;everyone needs to adapt&#8221; to a &#8220;more private and secure web&#8221;.</p>

<p>Google ends the thread with a reference to the regulatory commitments it offered the U.K.&#8217;s antitrust regulator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">last fall</a> &#8212; adding that it &#8220;welcome[s] feedback so we can find solutions that work for publishers and protect privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, er, touché.</p>
<p>In the U.K. the CMA and the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) are jointly assessing Google&#8217;s commitments in order that competition and data protection are considered in concert.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cma-ico-joint-statement-on-competition-and-data-protection-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint statement</a> last May the two U.K. regulators said the would work together to overcome any perceived tensions between their objectives.</p>
<p>Also on privacy and competition, Germany&#8217;s FCO has, in recent years, distinguished itself by bringing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">a pioneering case against Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;super-profiling&#8217; of users</a> &#8212; arguing the adtech giant&#8217;s &#8220;exploitative abuse&#8221; of privacy, through the systematic combining of people&#8217;s information across multiple services, is itself a competition concern.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security researcher said he was able to remotely access dozens of Teslas around the world because security bugs found in an open source logging tool popular with Tesla owners exposed their cars directly to the internet.</p>
<p>News of the vulnerability was first revealed earlier this month <a href="https://twitter.com/david_colombo_/status/1480632304045330433?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a tweet</a> by David Colombo, a security researcher in Germany, who said he had &#8220;full remote control&#8221; of more than 25 Teslas, but was struggling to disclose the issue to affected Tesla owners without making the details public and also alerting malicious hackers.</p>
<p>The bug is now fixed, Colombo confirmed. TechCrunch held this story until the vulnerability could no longer be exploited. Colombo published his findings in <a href="https://medium.com/@david_colombo/how-i-got-access-to-25-teslas-around-the-world-by-accident-and-curiosity-8b9ef040a028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257615" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Colombo told TechCrunch that the vulnerabilities were found in TeslaMate, a <a href="https://docs.teslamate.org/docs/screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free-to-download logging software</a> used by Tesla owners to connect to their vehicles and access their cars&#8217; otherwise hidden data — their car&#8217;s energy consumption, location history, driving statistics and other granular data for troubleshooting and diagnosing problems. TeslaMate is a self-hosted web dashboard often running on the home computers of Tesla hobbyists, and relies on access to Tesla&#8217;s API to tap into their car&#8217;s data, which is tied to the car owner&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>But security flaws in the web dashboard — like allowing anonymous access and using default passwords that some users never changed — coupled with misconfigurations by some Tesla owners, resulted in at least a hundred TeslaMate dashboards being exposed directly to the internet, including the car owner&#8217;s API key used to remotely control their Teslas.</p>
<p>In a call with TechCrunch, Colombo said the number of impacted Teslas is likely higher.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257629" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257629" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2257629 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png" alt="" width="900" height="557" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257629" class="wp-caption-text">One of the exposed TeslaMate dashboards showed one Tesla&#8217;s recent travel routes across California. TeslaMate has since fixed its vulnerabilities and Tesla has revoked thousands of API keys. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> David Colombo (supplied)</p></div></p>
<p>Colombo said he discovered that TeslaMate dashboards were unprotected by default after stumbling on an exposed dashboard last year. After scanning the internet for more open dashboards, he found exposed Teslas in the U.K., Europe, Canada, China and across the United States.</p>
<p>But contacting individual Tesla owners with exposed dashboards would be a Herculean task, Colombo explained, and in many cases, it&#8217;s not possible to accurately discern a way to contact affected Tesla customers.</p>
<p>Worse, it was possible to extract the Tesla users&#8217; API key from the exposed dashboard, allowing a malicious hacker to retain long-term access to Teslas without the drivers&#8217; knowledge. (An API allows two things to talk to each other over the internet — in this case, a Tesla car and the company’s servers, the Tesla app or a TeslaMate dashboard.) Access to Tesla&#8217;s API is restricted to Tesla owners through a private API key associated with the owner&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>With access to an exposed API key, Colombo said he could remotely access some features of the car, such as unlocking the doors and windows, honking the horn and starting keyless driving, which he verified with one Tesla owner in Ireland. He could also access the data inside, such as the car&#8217;s location data, recent driving routes and where it&#8217;s parked. Colombo said he does not believe it&#8217;s possible to use the API access to move the vehicle remotely over the internet.</p>
<p>Colombo said that while the security issues weren&#8217;t in Tesla&#8217;s infrastructure, Tesla could do more to improve its security, such as revoking a customer&#8217;s API key when their password is changed, an industry-standard practice.</p>
<p>After privately reporting the vulnerabilities, TeslaMate <a href="https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate/releases/tag/v1.25.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed a software fix</a> that users have to manually install to prevent access. TeslaMate project maintainer Adrian Kumpf told TechCrunch that the update went out within a few hours of receiving Colombo&#8217;s email. In an email, Kumpf said that because the software is self-hosted, it can&#8217;t protect against users accidentally exposing their systems to the internet, adding that TeslaMate&#8217;s documentation has long warned users to install the software &#8220;on your home network, as otherwise your Tesla API tokens might be at risk.&#8221; Kumpf also said that users who chose the advanced installation option should not be affected.</p>
<p>Colombo told TechCrunch that Tesla revoked thousands of drivers&#8217; API keys, potentially indicating that the issue may have been more widespread than initially thought. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment prior to publication. (Tesla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/teslas-decision-to-scrap-its-pr-department-could-create-a-pr-nightmare/">scrapped its public relations team</a> in 2020.)</p>

The 4680 cell is said to boost the range of electric vehicles by over 15 percent. As <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-to-start-producing-new-Tesla-batteries-in-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Nikkei</ins></em></a> notes, that could boost the range of the Model S from 650km (404 miles or so) on a single charge to 750km (around 465 miles).</p>
<p>Although the battery is said to be twice as big as previous versions, it has a fivefold increase in energy capacity, according to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-to-start-producing-new-Tesla-batteries-in-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Nikkei</em></a>. As such, cars need fewer of the batteries, which are already 10 to 20 percent cheaper to produce. It&#8217;s estimated that batteries account for 30 percent of the cost of EVs. A cost reduction could make EVs more affordable and hasten the transition to electric vehicles. What&#8217;s more, a longer range means drivers won&#8217;t need to charge batteries as often.</p>
<p>Panasonic, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-sold-tesla-shares-to-raise-cash-for-acquisition-103525121.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>a long-time partner of Tesla,</ins></a> is reportedly investing around 80 billion yen ($704 million) on new equipment to produce the 4680. It&#8217;s said to be expanding an existing plant in Japan and making the batteries there to begin with. <em>Nikkei </em>reports the company will start making the cells on a small scale this year to develop safe and efficient processes before entering mass production in 2023. It may mass produce the batteries in other countries later.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company confirmed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/panasonic-invest-700-million-produce-new-batteries-evs-nikkei-2022-01-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> that it was setting up a test production line in 2022, though didn&#8217;t say when it will start making the batteries at a larger scale. &#8220;We are studying various options for mass production,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Panasonic started working on the cell following a request from Tesla. The head of Panasonic&#8217;s battery division <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Panasonic-moves-toward-mass-production-of-Tesla-s-next-gen-batteries" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">said in November</a> that the company hasn&#8217;t ruled out producing the cell for other automakers, though Tesla is its priority. Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously said that although his company plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-26-tesla-developing-own-ev-battery-cells.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><ins>make its own batteries</ins></a>, it would continue to source them from other suppliers.</p>
<p>Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-battery-day-25k-ev-231307638.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>announced the 4680</ins></a> at a Battery Day event in September 2020. At the time, Musk said the cell and other developments could enable Tesla to start selling a $25,000 EV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a global competition to build the biggest, most powerful computers on the planet, and Meta (AKA Facebook) is about to jump into the melee with the <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-rsc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;AI Research SuperCluster,&#8221; or RSC</a>. Once fully operational, it may well sit in the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, which it will use for the massive number crunching needed for language and computer vision modeling.</p>
<p>Large AI models, of which OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 is probably the best known, don&#8217;t get put together on laptops and desktops; they&#8217;re the final product of weeks and months of sustained calculations by high-performance computing systems that dwarf even the most cutting-edge gaming rig. And the faster you can complete the training process for a model, the faster you can test it and produce a new and better one. When training times are measured in months, that really matters.</p>
<p>RSC is up and running and the company&#8217;s researchers are already putting it to work&#8230; with user-generated data, it must be said, though Meta was careful to say that it is encrypted until training time and the whole facility is isolated from the wider internet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260829" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The team that put RSC together is rightly proud at having pulled this off almost entirely remotely — supercomputers are surprisingly physical constructions, with base considerations like heat, cabling and interconnect affecting performance and design. Exabytes of storage sound big enough digitally, but they actually need to exist somewhere too, on site and accessible at a microsecond&#8217;s notice. (Pure Storage is <a href="https://www.purestorage.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/pure-partners-with-meta-on-ai-research-supercluster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also proud of the setup they put together for this</a>.)</p>
<p>RSC is currently 760 Nvidia DGX A100 systems with a total 6,080 GPUs, which Meta claims should put it approximately in competition with Perlmutter at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. That&#8217;s the fifth most powerful supercomputer in operation right now, <a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2021/11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to longtime ranking site Top 500</a>. (No. 1 is <a href="https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fugaku</a> in Japan by a long shot, in case you&#8217;re wondering.)</p>
<p>That could change as the company continues building out the system. Ultimately they plan for it to be about three times more powerful, which would in theory put it in the running for third place.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZnykn1tDSE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>There&#8217;s arguably a caveat in there. Systems like second-place Summit at Lawrence Livermore National Lab are employed for research purposes, where precision is at a premium. If you&#8217;re simulating the molecules in a region of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere at unprecedented detail levels, you need to take every calculation out to a whole lot of decimal points. And that means those calculations are more computationally expensive.</p>
<p>Meta explained that AI applications don&#8217;t require a similar degree of precision, since the results don&#8217;t hinge on that thousandth of a percent — inference operations end up producing things like &#8220;90% certainty this is a cat,&#8221; and if that number were 89% or 91% wouldn&#8217;t make a big difference. The difficulty is more about achieving 90% certainty for a million objects or phrases rather than a hundred.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an oversimplification, but the result is that RSC, running TensorFloat-32 math mode, can get more FLOP/s (floating point operations per second) per core than other, more precision-oriented systems. In this case it&#8217;s up to 1,895,000 teraFLOP/s, or 1.9 exaFLOP/s, more than 4x Fugaku&#8217;s. Does that matter? And if so, to whom? If anyone, it might matter to the Top 500 folks, so I&#8217;ve asked if they have any input on it. But it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that RSC will be among the fastest computers in the world, perhaps the fastest to be operated by a private company for its own purposes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Klarity replaces humans for tasks that require large-scale document review, including accounting order forms, purchase orders and agreements.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reviewing repetitive documents is, well, repetitive, but <a href="https://www.tryklarity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klarity</a> believes people don’t have to do all of that and is building an artificial intelligence tool, targeting finance and accounting departments, that turns documents into structured data.</p>
<p>Document automation is not a new concept. There was an original wave of companies working on partial document automation, which still needs a human review, but Ondrej Antos, Klarity’s co-founder and CEO, explained that the full document automation market is still very nascent.</p>
<p>“Partial document automation companies did not achieve much scale due to the limited value of their product,” he said via email. “Full automation has the ability to replace human review for a vast majority of documents — over 85% in Klarity’s case — and with a higher accuracy. This generates a lot of value, not only for large enterprises, but also mid-market companies that have a few hundred documents every month and the market is therefore much larger.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260899" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Antos founded Klarity in 2017 with Nischal Nadhamuni whom he met at MIT. They bonded over Antos’ experience of having to review large amounts of data when he was a corporate lawyer. Nadhamuni was studying Natural Language Processing and thought it could be applied to  understand documents better than humans. In August 2020, the product was launched.</p>
<p>Klarity replaces humans for tasks that require large-scale document review, including accounting order forms, purchase orders and agreements. Instead of having many accountants reading thousands of almost identical documents every month to find non-standard language, Klarity does that, helping the accountants save time and avoid mistakes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260904" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260904" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2260904" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png" alt="Klarity" width="1024" height="612" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png 1590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=1536,918 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260904" class="wp-caption-text">An example of Klarity&#8217;s document automation. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Klarity</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the last nine months, the company saw its annual recurring revenue grow nine times and over 24 times year over year, prompting Klarity to raise new capital to invest in sales and marketing to scale and continue investing in R&amp;D. It is also currently working with more than 40 enterprise and mid-market customers, including Coupa, Optimizely and 8&#215;8.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $18 million in a Series A funding round led by Tola Capital. As part of the investment, Sheila Gulati, founder and managing director of Tola Capital, joins Klarity’s board of directors. To date, Klarity has raised just over $20 million.</p>
<p>New investors also participating in the round are Invus Opportunities and a group of individual investors, including executives from its customers 8&#215;8 and Coupa. Existing investors following on include Elad Gil, Daniel Gross, Nat Friedman and Picus Capital.</p>
<p>The company is focused on hiring sales, marketing and engineering. It has 34 employees, up from 14 a year ago. It is also poised to launch new document review automation use cases for deal desk, renewals and procurement teams in late 2022.</p>
<p>“Today, the vast majority of enterprises don’t even realize there is a technological solution to this omnipresent problem,” Antos said. “We will help to educate the market that there is a technical solution to the age-old problem of document review by accounting teams and to continue building a market-leading product.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peloton ended 2020 on top. Its own supply chain issues had presented a hurdle &#8212; but if anything, these were side effects of the company’s own stratospheric successes. It simply <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/peloton-will-pump-100m-into-delivery-logistics-to-ease-supply-concerns/">couldn’t keep up with demand</a>, one of the better problems to have as a business on the rise. Always leave them wanting more, as P.T. Barnum may or may not have once said.</p>
<p>The connected fitness firm had already developed a kind of cultish following in various upscale circles, well before most of us had an inkling of knowledge about novel coronaviruses. But the pandemic accelerated Peloton’s success beyond what most could have reasonably predicted. Gyms across the world began to shut down, and with everyone stuck inside, home fitness provided a solution. Peloton, offering some extra connectedness in a socially distanced world, was a hit.</p>
<p>Investors bought in, sending Peloton&#8217;s share from around $30 at the start of 2020 to above $160 in the closing days of the year. In 2021, however, things hit the skids, with Peloton falling to around $36 by the end of last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Those declines have continued. Last week, things truly hit the wall at Peloton. A continued erosion in demand as gyms began to reopen has seemingly put the company on red alert. With hundreds of millions spent on manufacturing to meet a spike in demand, Peloton’s top brass appear to have seen the pandemic as less of a one-in-a-100-year-event and more the beginnings of something larger.</p>
<p>Following reports that the company had employed consulting firm McKinsey to facilitate restructuring and layoffs, Peloton lost ground. Further reports &#8212; partially denied by CEO John Foley &#8212; suggested the company was halting production across its line of treadmills and stationary bikes, and were more bad news for the value of the company.</p>
<p>And this morning, Jason Aintabi, the chief investment officer of activist investor Blackwells Capital, issued a letter to Peloton’s directors, calling for Foley’s immediate termination and imploring the board to consider selling Peloton.</p>
<p>Writes Aintabi:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the pandemic offered Peloton a tremendous and unexpected opportunity to accelerate consumer adoption of its category-defining products and drive performance of the business and value for shareholders. With the stock now trading below the IPO price, and down more than 80% from its high, it is clear that the Company, the executives and the Board have squandered this opportunity.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the Company is on worse footing today than it was prior to the pandemic, with high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders. And no wonder, the latter, given that Peloton underperformed every other company in the Nasdaq 100 over the last twelve months.</p></blockquote>
<p>The letter concludes, “The ride for Mr. Foley is over. This Board must now independently chart a new path for Peloton.”</p>
<p>Blackwells, which acquired a significant stake of less than 5% of the company, per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-investor-to-call-on-peloton-to-fire-its-ceo-11642982211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, cites a laundry list of “leadership failures,” outlining what has been an undeniable roller coaster for Peloton since the pandemic began. Included are: Committing to a 20-year lease on a massive office space in New York City, Foley’s handling of a massive product recall after the death of a young child, promoting his wife to an executive position inside the company and large investments in increased manufacturing capacity, which were ultimately shuttered over decreased demand.</p>
<p>Last week, Foley broke from a pre-earnings “quiet period” to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/peloton-ceo-acknowledges-corrective-actions-denies-halting-all-production-of-bikes-and-treadmills/">address some of the reports</a> that have swirled around the company, calling news that it was halting all production false. He did, however, confirm that adjustments to production and headcount were seemingly inevitable.</p>
<p>“In the past, we’ve said layoffs would be the absolute last lever we would ever hope to pull,” the executive wrote. “However, we now need to evaluate our organization structure and size of our team, with the utmost care and compassion. And we are still in the process of considering all options as part of our efforts to make our business more flexible.”</p>
<p>Foley chided press coverage derived from a series of leaks, calling it, “incomplete, out of context, and not reflective of Peloton’s strategy,” and promised to offer more information on the company’s strategy during its February earnings call.</p>
<p>Blackwells, for its part, doesn’t pull any punches in the letter.</p>
<p>“We recognize that Mr. Foley undoubtedly regards Peloton as ‘his’ company and you, the Company’s directors, as ‘his’ Board,” Aintabi writes. “He has outsized influence and outsized voting power by virtue of his status as founder. Perhaps some of you – friends with Mr. Foley for many years – feel obligated to do as he wishes. But the law and equity markets expect more. You are not here to preserve Mr. Foley’s dignity or his pride. Your role, as directors, is not to protect him from embarrassment or to shield him from blame.”</p>
<p>The situation that Peloton finds iteself in is not entirely unique. Other companies that enjoyed huge pandemic-era gains have seen their values fall back to prior levels. Zoom, the video chat service that became ubiquitous during COVID, has given back nearly all of its recent gains. By late March of 2020, Zoom was worth as much as $150 per share, up from the high $60s per share at the start of the year. It rose to around $560 before falling back to $144 or so as of today.</p>
<p>Not all the news is bad. Peloton bottomed-out at $23.25 per share per <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PTON/">Yahoo Finance</a>, but has since recovered to more than $27 (at the time of writing). That the company intends to cut costs is welcome news from a financial perspective. And its huge hardware bonanza of the last few years has certainly led to more bikes in the market. Perhaps those new users will hold onto their subscriptions, continuing to pump high-margin software revenues into the company&#8217;s accounts as it looks to trim headcount and other expenses.</p>
<p>But cutting to profitability is not where Peloton likely anticipated to find itself just a few quarters ago.</p>
<p>The company is worth just under $9 billion today. A price at which it is far more acquirable than it was a year ago. The number of companies that could afford to buy Peloton at a single-digit billions price tag is modest; the number of firms that could afford to pay dozens of billions for Peloton was vanishingly slim.</p>
<p>Who is on the list? Apple, perhaps, though today Peloton is an Android hardware shop. Google then? Probably not. Microsoft is out, Amazon won&#8217;t do it, and our list is getting thin. It&#8217;s not a metaverse company, so Meta is a no, and what gym group has the cash to make a buy of Peloton&#8217;s scale? Private equity might be able to juice the company for upside if costs can come down enough, but that feels like a stretch.</p>
<p>Sitting where we are today, it doesn&#8217;t seem like a sale is imminent, given the value retained by Peloton even after its sharp selloff. That means that the company likely has to tune its own engine. Keeping its CEO during that process could prove impossible if investors continue to demand restitution in the form of executive blood.</p>
