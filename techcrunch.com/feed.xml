										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> rise in the West is unprecedented for any Chinese tech company, and so is the amount of attention it has attracted from politicians worldwide. Below is a timeline of how TikTok grew from what some considered another &#8220;copycat&#8221; short video app to global dominance and eventually became a target of the U.S. government.</p>
<h1>2012-2017: The emergence of TikTok</h1>
<p><em>These years were a period of fast growth for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bytedance">ByteDance, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the Beijing-based parent company behind TikTok. Originally launched in China as Douyin, the video-sharing app quickly was wildly successful in its domestic market before setting its sights on the rest of the world. </em></p>
<h1><strong>2012 </strong></h1>
<p>Zhang Yiming, a 29-year-old serial engineer, establishes ByteDance in Beijing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h1><strong>2014</strong></h1>
<p>Chinese product designer Alex Zhu launches Musical.ly.</p>
<h1><strong>2016</strong></h1>
<p>ByteDance launches Douyin, which is regarded by many as a Musical.ly clone. It launches Douyin&#8217;s overseas version TikTok later that year.</p>
<h1>2017-2019: TikTok takes off in the United States</h1>
<p><em>TikTok merges with Musical.ly and and launches in the U.S., where it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/its-time-to-pay-serious-attention-to-tiktok/">quickly becomes popular</a>, the first social media app from a Chinese tech company to achieve that level of success there. But at the same time, its ownership leads to questions about national security and censorship, against the backdrop of the U.S.-China tariff wars and increased scrutiny of Chinese tech companies (including Huawei and ZTE) under the Trump administration.</em></p>

<p><em>After weeks of speculation, Trump signs an executive order in August against ByteDance. ByteDance begins seeking American buyers for TikTok, but the company also fights the executive order in court. A group of TikTok creators also file a lawsuit challenging the order. The last few months of 2020 become a relentless, and often confusing, flurry of events and new developments for TikTok observers, with no end in sight. </em></p>
<h2><strong>August</strong></h2>
<p>Reports say ByteDance agrees to divest TikTok&#8217;s U.S. operations and Microsoft will take over. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/01/bytedance-and-microsoft-offer-a-deal-to-allow-tiktok-to-remain-in-the-u-s-per-report/">link</a>)</p>

<p><strong>August 7</strong>: In the most significant escalation of tensions between the U.S. government and TikTok, Trump signs an executive order banning &#8220;transactions&#8221; with ByteDance in 45 days, or on September 20. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/)">link</a>). TikTok says the order was &#8220;issued without any due process&#8221; and would risk &#8220;undermining global businesses’ trust in the United States’ commitment to the rule of law.&#8221; (<a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-responds">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>August 9</strong>: TikTok reportedly plans to challenge the Trump administration ban. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/09/tiktok-is-reportedly-planning-to-challenge-the-trump-administration-ban/)">link</a>)</p>
<p>Oracle is also reportedly bidding for the TikTok sale. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/just-what-would-an-enterprise-company-like-microsoft-or-oracle-do-with-tiktok/">link</a>)</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>August 24:</strong> TikTok and ByteDance file their first lawsuit in federal court against the executive order, naming President Trump, Secretary of State Wilbur Ross and the U.S. Department of Commerce as defendants. The suit seeks to prevent the government from banning TikTok. Filed in U.S. District Court Central District of California (case number 2:20-cv-7672), it claims Trump’s executive order is unconstitutional. </span> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-sues-the-u-s-government-over-its-forthcoming-ban/)">link</a>)</p>

<p><strong>August 28:</strong> China&#8217;s revised export laws could block TikTok&#8217;s divestment. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/china-export-rules-complicate-tiktok-sale/">link</a>)</p>
<h2><strong>September</strong></h2>
<p>China says it would rather see TikTok shuttered than sold to an American firm. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/china-may-kill-tiktoks-u-s-operations-rather-than-see-them-sold/">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>September 13</strong>: Oracle confirms it is part of a proposal submitted by ByteDance to the Treasury Department in which Oracle will serve as the &#8220;trusted technology provider.&#8221; (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/oracle-wins-bid-to-buy-tiktok/">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>September 18</strong>: The Commerce Department <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/09/commerce-department-prohibits-wechat-and-tiktok-transactions-protect">publishes regulations</a> against TikTok that will take effect in two phases. The app will no longer be distributed in U.S. app stores as of September 20, but it gets an extension on how it operates until November 12. After that, however, it will no longer be able to use internet hosting services in the U.S., rendering it inaccessible.  (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday/">link</a>)</p>
<p><em>On the same day as the Commerce Department&#8217;s announcement, two separate lawsuits are filed against Trump&#8217;s executive order against TikTok. One is filed by ByteDance, while the other is by three TikTok creators.</em></p>
<p>The one <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04518061204">filed by TikTok and ByteDance</a> is in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (case number 20-cv-02658), naming President Trump, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and the Commerce Department as defendants. It is very similar to the suit ByteDance previously filed in California. TikTok and ByteDance&#8217;s lawyers argue that Trump&#8217;s executive order violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the right to free speech, and due process and takings clauses.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other lawsuit, filed by TikTok creators Douglas Marland, Cosette Rinab and Alec Chambers, also names the president, Ross and the Department of Commerce as defendants. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (case number </span><span class="s2">2:20-cv-04597), argues that Trump’s executive order &#8220;violates the first and fifth amendments of the U.S. Constitution and exceeds the President’s statutory authority.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>September 19:</strong> One day before the September 20 deadline that would have forced Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their app stores, the Commerce Department <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/09/statement-delayed-prohibitions-related-tiktok">extends it by a week to September 27</a>. This is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-commerce-idUSKCN26A11J">reportedly</a> to give ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart time to finalize their deal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the same day, Marland, Rinab and Chambers, the three TikTok creators, <a href="https://ecf.paed.uscourts.gov/doc1/153119035733">file</a> their first motion for a preliminary injunction against Trump’s executive order. They argue that the executive order violates freedom of speech and deprives them of “protected liberty and property interests without due process,” because if a ban goes into effect, it would prevent them from making income from TikTok-related activities, like promotional and branding work.</span></p>
<p><strong>September 20</strong>: After filing the D.C. District Court lawsuit against Trump&#8217;s executive order, TikTok and ByteDance formally withdraw their similar pending suit in the U.S. District Court of Central District of California.</p>
<p><strong>September 21</strong>: ByteDance and Oracle confirm the deal but send conflicting statements over TikTok&#8217;s new ownership. TikTok is valued at an estimated $60 billion. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/tiktok-wtf/">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>September 22</strong>: China&#8217;s state newspaper says China won&#8217;t approve the TikTok sale, labeling it &#8220;extortion.&#8221; (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/china-says-it-wont-greenlight-tiktok-deal/">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>September 23: </strong>TikTok and ByteDance <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04518069190">ask</a> the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to grant a preliminary injunction against the executive order, arguing that the September 27 ban removing TikTok from app stores will &#8220;inflict direct, immediate, and irreparable harm on Plaintiffs during the pendency of this case.&#8221; (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/tiktok-files-for-injunction-against-pending-trump-app-ban/">link</a>)</p>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>September 26:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/27/21458242/judge-rejects-tiktok-creators-request-ban-says-they-wont-suffer-irreparable-harm">denies Marland, Rinab and Chambers’ motion</a> for a preliminary injunction against the executive order, writing that the three did not demonstrate &#8220;they will suffer immediate, irreparable harm if users and prospective users cannot download or update&#8221; TikTok after September 27, since they will still be able to use the app.</span></p>
<p><strong>September 27</strong>: Just hours before the TikTok ban was set to go into effect, U.S. District Court Judge Carl J. Nichols <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04518076799">grants ByteDance&#8217;s request for a preliminary injunction </a>while the court considers whether the app poses a risk to national security.

<h2>November</h2>
<p><strong>November 7:</strong> After five days of waiting for vote counts, Joe Biden is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/media-calls-joe-biden-winner-bee69f9d1d32e84d68e6164ea956e67a">declared the president-elect by CNN</a>, followed by the AP, NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox News. With Biden set to be sworn in as president on January 20, the future of Trump&#8217;s executive order against TikTok becomes even more uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>November 10:</strong> ByteDance asks the federal appeal court to vacate the U.S. government&#8217;s divestiture order that would force it to sell the app&#8217;s American operations by November 12. Filed as part of the lawsuit in D.C. District Court, ByteDance said it asked the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States for an extension, but hadn&#8217;t been granted one yet.

<p><strong>November 12: </strong>This is the day that the Commerce Department&#8217;s ban on transactions with ByteDance, including providing internet hosting services to TikTok (which would stop the app from being able to operate in the U.S.), was set to go into effect. But instead the case becomes more convoluted as the U.S. government sends mixed messages about TikTok&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-25360.pdf">says it will abide</a> by the preliminary injunction granted on October 30 by Judge Beetlestone, pending further legal developments. But, around the same time, the Justice Department files an appeal against Beetlestone&#8217;s ruling. Then Judge Nichols sets new deadlines (December 14 and 28) in the D.C. District Court lawsuit (the one filed by ByteDance against the Trump administration) for both sides to file motions and other new documents in the case.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Hi, I’m Rivers from the band, Weezer,” Rivers Cuomo says with a slight smile and a wave. He turns away from the camera for a bit, before launching into his best infomercial pitch. “Imagine you’re on tour, and you’re sitting in your dressing room or your tour bus. You’re backstage. You have stage fright, you’re stressing out. You’re pacing back and forth. And then on top of that, your tour manager is constantly calling you, asking you logistical questions.”</p>
<p>As far as internet pitch videos go, it’s not the most universal. If anything, the three-minute clip loses any hope of populist appeal by the end. In a final shot, the singer in a maroon SpaceX hoodie is the last up the ramp onto a private jet. The plane door closes revealing a Weezer flying “W” logo.</p>
<p>“Download Drivetimes now, on GitHub,” Cuomo adds in voice-over. “This is CS50X.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s not the most polished app pitch video, and Cuomo’s elevator pitch could probably do with a bit of refining before approaching venture capitalists about a seed round. As far as final projects for online programming courses go, however, it’s something to behold. The images alternate between pages of code, Google spreadsheets and POV shots as he takes the stage for a co-headlining tour with the Pixies.</p>
<p>It helped earn Cuomo a 95 in the class.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Kf4-zMNqq8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>But while, in its current configuration, the Drivetime tour scheduling tool might have limited appeal, the musician’s final project from Harvard’s follow-up course, CS50W, is immediately apparent for an army of fans who have followed his quarter-century-plus career. This week Cuomo <a href="https://www.riverscuomo.com/demos">dropped more than 2,400 demos</a> totaling more than 86 hours. Spanning 1976 to 2015, the songs range in quality from tape-recorded sketches to more polished fare. Some would eventually find their way onto Weezer’s 13 albums, or assorted side projects. Others wouldn’t be so lucky.</p>
<p>Available through Cuomo’s “Mr. Rivers’ Neighborhood” site, the tracks are gathered into nine bundles, each available for $9 a piece. “By the way,” Cuomo writers at the bottom of a disclaimer, “this market is my final project for a course I&#8217;m taking in web programming.”</p>
<p>For half-a-decade, the platinum-selling rock star has been moonlighting as a computer programming student.</p>
<p>“I was always a spreadsheet guy,” Cuomo tells TechCrunch. “Around 2000, I think I started in Microsoft Access and then Excel. Just keeping track of all my songs and demos and ideas. Spreadsheets got more and more complicated to the point where it was like, ‘Well, I&#8217;m kind of almost writing code here in these formulas, except it&#8217;s super hard to use. So maybe I should actually do programming instead.’ ”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/okthJIVbi6g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It would be an odd side hustle for practically any other successful musician. For Cuomo, however, it’s the next logical step. In the wake of the massive success of Weezer’s self-titled debut, he enrolled as a sophomore at Harvard, spending a year living in a dorm. He would ultimately leave school to record the band’s much-loved follow-up, <em>Pinkerton</em>, but two more more enrollments in 1997 and 2004 found the musician ultimately graduating with an English BA in 2006.</p>
<p>CS50 found Cuomo returning to Harvard — at least in spirit. The course is hosted online by the university, a free introduction to computer science.</p>
<p>“I went through some online courses and was looking for something that looked appealing and so I saw the Harvard CS50 was very popular,” Cuomo says. “So I was like, ‘Well, I&#8217;ll give this a shot.’ It didn&#8217;t take immediately. The first week course was using Scratch. I don&#8217;t know if you know that, but it&#8217;s like kind of click and drag type of programming, and you&#8217;re making a little video game.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_Wu6lI-42w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>A six-week course stretched out for six months for the musician. That same year, the musician — now a father of two — played dozens of shows and recorded Weezer’s 10th album, the Grammy-nominated <em>White Album</em>.</p>
<p>“When we hit <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/python" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="python">Python <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> halfway through the course,” Cuomo says, “I was just amazed at how powerful it was and intuitive it was for me, and I could just get so much done. Then by the end of the course, I was writing programs that were really helping me manage my day-to-day life as a traveling musician and then also managing my spreadsheets and managing my work as a creative artist.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/UV5F3vcQyrY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>For Cuomo, productivity has never been much of an issue. The band has two albums completed beyond this year’s <em>Black Album</em>, and he’s already begun work on two more follow-ups. What has seemingly been a bigger issue, however, is organizing those thoughts. That’s where the spreadsheets and database come in.</p>
<p>The “thousands” of spreadsheets became a database, cataloging Cuomo’s own demos and work he was studying from other artists.</p>
<p>“For years it seemed like kind of a waste of time or an indulgence,” he says. “I should be writing a new song or, or recording a song rather than just cataloging these old ideas, but I&#8217;ve found that, years later, I&#8217;m able to very efficiently make use of these ancient ideas because I can just tell my Python program, ‘Hey, show me all the ideas I have at 126 BPM in the key of A flat that start with a third degree of the scale and the melody and are in Dorian mode and that my manager has given three stars or more to.’ ”</p>
<p>He admits that the process may be lacking in some of the rock and roll romanticism for which fans of the bands might hope. But in spite of drawing on pages of analytics, Cuomo insists there’s still magic present.</p>
<p>For Cuomo, productivity has never been much of an issue. Given his level of productivity, however, organizing all of those thoughts can get tricky. That’s where the spreadsheets and database come in.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/THb3ncBWMms?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>“There&#8217;s still plenty of room for spontaneity and inspiration in what we traditionally think of as human creativity,” Cuomo explains. “One of my heroes in this realm is Igor Stravinsky. There’s a collection of his lectures called &#8220;The Poetics of Music.&#8221; And he had a note in that collection. He said he has no interest in a composer that&#8217;s only using one of his faculties, like a composer that says, ‘I am only going to write what pops into my head spontaneously when I&#8217;m in some kind of a creative zone. I won&#8217;t use any of my other tools.’</p>
<p>“He says, ‘No, I prefer to listen to the music of a composer who&#8217;s using every faculty at his disposal, his intuition, but also his intellect and his ability to analyze and categorize and make use of everything he has.’ I find that those ended up being the most wild and unpredictable and creative compositions.”</p>
<p>And there’s been no shortage of compositions. Cuomo says the band has two albums completed beyond this year’s<em> Black Album</em>, and he’s already begun work on two more follow-ups. After decades of feeling beholden to the 18-month major label album release cycle, the singer says that after the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/demos-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="demos-3">Demos <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> project, he has a newfound interest in finding more ways to release music directly to fans.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m really good at understanding the big-picture marketplace and how to make the biggest impact in the world,” he says. “My manager is so good at that, but I just told them like, ‘Hey, this feels like something here. First of all, it&#8217;s really fun. The fans are really happy. It&#8217;s super easy for everyone involved.’ The coding part wasn&#8217;t easy, but for everyone else, it&#8217;s a couple of clicks and you&#8217;ve got all this music, and it&#8217;s a cheap price, and there&#8217;s no middleman. PayPal takes a little bit, but it&#8217;s nothing like a major label. So, this could be something. And there&#8217;s just something, it feels so good when it&#8217;s directly from me to the audience.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOIsYA1QDuk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>For now, computer science continues to take up a major chunk of his time. Cuomo estimates that he’s been spending around 70% of his work hours on programming projects. On Wednesday nights, he helps out with programming for a meditation site (another decades-long passion), and he plans to take Harvard’s follow-up CS50M course, which centers around developing for mobile apps.</p>
<p>There are, however, no immediate plans to quit his day job.</p>
<p>“I can&#8217;t see me getting a job at a startup or something or maintaining somebody&#8217;s website,” he says. “But maybe the line between rock star and web developer is getting blurred so that musicians will be making more and more use of technological tools. Besides just the music software, we’ll be making more and more use of means of distribution and organization and creativity that&#8217;s coming out in the way we code our connection to the audience.”</p>

<p>Even in a normal year, the holidays can be an anxiety-inducing hellscape. In 2020, though — honestly, it’s hard to say what manner of climactic finale this historically rough year might have on tap. In honor of one of the most epically rotten years on record, we’ve cobbled together a list of gifts that could go a ways toward helping folks make it triumphantly across the finish line.</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a mixed bag, I admit. Everyone blows off stress differently — some like to play video games, come cook, some go for a run, others meditate. This is an attempt to round up some gadgets and software that can help increase sleep, reduce blood pressure and generally help survive what’s left of 2020 intact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>Muse S</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1928241 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Muse-S-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Muse-S-1.jpg 3211w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Muse-S-1.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Muse-S-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Muse-S-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Muse-S-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Muse-S-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Muse-S-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Muse-S-1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>I was using Muse’s latest headband quite a bit during CES, back when that show still felt like it was going to be the apex of stress for my year. The device offers a clever kind of gamified approach to meditation — something I, as one of the worst meditators of all-time, have come to appreciate. I recognize that words like “gamify” sound counterproductive when it comes something like meditating, but Muse does a surprisingly good job getting you into the right headspace.</p>

<p>The company also recently added sleep tracking to the wearable. I will say that the Muse S is reasonably comfortable as far as tech headbands go (an admittedly low bar), but even so, sleeping with one on still takes some getting used to.</p>

<p>We can recommend a number of all-purpose, noise-cancelling headphones for help relaxing. The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bose" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bose">Bose <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sleepbuds II aren’t that. These little Bluetooth buds are built for one purpose only: sleep. They’re comfortable, they get good battery life and they’ll stay in place while you sleep. They’re built for noisy environments — whether you’re trying to sneak in a midday nap or sleep next to a snorer.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HgLCVIckhV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/bose-introduces-a-new-pair-of-sleep-focused-earbuds/">Bose introduces a new pair of sleep-focused earbuds</a></p></blockquote>

<p>They’re a bit pricy and not very versatile, only designed to play back Bose’s preloaded sleep sounds. But if someone in your life is having trouble falling — or staying — asleep, they’re a solid investment.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FRR6Z1N/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08FRR6Z1N&amp;linkId=887042489e568ce6f136bef8635538cd">$250 from Amazon</a></p>

<p>There’s no shortage of meditation apps these days, but Calm has been my go-to for a long time. The app has been tremendously successful over the past couple of years, even landing a star-studded show on HBO Max. With more than 90 million downloads, Calm offers some of the most extensive and best guided meditation courses and tracks to help lull listeners to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.calm.com/">$13/month from Calm</a></p>
<h2>Withings Sleep</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2077500" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077500" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077500" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Withings-Sleep-Trackers.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="638" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Withings-Sleep-Trackers.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Withings-Sleep-Trackers.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Withings-Sleep-Trackers.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Withings-Sleep-Trackers.jpg?resize=768,479 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Withings-Sleep-Trackers.jpg?resize=680,424 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Withings-Sleep-Trackers.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077500" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Withings</p></div></p>
<p>I really dug this thing before my rabbit chewed the cord and rendered the thing effectively useless. I’m going to go out on a limb and assume that’s not an issue most users are going to run into. Withings Sleep is, effectively, a pad that sits under the mattress to detect your sleep progress during the night. Those results are then collected and displayed in Withings&#8217; Health app. I’ve tested a lot of wearable sleep trackers over the year, but if you’re really invested in sleep tracking, this is a good way to go. Among other things, you don’t have to wear a band to sleep.</p>
<p>Withings Sleep goes deep with its tracking, including cycles heart rate tracking and even snore detection. It’s also one of the first of this class of consumer device to offer sleep apnea detection.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Z1B34S/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B078Z1B34S&amp;linkId=d1c64e536490aa2492d9cb129c9ff877">$74 from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Dreamlight Zen</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2077502" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077502" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077502" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/index.jpeg" alt="" width="730" height="410" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/index.jpeg 730w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/index.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/index.jpeg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/index.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/index.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077502" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dreamlight</p></div></p>
<p>Back when we used to do travel gift guides, I included one of Dreamlight’s masks for long flights. Even though we’re all grounded, though, I’ve actually got a fair amount of use out of the thing, dealing with some health struggles this year. Dreamlight Zen is a step up from that model, featuring built-in sleep and meditation aids that can run up to 10 hours on a charge.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://dreamlight.tech/products/dreamlight-zen">$200 from Dreamlight</a></p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jason-green-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jason-green-3">Jason Green <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has a pretty solid reputation as venture capitalists go. The enterprise-focused firm he co-founded 17 years ago, <a href="https://www.emcap.com/">Emergence Capital</a>, has backed Saleforce, Box and Zoom, among many other companies, and even while every firm is now investing in software-as-a-service startups, his remains a go-to for many top founders selling business products and services.</p>
<p>To learn more about the trends impacting Green&#8217;s slice of the investing universe, we <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/zoom-investor-jason-green-on-whats-next/id1498270180?i=1000499674063">talked</a> with him late last week about everything from SPACs to valuations to how the firm differentiates itself from the many rivals with which it&#8217;s now competing. Below are some outtakes edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you make of the <a href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1328770446993534978">assessment</a> that SPACs are for companies that aren&#8217;t generating enough revenue to go public the traditional route?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>JG: Well, yeah, it&#8217;ll be really interesting. This has been quite a year for SPACs, right? I can&#8217;t remember the number, but it&#8217;s been something like $50 billion of capital raised this year in SPACs, and all of those have to put that money to work within the next 12 to 18 months or they give it back. So there&#8217;s this incredible pent-up demand to find opportunities for those SPACs to convert into companies. And the companies that are at the top of the charts, the ones that are the high-growth and profitable companies, will probably do a traditional IPO, I would imagine.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A8AIZTgGb3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/">Almost everything you need to know about SPACs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Almost everything you need to know about SPACs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/embed/#?secret=A8AIZTgGb3" data-secret="A8AIZTgGb3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>[SPAC candidates are] going to be companies that are growing fast enough to be attractive as a potential public company but not top of the charts. I think [sponsors are] going to target companies that are probably either growing slightly slower than the top-quartile public companies but slightly profitable, or companies that are growing faster but still burning a lot of cash and might actually scare all the traditional IPO investors.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you having conversations with CEOs about whether or not they should pursue this avenue?</strong></p>
<p>JG: We just started having those conversations now. There are several companies in the portfolio that will probably be public companies in the next year or two, so it&#8217;s definitely an alternative to consider. I would say there&#8217;s nothing impending I see in the portfolio. With most entrepreneurs, there&#8217;s a little bit of this dream of going public the traditional way, where SPACs tend to be a little bit less exciting from that perspective. So for a company that maybe is thinking about another private round before going public, it&#8217;s like a private-plus round. I would say it&#8217;s a tweener, so the companies that are considering it are probably ones that are not quite ready to go public yet.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of the SPAC fundraising has seemed like a reaction to uncertainty around when the public window might close. With the election behind us, do you think there&#8217;s less uncertainty?</strong></p>
<p>JG: I don&#8217;t think risk and uncertainty has decreased since the election. There&#8217;s still uncertainty right now politically. The pandemic has reemerged in a significant way, even though we have some really good announcements recently regarding vaccines or potential vaccines. So there&#8217;s just a lot of potential directions things could head in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an environment generally where the public markets tend to gravitate more toward higher-quality opportunities, so fewer companies but higher quality,  and that&#8217;s where SPACs could play a role. In the first half of next year, I could easily see SPACs being the more likely go-to-market for a public company, then the latter half of next year, once the vaccines have kicked in and people feel like we&#8217;re returning to somewhat normal, I could see the traditional IPO coming back.</p>
<p><strong>TC: When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/top-vcs-on-the-changing-landscape-for-enterprise-startups/">sat down</a> in person about a year ago, you said Emergence looks at maybe 1,000 deals a year, does deep due diligence on 25 and funds just a handful or so of these startups every year. How has that changed in 2020?</strong></p>
<p>JG: I would say that over the last five years, we&#8217;ve made almost a total transition. Now we&#8217;re very much a data-driven, thesis-driven outbound firm, where we&#8217;re reaching out to entrepreneurs soon after they&#8217;ve started their companies or gotten seed financing. The last three investments that we made were all relationships that [date back] a year to 18 months before we started engaging in the actual financing process with them. I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s required to build a relationship and the conviction, because financings are happening so fast.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re going to actually do more investments this year than we maybe have ever done in the history of the firm, which is amazing to me [considering] COVID. I think we&#8217;ve really honed our ability to build this pipeline and have conviction, and then in this market environment, Zoom is actually helping expand the landscape that we&#8217;re willing to invest in. We&#8217;re probably seeing 50% to 100% more companies and trying to whittle them down over time and really focus on the 20 to 25 that we want to dig deep on as a team.</p>
<p><strong>TC: For founders trying to understand your thinking, what&#8217;s interesting to you right now?</strong></p>
<p>JG: We tend to focus on three major themes at any one time as a firm, and one we&#8217;ve termed &#8216;coaching networks.&#8217; This is this intersection between AI and machine learning and human interaction. Companies like [the sales engagement platform] <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> or [the knowledge management system] <a href="https://www.getguru.com/">Guru</a> or Drishti [which sells video analytics for manual factory assembly lines] fall into this category.</p>
<p>The second [theme] is going deep into more specific industry verticals. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-16/veeva-ipo-generates-300-fold-return-for-emergence-capital-1-">Veeva</a> was the best example of this early on with with healthcare and life sciences, but we now have one called <a href="https://www.project44.com/">p44</a> in the transportation space that&#8217;s doing incredibly well. <a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a> is in the healthcare space and going deep like a LinkedIn for physicians, with some remote health capabilities. And then [lending company] <a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a>, which is in the financial services area. These companies are taking cloud software and just going deep into the most important problems of their industries.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zoom&#8217;s earliest investors are betting millions on a better Zoom for schools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/embed/#?secret=6iCFvC03nQ" data-secret="6iCFvC03nQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The third theme [centers around] remote work. Zoom, which has obviously has been [among our] best investments is almost a platform, just like Salesforce became a platform after many years. We just funded a company called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/">ClassEDU</a>, which is a Zoom-specific offering for the education market. Snowflake is becoming a platform. So another opportunity is is not just trying to come up with another collaboration tool, but really going deep into a specific use case or vertical.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s a company you&#8217;ve missed in recent years and were any lessons learned?</strong></p>
<p>JG: We have our hall of shame. [Laughs.] I do think it&#8217;s dangerous to assume that things would have turned out the same if if we had been investors in the company. I believe the kinds of investors you put around the table make a difference in terms of the outcome of your company, so I try to not beat myself up too much on the missed opportunities because maybe they found a better fit or a better investor for them to be successful.</p>
<p>But Rob Bernshteyn of <a href="https://www.coupa.com/">Coupa</a> is one where I knew Rob from SuccessFactors [where he was a product marketing VP], and I just always respected and liked him. And we were always chasing it on valuation. And I think I think we probably turned it down at an $80 million or $100 million valuation [and it&#8217;s valued at] $20 billion today. That can keep you up at night.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the moment, there are some risks and concerns about the business and there are other people who are willing to be more aggressive and so you lose out on some of those opportunities. The beautiful thing about our business is that it&#8217;s not a zero-sum game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D-rendered faces are a big part of any major movie or game now, but the task of capturing and animating them in a natural way can be a tough one. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/disney-research" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="disney-research">Disney Research <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is working on ways to smooth out this process, among them a machine learning tool that makes it <a href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/2020/11/25/semantic-deep-face-models/">much easier to generate and manipulate 3D faces</a> without dipping into the uncanny valley.</p>
<p>Of course this technology has come a long way from the wooden expressions and limited details of earlier days. High-resolution, convincing 3D faces can be animated quickly and well, but the subtleties of human expression are not just limitless in variety, they&#8217;re very easy to get wrong.</p>
<p>Think of how someone&#8217;s entire face changes when they smile — it&#8217;s different for everyone, but there are enough similarities that we fancy we can tell when someone is &#8220;really&#8221; smiling or just faking it. How can you achieve that level of detail in an artificial face?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Existing &#8220;linear&#8221; models simplify the subtlety of expression, making &#8220;happiness&#8221; or &#8220;anger&#8221; minutely adjustable, but at the cost of accuracy — they can&#8217;t express every possible face, but can easily result in impossible faces. Newer neural models learn complexity from watching the interconnectedness of expressions, but like other such models their workings are obscure and difficult to control, and perhaps not generalizable beyond the faces they learned from. They don&#8217;t enable the level of control an artist working on a movie or game needs, or result in faces that (humans are remarkably good at detecting this) are just <em>off</em> somehow.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/awnqYKNJamU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>A team at Disney Research proposes a new model with the best of both worlds — what it calls a &#8220;semantic deep face model.&#8221; Without getting into the exact technical execution, the basic improvement is that it&#8217;s a neural model that learns how a facial expression affects the whole face, but is not specific to a single face — and moreover is nonlinear, allowing flexibility in how expressions interact with a face&#8217;s geometry and each other.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: A linear model lets you take an expression (a smile, or kiss, say) from 0-100 on any 3D face, but the results may be unrealistic. A neural model lets you take a learned expression from 0-100 realistically, but only on the face it learned it from. <em>This</em> model can take an expression from 0-100 smoothly on any 3D face. That&#8217;s something of an over-simplification, but you get the idea.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2078806" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/disney-faces-deep.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2078806" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2078806" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/disney-faces-deep.gif" alt="Computer generated faces all assume similar expressions in a row." width="800" height="484" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2078806" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney Research</p></div></p>
<p>The results are powerful: You could generate a thousand faces with different shapes and tones, and then animate all of them with the same expressions without any extra work. Think how that could result in diverse CG crowds you can summon with a couple clicks, or characters in games that have realistic facial expressions regardless of whether they were hand-crafted or not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a silver bullet, and it&#8217;s only part of a huge set of improvements artists and engineers are making in the various industries where this technology is employed — markerless face tracking, better skin deformation, realistic eye movements and dozens more areas of interest are also important parts of this process.</p>

<p>Smart thermostats are fairly ubiquitous these days, but depending on which one you’re using, you could be getting a lot more from your home heating and cooling with relatively simple DIY upgrades. The <a href="https://flair.co">Flair Smart Vent</a> system is one such upgrade, and though it costs a bit upfront to get going (each register is $79 to start, depending on size — and you&#8217;ll need at least one control puck to act as a hub, which adds around $100 to the cost of entry) you won’t have to call an HVAC contractor or break down any walls to take advantage of what it offers.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Around $200 for a starter kit that includes one register and one puck, <a href="https://flair.co/pages/catalog#">direct from Flair</a></p>

<p>Many smart home gadgets focus on convenience or automation of typically manual tasks, but <a href="https://flumewater.com">Flume’s</a> smart water sensor provides a potentially much more vital service: the ability to track how much water you’re consuming and alert you to potential leaks in your home’s plumbing.

<p>Think of the <a href="https://sensibo.com">Sensibo</a> as a smart thermostat for those who do not have a central/heating cooling unit. If a person has a window air conditioner, portable room heater or modern heat pump &#8212; any device that has a remote control &#8212; the Senisbo will control the temperature. The latest version retails for $149 (it&#8217;s often on sale) and works great. If you have multiple heating and cooling devices, get a couple of these devices to have complete control.</p>
<p>The company launched in TechCrunch&#8217;s Hardware Battlefield competition in 2015 and has since evolved the product into a powerful platform that can automate a person&#8217;s heating and cooling needs.</p>

<p><a href="https://us-shop.nanoleaf.me">Nanoleaf</a> products work like interactive, programmable art displays&#8230; and, for bonus points, they look like something out of a sci-fi movie. Once you&#8217;ve snapped the modular panels together, you can tie them into HomeKit, Alexa, Google Home, or if you&#8217;re feeling fancy, use services like IFTTT to programmatically recolor the lights based on the weather outside, or flash whenever you&#8217;ve got an incoming message. The kits with everything you&#8217;d need to get started (the controller, power plug, and a handful of panels) start at around $150-200, while expansion packs with more panels go for around $60-70 — so it&#8217;s not a cheap hobby, but you can start with just a few panels and build up over time if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robots are no longer the high-tech tools reserved for university labs, e-commerce giants and buzzy Silicon Valley startups. The local grocer now has access too.</span></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tortoise-dev" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tortoise-dev">Tortoise, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the one-year-old Silicon Valley startup known for its remote repositioning electric scooters, has taken its tech and adapted it to delivery carts. The company recently partnered with online grocery platform Self Point to provide neighborhood stores and specialty brand shops with electric carts that — with help from remote teleoperators — deliver goods to local consumers.</p>
<p>The companies have launched the product offering in Los Angeles with three customers. Each customer, which includes Kosher Express, has two to three carts that can be used to make deliveries up to a three-mile radius from the store. Unlike the network models used by some autonomous sidewalk delivery companies, grocery stores lease the delivery carts and are responsible for storage, charging and packing it up with goods that their customers have ordered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The initial Self Point/Tortoise launch is small. But it has the makings of expanding far beyond Los Angeles. More importantly for Tortoise, it&#8217;s a validation of the company&#8217;s larger vision to make remote repositioning a horizontal business with numerous applications.</p>
<p>Tortoise started by equipping electric scooters with cameras, electronics and firmware that allow teleoperators in distant locales to drive the micromobility devices to a rider or deliver it back to its proper parking spot. Now, it has taken that same hardware and software and used it to build its own delivery cart.</p>
<p>Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko has said the company&#8217;s remote repositioning kit can be used for security and cleaning bots as well as electric wheelchairs and other accessibility devices. He&#8217;s even fielded inquiries from farmers interested in using remote repositioning scooters to monitor crops.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a practical point of view we&#8217;re not trying to not be everywhere overnight, but there&#8217;s really no technological constraint for us,&#8221; Shevelenko said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The emergence of COVID-19 and its effects on consumer behavior prompted Tortoise to home in on delivery carts as its second act.</p>
<p>&#8220;We kind of quickly realized that we&#8217;re living in a once-in-a-generation change in consumer behavior where now everything is online and people are expecting it to be delivered same day,&#8221; Shevelenko said. Tortoise was able to go from the first renderings in May to a delivery cart launch by the fourth quarter because of its ability to repurpose its hardware, software and workforce.</p>
<p>The company still remains bullish on its initial application in micromobility. Earlier this year, Tortoise, GoX and and tech incubator Curiosity Labs launched a six-month pilot in Peachtree Corners, Georgia that allows riders to use an app to hail a scooter. The scooters are outfitted with Tortoise&#8217;s tech. Once riders hail the scooter, a Tortoise employee hundreds of miles away remote controls the scooter to the user. After riders complete trips, the scooters drive themselves back to a safe parking spot. From there, GoX employees charge and sanitize the scooters and then mark them with a sticker that indicates they have been properly cleaned.</p>
<p>While partnership with Self Point is Tortoise&#8217;s next big project, Shevelenko was quick to note that the company is only focused on one slice of the on-demand delivery pie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low speeds and hot foods don&#8217;t work too well,&#8221; he said. Startups such as Kiwibot and Starship have smaller robots that focus on that market, Shevelenko added. Tortoise&#8217;s delivery carts were designed specifically to hold large amounts of groceries, alcohol and other goods.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw kind of a big opening in grocery,&#8221; he said, adding that relying on remote operators and its kit is a low-cost combination that can be used today while automated technology continues to develop. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing for last-mile delivery what globalized call centers did for customer support.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">France is going forward with its plan to tax big tech companies. The government has sent out notices to tech giants, as reported by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2cfe3d07-7e69-4f57-b634-8b6002f967cb">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-usa-tax/france-orders-tech-giants-to-pay-digital-tax-idUKKBN28522M">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/internet/reseaux-sociaux/facebook/malgre-les-menaces-de-sanctions-de-washington-la-taxe-gafa-sera-bien-prelevee-en-2020-confirme-paris_4195055.html">AFP</a>. There could be retaliation tariffs on French goods in the U.S.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, France’s Economy Minister <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bruno-le-maire" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bruno-le-maire">Bruno Le Maire <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been pushing hard for a tax reform. Many economy ministers in Europe think tech companies aren’t taxed properly. They generate revenue in one country, but report to tax authorities in another country. They take advantage of countries with low corporate tax to optimize the bottom line.</p>
<p>Le Maire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/05/european-union-plans-to-tax-tech-giants-on-local-revenue/">first pitched</a> the idea of a European tax on big tech companies based on local revenue. But he failed to get support from other European countries — European tax policies require a unanimous decision from members of the European Union.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The French government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/france-doesnt-want-to-wait-for-european-tax-reform-to-tax-tech-giants/">chose not to wait</a> for other European countries and started working on its own local tax. There are two requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>You generate more than €750 million in revenue globally and €25 million in France.</li>
<li><em>And</em> you’re operating a marketplace (Amazon’s marketplace, Uber, Airbnb…) or an advertising business (Facebook, Google, Criteo…).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you meet those two requirements, you have to pay 3% of your French revenue in taxes.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">the OECD</a> has been working on a way to properly tax tech companies with a standardized set of rules that would work across the globe. But OECD members have yet to reach a compromise.</p>
<p>France and the U.S. have been arguing on and off for the past couple of years about the tech tax. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/us-and-france-reach-a-compromise-on-frances-tax-on-tech-giants/">August 2019</a>, then U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron reached a deal by promising that the French government would scrap the French tax as soon as the OECD finds a way to properly tax tech companies in countries where they operate.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/us-could-impose-100-tariffs-on-french-goods-following-frances-tax-on-tech-giants/">December 2019</a>, the U.S. promised 100% tariffs on French wine, cheese and handbags because the previous deal wasn&#8217;t good enough. In <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2cfe3d07-7e69-4f57-b634-8b6002f967cb">January 2020</a>, the two sides agreed to wait a little bit to see if the OECD framework would come through.</p>
<p>And here we are. According to the French government, OECD negotiations have failed, so it’s time to start collecting the French digital tax. Let’s s see how the U.S. reacts during the Trump-Biden transition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> makes a broad shift in strategy, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-25/ibm-planning-about-10-000-job-cuts-in-europe-ahead-of-unit-sale">Bloomberg reported this morning</a> that the company would be cutting around 10,000 jobs in Europe. This comes on the heels of last month&#8217;s announcement that the organization will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">spinning out its infrastructure services business</a> next year. While IBM wouldn&#8217;t confirm the layoffs, a spokesperson suggested there were broad structural changes ahead for the company as it concentrates fully on a hybrid cloud approach.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ibm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ibm">IBM <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had this to say in response to a request for comment on the Bloomberg report: &#8220;Our staffing decisions are made to provide the best support to our customers in adopting an open hybrid cloud platform and AI capabilities. We also continue to make significant investments in training and skills development for IBMers to best meet the needs of our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that means basically if you don&#8217;t have the currently required skill set, chances are you might not fit with the new version of IBM. IBM CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">Arvind Krishna alluded to the changing environment</a> in an interview with Jon Fortt at the CNBC Evolve Summit earlier this month when he said:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The Red Hat acquisition gave us the technology base on which to build a hybrid cloud technology platform based on open-source, and based on giving choice to our clients as they embark on this journey. With the success of that acquisition now giving us the fuel, we can then take the next step, and the larger step, of taking the managed infrastructure services out. So the rest of the company can be absolutely focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence.</p></blockquote>

<p>The story has always been the same around IBM layoffs, that as they make the transition to a new model, it requires eliminating positions that don&#8217;t fit into the new vision, and today&#8217;s report is apparently no different, says Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM is in the biggest transformation of the company&#8217;s history as it moves from services to software and specialized hardware with Quantum. That requires a different mix of skills in its employee base and the repercussions of that manifest itself in the layoffs that IBM has been doing, mostly quietly, for the last 5+ years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>None of this is easy for the people involved. It&#8217;s never a good time to lose your job, but the timing of this one feels worse. In the middle of a recession brought on by COVID, and as a second wave of the virus sweeps over Europe, it&#8217;s particularly difficult.</p>
<p>We have reported on a number of IBM layoffs over the last five years. In May, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/ibm-confirms-layoffs-are-happening-but-wont-provide-details/">confirmed layoffs</a>, but wouldn&#8217;t confirm numbers. In 2015, we reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/26/sources-say-ibm-planning-on-laying-off-12000-over-next-year/">a 12,000 employee layoff</a>.</p>

		Will Butler is a writer, producer and podcast host from California. Legally blind since age of 19, Will has written and produced numerous stories about adjusting to vision loss. Will joined <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/">Be My Eyes</a> as its VP in 2019 after four years at <a href="https://lighthouse-sf.org/">Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired</a> in San Francisco. You can listen to Will’s interviews with leaders from the world of blindness and accessibility on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/the-be-my-eyes-podcast/id1470367534">The Be My Eyes podcast</a> and the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/13-letters/id1498477431">13 Letters podcast</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was pronounced legally blind in 2009, I didn’t know one other person who called themselves blind – least of all “low vision” or “visually impaired.” Today, I manage the largest blindness community in the world, <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/">Be My Eyes</a>, a support platform where more than 4 million people and companies use live video to support users in almost 200 languages. And though the growth of our collective community is a crucial step making our lives better, it’s just one piece of what makes today, as I’ve heard many others say, “a great time to be blind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s because in the past 10 years, “sight tech” has taken off. What we might have once called “assistive” or “special needs” technology has gone mainstream – and the technology developed by and for people with disabilities is now used by you, your kids, your grandparents – regardless of whether you identify as having a disability or not.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sight tech – or more broadly, eyes-free tech – now touches every part of our lives and the devices that we depend on. And it’s not just blind and visually impaired people who are benefitting. It’s everyone. That’s why I’m pleased to be hosting the </span><a href="http://sighttechglobal.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first ever Sight Tech Global conference on December 2 and 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to sit down with the tech world’s most important figures in sight tech and talk about the past, present and future of how designing for the blind informs and affects all of our lives. </span>Registration is free; <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/conference-registration/">sign up today</a>.</p>
<h2>What is Sight Tech?</h2>
<p>Inventions to help the blind “see” have quietly been spurring innovation for decades. Often, idealistic inventors create with a charitable mindset – to help the needy or return something lost – but the real technological advances in sight tech have done a lot more than simply suggest a cure for human disability. They’ve created new abilities for everyone, and opened new doors to unpredictable innovation: The 12-inch record, the computer keyboard, and the text recognition software that laid the foundation for the modern database were all brought to market, initially, for blind consumers.</p>
<p>There was a time when a personal assistant, someone to read to you or a car at your door, were once thought of as “special” – but no longer. Today, every device shipped by Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft includes these capabilities and more, not as a bonus but as a necessity to compete in today’s competitive hardware and software markets. So whether you use your phone in dark mode or talk to Siri while you’re driving, you too use “sight tech” that was invented initially for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>Over and over again, designing for blind consumers has shown an ROI far beyond helping the needy. Audiobooks, which were heavily resisted by publishers when first developed for blind readers in 1934, now are the book industry’s only growing business. Likewise, coding your website for a blind person’s screen reader might seem like extra work until you realize it optimizes your SEO and makes your website more usable to about a billion other non-standard device users, as well. The world of sight tech is absolutely full of these types of happy surprises; unexpected synchronicities and wide applicability that started with designing for a seemingly small group.</p>
<p>Founded by former TechCrunch COO Ned Desmond earlier this year, <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/">Sight Tech Global</a> provides a new venue for those who are passionate about AI, blind tech, digital inclusion and equal access for all to gather and hear from the accessibility community’s greatest thinkers and doers. Best of all, this free, all-virtual conference is a benefit for the <a href="https://www.vistacenter.org/">Vista Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired</a> which has been helping individuals with blindness or low vision for the past 75 years.</p>
<p>Here’s a little preview of what we’ll be unveiling, cheering, arguing and dreaming about at Sight Tech Global. I hope you’ll join us! Here is a <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/">link to the full agenda</a>.</p>
<h2>Achieving perfect mobility</h2>
<p>For most, the self-driving car is a long-promised luxury. For those of us who can’t get a driver’s license, it’s the key to an unprecedented level of independence. Researchers at Waymo are intent on making sure that, when the first self-driving taxi arrives on your doorstep, it shouldn’t matter whether you can see or not: You should be able to hop in and take a ride.</p>
<p>Similarly, maps are much more than just a handy tool for those of us with visual impairments. In many cases, they’re the only option for finding your bearings – the difference between independence and codependence. Blind and sighted inventors alike have been pushing for better, more exact navigational tools for decades, and today the team at GOOD Maps has harnessed the power of lidar, data and and faster-than-ever processors to make sure that someone with no sight can get themselves within arm&#8217;s reach of exactly what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>Join product managers from Waymo, Waymap, Goodmaps and more to hear about the future of getting from point A to point B.</p>
<h2>The next talking computer</h2>
<p>Since the late 1980s, companies like Freedom Scientific and Humanware have laid the foundation for accessible computing, writing software and building devices that can convert visual information into sound or touch. Those devices were operating computers, rendering digital Braille and delivering audio books to readers long before there was an app for that.</p>
<p>Today, mainstream tech giants Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are creating screen readers and assistive devices of their own, not to mention the thousands of third-party apps for navigation, sensory optimization, recognizing text and images and more. And with this new functionality native to operating systems, established assistive tech companies are evolving, too.</p>
<p>We’ll take a deep dive into what’s next for the “screen reader” – and how new tech from AI to AR, and headgear to haptics are shaking up interfaces and reshaping paradigms across our industry.</p>
<p>Over the course of two days, we’ll be hearing from the accessibility leaders at Apple, Microsoft, Google, Vispero, Humanware, Amazon and more.</p>
<h2>Tech that doesn’t discriminate</h2>
<p>Even the greatest new tech creates great new problems. And as AI swoops in to save the day, allowing blind and visually impaired people to overcome barriers in their work and social lives, AI can also introduce new biases that we never expected. When training our systems to recognize, categorize and interact with real people, how do we account for disability and a diverse range of functional needs? How do we make machines that don’t inherit our own cultural prejudices?</p>
<p>We’ll also be joined by some of the blindness and disability community’s greatest advocates: people like Lainey Feingold, Haben Girma and George Kerscher, who will take a hard look at access to information as a civil right, how far we’ve come and how far we have to go in the era of AI.</p>
<p>Sight Tech Global is December 2-3 – all-virtual and 100% free. All sponsorship proceeds benefit the Vista Center for the Blind. It&#8217;s not too late to sponsor &#8211; <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/sponsorship-opportunities/">learn more here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of insurtech unicorn Root&#8217;s IPO, it felt safe to say that the big transactions for the insurance technology startup space were done for the year.</p>
<p>After all, 2020 had been a big one for the broad category, with insurtech marketplaces raising lots, rental insurance startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lemonade" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lemonade">Lemonade <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/softbank-backed-lemonade-files-to-go-public/">going public</a>, Root itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/inside-roots-ipo-filing">debuting even more recently</a> on the back of its automotive insurance business, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/understanding-hippos-valuation-in-a-post-lemonade-ipo-world/">big round to help Hippo keep building</a> its homeowners company and more.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But yesterday brought with it even more news: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/metromile" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="metromile">Metromile, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a startup competing in the auto insurance market, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pay-per-mile-auto-insurer-metromile-is-heading-to-public-markets-via-spac/">going public via a blank-check company</a> (SPAC), and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201124005400/en/Hippo-Secures-350-Million-Capital-Investment">Hippo raised a huge, unpriced round</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />So let&#8217;s talk about why Metromile might be plying the public markets, and why Hippo may have have decided to pick up more cash. Hint: The reasons are related.</p>
<h2>A market hungry for growth</h2>
<p>The Lemonade IPO was a key moment for neoinsurance startups, a key part of the broader insurtech space. When the rental insurance provider went public, it helped set the tone for public exit valuations for companies of its type: fast-growing insurance companies with slick consumer brands, improving economics, a tech twist and stiff losses.</p>
<p>For the Roots and Metromiles and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hippo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hippo">Hippos, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> it was an important moment.</p>
<p>So, when Lemonade <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/insurtech-unicorn-lemonade-raises-ipo-range-ahead-of-debut">raised its IPO range</a>, and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/lemonade-and-accolade-open-sharply-higher-as-public-markets-rally/">traded sharply higher after its debut</a>, it boded well for its private comps. Not that rental insurance and auto insurance or homeowners insurance are the same thing. They very most decidedly are not, but Lemonade&#8217;s IPO demonstrated that private investors were correct to bet <em>generally</em> on the collection of startups, because when they reached IPO-scale, they had something that public investors wanted.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon-web-services" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is currently having an outage, taking a chunk of the internet down with it.</p>
<p>Several AWS services were experiencing problems as of early Wednesday, according to <a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/">its status page</a>. That means any app, site or service that relies on AWS might also be down, too. (As I found out the hard way this morning when my Roomba refused to connect.)</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says the issue is largely localized to North America. The company didn&#8217;t give a reason for the outage, only that it was experiencing increased error rates and that it was working on a resolution. The irony is that the outage is also affecting the company&#8217;s &#8220;ability to post updates to the Service Health Dashboard,&#8221; so not even Amazon is immune from its own downtime.</p>
<p>So far a number of companies that rely on AWS have tweeted out that they&#8217;re experiencing issues as a result, including Adobe and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roku" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roku">Roku <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-has-held-talks-to-buy-slack-technologies-11606326392">interested in buying Slack</a>, the popular workplace chat company, sent shares of the smaller firm sharply higher today.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> shares are up just under 25% at the moment, according to Yahoo Finance data. Slack is worth $36.95 per share as of the time of writing, valuing it at around $20.8 billion. The well-known former unicorn has been worth as little as $15.10 per share inside the last year and worth as much as $40.07.</p>
<p>Inversely, shares of Salesforce are trading lower on the news, falling around 3.5% as of the time of writing. Investors in the San Francisco-based SaaS pioneer were either unimpressed at the combination idea, or perhaps worried about the price that would be required to bring the 2019 IPO into their fold.</p>
<p>Why Salesforce, a massive software company with a strong position in the CRM market, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/ncino-marks-second-successful-ipo-of-company-built-on-salesforce-platform/">aspirations of becoming an even larger platform player</a>, would want to buy Slack is not immediately clear though there are possible benefits. This includes the possibility of cross-selling the two companies products&#8217; into each others customer bases, possibly unlocking growth for both parties. Slack has wide marketshare inside of fast-growing startups, for example, while Salesforce&#8217;s products roost inside a host of megacorps.</p>

<p>TechCrunch reached out to Salesforce, Slack and Slack&#8217;s CEO for comment on the deal&#8217;s possibility. We&#8217;ll update this post with whatever we get.</p>
<p>While Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">bought Quip for $750 million in 2016</a>, which gave it a kind of document sharing and collaboration, Salesforce Chatter has been the only social tool in the company&#8217;s arsenal. Buying Slack would give the CRM giant solid enterprise chat footing and likely a lot of synergy among customers and tooling.</p>
<p>But Slack has always been more than a mere chat client. It enables companies to embed workflows, and this would fit well in the Salesforce family of products, which spans sales, service, marketing and more. It would allow companies to work both inside and outside the Salesforce ecosystem, building smooth and integrated workflows. While it can theoretically do that now, if the two were combined, you can be sure the integrations would be much tighter.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Holger Mueller, an analyst at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/constellation-research" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="constellation-research">Constellation Research <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it would give Salesforce a sticky revenue source, something they are constantly searching for to keep their revenue engine rumbling along. &#8220;Slack could be a good candidate to strengthen its platform, but more importantly account for more usage and &#8216;stickiness&#8217; of Salesforce products &#8212; as collaboration not only matters for CRM, but also for the vendor&#8217;s growing work.com platform,&#8221; Mueller said.  He added that it would be a way to stick it to former-friend-turned-foe Microsoft.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Slack has come under <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/10/28/microsoft-teams-reaches-115-million-dau-plus-a-new-daily-collaboration-minutes-metric-for-microsoft-365/">withering fire from Microsoft in recent quarters</a>, as the Redmond-based software giant poured resources into its competing Teams service. Teams challenges Slack&#8217;s chat tooling and Zoom&#8217;s video features and has seen huge customer growth in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Finding Slack a corporate home amongst the larger tech players could ensure that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t grind it under the bulk of its enterprise software sales leviathan. And Salesforce, a sometimes Microsoft ally, would not mind adding the faster-growing Slack to its own expanding software income.</p>
<p>The question at this juncture comes down to price. Slack investors won&#8217;t want to sell for less than a good premium on the pre-pop per-share price, which now feels rather dated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sure, we&#8217;re heading into a holiday weekend here in America, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the good ship TechCrunch is going to slow down. We&#8217;re diving right back in next week with another installment in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/announcing-the-extra-crunch-live-event-series/">season two of Extra Crunch Live</a>, our regular interview series with startup founders, venture capitalists and other leaders from the technology community.</p>
<p>This series is for Extra Crunch members, so if you haven&#8217;t signed up you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=jaidaspost">hop on that train right here</a>.</p>
<p>Next week I&#8217;m virtually sitting down with <a href="https://twitter.com/jai_das?lang=en">Jai Das</a>, a well-known managing director at <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Das has invested in companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mulesoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mulesoft">MuleSoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">sold for $6.5 billion</a>), Alteryx (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/24/alteryx-rises-11-in-data-analytics-ipo/">now public</a>), Square (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/19/square-nyse-pop/">also public</a>), Sumo Logic (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/unpacking-the-sumo-logic-s-1-filing/">yep, public</a>) while at Sapphire, having previously worked corporate venture jobs at Intel Capital and Agilent Ventures. (Sapphire was itself originally SAP&#8217;s corporate venture capital arm, but it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/sap-spinout-sapphire-ventures-raises-1-4b-for-new-investments/">split off from its parent in 2011, rebranded and kept on raising funds</a>.)</p>
<p><em>Here <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/why-bessemers-byron-deeter-thinks-saas-companies-could-grow-even-faster-in-2021/">are notes</a> from the last episode of Extra Crunch Live with Bessemer&#8217;s Byron Deeter.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be fun as there&#8217;s so much to talk about. I&#8217;m still bubbling up my question list, so to avoid giving the Sapphire PR team too much pre-discussion ammo let&#8217;s just say that corporate venture capital&#8217;s place in the 2020 boom is an interesting topic for both founders and investors alike.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll want to press Das on the current market for software startups, where we are in the historical arc of SaaS multiples, the importance of API-led tech upstarts, where founders might look to build the next great enterprise startup and if there are any new platforms bubbling up that could be a foundation for future founders to later leverage.</p>
<p>As this is an Extra Crunch Live, I&#8217;ll also work in a few questions from the audience (that means you, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=jaidaspost">make sure your Extra Crunch subscription is live</a>), to augment my own clipboard of notes.</p>
<p>This is going to be a good one. I&#8217;ll see you next Tuesday for the show.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Below are links to add the event to your calendar and to save the Zoom link. We’ll share the YouTube link shortly before the discussion:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you launch an application in the public cloud, you usually put everything on one provider, but what if you could choose the components based on cost and technology and have your database one place and your storage another?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what <a href="http://cast.ai">Cast.ai</a> says that it can provide, and today it announced a healthy $7.7 million seed round from TA Ventures, DNX, Florida Funders and other unnamed angels to keep building on that idea. The round closed in June.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/yuri-frayman" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="yuri-frayman">Yuri Frayman <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says that they started the company with the idea that developers should be able to get the best of each of the public clouds without being locked in. They do this by creating <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> clusters that are able to span multiple clouds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Cast does not require you to do anything except for launching your application. You don&#8217;t need to know  [&#8230;] what cloud you are using [at any given time]. You don&#8217;t need to know anything except to identify the application, identify which [public] cloud providers you would like to use, the percentage of each [cloud provider&#8217;s] use and launch the application,&#8221; Frayman explained.</p>
<p>This means that you could use Amazon&#8217;s RDS database and Google&#8217;s ML engine, and the solution decides how to make that work based on your requirements and price. You set the policies when you are ready to launch and Cast will take care of distributing it for you in the location and providers that you desire, or that makes most sense for your application.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cKbtarELGt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/startups-are-helping-cloud-infrastructure-customers-avoid-vendor-lock-in/">Startups are helping cloud infrastructure customers avoid vendor lock-in</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups are helping cloud infrastructure customers avoid vendor lock-in&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/startups-are-helping-cloud-infrastructure-customers-avoid-vendor-lock-in/embed/#?secret=cKbtarELGt" data-secret="cKbtarELGt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company takes advantage of cloud-native technologies, containerization and Kubernetes to break the proprietary barriers that exist between clouds, says company co-founder Laurent Gil. &#8220;We break these barriers of cloud providers so that an application does not need to sit in one place anymore. It can sit in several [providers] at the same time. And this is great for the Kubernetes application because they&#8217;re kind of designed with this [flexibility] in mind,&#8221; Gil said.</p>
<p>Developers use the policy engine to decide how much they want to control this process. They can simply set location and let Cast optimize the application across clouds automatically, or they can select at a granular level exactly the resources they want to use on which cloud. Regardless of how they do it, Cast will continually monitor the installation and optimize based on cost to give them the cheapest options available for their configuration.</p>
<p>The company currently has 25 employees with four new hires in the pipeline, and plans to double to 50 by the end of 2021. As they grow, the company is trying keep diversity and inclusion front and center in its hiring approach; they currently have women in charge of HR, marketing and sales at the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have very robust processes on the continuous education inside of our organization on diversity training. And a lot of us came from organizations where this was very visible and we took a lot of those processes [and lessons] and brought them here,&#8221; Frayman said.</p>
<p>Frayman has been involved with multiple startups, including <a href="http://cujo.ai">Cujo.ai</a>, a consumer firewall startup that participated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/cujo/">in TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in New York in 2016.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers have laid out a major legislative proposal <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2102">today</a> to encourage the reuse of industrial data across the Single Market by creating a standardized framework of trusted tools and techniques to ensure what they describe as &#8220;secure and privacy-compliant conditions&#8221; for sharing data.</p>
<p>Enabling a network of trusted and neutral data intermediaries, and an oversight regime comprised of national monitoring authorities and a pan-EU coordinating body, are core components of the plan.</p>
<p>The move follows the European Commission&#8217;s data strategy announcement in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">February</a>, when it said it wanted to boost data reuse to support a new generation of data-driven services powered by data-hungry artificial intelligence, as well as encouraging the notion of using &#8220;tech for good&#8221; by enabling “more data and good quality data” to fuel innovation with a common public good (like better disease diagnostics) and improve public services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The wider context is that personal data is already regulated in the bloc (such as under the General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR), which restricts reuse. While commercial considerations can limit how industrial data is shared.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive believes harmonzied requirements that set technical and/or legal conditions for data reuse are needed to foster legal certainty and trust &#8212; delivered via a framework that promises to maintain rights and protections and thus get more data usefully flowing.</p>
<p>The Commission sees major business benefits flowing from the proposed data governance regime. &#8220;Businesses, both small and large, will benefit from new business opportunities as well as from a reduction in costs for acquiring, integrating and processing data, from lower barriers to enter markets, and from a reduction in time-to-market for novel products and services,&#8221; it writes in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2103">press release</a>.</p>
<p>It has further data-related proposals incoming in 2021, in addition to a package of digital services legislation it&#8217;s due to lay out early next month &#8212; as part of a wider reboot of industrial strategy which prioritises digitalization and a green new deal.</p>
<p>All legislative components of the strategy will need to gain the backing of the European Council and parliament so there&#8217;s a long road ahead for implementing the plan.</p>

<h2>Data Governance Act</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EU lawmakers often talk in shorthand about the data strategy being intended to encourage the sharing and reuse of &#8220;industrial data&#8221; &#8212; although the Data Governance Plan (DGA) unveiled today has a wider remit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Commission envisages the framework enabling the sharing of data that&#8217;s subject to data protection legislation &#8212; which means personal data; where privacy considerations may (currently) restrain reuse &#8212; as well as industrial data subject to intellectual property, or which contains trade secrets or other commercially sensitive information (and is thus not typically shared by its creators primarily for commercial reasons). </span></p>
<p>In a press conference on the data governance proposals, internal market commissioner Thierry Breton floated the notion of &#8220;data altruism&#8221; &#8212; saying the Commission wants to provide citizens with an organized way to share their own personal data for a common/public good, such as aiding research into rare diseases or helping cities map mobility for purposes like monitoring urban air quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through personal data spaces, which are novel personal information management tools and services, Europeans will gain more control over their data and decide on a detailed level who will get access to their data and for what purpose,&#8221; the Commission writes in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2103">Q&amp;A</a> on the proposal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s planning a public register where entities will be able to register as a &#8220;data altruism organisation&#8221; &#8212; provided they have a not-for-profit character; meet transparency requirements; and implement certain safeguards to &#8220;protect the rights and interests of citizens and companies&#8221; &#8212; with the aim of providing &#8220;maximum trust with minimum administrative burden&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>The DGA envisages different tools, techniques and requirements governing how private sector bodies share data versus private companies.</p>
<p>For public sector bodies there may be technical requirements (such as encryption or anonymization) attached to the data itself or further processing limitations (such as requiring it to take place in &#8220;dedicated infrastructures operated and supervised by the public sector&#8221;), as well as legally binding confidentiality agreements that must be signed by the reuser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever data is being transferred to a reuser, mechanisms will be in place that ensure compliance with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en">GDPR</a> and preserve the commercial confidentiality of the data,&#8221; the Commission&#8217;s PR says.</p>
<p>To encourage businesses to get on board with pooling their own data sets &#8212; for the promise of a collective economic upside via access to bigger volumes of pooled data &#8212; the plan is for regulated data intermediaries/marketplaces to provide &#8220;neutral&#8221; data-sharing services, acting as the &#8220;trusted&#8221; go-between/repository so data can flow between businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;To ensure this neutrality, the data-sharing intermediary cannot exchange the data for its own interest (e.g. by selling it to another company or using it to develop their own product based on this data) and will have to comply with strict requirements to ensure this neutrality,&#8221; the Commission writes on this.</p>
<p>Under the plan, intermediaries&#8217; compliance with data handling requirements would be monitored by public authorities at a national level.</p>
<p>But the Commission is also proposing the creation of a new pan-EU body, called the European Data Innovation Board, that would try to knit together best practices across Member States &#8212; in what looks like a mirror of the steering/coordinating role undertaken by the European Data Protection Board (which links up the EU&#8217;s patchwork of data protection supervisory authorities).</p>
<p>&#8220;These data brokers or intermediaries that will provide for data sharing will do that in a way that your rights are protected and that you have choices,&#8221; said EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up the bloc&#8217;s digital strategy, also speaking at today&#8217;s press conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that you can also have personal data spaces where your data is managed. Because, initially, when you ask people they say well actually we do want to share but we don&#8217;t really know how to do it. And this is not only the technicalities &#8212; it&#8217;s also the legal certainty that&#8217;s missing. And this proposal will provide that,&#8221; she added.</p>

<h2>Data localization requirements &#8212; or not?</h2>
<p>The commissioners faced a number of questions over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">hot button issue of international data transfers</a>.</p>
<p>Breton was asked whether the DGA will include any data localization requirements. He responded by saying &#8212; essentially &#8212; that the rules will bake in a series of conditions which, depending on the data itself and the intended destination, may mean that storing and processing the data in the EU is the only viable option.</p>
<p>&#8220;On data localization &#8212; what we do is to set a GDPR-type of approach, through adequacy decisions and standard contractual clauses for only sensitive data through a cascading of conditions to allow the international transfer under conditions and in full respect of the protected nature of the data. That&#8217;s really the philosophy behind it,&#8221; Breton said. &#8220;And of course for highly sensitive data [such as] in the public health domain it is necessary to be able to set further conditions, depending on the sensitivity, otherwise&#8230; Member States will not share them.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JmmEP3SHMA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that&#8217;s cold comfort for Facebook</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that&#8217;s cold comfort for Facebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/embed/#?secret=JmmEP3SHMA" data-secret="JmmEP3SHMA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;For instance it could be possible to limit the reuse of this data into public secure infrastructures so that companies will come to use the data but not keep them. It could be also about restricting the number of access in third countries, restricting the possibility to further transfer the data and if necessary also prohibiting the transfer to a third country,&#8221; he went on, adding that such conditions would be &#8220;in full respect&#8221; of the EU&#8217;s WTO obligations.</p>
<p>In a section of its Q&amp;A that deals with data localization requirements, the Commission similarly dances around the question, writing: &#8220;There is no obligation to store and process data in the EU. Nobody will be prohibited from dealing with the partner of their choice. At the same time, the EU must ensure that any access to EU citizen&#8217;s personal data and certain sensitive data is in compliance with its values and legislative framework.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the presser, Breton also noted that companies that want to gain access to EU data that&#8217;s been made available for reuse will need to have legal representation in the region. &#8220;This is important of course to ensure the enforceability of the rules we are setting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is very important for us &#8212; maybe not for other continents but for us &#8212; to be fully compliant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commissioners also faced questions about how the planned data reuse rules would be enforced &#8212; given ongoing criticism over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement</a> of Europe&#8217;s data protection framework, GDPR.</p>
<p>&#8220;No rule is any good if not enforced,&#8221; agreed Vestager. &#8220;What we are suggesting here is that if you have a data-sharing service provider and they have notified themselves it&#8217;s then up to the authority with whom they have notified actually to monitor and to supervise the compliance with the different things that they have to live up to in order to preserve the protection of these legitimate interests &#8212; could be business confidentiality, could be intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a thing that we will keep on working on also in the future proposals that are upcoming &#8212; the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act &#8212; but here you have sort of a precursor that the ones who receive the notification in Member States they will also have to supervise that things are actually in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also responding on the enforcement point, Breton suggested enforcement would be baked in up front, such as by careful control of who could become a data reuse broker.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Firstly] we are putting forward common rules and harmonized rules&#8230; We are creating a large internal market for data. The second thing is that we are asking Member States to create specific authorities to monitor. The third thing is that we will ensure coherence and enforcement through the European Data Innovation Board,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just to give you an example&#8230; enforcement is embedded. To be a data broker you will need to fulfil a certain number of obligations and if you fulfil these obligations you can be a neutral data broker &#8212; if you don&#8217;t you cannot. So it will be easy to apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside the DGA, the Commission also announced an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2188">Intellectual Property Action Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Vestager said this aims to build on the EU&#8217;s existing IP framework with a number of supportive actions &#8212; including financial support for SMEs involved in the Horizon Europe R&amp;D program to file patents.</p>
<p>The Commission is also considering whether to reform the framework for filing standards essential patents. But in the short term Vestager said it would aim to encourage industry to engage in forums aimed at reducing litigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;One example could be that the Commission could set up an independent system of third party essentiality checks in view of improving legal certainty and reducing litigation costs,&#8221; she added of the potential reform, noting that protecting IP is an important component of the bloc&#8217;s industrial strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we head into the biggest shopping period of the year &#8212; which this year may well have an even stronger online component than usual because of COVID-19 &#8212; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has launched its latest effort to combat the sale of counterfeit goods on its site.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant today <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201125005567/en/Amazon-Launches-IP-Accelerator-in-Europe-to-Help-Small-Businesses-Protect-Their-Brands-and-Tackle-Counterfeit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that its <a href="http://brandservices.amazon.com/ipaccelerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP Accelerator</a> is now live in Europe &#8212; specifically France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands and the United Kingdom &#8212; to help SMBs selling on Amazon obtain trademarks on their intellectual property, protect their brands and tackle the sale of counterfeit goods, connecting companies with recommended legal firms to carry out work. Joining the IP Accelerator is free, while the legal aid is provided as &#8220;low-cost assistance&#8221;, with those costs coming in the form of &#8220;competitive, pre-negotiated rates,&#8221; Amazon said.</p>
<p>The European launch &#8212; in Amazon&#8217;s six biggest markets in Europe, covering more than 150,000 small and medium businesses selling on Amazon&#8217;s platform, which account for more than half the products sold in the region &#8212; comes just over a year after Amazon kicked off an IP Accelerator in the U.S., in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-intellectual-property-accelerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon today said that the U.S. effort has so far yielded 6,000 trademark applications submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by SMBs working through the program.</p>
<p>Amazon has long struggled with counterfeit and other illicit items sold through its marketplace &#8212; which brings in third-party sellers and is built on the very concept of economies of scale, offering a vast array of choices to shoppers, and the IP Accelerator comes on the heels of a lot of other proactive efforts to battle the situation.</p>
<p>They have included Amazon filing a number of lawsuits &#8212; both on its own and in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/amazon-and-valentino-team-up-in-joint-lawsuit-against-new-york-counterfeiter-over-rockstud-knock-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">partnership with others</a>, and most recently, just this month, being the plaintiff in a case that interestingly extended outside its own platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-sues-online-influencers-engaged-in-a-counterfeit-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">target online influencers</a>.</p>
<p>It also has built a lot of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/amazon-expands-transparency-anti-counterfeit-codes-to-europe-india-and-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology</a> to help track and spot illicit goods.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s working with government authorities, most recently in an initiative to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201124005382/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">halt the import</a> of counterfeit inventory before it gets sold or delivered to buyers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Sisyphean task in some regards: Amazon&#8217;s growth means more sellers, and more goods to triage, and more chances for dodgy items. But it&#8217;s one that is very much in Amazon&#8217;s interest to get right: If it can&#8217;t protect IP, the best brands will stay away, and consumers will start to lose confidence in the platform, too.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yXlhINbAi5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-sues-online-influencers-engaged-in-a-counterfeit-scheme/">Amazon sues online influencers engaged in a counterfeit scheme</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon sues online influencers engaged in a counterfeit scheme&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-sues-online-influencers-engaged-in-a-counterfeit-scheme/embed/#?secret=yXlhINbAi5" data-secret="yXlhINbAi5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That&#8217;s where initiatives like the IP Accelerator come in, where the idea is that it gives sellers who are smaller more direct control over their own brand destinies.</p>
<p>The focus on SMBs is very specific and not just because of their collective selling power on Amazon. They <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">are most often not in full possession of their legal options, and perhaps also worried about the costs of getting involved in trademarking, with a recent <a href="https://www.clustercollaboration.eu/sites/default/files/news_attachment/roadmap_-_intellectual_property_action_plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> from the European Intellectual Property Office finding that just 9% of SMBs have registered IP rights, versus 36% of larger companies.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We know from our conversations with small business owners that there is often confusion about why IP rights are important and how sellers can secure them,&#8221; said Francois Saugier, vice president for EU Seller Services, Amazon, in a statement. &#8220;As part of our broader commitment to supporting small businesses, we have set up IP Accelerator to make the IP registration process as easy and as affordable as possible for entrepreneurs in the early days of their businesses.”</p>
<p>In addition to legal assistance, SMBs in the program can then join Amazon&#8217;s Brand Registry. This currently covers some 350,000 brands and gives businesses the ability to manage and track their brands, using automated algorithms built by Amazon and giving participants a hotline to reporting and acting on potential copycats and other trademark criminals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/11/13/amazon-primed-disrupt-legal-field-launch-ip-accelerator-program/id=115796/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One IP publication, IP Watchdog, describes how</a> the IP Accelerator is a particularly disruptive concept in part because of that quick access to the Brand Registry: Previously, a company would have had to have a trademark approved by the patent office before joining. Now, it seems that as long as the application is in progress &#8212; via the legal firms that have been picked to be a part of the IP Accelerator &#8212; you can join the registry. Businesses generally try to join to get a leg up on their marketing, and critics see the Accelerator as one way to potentially game that system.</p>
<p>(The other way that the IP Accelerator is disruptive, according to the article? By forcing a pricing structure for trademarking services that departs from the norm, for a potentially very large audience of customers, which also could lay the groundwork for a wider set of legal services for businesses.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The business of providing business services to SMBs on the platform is an interesting one.</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">number of startups emerge in recent times</a> that are looking to acquire and roll up the best of the SMBs that sell on Amazon with big ambitions of their own.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ynxr0rGc7o"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/">SellerX raises $118M to buy up and grow Amazon marketplace businesses</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Their plans are to use economies of scale to run these businesses better, with better supply-chain management, marketing, IP control and more. That strategy is predicated on the fact that those small businesses are finding it a challenge to take their enterprises to the next level on their own.</p>
<p>In that regard, Amazon&#8217;s IP Accelerator potentially gives those smaller sellers another helping hand to stay independent (or at least grow their businesses enough to catch the attention of these consolidators).</p>
<p>“Great ideas are the core of every good business. Turning those ideas into a reality relies on IP,&#8221; Pippa Hall, director of Innovation and chief economist at the U.K.’s Intellectual Property Office, said in a statement. &#8220;Understanding, protecting and getting the most out of your IP is a crucial ingredient of success. A good IP strategy should sit at the heart of every good business plan.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unacademy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unacademy">Unacademy, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an online learning platform in India, has added two more marquee investors to its cap table. The Bangalore-based startup, which focuses on K-12 online education, said on Wednesday it has raised new funds from Tiger Global Management and Dragoneer Investment Group.</p>
<p>The funding round, which is between $75 million to $100 million in size (according to a person familiar with the matter; Unacademy has not disclosed the figure), valued the four-and-a-half-year-old startup at $2 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/facebook-backs-indian-education-startup-unacademy/">up from about $500 million in February this year</a> when Facebook joined its list of backers, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation/">$1.45 billion in September</a>, when SoftBank led the round.</p>
<p>“Our mission from Day One has been to democratise education and make it more affordable and accessible. We have consistently built the most iconic products that deliver high quality education to everyone. Today, I’m delighted to welcome Tiger Global and Dragoneer as our partners in the journey. They are both marquee global investors with a history of partnering with innovative companies that are making an impact on people’s lives,” said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/gaurav-munjal" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="gaurav-munjal">Gaurav Munjal, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder and chief executive of Unacademy, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://unacademy.com/">Unacademy</a> helps students prepare for competitive exams to get into college, as well as those who are pursuing graduate-level courses. On its app, students watch live classes from educators and later engage in sessions to review topics in more detail. In recent months, the startup has held several online interviews of high-profile individuals, such as Indian politician Shashi Tharoor, on a range of topics, which has expanded its appeal beyond its student base.</p>

<p>The platform has amassed over 47,000 educators, who teach students in 5,000 cities in India in more than 14 languages. Over 150,000 live classes are conducted on the platform each month and the collective watch time across platforms is more than 2 billion minutes per month, the startup said.</p>
<p>“The opportunity to improve lives through online education is enormous because of its sheer accessibility. The Unacademy team has innovated rapidly to build a leading platform that is taking education to the farthest corners of India. We are very excited to partner with Unacademy and look forward to seeing it scale further,” said Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>

<p>Scores of education startups in India have reported skyrocketing growth in recent months as schools remain shut across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic. Even as most Indians tend not to pay for online services — just ask Google and Facebook, both of which count India as their biggest market by users but make little in the country — the education category is an outlier. Indian families continue to spend heavily on their children’s education in hopes of paving the way for a better future.</p>
