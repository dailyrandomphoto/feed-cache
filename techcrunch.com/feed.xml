										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>, the communications service that&#8217;s become the 21st century&#8217;s answer to MUD rooms, is close to closing a new round of financing that would value the company at up to $7 billion, according to sources with knowledge of the round.</p>
<p>The new funding comes just months after a $100 million investment that gave the company a $3.5 billion valuation. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/discord" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="discord">Discord&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> doubling in corporate value comes as the persistent, inept, American response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to accelerate the adoption and growth of businesses creating virtual social networking opportunities.</p>
<p>Discord built its initial growth on the back of the gaming industry and the rise of multi-player, multi-platform games that supplanted earlier social networks as the online town square for a generation of young gamers (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+gamers+are+there+in+the+world+2020&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS896US897&amp;oq=how+many+gamers+are+there+in+the+world+&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i457j0j69i57j0i22i30l5.4497j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">whose numbers globally now spiral north of several billion</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But, as the company&#8217;s founders noted when they announced their last round of financing, the Discord use case has extended far beyond the gaming community.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">“It turns out that, for a lot of you, it wasn’t just about video games anymore,” wrote co-founders Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy<a href="https://blog.discord.com/your-place-to-talk-a7ffa19b901b"> in a July blog post announcing the latest financing</a>.</p>
<p id="7ccd" class="ih ii as ij b ej ik il em im in io ip er iq ir eu is it ex iu di eh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The two men frame their company as “a place designed to hang out and talk in the comfort of your own communities and friends.” Discord, they say, is “a place to have genuine conversations and spend quality time with people, whether catching up, learning something or sharing ideas.”</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">If that sounds familiar to some of the internet&#8217;s earliest users, that&#8217;s because it is. Back in the dawn of the world wide web, multi-user dungeons (MUD) provided ways for practitioners of any number of sub cultures to find each other online and chat about whatever tickled their collective fancy.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">As the web evolved, so did the number of places and spaces for these conversations to happen. Now there are multivariate ways for users to find each other within the web, but Discord seems to have risen above most of the rest.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">As analyst John Koetsier <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/06/12/private-social-discords-250m-users-are-already-where-facebook-wants-to-go/?sh=2b02fed741fd">noted in Forbes back in 2019</a>, there were already 250 million Discord users sending 315 million messages a day. Those are the company&#8217;s pre-pandemic numbers &#8212; and they&#8217;re impressive by any standards.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">As with any platform that has become popular on the web, Discord isn&#8217;t without its underbelly. Three years ago, the company tried to boot a number of its most racist users, but their ability to use the platform to disseminate hate speech <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/discord-safe-space-white-supremacists.html">has stubbornly persisted</a>.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">Until mid-2019, white nationalists were comfortable enough using the service to warrant a shoutout from Daily Stormer founder, Andrew Anglin, <a href="http://archive.li/5TbnQ">who urged his fellow travelers to stop using the service</a>.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">“Discord is always on and always present among these groups on the far-right,” Joan Donovan, the lead researcher on media manipulation at the Data &amp; Society Research Institute, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/discord-safe-space-white-supremacists.html">told Slate in 2018</a>. “It’s the place where they do most of the organizing of doxing and harassment campaigns.”</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">To date, Discord has raised $379.3 million,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/discord"> according to Crunchbase</a>, from an investor group that includes Greylock, Index Ventures, Spark Capital, Tencent and Benchmark.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">In addition to the cash it raised earlier this year, Discord emphasized a new user experience and added video functionality so that users could communicate more readily (and so the company could compete with Zoom). There are templates available to help users create servers, and the company has increased its voice and video capacity by 200%.</p>
<p id="9423" class="ih ii as ij b ej ik il em im in io ip er iq ir eu is it ex iu di eh" data-selectable-paragraph="">As part of this new focus on product, Discord has launched what it calls a “<a class="co gl iy iz ja jb" href="https://discord.com/safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safety Center</a>” that clearly defines the company’s rules and regulations and what actions users can take to monitor and manage their use of service for hate speech and abuse.</p>
<p class="ih ii as ij b ej ik il em im in io ip er iq ir eu is it ex iu di eh" data-selectable-paragraph="">“We will continue to take decisive action against white supremacists, racists and others who seek to use Discord for evil,” the founders wrote in June.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">As we reported at the time, Index Ventures co-founder Danny Rimer, who led the investor group that backed Discord’s latest $100 million cash infusion, was an advocate for the company’s expanded vision for itself.</p>
<p>“I believe Discord is the future of platforms because it demonstrates how a responsibly curated site can provide a safe space for people with shared interests,” Rimer <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/discord-community-home-soul/">wrote in a statement</a>. “Rather than throwing raw content at you, like Facebook, it provides a shared experience for you and your friends. We’ll come to appreciate that Discord does for social conversation what Slack has done for professional conversation.”</p>
<p>Apparently, investors are doubling down on that assessment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is developing a new product, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), that will allow people to start conversations with businesses or creators&#8217; accounts by tapping on a commonly asked question within a chat. Those who already have the feature available report they&#8217;re able to create set of up to four questions which can optionally be displayed at the beginning of a conversation with other users.</p>
<p>The feature could be useful for businesses that are often responding to customer inquiries about their products or services, or for creators who receive a number of inbound requests from fans or brands interested in collaborations, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2078309" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2078309" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2078309 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235910_com.instagram.android.jpg?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235910_com.instagram.android.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235910_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235910_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235910_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235910_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235910_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235910_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2078309" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/thenezvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@thenezvm <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product&#8217;s introduction highlights the extent that Instagram&#8217;s messaging platform now overlaps with Facebook Messenger, following the recent launch of the new Instagram messaging experience. In September, Facebook announced Instagram users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/">would have the option to upgrade to a new inbox</a> that now offers a number of Messenger-inspired features &#8212; like the ability to change your chat color, react with any emoji, set messages to disappear, and more. The upgrade also introduced cross-app communication between Instagram and Messenger&#8217;s platforms.</p>
<p>With these changes, it appears Facebook is paving a road towards making the Instagram messaging experience more on par with Messenger.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2078312" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2078312" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2078312 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235931_com.instagram.android.jpg?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235931_com.instagram.android.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235931_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235931_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235931_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235931_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235931_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_20201124_235931_com.instagram.android.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2078312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/thenezvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@thenezvm <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Today, the Messenger app offers <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-messenger/">a similar FAQ option</a> for Facebook Page owners under the Automated Responses section in Messenger&#8217;s settings. Here, Page owners or admins can set up a series of frequently asked questions and their responses to those questions which can be presented at the beginning of conversations with their Page &#8212; just like this new Instagram feature offers.</p>
<p>The Instagram FAQ option had been spotted earlier this year while in <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1305989550599274496">development</a>, but seemed to be only for Business accounts, according to the app&#8217;s code.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, new reports and screenshots from one Instagram user with access to the feature indicate the FAQ will be available for creator accounts, in addition to businesses.</p>
<p>The feature was spotted on Monday by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra">Matt Navarra</a>, who credited <a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1n1174f r-1loqt21 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/thenezvm" data-focusable="true">@thenezvm</a> for the new discovery.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Instagram has rolled out FAQs feature to more users </p>
<p>h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/thenezvm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thenezvm</a> <a href="https://t.co/eCbsjMCDEb">pic.twitter.com/eCbsjMCDEb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1330862897279414272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Given that @thenezvm has access to the feature now, as the above credited screenshots show, the FAQ option could either be in early testing or starting to roll out more broadly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely the former, however, as Instagram declined to comment or provide details, when TechCrunch asked for more information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dija, a new U.K. based startup founded by senior former Deliveroo employees, is closing in on $20 million funding, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources, the round, which has yet to close, is being led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/let-a-second-fund-blossom/">Blossom Capital</a>, the early stage venture capital firm founded by ex-Index and LocalGlobe VC Ophelia Brown. It&#8217;s not clear who else is in the running, although I understand it was highly contested and the startup had offers from several top tier funds. Blossom Capital and Dija declined to comment.</p>
<p>Playing in the convenience store and delivery space, yet to launch Dija is founded by Alberto Menolascina and Yusuf Saban, who both spent a number of years at Deliveroo in senior positions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Menolascina was previously Director of Corporate Strategy and Development at the takeout delivery behemoth and held several positions before that. He also co-founded Everli (formerly Supermercato24), the Instacart-styled grocery delivery company in Italy, and also worked at Just Eat.</p>
<p>Saban is the former Chief of Staff to CEO at Deliveroo and also worked at investment bank Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>In other words, both are seasoned operators in food logistics, from startups to scales-ups. Both Menolascina and Saban were also instrumental in Deliveroo&#8217;s Series D, E, and F funding rounds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, few details are public about Dija, except that it will offer convenience and fresh food delivery using a &#8220;dark” convenience store mode, seeing it build out hyper local fulfilment centers in urban high population areas for super quick delivery. It&#8217;s likely akin to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">Accel and Softbank-backed goPuff</a> in the U.S. or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">perhaps startup Weezy</a> in the U.K.</p>
<p>That said, the model is yet to be proven everywhere it’s been tried and will likely be a capital intensive race in which Dija is off to a good start. And, of course, with everybody making the shift to online groceries while in a pandemic, as ever, timing is everything.</p>

Flowmill focuses on helping its users find network performance issues in their cloud infrastructure in real time and measure their traffic by service to help them control cost.</p>
<p>Like so many other companies in this space now, Flowmill utilizes eBPF, the Linux kernel&#8217;s relatively new capability to run sandboxed code inside it without having to change the kernel or load kernel modules. That makes it ideal for monitoring applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Observability technology is rapidly increasing in both sophistication and ability to help organizations revolutionize how they monitor their infrastructure and applications. Flowmill’s innovative NPM solution provides real-time observability into network behavior and performance of distributed cloud applications, leveraging extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technologies,&#8221; said Tim Tully, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/splunk" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="splunk">Splunk&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> chief technology officer. &#8220;We’re excited to bring Flowmill’s visionary NPM technology into our Observability Suite as Splunk continues to deliver best-in-class observability capabilities to our customers.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/454185796" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>While Spunk has made some larger acquisitions, including its $1.05 billion purchase of SignalFx, it&#8217;s building out its observability platform by picking up small startups that offer very specific capabilities. It could probably build all of these features in-house, but the company clearly believes that it has to move fast to get a foothold in this growing market as enterprises look for new observability tools as they modernize their tech stacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flowmill’s approach to building systems that support full-fidelity, real-time, high-cardinality ingestions and analysis aligns well with Splunk’s vision for observability,&#8221; said Flowmill CEO Jonathan Perry. &#8220;We’re thrilled to join Splunk and bring eBPF, next-generation NPM to the Splunk Observability Suite.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies didn&#8217;t disclose the purchase price, but Flowmill previously <a href="https://www.flowmill.com/company/">raised</a> funding from Amplify, Felicis Ventures, WestWave Capital and UpWest.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">After Election Day, <a href="https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2020/10/23/what-if-second-civil-war">NPR</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fear-of-election-violence/2020/10/30/5b4f5314-17a3-11eb-befb-8864259bd2d8_story.html">The Washington Post</a> and <a href="https://eand.co/american-democracy-is-hanging-on-by-a-thread-d13f482b3aa">various</a> <a href="https://thecitizen.com/2020/11/04/the-coming-civil-war/">blogs</a> described America as bitterly divided or on the brink of civil war. These were by the same journalists, pundits and intellectuals who only know how to sell fear.</p>
<p>“They want to take away your guns!” and “They want to take your children away!” were their cries, while praising BLM’s protesters on one screen and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz575YtRnpA&amp;t=2s">promoting videos</a> of the infinitesimal number of rioters on another.</p>
<p>The Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/will-election-get-violent/616875/">speculated about widespread violence</a> depending on the outcome, but I never believed these seemingly well-researched reports that have become commonplace in our clickbait-driven world. And as we saw, nothing of real concern happened; instead of violence, there were relatively small protests and dancing in the streets.<br />
The gap that supposedly divides our nation is narrower than the doomsaying pundits, intellectuals, politicians and cause leaders want you to believe. Why do they want you to believe this? Because promoting division and conflict sells and grants a perverse glue that unites people within their tribal communities. Behind these labels of conflict are seeds of fear that can grow into irrational fears. Fears without reason, fears beyond facts. Sometimes these fears become things we hate  —  and our society and nation should have no place for hate, because it is an unproductive emotion without any possible positive outcome.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I’ve learned to ignore much of the headline-driven news and social media echo chambers where ridiculous ideas fester across our political spectrum. There are obviously ridiculous ideas, such as QAnon, but the subtly ridiculous ideas can be more dangerous and potentially even more destructive. These ideas can be diminished by simple questions to the average reasonable person.<br />
One idea spawned in some progressive echo chambers was the notion that Trump <a href="https://eand.co/will-american-democracy-survive-the-gops-coup-dfbbb97d71c4">would stage a coup d’état</a> if Joe Biden won the election (i.e., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/us/politics/unidentified-police-protests.html">“Did you see those unmarked federal police!?”</a> which signaled to <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/07/donald-trump-federal-agents-portland">some that a coup</a> was coming).</p>
<p>A basic element of a coup d’état is military support or control, which obviously Trump did not have. I would ask basic questions around this idea, but always ask the rhetorical question, “Do you know how difficult it is to conduct a coup d’état?” Meanwhile, in some <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/506187-how-conservative-conspiracy-theories-are-deepening-americas-political">conservative echo chambers</a>, a similar concern made rounds that “defund the police” was an effort to install a “federal police force” that Biden would control once in the Oval Office. So there really isn’t much original thought inside the echo chambers of America.</p>

<p>Maybe both sides with such fantasies recently watched that Patrick Swayze classic, “Red Dawn,” where a tiny militia of high school students held off the combined forces of the old Soviet Union and Cuba. Or maybe they saw “300,” in which Sparta’s army held off more than 300,000 invaders. After watching either of these inspirational movies, I might possibly believe such a militia or “federal force” could overpower the whole might of the U.S. military. Ahem.</p>
<p>For those warmongers and soothsayers warning of civil war, where do they want the country to go? Static echo chambers of America, or a vision of suburban folks with pitchforks and handguns versus urban dwellers carrying machine guns and Blue Bottle coffee mugs?</p>
<p>Since the level of violence after the election did not in fact match the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/10/27/why-the-risk-of-election-violence-is-high/">crystal balls of these oracles</a>, the definitions and <a href="https://medium.com/discourse/trumps-coup-attempts-probably-won-t-work-but-notes-are-being-taken-5474c734715f">terms have of course changed</a>. As Bertrand Russell stated, “fear is the main source of superstition”  —  to which I would add that fear is also the source of really stupid predictions and ideas.<br />
And let’s be clear that while I do criticize the echo chambers of social media, they are only tools of promotion, because echo chambers are not limited to the online social media. Echo chambers can be homes, bars, lodge meetings, yoga studios and Sunday bridge clubs. The enablers are the pundits, intellectuals, politicians and cause leaders that seed these ideas.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories, misinformation and outlandish statements were quite capable of spreading before the recommendation engines of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and others were fully developed. For example, in 2006, <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2011/04/more-than-half-of-democrats-believed-bush-knew-035224">over 50% of Democrats</a> believed the U.S. government was involved in the 9/11 terrorist attack. More than half of registered Democrats believed in this conspiracy theory! And let’s not forget the Obama “birther” conspiracy, where <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-birther-obama-poll-republicans-kenya-744195">at least 57% of Republicans</a> continued to believe that President Obama was born in Kenya even after he released his birth certificate in 2008.</p>
<p>But today, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other social media sites have become extremely powerful accelerants for such provocative ideas and strange fictions. Tristan Harris, co-founder and president of the Center for Humane Technology, was recently featured in the Netflix documentary “The Social Dilemma,” where <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tristan-harris-tech-is-downgrading-humans-time-to-fight-back/">he discussed how social media</a> tends to feed content to retain people’s attention and can spiral downward.</p>
<p>This can become an abyss of outright misinformation, or — even more importantly in my estimation — for subtle, ignorant ideas, such as coups d&#8217;état and civil wars. And those destructive ideas and irrational conspiracy theories from the 2000s that probably took months to spread, are now supercharged by today’s social media giants to infect our society in a matter of days or weeks.</p>
<p>The fabric of our nation was delicately woven, but after countless turns of the loom between conflicts and enlightenment, our country has proven itself extremely resilient. Indestructible beyond today’s calls for racism and ignorance, for anarchy and destruction, and for civil wars.</p>
<p>Biden is our President-elect with a mandate to lead our nation beyond this divide  —  a divide that I believe has been overstated. Many citizens met in the middle to provide Biden with a mandate to bridge the gap. The “blue wave” didn’t occur and House Republicans gained 10 seats, which means many Republicans and independents voted “red” down-ballot but also voted for Biden.</p>
<p>Trump had the largest number of minority votes for a Republican presidential candidate in history, including from 18% of Black male voters  —  and that number would have been much higher pre-pandemic. I see all of this as a positive, because our citizens are not voting party line or becoming beholden to one party.</p>
<p>In reality, many of the major issues that supposedly separate us are much closer than we know. For example, I’ve sat down behind closed doors with a senior adviser on healthcare for a major Republican leader, who stated that Obamacare isn’t far off from what they were planning. The difference was that their plan was more small business friendly and their cost savings would be among the younger demographic. I also sat down with a senior adviser for Obamacare, who explained that they believed it wasn’t sustainable unless the cost savings were for those 65 and above. So the differences on such critical policies are not miles apart but only steps away from each other. Although at times politics are about credit and conflict, hopefully such differences can be resolved in the near future.</p>
<p>I hope this election will change the temperament of our nation and its citizens. I hope it will lead more people to ignore the tactics of both political parties and organizations seeking their attention and support. Their shortsighted methods should be cast away like the relics of the past and conflict should not be the tool of this new America. Instead, let’s focus on productive dialogue to find common ground, and thoughtful, practical policies to move our nation forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/marie-ekeland" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="marie-ekeland">Marie Ekeland <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has unveiled <a href="https://bibicheri.medium.com/2050-commence-aujourdhui-bf2cee03a9b0">her next act</a> — and it’s a new fund called <a href="https://2050.do">2050</a>. But it’s not your average French VC fund as it’s going to be an evergreen fund focused on building a better world. It sounds ambitious, but Ekeland isn’t just daydreaming as she has a detailed action plan.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Marie Ekeland, she used to be an investor at French VC firm <a href="https://www.elaia.com">Elaia</a>. She invested in adtech firm Criteo, which later became a public company in the U.S. She is also one of the founding members of <a href="https://francedigitale.org/en/">France Digitale</a>, the main startup lobby in France.</p>
<p>More recently, she <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/16/vc-firm-daphni-announces-its-first-165-million-fund/?ncid=rss">co-founded Daphni</a>, her own VC firm. While she’s no longer involved with Daphni’s day-to-day activities, she still follows her own investments in Daphni’s first fund. Her investments include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/societe-generale-is-acquiring-freelancer-challenger-bank-shine/">Shine</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/swile-raises-78-7-million-for-its-corporate-lunch-card-and-benefits-app/">Swile</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/holberton-raises-8m-for-its-full-stack-engineering-school/">Holberton School</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/lifen-raises-22-7-million-for-its-healthcare-messaging-platform/">Lifen</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With 2050, Ekeland is going back to the drawing board with a different vision when it comes to investment thesis, fund structure and the firm’s own values.</p>
<p>“Investment is self-fulfilling,” Ekeland told me. “When you invest in this company instead of that one, you’re shaping the future of society.”</p>
<p>During our lengthy discussion, it became quite clear that Ekeland both suffers from tech fatigue and also still believes she can have a positive impact through her investments.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the investment thesis. 2050 wants to focus on five fundamental areas — the future of food, better healthcare, improving education, shaping a sustainable lifestyle and fostering trust in the media and financial institutions.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, 2050 has a lot of time to think about these issues. The firm is willing to invest over the long haul. But if an entrepreneur wants to sell their company, that’s OK too. The idea is that there shouldn’t be any time frame pressure.</p>
<p>With traditional VC firms, limited partners invest in a fund and expects returns 10 years later. That’s why most VC funds have to sell their positions within eight to 10 years. It could lead to some pressure to go public, get acquired or find other investors to buy back previous investors.</p>
<p>So how do you remove short-term financial pressure from investment firms? 2050 is a <em>fonds de pérennité</em>, which works a bit like a trust fund, a mission-driven fund.</p>
<p>As an evergreen fund, investors in 2050 can invest whenever they want. Regularly, 2050 will open up liquidity distribution windows. It means that existing investors will be able to sell their positions in 2050. New investors will purchase those positions.</p>
<p>“What we’re doing is quite innovative, so we’re learning by doing,” Ekeland said. 2050 is still expecting regulatory approvals from France’s financial regulator AMF. In the meantime, 2050 has already participated in Withings’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/withings-raises-60-million-to-bridge-the-gap-between-consumer-tech-and-healthcare-providers/">latest funding round</a>. Along with Ekeland, Anne-Lise Bance, Aicha Ben Dhia, Charly Berthet, Meyha Camara and Aude Duprat have already joined the team.</p>
<p>2050 also plans to dedicate 10% of investments in the fund and 50% of the team’s carried interest for digital commons. Arguably, this is the most interesting part of 2050. It proves that the team is committed to its vision beyond blog posts.</p>
<p>For instance, 2050 will contribute to Université Paris Dauphine’s class on the ecological challenges of the 21st century. The idea is to share that class as broadly as possible under an open license.</p>
<p>Some key concepts will be turned into actionable items for entrepreneurs. If you browse the business book section of your local bookshop, chances are you’ll see a ton of books about building a startup, growing as fast as possible and not paying attention to structural damage.</p>
<p>By investing in (often underfunded) knowledge, 2050 could share a different kind of actionable items with its portfolio companies and the tech ecosystem at large. Other investments in commons could include infrastructure investments that help everyone, or mutualized research.</p>
<p>Tech isn’t just about building companies. Public institutions, individuals and nonprofit organizations also have a say in the tech ecosystem. And I’m glad to see that 2050 understands that tech investment isn’t just about financing private companies. It’s such an important shift and I hope other investors will follow suit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/help-us-shape-our-new-approach-to-verification.html">announced</a> today it&#8217;s planning to relaunch its verification system in 2021, and will now begin the process of soliciting public feedback on the new policy ahead of its implementation. Under the <a href="https://help.twitter.com/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">policy</a>, Twitter will initially verify six types of accounts, including those belonging to government officials; companies, brands and nonprofit organizations; news; entertainment; sports; and activists, organizers and other influential individuals. The number of categories could expand in time.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s verification system, which provides a blue checkmark to designate accounts belonging to public figures, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/twitter-pauses-account-verifications-after-critics-slam-it-for-verifying-charlottesville-rally-organizer/">paused in 2017</a> as the company tried to address confusion over what it meant to be verified.</p>
<p>The issue at the time was that Twitter had <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-verifies-charlottesville-rally-boss-jason-kessler-who-called-slain-protesters-death-payback-time">verified</a> the account belonging to Jason Keller, the person who organized the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In response to the wave of criticism directed at Twitter as a result of this action, the company defended its decision by <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/11/08/twitter-verification-white-supremacist/#eCGh60lIgkq1">pointing</a> to its <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/119135">policies</a> around account verification, which explained its blue badges were awarded to accounts of &#8220;public interest.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Critics argued that genuinely noteworthy figures were still <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/09/01/instagram-verification-paid-black-market-facebook/#VryfaE1nHqqL">struggling</a> to get their own accounts verified, and that verifying a known white supremacist was not something that should ever be in the &#8220;public interest.&#8221; As a result, Twitter in November 2017 decided to pause all account verifications.</p>
<p>The following year, the company announced work on the verification system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/twitter-is-holding-off-on-fixing-verification-policy-to-focus-on-election-integrity/">would be placed on a longer, more indefinite hold</a>, so Twitter could direct its resources to focus on election integrity. That proved to be a significant undertaking, as it turned out.</p>
<p>Though the company this year <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1241155701822476288?s=20">verified medical experts</a> tweeting about COVID-19 and <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterGov/status/1205171312152514562?s=20">labeled candidates</a> running for public office, these efforts were managed in more of a one-off fashion.</p>
<p>Now, with the 2020 U.S. presidential election having wrapped, and with a transition <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/us/politics/trump-transition-biden.html">underway</a>, Twitter says work on its new verification system will finally resume.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WZex9EEVYO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/biden-harris-finally-get-their-transition-gov-domain/">Biden-Harris team finally get their transition .gov domain</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The company today shared a <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">draft</a> of its new verification policy in order to gain public feedback. The policy details more specifically which accounts can be verified and introduces additional guidelines that could limit some accounts from receiving the blue badge.</p>
<p>For example, Twitter says the account must be &#8220;notable and active,&#8221; and the badge won&#8217;t be awarded to any accounts with incomplete profiles. Twitter will also deny or remove verification badges from otherwise qualified individuals if their accounts are found to be in repeated violation of the Twitter Rules.</p>
<p>The company additionally admitted it had verified accounts over the years which should not be, as based on these guidelines. To correct this, Twitter will begin to automatically remove badges from accounts that are inactive or have incomplete profiles, to help it streamline its work going forward.</p>
<p>The policy also lays out specifics about how it will determine whether an account in a supported category will qualify.</p>
<p>For example, news organizations will have to adhere to professional standards for journalism, and independent or freelance journalists will need to provide at least three bylines in qualifying organizations published in the last six months. Entertainers will need to be able to point to credits on their IMDb page or to references in verified news publications. Government officials will need to show a public reference on an official government website, party website or multiple references by news media. Sports figures will have to appear on team websites, rosters or in sports data services like Sportradar. There are a few other ways to be verified in these categories, too.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter prioritizes blue-check verifications to confirm experts on COVID-19 and the novel coronavirus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/21/twitter-prioritizes-blue-check-verifications-to-confirm-experts-on-covid-19-and-the-novel-coronavirus/embed/#?secret=m0kQ7QE89y" data-secret="m0kQ7QE89y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The guidelines for public figures are more detailed, as they must meet two different criteria for &#8220;notability&#8221; &#8212; one that quantifies their Twitter activity and another that highlights their off-Twitter notability, like a Wikipedia page, Google Trends profile, profile on an official advocacy site and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know we can’t solve verification with a new policy alone &#8212; and that this initial policy won’t cover every case for being verified &#8212; but it is a critical first step in helping us provide more transparency and fairer standards for verification on Twitter as we reprioritize this work,&#8221; a company announcement stated. &#8220;This version of the policy is a starting point, and we intend to expand the categories and criteria for verification significantly over the next year,&#8221; it noted.</p>
<p>Twitter users will be able to offer feedback on the new verification policy starting today, November 24, 2020, and continuing through December 8, 2020. The policy is being made available in English, Hindi, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese. Users can either respond to the survey Twitter has posted or they can choose to tweet their feedback publicly, using the hashtag #VerificationFeedback.</p>
<p>In addition, Twitter says it&#8217;s working with local non-governmental organizations and its <a href="https://about.twitter.com/en_us/safety/trust-and-safety-council.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://about.twitter.com/en_us/safety/trust-and-safety-council.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606271381295000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0HcXdcHb8SG-j-HTjLPmjn">Trust and Safety Council </a>to gain a range of other perspectives.</p>
<p>After December 8, 2020, Twitter will train its team on the new policy and introduce the final version by Decemeber 17, 2020. The verification system itself, which will include a new public application process, will begin in early 2021.</p>
<p>Though Twitter is giving itself time to make policy changes based on public feedback, it had already begun to develop the underlying technology for the verification application process.</p>

The feature had been found buried in the app&#8217;s code by reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1269586202606235648?s=20">Jane Manchun Wong</a>, who tweeted a screenshot of a new option, &#8220;Request Verification,&#8221; that appeared under Twitter&#8217;s account settings. At the time, Twitter wouldn&#8217;t confirm when the new system would go live.</p>
<p>Though not everyone will qualify for verification, Twitter says it&#8217;s working on other features that will help to better distinguish accounts on its platform. Also in 2021, the company will introduce new account types and labels that will help Twitter users identify themselves on their profiles. More details on these features will be announced in the weeks to come, Twitter says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Udemy, an online learning marketplace, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/filing-online-learning-marketplace-udemy-is-raising-up-to-100m-at-a-3-32b-valuation/">raised $50 million at a $3.32 billion valuation</a>, up from a $2 billion valuation earlier this year. Language learning app Duolingo raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/language-learning-app-duolingo-confirms-it-has-raised-35m-on-a-2-4b-valuation/">$35 million on a $2.4 billion valuation</a>, up from a $1.65 valuation from earlier this year.</p>
<p>The valuation bumps for both Duolingo and Udemy underscore just how much investor confidence there is in edtech’s remote learning boom. Today, let’s examine some lessons early-stage startups can learn from late-stage edtech.</p>
<h2><strong>Content is no longer king</strong></h2>
<p>Edtech startups that have figured out how to convey information while engaging users have  a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/booming-edtech-ma-activity-brings-consolidation-to-a-fragmented-sector/">competitive advantage</a> but, as the information economy booms, content is growing more and more commoditized. It’s an age-old question: Why would someone pay for information they could get for free on YouTube?</p>
<p>The solution for edtech businesses seeking growth is to make its content free and then charge for more specialized services. In Duolingo’s case, CEO Luis von Ahn says consumers are drawn to its freemium business model.</p>
<p>More than 97% of Duolingo users take lessons for free, but the remaining 3% account for nearly $180 million in bookings, a metric the company uses as a proxy for revenue. The company is “more than breaking even,” according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/duolingo-ceo-explains-language-apps-surge-in-bookings/?tpcc=ECTW2020">von Ahn</a>.</p>
<p>Duolingo Plus, its paid product, is ad-free, offers offline access and more comprehensive tracking metrics. However, it&#8217;s not a world of a difference from the Duolingo free product &#8212; and that’s part of the point. Free users have saved the company paid acquisition, and widespread usage gives Duolingo insights on what they need to do on a week-by-week basis.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued rules that would allow public and private companies to offer equity compensation to gig workers.</p>
<p>The rule-making comes just weeks after California voters <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">upheld an initiative that overturned legislation that would have classified gig workers as employees</a>. The initiative replaced employment status with requirements that gig economy companies include an earnings guarantee<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> of at least 120% of minimum wage while on the job, 30 cents per engaged miles for expenses, a healthcare stipend, occupational accident insurance for on-the-job injuries, protection against discrimination and sexual harassment and automobile accident and liability insurance, as TechCrunch reported. The earnings guarantees and reimbursement for expenses reflects a driver’s engaged time, not for the time spent between rides or deliveries.</span></p>
<p>Now the Securities and Exchange Commission is adding another potential perk, enabling companies to issue stock to gig employees as a form of compensation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fzOVSjGprg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">After Prop 22&#8217;s passage, Uber is taking its lobbying effort global</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After Prop 22&#8217;s passage, Uber is taking its lobbying effort global&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/embed/#?secret=fzOVSjGprg" data-secret="fzOVSjGprg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;As our economy and work arrangements evolve, we must be willing to experiment with concomitant changes to our regulations,&#8221; commissioners Elad Roisman and Hester Peirce wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>The proposed rules expand stock compensation for gig-workers for a five-year time period. During that time, stock issuers will give information to the Commission to assess the utility of the rules.</p>
<p>Those SEC guidelines also include certain protections to ensure that stocks issued to gig workers are compensation and not confused with fundraising.</p>
<p>These new rules are open to comment from platform workers, the SEC said.</p>
<p>Under the proposed guidelines, gig workers that provide services through a marketplace are eligible for stock compensation, not any consumers of those services. The commission is considering whether workers that sell goods could participate in the stock compensation program as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gig economy is here to stay. We are proposing to tweak one discrete area of our securities laws to allow the many Americans who engage in gig work because it provides a much-needed source of current income also build longer-term investments,&#8221; the commissioners wrote in their statement. &#8220;As our nation’s economy heals from the pandemic, many under- or un-employed individuals will be attracted to the flexibility and income opportunities that gig work can offer.  We view today’s proposal as a way to improve benefits for these important workers and to introduce them to the powerful role that our capital markets can play in building a nest egg for retirement and for passing along to the next generation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trump&#8217;s election denialism saw him retaliate in a way that isn&#8217;t just putting the remainder of his presidency in jeopardy, it&#8217;s already putting the next administration in harm&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>In a stunning display of retaliation, Trump fired <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cisa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cisa">CISA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> director Chris Krebs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trump-fires-us-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs-for-debunking-false-election-claims/">last week</a> after declaring that there was &#8220;no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election">a direct contradiction</a> to the conspiracy-fueled fever dreams of the president who repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that the election had been hijacked by the Democrats. CISA is left distracted by disarray, with multiple senior leaders leaving their posts — some walked, some <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/bryan-ware-cisa-dhs-resignation/">were pushed</a> — only for the next likely chief to stumble before he even starts <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/sean-plankey-cisa-white-house-security-clearance/">because of concerns</a> with his security clearance.</p>
<p>Until yesterday, Biden&#8217;s presidential transition team was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-team-lacks-full-u-s-cybersecurity-support-in-transition-fracas-11605891470">stuck in cybersecurity purgatory</a> because the incumbent administration refused to trigger the law that grants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">the incoming team</a> access to government resources, including cybersecurity protections. That&#8217;s left the incoming president <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/google-china-iran-trump-biden/">exposed to ongoing cyber threats</a>, all while being shut out from classified briefings that describe those threats in detail.</p>
<p>As Biden <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">builds his team</a>, Silicon Valley is also gearing up for a change in government — and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/07/jeff-bezos-bill-gates-and-other-tech-luminaries-react-to-biden-win.html">temperament</a>. But don&#8217;t expect too much of the backlash to change. Much of the antitrust allegations, privacy violations and net neutrality remain hot button issues, and the tech titans resorting to <a href="https://t.co/gNTIIWvJwY">cheap &#8220;charm offenses&#8221;</a> are likely to face the music under the Biden administration — whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more from the week.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-big-picture">THE BIG PICTURE</h2>
<h3 id="apple-and-facebook-spar-over-privacy-again">Apple and Facebook spar over privacy — again</h3>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Facebook are back in the ring, fighting over which company is a bigger existential threat to privacy. In <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/apple-apps-advertising-privacy-facebook/">a letter</a> to a privacy rights group, Apple said its new anti-tracking feature will launch next year, which will give users the choice of blocking in-app tracking, a move that&#8217;s largely expected to cause havoc to the online advertising industry and data brokers.</p>
<p>Given an explicit option between being tracked and not, as the feature will do, most are expected to decline.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s letter specifically called out Facebook for showing a &#8220;disregard for user privacy.&#8221; Facebook, which made more than 98% of its global revenue last year from advertising, took its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/20/apple-accuses-facebook-of-disregard-for-user-privacy">own potshot back</a> at Apple, claiming the iPhone maker was &#8220;using their dominant market position to self-preference their own data collection, while making it nearly impossible for their competitors to use the same data.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, BuzzFeed announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/buzzfeed-acquires-huffpost/">it was acquiring HuffPost</a> as part of a broader deal with Verizon Media (which also owns TechCrunch).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fortnite’s free to play model has no doubt been a big driver in the battle royale title’s stratospheric success. Epic clearly hasn’t had much issue monetizing the game. While revenue slipped last year, it still managed to pull in a massive windfall of $1.8 billion (down from an even more staggering $2.4 billion).</p>
<p>The company has had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/epic-games-the-creator-of-fortnite-raises-1-25-billion/">no shortage of investments</a>, though it could always use some extra cash for&#8230;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/epic-games-founder-tim-sweeney-likens-fight-against-apple-to-fight-for-civil-rights/">reasons</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the publisher announced a new model designed to deliver reoccurring payments, in addition to its standard micro transactions — offering up a discount on some of its virtual wares in the process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The $11.99 monthly Fortnite Crew fee entitles players to a full season battle pass, 1,000 monthly bucks and a Crew Pack featuring an exclusive outfit bundle. The monthly fee adds up — as monthly fees do. It’s certainly significantly pricier than just going in for the standard battle pass, which runs a couple of bucks less and generally lasts a few months or so. Ditto for a 1,000 V-Bucks, which run around $8.</p>
<p>The plan will launch December 2, along Chapter 2, Season 5 of the game. The first pack includes a Galaxia outfit. It’s a space-themed suit that also includes a unicorn-head pickaxe. Content from popular properties like the Star Wars series &#8220;The Mandalorian&#8221; may also be on the horizon, as well. Certainly exclusive access to well-known IP would go a ways toward sweetening the appeal of yet another monthly subscription.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Surging <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> shares have pushed the company&#8217;s market capitalization to more than $515 billion, a fivefold increase since the start of the year.</p>
<p>The traditionally volatile stock has continued to experience price swings. But since reaching a low for the year in March, Tesla&#8217;s share price has been on an upwards trajectory that accelerated in August. Tesla&#8217;s share price, which rose 4.6% in morning trading to $545.62, has helped blast its CEO Elon Musk into the upper stratosphere of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=AwwRcx4b">Bloomberg&#8217;s Billionaire Index</a>. As of Tuesday, Musk&#8217;s net worth had risen $7.24 billion to more than $128 billion. Only Amazon&#8217;s Jeff Bezos stands in his way to becoming the world&#8217;s wealthiest person.</p>
<p>Tesla shares have been fueled over the past week by news that it will be added to the S&amp;P 500 index in December. Since Friday, the company has added more than $52 billion to its market cap — the equivalent of adding nearly one and a half Ford Motor Co., to its valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices announced November 16 that Tesla will officially join the benchmark index prior to trading December 21, putting the electric automaker in the same company as heavyweights like Apple, Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft.</p>
<p>When Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500, it will be among the most valuable companies on the benchmark. Its weighting will be so influential that the S&amp;P DJI is mulling whether to add the stock at the full float-adjusted market capitalization weight all at once or in two tranches.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s addition to the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t just a symbolic nod. Joining the S&amp;P 500 has real financial benefits, as investors that have index-tracked funds will be forced to buy shares. With share prices already popping, that will mean investors will have to sell other stocks to make room for Tesla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With $90 million in deposits and $18.25 million in new financing, <a href="https://www.hmbradley.com/">HMBradley</a> is making moves as the Los Angeles-based entrant into the challenger bank competition.</p>
<p>LA is home to a growing community of financial services startups and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hmbradley" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hmbradley">HMBradley <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is quickly taking its place among the leaders with a novel twist on the banking business.</p>
<p>Unlike most banking startups that woo customers with easy credit and savvy online user interfaces, HMBradley is pitching a better savings account.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company offers up to 3% interest on its savings accounts, much higher than most banks these days, and it&#8217;s that pitch that has won over consumers and investors alike, according to the company&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach Bruhnke. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With climbing numbers on the back of limited marketing, Bruhnke said raising the company&#8217;s latest round of financing was a breeze. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;They knew after the first call that they wanted to do it,&#8221; Brunke said of the negotiations with the venture capital firm Acrew, a venture firm whose previous exposure to fintech companies included backing the challenger bank phenomenon which is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chime-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chime-2">Chime <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. &#8220;It was a very different kind of fundraise for us. Our seed round was a terrible, treacherous 16-month fundraise,&#8221; Brunke said.</p>
<p>For Acrew&#8217;s part, the company actually had to call <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chime-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chime-2">Chime&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder to ensure that the company was okay with the venture firm backing another entrant into the banking business. Once the approval was granted, Brunke said the deal was smooth sailing.</p>
<p>Acrew, Chime, and HMBradley&#8217;s founders see enough daylight between the two business models that investing in one wouldn&#8217;t be a conflict of interest with the other. And there&#8217;s plenty of space for new entrants in the banking business, Bruhnke said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very, very large industry as a whole,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As the company grows its deposits, Bruhnke said there will be several ways it can leverage its capital. That includes commercial lending on the back end of HMBradley&#8217;s deposits and other financial services offerings to grow its base.</p>
<p>For now, it&#8217;s been wooing consumers with one click credit applications and the high interest rates it offers to its various tiers of savers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When customers hit that 3% tier they get really excited,&#8221; Bruhnke said. &#8220;If you’re saving money and you’re not saving to HMBradley then you’re losing money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money that HMBradley raised will be used to continue rolling out its new credit product and hiring staff. It already poached the former director of engineering at Capital One, Ben Coffman, and fintech thought leader Saira Rahman, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, the company said, deposits doubled month-over-month and transaction volume has grown to over $110 million since it launched in April. </span></p>
<p>Since launching the company&#8217;s cash back credit card in July, HMBradley has been able to pitch customers on 3% cash back for its highest tier of savers &#8212; giving them the option to earn 3.5% on their deposits.</p>
<p>The deposit and lending capabilities the company offers are possible because of its partnership with the California-based <a href="http://hmb.to/hatch">Hatch Bank</a>, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australia&#8217;s intelligence agencies have been caught &#8220;incidentally&#8221; collecting data from the country&#8217;s COVIDSafe contact tracing app during the first six months of its launch, a government watchdog has found.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20416358-report-to-oaic-may-nov-2020-covidsafe-app#document/p2/a2005851">published Monday</a> by the Australian government&#8217;s inspector general for the intelligence community, which oversees the government&#8217;s spy and eavesdropping agencies, said the app data was scooped up &#8220;in the course of the lawful collection of other data.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the watchdog said that there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221; that any agency &#8220;decrypted, accessed or used any COVID app data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidental collection is a common term used by spies to describe the data that was not deliberately targeted but collected as part of a wider collection effort. This kind of collection isn&#8217;t accidental, but more of a consequence of when spy agencies tap into fiber optic cables, for example, which carries an enormous firehose of data. An Australian government spokesperson told one outlet, which <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/covidsafe-data-incidentally-collected-by-intelligence-agencies-in-first-six-months-558129">first reported the news</a>, that incidental collection can also happen as a result of the &#8220;execution of warrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report did not say when the incidental collection stopped, but noted that the agencies were &#8220;taking active steps to ensure compliance&#8221; with the law, and that the data would be &#8220;deleted as soon as practicable,&#8221; without setting a firm date.</p>
<p>For some, fears that a government spy agency <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/nso-group-fleming-contact-tracing/">could access COVID-19 contact tracing data</a> was the worst possible outcome.</p>
<p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries — and states in places like the U.S. — have rushed to build contact tracing apps to help prevent the spread of the virus. But these apps vary wildly in terms of functionality and privacy.</p>
<p>Most have adopted the more privacy-friendly approach of using Bluetooth to trace people with the virus that you may have come into contact with. Many have chosen to implement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/apple-google-coronavirus-tracing/">the Apple-Google system</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/academics-contact-tracing/">hundreds of academics have backed</a>. But others, like Israel and Pakistan, are using more privacy invasive techniques, like <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/07/pakistan-isi-terrorism-surveillance-coronavirus.html">tracking location data</a>, which governments can also use to monitor a person&#8217;s whereabouts. In Israel&#8217;s case, the tracking was so controversial that the courts <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-halts-controversial-coronavirus-surveillance-11591734875">shut it down</a>.</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s intelligence watchdog did not say specifically what data was collected by the spy agencies. The app uses Bluetooth and not location data, but the app requires the user to upload some personal information — like their name, age, postal code, and phone number — to allow the government&#8217;s health department <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app">to contact</a> those who may have come into contact with an infected person.</p>
<p>Australia has seen more than 27,800 confirmed coronavirus cases and over 900 deaths since the start of the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://proxyclick.com">Proxyclick</a> began life by providing an easy way to manage visitors in your building with an iPad-based check-in system. As the pandemic has taken hold, however, customer requirements have changed, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/proxyclick" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="proxyclick">Proxyclick <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is changing with them. Today the company announced Proxyclick Flow, a new system designed to check in employees during the time of COVID.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically when COVID hit our customers told us that actually our employees are the new visitors. So what you used to ask your visitors, you are now asking your employees &#8212; the usual probing question, but also when are you coming and so forth. So we evolved the offering into a wider platform,&#8221; Proxyclick co-founder and CEO Gregory Blondeau explained.</p>
<p>That means instead of managing a steady flow of visitors &#8212; although it can still do that &#8212; the company is focusing on the needs of customers who want to open their offices on a limited basis during the pandemic, based on local regulations. To help adapt the platform for this purpose, the company developed the Proovr smartphone app, which employees can use to check in prior to going to the office, complete a health checklist, see who else will be in the office and make sure the building isn&#8217;t over capacity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bBC8XgJrUo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/proxyclick-raises-15m-series-b-for-its-visitor-management-platform/">Proxyclick raises $15M Series B for its visitor management platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Proxyclick raises $15M Series B for its visitor management platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/proxyclick-raises-15m-series-b-for-its-visitor-management-platform/embed/#?secret=bBC8XgJrUo" data-secret="bBC8XgJrUo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When the employee arrives at the office, they get a temperature check, and then can use the QR code issued by the Proovr app to enter the building via Proxyclick&#8217;s check-in system or whatever system they have in place. Beyond the mobile app, the company has designed the system to work with a number of adjacent building management and security systems so that customers can use it in conjunction with existing tooling.</p>
<p>They also beefed up the workflow engine that companies can adapt based on their own unique entrance and exit requirements. The COVID workflow is simply one of those workflows, but Blondeau recognizes not everyone will want to use the exact one they have provided out of the box, so they designed a flexible system.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the challenge was technical on one side to integrate all the systems, and afterwards to group workflows on the employee&#8217;s smartphone, so that each organization can define its own workflow and present it on the smartphone,&#8221; Blondeau said.</p>
<p>Once in the building, the systems registers your presence and the information remains on the system for two weeks for contact tracing purposes should there be an exposure to COVID. You check out when you leave the building, but if you forget, it automatically checks you out at midnight.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2010 and has raised $19.6 million. The most recent raise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/proxyclick-raises-15m-series-b-for-its-visitor-management-platform/">was a $18.5 million Series B</a> in January.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. challenger bank <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/current-6" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="current-6">Current, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which has doubled its member base in less than six months, <a href="https://current.com/blog/current-announces-131-million-in-series-c-funding-surpasses-2-million-members/">announced</a> this morning it raised $131 million in Series C funding, led by Tiger Global Management. The additional financing brings Current to over $180 million in total funding to date, and gives the company a valuation of $750 million.</p>
<p>The round also brought in new investors, Sapphire Ventures and Avenir. Existing investors returned for the Series C, as well, including Foundation Capital, Wellington Management Company and QED.</p>
<p>Current had originally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/current-launches-a-visa-debit-card-for-kids-that-parents-control-with-an-app/">began</a> as a teen debit card controlled by parents, but expanded to offer personal checking accounts last year, using the same underlying banking technology. The service today competes with a range of mobile banking apps, offering features like free overdrafts, no minimum balance requirements, faster direct deposits, instant spending notifications, banking insights, check deposits using your phone&#8217;s camera, and other now-standard baseline features for challenger banks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In August 2020, Current <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/mobile-bank-current-launches-a-points-rewards-program-for-debit-card-users/">debuted a points rewards program</a> in an effort to better differentiate its service from the competition, which as of this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/google-pay-gets-a-major-redesign/">now includes Google Pay. </a></p>
<p>When Current <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/mobile-banking-app-current-raises-20m-series-b-tops-half-a-million-users/">raised its Series B last fall</a>, it had over 500,000 accounts on its service. Today, it touts over 2 million members. Revenue has also grown, increasing by 500% year-over-year, the company noted today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen a demonstrated need for access to affordable banking with a best-in-class mobile solution that Current is uniquely suited to provide,&#8221; said Current founder and CEO Stuart Sopp, in a statement about the fundraise. &#8220;We are committed to building products specifically to improve the financial outcomes of the millions of hard-working Americans who live paycheck to paycheck, and whose needs are not being properly served by traditional banks. With this new round of funding we will continue to expand on our mission, growth and innovation to find more ways to get members their money faster, help them spend it smarter and help close the financial inequality gap,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The additional funds will be used to further develop and expand Current&#8217;s mobile banking offerings, the company says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Time flies.</p>

There were even more names: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/as-5-more-startups-join-the-100m-club-are-we-just-making-a-pre-ipo-list/">Movable Ink, Noom, Riskified, Seismic, ThoughtSpot,</a> along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/as-q3-kicks-off-four-more-companies-join-the-100m-arr-club/">Snow Software, A Cloud Guru, Zeta Global and Upgrade</a>.</p>
<p>Today we have three more names to add to the group: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/usertesting-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="usertesting-com">UserTesting, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/udemy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="udemy">Udemy&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> business arm and Expensify. But, more than merely adding those companies to the mix &#8212; more after the jump &#8212; I wanted to shake up our radar a bit as we head into 2021.</p>
<p>Yes, The Exchange will keep tabs on startups and other private companies that reach $100 million in ARR, or annual run rate, as the case may be. But next year we <em>also</em> want to find the startups around $50 million ARR that are growing like hell. We want to go a year or two earlier in growth histories to better watch how startups scale <em>into</em> nine-figure revenues, instead of hearing about it after the fact.</p>
<p>So, if you are a startup that is expanding aggressively and will reach the $50 million revenue mark inside the next quarter or two, <a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com">please say hello</a>. I suspect a good cut of the global unicorn market could fit this bill, and therefore might provide a window into which highly valued startups are growing into their valuations.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>It&#8217;s going to be fun. Now, let&#8217;s quickly chat about the latest members of the $100 million ARR club.</p>
<h2>UserTesting, Expensify and Udemy&#8217;s business arm</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard of each of our $100 million ARR companies this morning, so there&#8217;s less need for prelude and introduction. Here&#8217;s the group:</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.expensify.com/">Expensify</a></strong></h3>
<p>Expensify is an expense-tracking company well-known around the technology world, so it&#8217;s no real surprise that it <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005455/en/Expensify-Surpasses-100-Million-Annual-Recurring-Revenue">has reached</a> the $100 million ARR threshold, a feat it announced yesterday.</p>
<p>But the company did us one better than merely dropping a single data point and racing back into the shadows. Instead, Expensify also disclosed that it has &#8220;maintained profitability for years [and] recorded its highest monthly revenue ever in October.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://f3.cool">F3</a>, an anonymous Q&amp;A app targeting Gen Z teens which blends a Tinder-style swipe-to-friend gamification mechanic, Stories-esque rich media responses and eye-wateringly expensive subscriptions to unlock a &#8216;Plus&#8217; version that actually lets you see who wants to friend you &#8212; has raised a $3.9M seed round, including for a planned push on the US market.</p>
<p>The Latvian team behind F3 are not new to the viral teen app game having founded the anonymous teen Q&amp;A app Ask.fm &#8212; which faced huge controversy back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/19/ask-fm-safety-policy/">2013</a> over bullying and safety concerns after being linked to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/12/in-wake-of-teen-suicides-ask-fm-faces-a-myspace-problem/?_ga=2.51446573.582495266.1606121626-1757155993.1533833482">number of suicides of users</a> who&#8217;d received abusive messages. Not that they&#8217;ve let that put them off the viral teen app space, clearly.</p>
<p>Investors in F3&#8217;s seed round hail from the Russian dating network Mamba (including the latter&#8217;s investor, Mail.ru Group) and a co-investor VC firm with a marketing focus, called <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ad-ru">AdFirst</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alex Hofmann (former <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/musically-tiktok/">musical.ly</a> president) and Marat Kichikov (GP at Bitfury Capital) are also named as being among those joining the round as angel investors.</p>
<p>F3, which launched its apps in 2018, has 25M registered users at this point &#8212; 85% of whom are younger than 25.</p>
<p>The typical user is a (bored) teenager, with the user base being reported as 65% female and 60% Europe / 20% LatAm / 20% Rest of World at this point. (They&#8217;re not breaking out any active user metrics but claim 80% of users have been on the app for more than three months at this point.)</p>
<p>On the safety front, F3 is using both automated tools and people for content moderation &#8212; with the founders claiming to have learnt lessons from their past experience with Ask.fm (which got acquired by IAC&#8217;s Ask.com back in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/askcom-acquires-largest-global-qa-social-network-askfm-271234091.html">2014</a>, given them the funds to plough into F3&#8217;s development up to now).</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been solving problem of violating content in our previous company (Ask.fm), and now at F3 we&#8217;ve used all our knowledge of solving this problem from day one. Automation tools include text analysis in all major languages with database of 250k+ patterns that is continuously being improved, and AI based image recognition algorithms for detecting violating content in photos and videos,&#8221; says the founding team &#8212; which includes CEO Ilja Terebin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our 24/7 content moderation team (8 in-house safety experts and 30+ outsourced contractors) manually reviews user reports and items flagged by automation tools,&#8221; they add.</p>
<p>However reviews of the app that we saw included complaints from users who said they&#8217;ve being pestered by &#8216;pedophiles&#8217; asking for nudes &#8212; so claims of safety risks being &#8220;solved&#8221; seem riskily overblown.</p>
<p>Why do teens need yet another social discovery/messaging app? On that Terebin &amp; team say the app has been tailored for Gen Z from the get-go &#8212; &#8220;focusing on their needs to socialize and make new friends online, &#8216;quick&#8217; content in the form of photos and short videos, which is true and personal&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raw &amp; real&#8221; is another of their teen-friendly product market fit claims.</p>
<p>F3 users get a personalized URL that they can share to other social networks to solicit questions from their friends &#8212; which can be asked anonymously or not. (F3 users can also choose not to accept anonymous questions if they prefer.)</p>
<p>Instead of plain text answers users snap a photo or grab a short video, add filters, fancy fonts and backgrounds, and so on to reply in a rich-media Stories-style that&#8217;s infiltrated all social networking apps (most recently infecting Twitter, where it&#8217;s called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/twitter-starts-testing-its-own-version-of-stories-called-fleets-which-disappear-after-24-hours/">Fleets</a>).</p>
<p>These rich media responses get made public on their feed &#8212; so if an F3 user chooses to answer a question they&#8217;re also engaging with the wider community by default (though they can choose not to respond as questions remain private until responded to).</p>
<p>Asked how F3 stands out in a very packed and competitive social media landscape, they argue the app&#8217;s &#8220;uniqueness&#8221; is that the Q&amp;A is photo and video based &#8212; &#8220;so the format is familiar and close to other social networks (&#8216;stories&#8217; or &#8216;snaps&#8217;) but in a Q&amp;A style back-and-forth communication&#8221;, as they put it, adding that for their Gen Z target &#8220;the outdated text-based Q&amp;A just was too boring&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We compete for eyeballs of Gen Z with Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram. Our key strength is that through the Q&amp;A format one can make new friends and truly get to know other people on a personal level through the prism of &#8216;raw and real&#8217; content, which is not central on any of those platforms,&#8221; they also claim.</p>
<p>In terms of most similar competitors, they note <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/download-yolo-app/">Yolo</a> has seen &#8220;some traction&#8221; and concede there are a bunch of others also offering Q&amp;A. But here they argue F3 is more fully featured than rivals &#8212; suggesting the Q&amp;A feature is just the viral hook to get users into a wider community net.</p>
<p>&#8220;[F3] is a fully functional social platform, built around visual communication &#8212; users have content feed where they can view posts by people they follow, they can create photo/video content using editing tools in the app itself, there&#8217;s a messenger functionality for direct chats, follow-ships, content and user discovery. So for us, the anonymous messaging/Q&amp;A format is just an entry point which allows us to grow quickly and get the users on our platform, but then they make new connections and keep engaging with their unique social circle they have only on F3, making it a sustainable stand-alone social network.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, though, user reviews tell more of a raw (and real?) story &#8212; with plenty of complaints that there&#8217;s little value in the free version of the app (while F3 Plus costs $3.99 for 7 days; $8.99 for 1 month or $19.99 for 3 months), and questions over the authenticity of some anonymous questions, as well as complaints that other users they&#8217;re able to meet aren&#8217;t nearby and/or don&#8217;t speak the same language. Other reviews aren&#8217;t wowed by more of the  same Q&amp;A format. Others complain the app just feels like a data grab. (And the F3 &#8216;<a href="https://about.f3.cool/privacy.en_US">privacy policy</a>&#8216; definitely has a detailed story to unfold vis-a-vis the tracking users are agreeing to, for anyone who bothers to dig in and read it.)</p>
<p>&#8220;This whole app is literally just like all the other apps. Just another copy cat that you still have to pay for,&#8221; runs one review from July 2020. &#8220;Don&#8217;t download.&#8221;</p>
