										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://maya.com.bd/">Maya</a> is dedicated to making it easier for women to get healthcare, especially for sensitive issues like reproductive and mental health. Now the startup, based in Bangladesh and incorporated in Singapore, is expanding into new countries. Maya announced today it has raised $2.2 million in seed funding, which it said is the largest raised by a Bangladeshi health tech company so far. The round was led by early-stage fund Anchorless Bangladesh and The Osiris Group, a private equity firm focused on impact investing in Asian markets.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to introduce new products to Maya&#8217;s telehealth platform and on its international expansion. Maya recently launched in Sri Lanka and has started testing its service in India, Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries. It is also planning to enter Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Maya uses natural language processing and machine learning technology for its digital assistant, which answers basic health-related questions and decides if users need to be routed to human experts. It has about 10 million unique users and currently counts more than 300 licensed healthcare providers on its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Ivy Huq Russell, who grew up in Chittagong and Dhaka before moving to the United Kingdom for university, started Maya as a blog with healthcare information in 2011. At the time, Russell worked in finance. She had just given birth to her first child and her mother had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Russell told TechCrunch she realized how many challenges there were to seeking medical care in Bangladesh, including financial barriers, a shortage of providers and long travel times to clinics.</p>
<p>She began Maya with the goal of providing trustworthy health information, but quickly realized that the site&#8217;s visitors needed more support. Many sent messages through WhatsApp, email or the site&#8217;s chat box, including survivors of sexual abuse, rape and domestic violence. After receiving a grant from BRAC, a Bangladeshi non-governmental organization, Maya&#8217;s team began developing an app to connect users with medical information and experts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110583" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110583" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110583" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?w=417" alt="Bangladesh-based healthcare app Maya's homescreen" width="417" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg 1684w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=768,1253 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=941,1536 941w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=1255,2048 1255w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2110583" class="wp-caption-text">Maya&#8217;s homescreen</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We were very focused on two things,&#8221; Russell said. &#8220;One is how do we built trust in our community, in their language, because it&#8217;s very important that they communicate in the language that they&#8217;re comfortable using. At the same time, we realized as soon as we started getting hundreds and hundreds of questions, that we&#8217;re not going to be able to scale up if we just have 50 experts on computers typing.&#8221;</p>
<p>To support Bengali and regional dialects, Maya spent more than two years focused on developing its natural language processing technology. It collaborated with data scientists and linguists and took part in Google Launchpad&#8217;s accelerator program, working on tokenization and training its machine learning algorithms. Now Maya is able to provide automated answers in Bengali to basic questions in 50 topics with about 95% accuracy, Russell said. Out of the four million queries the platform has handled so far, about half were answered by its AI tech. It has also worked on NLP technology to support Urdu, Hindi and Arabic.</p>
<p>Many have to do with sexual or reproductive health and the platform has also seen an increase in questions about mental health. These are topics users are often hesitant seeking in-person consultations for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing up in Bangladesh, we got minimum sexual education. There&#8217;s no curriculum at school. Recently in the last one or two years, we&#8217;ve also started to see a lot of mental health questions, because I think we&#8217;ve made a good drive toward talking about mental health,&#8221; said Russell. She added, &#8220;it’s quite natural that whatever they couldn&#8217;t go and ask a question about very openly in traditional healthcare systems, they come and ask us.&#8221;</p>
<p>More consultations are coming from men, too, who now make up about 30% of Maya’s users. Many ask questions about birth control and family planning, or how to support their partners&#8217; medical issues. To protect users&#8217; privacy, consultations are end-to-end encrypted, and experts only see a randomly-generated ID instead of personal information.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five CEOs on their evolution in the femtech space&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/five-ceos-on-their-evolution-in-the-femtech-space/embed/#?secret=Jt5Lgdmdcs" data-secret="Jt5Lgdmdcs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In order to understand if someone needs to be routed to a human expert, Maya&#8217;s algorithms considers the length, complexity and urgency of queries, based on their tone. For example, if someone types &#8220;please, please, please help me,&#8221; they automatically get directed to a person. The majority of questions about mental health are also sent to an expert.</p>
<p>Russell said Maya&#8217;s approach is to take a holistic approach to physical health and mental wellness, instead of treating them as separate issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t just ask about physical health issues. They also ask things like, &#8216;I wear a hijab and I want to go for a run, but I feel really awkward,'&#8221; said Russell. &#8220;It sounds like a very normal question, but it&#8217;s actually quite a loaded question, because it&#8217;s affecting their mental health on a day-to-day basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the company’s goals is to make the app feel accessible, so people feel more comfortable seeking support. &#8220;We&#8217;ve literally have had sweets delivered to our office when a user has a baby,&#8221; Russell said. &#8220;These are the personal touches that I think Maya has delivered in terms of dealing with both physical as well as mental health conditions combined together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is currently working with different monetization models. One is business-to-business sales, positioning Maya as a software-as-a-service platform that employers can offer to workers as a benefit. Garment manufacturing is one of Bangladesh&#8217;s <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/987683/bangladesh-garment-share-total-exports/">biggest export sectors</a>, and many workers are young women, fitting Maya’s typical user profile. The startup has worked with Marks and Spencer, Primark and the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturer and Exporters Association (BGMEA).</p>
<p>Another B2B route is partnering with insurance providers who offer Maya as a benefit. On the direct-to-consumer side, Maya recently launched premium services, including in-app video consultations and prescription delivery. Demand increased sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it now handles about one consultation every ten seconds. Russell expects many users to continue using telehealth services even after the pandemic subsides.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve really seen the advantage of just having a doctor right in front of you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;For people with chronic conditions, it&#8217;s easier because they don&#8217;t have to go somewhere every week, and the fact they have monitoring and their history gathered is helpful for regular users, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit has raised a new funding round, totalling $250 million. This is the company&#8217;s Series E round of financing, and it comes hot on the heels of renewed public attention on the site that has dubbed itself &#8216;the front page of the Internet,&#8217; owing to the role the subreddit r/WallStreetBets played in the recent meteoric rise (and subsequent steep fall) of the value of GameStop stock. Reddit also ran a 5-second Super Bowl ad on Sunday, consisting of. a single static image that looked like a standard post on the network itself.</p>
<p>This is Reddit&#8217;s 16th year of operation, and the company has raised around $800 million to date, including a Tencent-led $300 million Series D in February, 2019. Today&#8217;s round including financing from &#8220;existing and new investors,&#8221; Reddit noted in a <a href="https://redditblog.com/2021/02/08/fueling-reddits-future/">blog post in which it announced the funding</a>. In the post, Reddit notes that the company felt &#8220;now was the right opportunity to make strategic investments in Reddit including video, advertising, consumer products and expanding into international markets.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110580" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110580" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2110580" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110580" class="wp-caption-text">Reddit&#8217;s 5-second Super Bowl ad.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how the round came together exactly, but given the network&#8217;s time in the spotlight over the past few weeks, culminating in yesterday&#8217;s very brief, but also very memorable and high-profile ad, it seems likely it was at least finalized fast in order to help the company make the most of its time in the spotlight. In terms of what kind of specific moves Reddit could make with its new cash on hand, the blog post also namecheck its acquisition late last year of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/reddit-acquires-dubsmash/">short video sharing platform Dubsmash</a>, and announced plans to double its team over the course of this year with new hires.</p>

<p>Reddit&#8217;s long history has also included some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/reddit-is-still-in-turmoil/">significant tumult</a>, and efforts to clean up its act in order to present a better face to advertisers, and to potential new community members. The network still struggles with balancing its commitments to fostering a home for a range of communities with the potential for hate speech and discrimination to take root within some of these, and it was also in the news earlier this year for finally banning controversial subreddit r/donaldtrump following &#8220;repeat´d policy violations&#8221; surrounding the attempted insurrection a the U.S. Capitol by a mob of domestic terrorists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dayna Grayson and Rachel Holt seemingly didn&#8217;t have the best timing. It was late in 2019 when the two, who met six years ago in Washington through a mutual acquaintance, decided to act on earlier conversations and start a fund together called <a href="https://constructcap.com/">Construct Capital</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Grayson spied an opportunity to create a new venture brand that focused largely on the types of <a href="https://www.desktopmetal.com/">manufacturing-related deals</a> that she was funding inside of the investing giant, NEA, which she joined in 2012.</p>
<p>Holt, who&#8217;d joined Uber in 2011, rising from a city general manager in Washington to the eventual head of the company&#8217;s mobility unit in 2018, was also ready for a change and excited about the prospect of investing full time, having been brought into NEA by Grayson to scout out nascent deals on the side.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we didn&#8217;t expect COVID,&#8221; Holt says now. Still, it didn&#8217;t stop them from moving forward with fundraising and, in the process, securing $140 million in capital commitments from what Holt describes as &#8220;the typical kind of institutional LP base, including endowments, foundations,&#8221; and also some peers, including Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures, Josh Kopelman of First Round, and Grayson&#8217;s former NEA colleague, Scott Sandell.</p>
<p>Construct, which is focused primarily on five themes &#8212;  decentralized manufacturing, supply chain visibility, automation, transportation and mobility &#8212; is already actively writing checks, in fact. Among the companies it has backed are <a href="https://chefrobotics.ai/">Chef Robotics</a>, a startup focused on assembling food at high throughput; <a href="https://www.copia.io/">Copia</a>, an outfit whose tools aim to empower engineers to streamline workflows, increase productivity, and decrease downtime; and <a href="https://www.chargelab.co/">ChargeLab</a>, a maker of electric vehicle charging software that Holt likens to the &#8220;Android of the charging market.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get a better sense of the types of startups that might be ideal for the firm going forward, we talked earlier with the pair, who recently signed a lease in the nation&#8217;s capital for their team (Construct also has <a href="https://constructcap.com/#team">two junior investors</a>), and who were together today at Holt&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>Parts of that conversation follow, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Rachel, what startups did you identify for NEA and how do they fit into your point of view as an investor?</strong></p>
<p>RH: I was always attracted to business solving real-world problems, so among the investments [I made as a scout for] NEA is an auto-refinancing company called <a href="https://www.motorefi.com/">MotoRefi</a> because that was a problem I saw firsthand, talking with Uber drivers. I&#8217;m still on the board of that company.</p>
<p>But Dayna and I have both been attracted to what we called foundational industries. I saw [opportunities] on the transportation side, on the supply chain side on the logistics side [at Uber]. When we were running Jump [as part of the mobility unit of Uber], we were building an e-bike, which is actually a pretty complicated piece of equipment to pull together, and you would see that something had left a factory in China, then you would lose track of it for five weeks, then you would see that it entered a port in the U.S., and then you would lose track of it again and I knew there had to be a better way . . . and I think COVID only highlights the urgency around some of the cracks in the system.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Right. I think we&#8217;ve all been stunned by the supply chain issues as they related to the vaccines and PPE, certainly. Are you focused on global supply chain opportunities or just domestically?</strong></p>
<p>DG: We&#8217;re primarily focused domestically. We will do investments in Canada and occasionally in Europe. We wouldn&#8217;t [invest in] Asia without some more dedicated personnel there, and that&#8217;s not in the scope right now.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;ve seen in COVID is just a huge acceleration of consumer demand, so if you&#8217;re a brand or an e-tailor and you were planning all these upgrades to meet that demand two years from now, that&#8217;s happening today, so it&#8217;s really put a crunch on the system. A company like <a href="https://www.tradeswell.com/">Tradeswell</a> &#8212; which is one of our investments &#8212; brings data visibility across the supply chain, from where sales are happening online to how they&#8217;re being fulfilled in inventory. That&#8217;s something that analysts and agencies could help you do, but when you&#8217;re looking at just the crunch of having to have that real-time urgency and information at your fingertips, you can&#8217;t wait for human intervention anymore. You have to automate.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You invested in Tradeswell&#8217;s seed round and its Series A. Will that be typical going forward? Relatedly, what size checks will you be writing and how much ownership will you be targeting when you invest in a company?</strong></p>
<p>RH: Our typical size is $2 million to $6 million checks. We like to lead those those rounds, but they can be part of a round that goes up to, say, $12 million.</p>
<p>DG: As for ownership, something reasonable is close to 15%. We&#8217;re not going to have a huge portfolio. Every company really matters to the fund. We&#8217;re not gonna have a huge portfolio. Every company really matters to the fund; every company receives dedicated time and attention from us. There isn&#8217;t a cookie cutter approach where if you work with Construct, you get X. It depends on the entrepreneur and what they need.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How important are board seats to you both?</strong></p>
<p>RH: What&#8217;s more important to us is meeting the company where they are and understanding what the entrepreneur needs and how we can add value.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re in Washington. As investors who focus on what you do, is there any special advantage to being there?</strong></p>
<p>DG: We&#8217;re investing nationally. If we find great projects here, we&#8217;d love to be involved, but of our first investments, two are in the Bay Area and two are on the East Coast.</p>
<p>RH: Dayna [had been operating remotely at times before COVID] and I was running teams in the U.S and Canada [at Uber]. We don&#8217;t have a backyard bias.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you&#8217;re likely to do more remotely, even after the world returns to normal.</strong></p>
<p>DG: I definitely think some things are here to stay, and that it&#8217;s great for founders. Their ability to engage investors over Zoom, whether they&#8217;re down the street or across the globe, is really in their interest and I&#8217;m glad to see a more efficient fundraise happen for a lot of them.</p>
<p>RH: I think for entrepreneurs, trying to find the best fit for what they are building, versus just who is the person they know because they run into them at the gym, is a big net positive [to come out of this whole thing]. It also enables them to build companies in the place where they&#8217;re best-suited to build the company, rather than indexing for where they&#8217;ll be seen from a funding perspective.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">$1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin</a> may be good for Elon Musk, but it&#8217;s definitely risky for the company that made him the world&#8217;s richest man, according to investors, analysts and money managers at some of the country&#8217;s largest banks.</p>
<p>As a standard bearer for the consumer electric vehicle industry and the broader climate tech movement rallying around it, Tesla&#8217;s bet to go all in on crypto could damage its climate bonafides and its reputation with customers even as other automakers pour in to the EV market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla buys $1.5B in bitcoin, may accept the cryptocurrency as payment in the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/embed/#?secret=XZuEkOazJH" data-secret="XZuEkOazJH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Given Bitcoin&#8217;s current environmental footprint, the deal flies in the face of Tesla&#8217;s purported interest in moving the world to cleaner sources of energy and commerce.</p>
<p>Until the energy grid decarbonizes in places like Russia and China, mining bitcoin remains a pretty dirty business (from an energy perspective), according to some energy investors who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about Musk&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were talking about people doing this in Russia back in 2018 and how they were tapping coal power to run their mining operations,&#8221; one investor said. &#8220;The cost per transaction from an energy intensity standpoint has only gotten more intense. I don’t see how those things coalesce, climate and crypto.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The stake makes Tesla one of the largest corporate hodlers of Bitcoin but represents a massive portion of the company&#8217;s $19 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the size of their treasury it feels irresponsible, IMO,&#8221; wrote one investor whose firm backed Tesla from its earliest days. The company&#8217;s move could be seen as another example of the absurdity of U.S. capital markets in today&#8217;s investment climate &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/what-are-these-rich-people-doing-pumping-crappy-assets/">and the underlying cynicism of some of its biggest beneficiaries</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aK29gDHi4B"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/what-are-these-rich-people-doing-pumping-crappy-assets/">What are these rich people doing pumping crappy assets?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What are these rich people doing pumping crappy assets?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/what-are-these-rich-people-doing-pumping-crappy-assets/embed/#?secret=aK29gDHi4B" data-secret="aK29gDHi4B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin investors welcomed the move, which sent the value of their holdings rocketing up by roughly 18% over the course of the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The announcement that Tesla has diversified its treasury through the addition of bitcoin is not surprising, nor is the assuredness implied by an 8% allocation of cash-on-hand. Equal to Tesla’s R&amp;D expenditure for 2020, this investment is significant to the Company and shows a commitment to maximizing shareholder returns,&#8221; wrote Stillmark founding partner Alyse Killeen. &#8220;Elon Musk has a long history of operating at the precipice of what’s possible technically and setting the trend of what’s to later become common operationally. I suspect the same will be true here, and that Tesla is the first of a larger cohort of publicly-traded companies that will aim to optimize the returns of their cash via bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry observers on Wall Street also criticized the company&#8217;s big bet on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tesla buying $1.5 billion in BTC is interesting. Am assuming they haven&#8217;t hedged it, so they will either be cash rich in the future or have a hole in the balance sheet. Elon Musk stays wild,&#8221; wrote one capital planning executive at a major Wall Street bank who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the press. &#8220;[It&#8217;s] not dissimilar from a large company throwing cash into a wildly volatile emerging market currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, in the short term, the deal is showing dividends. The price of Bitcoin has risen nearly $8,000, or 18.73%, over the course of the day since Tesla made its announcement.</p>
<p>But the investment represents the equivalent of the company&#8217;s entire research and development budget, as Killeen noted. That&#8217;s&#8230; something. There&#8217;s also the question is whether any regulator will step in to punish Musk.</p>
<p>Musk has been tweeting his support for Bitcoin and other, more arcane (or useless) cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin for the past several weeks, in what seems to be a violation of his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/26/elon-musk-sec-agree-to-guidelines-on-twitter-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s richest man has previously been fined by regulatory agencies for his tweeting habits. Back in 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/here-is-the-sec-complaint-against-elon-musk-and-tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SEC charged Musk with fraud for tweets</a> about privatizing the electric vehicle company at $420 per share.</p>
<div class="group">
<p>Musk eventually settled with the SEC, at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/29/elon-musk-agrees-to-resign-as-tesla-chairman-in-settlement-with-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price of his role as chairman of Tesla&#8217;s board</a> and a $20 million personal fine &#8212; with Tesla paying out another $20 million to the SEC.</p>
<p>The volatility of the cryptocurrency could impact more than just Tesla&#8217;s bottom line, but also hit its customers should they use the currency to buy cars.</p>
</div>
<p>“Bitcoin jumped over 15% to a new high of $44,000 on Monday. This sort of hype-based price power should be worrying to investors and consumers alike &#8211; especially if this is to be used as medium of exchange,&#8221; wrote GlobalData analyst Danyaal Rashid, Head of Thematic Research at GlobalData.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Elon Musk can help dictate the price of this asset with a tweet or large order, the same could happen to send the price back down. The task of purchasing a vehicle should not be speculative. Consumers who may have thought of buying bitcoin to use as a substitute for fiat – could very easily end up with more or less than they bargained for.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cynthia Perry, a former design research senior manager at Salesforce who left earlier this month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6763264995485728768/">posted her resignation letter</a> on LinkedIn that detailed her negative treatment at the company, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/salesforces-benioff-diversity-inclusion-woes">Protocol first reported</a>. In it, Perry, a Black woman, alleges she experienced &#8220;countless microaggressions and inequity&#8221; during her time there.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Perry said she left her job because she had been &#8220;Gaslit, manipulated, bullied, neglected, and mostly unsupported&#8221; by folks she chose not to name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salesforce, for me, is not a safe place to come to work,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a place where I can be my full self. It&#8217;s not a place where I have been invested in. It&#8217;s not a place full of opportunity. It&#8217;s not a place of Equality for All. It&#8217;s not a place where well-being matters.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Salesforce has long been vocal about the importance of equality. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/15/tony-prophet-named-as-salesforces-first-chief-equality-officer/">In 2016</a>, Salesforce named Tony Prophet as its first-ever chief equality officer. That came about a year after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said its major diversity focus was &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/slack-engineer-erica-baker-diversity-efforts-need-to-extend-beyond-gender/?_ga=2.41637990.573523786.1612804300-1057749772.1591641289">the women&#8217;s issue.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>Salesforce was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/unpacking-techs-response-to-george-floyds-death/">one of the many companies that came out in support of Black people</a> in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now more than ever we must support one another as allies and speak up for justice and equality,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/salesforce/status/1266066647275757568">the company said in a tweet</a>.</p>
<p>But companywide, Salesforce is just 3.4% Black in the U.S., while its leadership team is only 2.3% Black, <a href="https://equalitydata.herokuapp.com/">according to its November 2020 diversity report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;For privacy reasons, we can&#8217;t comment on individual employee matters but Equality is one of our highest values and we have been dedicated to its advancement both inside and outside of our company since we were founded almost 22 years ago,&#8221; a Salesforce spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Perry is the latest Black female tech worker to speak out about her negative experience at a tech company. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/">Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks came forward with allegations of racial and gender discrimination at Pinterest</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vaccine misinformation has been around since well before the pandemic, but ensuring that anti-scientific conspiracies don&#8217;t get boosted online is more crucial than ever as the world races against the spread of a deadly, changing virus.</p>
<p>Now, Facebook says it will expand the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims">criteria it uses to take down false vaccine claims</a>. Under the new rules, which Facebook said it made in consultation with groups like the World Health Organization, the company will remove posts claiming that COVID-19 vaccines aren&#8217;t effective, that it&#8217;s &#8220;safer to get the disease&#8221; and the widely debunked longstanding anti-vaxxer claim that vaccines could cause autism.</p>
<p>Facebook says it will place a &#8220;particular focus&#8221; on enforcement against Pages, groups and accounts that break the rules, noting that they may be removed from the platform outright.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the coming weeks we&#39;ll be making it harder to find accounts in search that discourage people from getting vaccinated on Instagram. These changes won&#39;t happen overnight, but will help keep our community safe and informed, especially as more claims around the vaccine emerge.</p>
<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f637.png" alt="😷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1358851016553332738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Facebook took steps to<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/coronavirus/#latest"> limit COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in December</a>, preparing the platform for the vaccine rollout while still lagging well behind the rampant spread of anti-vaccine claims. The company began removing posts containing some misinformation about the vaccine, including &#8220;false claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips&#8221; and content claiming that the vaccine is being tested on portions of the population without their consent.</p>
<p>Why this kind of stuff didn&#8217;t already fall under Facebook&#8217;s rules against COVID-19 misinformation is anyone&#8217;s guess. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/facebook-coronavirus-information-center-zuckerberg/">came out of the gate early</a> in the pandemic with a new set of policies intended to prevent an explosion of potentially deadly COVID-related conspiracies, but <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/covid-19-vaccines-face-varied-powerful-misinformation-movement-online-n1249378">time</a> and <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/facebook_coronavirus_vaccine_misinformation.php">time again</a> the company fails to evenly and firmly enforce its own rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Income-share agreements, or ISAs, have been gathering force as an alternative financial model for students, particularly at non-traditional schools like coding boot camps and trade schools. We’ve done <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/31/how-income-share-agreements-will-spark-the-rise-of-career-accelerators/">some pretty deep dives into the space</a> over the years in terms of how these loan products incentivize students and colleges to work together for better professional outcomes. Given their novelty though, one of the largest barriers to wide adoption remains the lack of capital for these models.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ID69aPXKTR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/31/how-income-share-agreements-will-spark-the-rise-of-career-accelerators/">How income share agreements will spark the rise of career accelerators</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That’s starting to change, and companies like <a href="https://joinblair.com">Blair</a> are leading the charge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blair told TechCrunch that it has raised $100 million in a new debt facility to fund what it is dubbing “Blair Capital” to fund ISAs at partner institutions. The money came from an undisclosed investor, which was described by Blair CEO Mike Mahlkow as an “institutional capital partner with more than $10 billion under management.”</p>
<p>My colleague Mike Butcher <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/launching-out-of-yc-blair-is-aiming-to-reshape-the-financing-of-college-tuition/">first profiled Blair when it was coming out of YC back in summer 2019</a>. When Blair first got started by co-founders Mahlkow, Constantin Schreiber and David Nordhausen, it was focused exclusively on the direct-to-consumer market for ISAs. The idea was that students would go to Blair and secure an ISA with a set amount of upfront cash to cover tuition and cost of living, and then choose a school to attend. Underwriting was based on the future income potential of the student.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="av5ZZ6C2N6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/launching-out-of-yc-blair-is-aiming-to-reshape-the-financing-of-college-tuition/">Launching out of YC, Blair is aiming to reshape the financing of college tuition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Launching out of YC, Blair is aiming to reshape the financing of college tuition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/launching-out-of-yc-blair-is-aiming-to-reshape-the-financing-of-college-tuition/embed/#?secret=av5ZZ6C2N6" data-secret="av5ZZ6C2N6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blair’s technology platform allowed it to service ISAs for students, such as collecting their payments, tracking their requirements and giving them updates on their remaining terms. But to really scale up the platform, Blair needed capital to actually underwrite ISAs and increase loan volumes on its platform.</p>
<p>So it looked to raise a debt facility — and then COVID-19 hit. “It was very, very, difficult to raise any kind of debt capital for direct-to-consumer ISAs,” Mahlkow explained in the milieu of a pandemic. But, “we got a lot of inbound demand from education institutions,” and particularly from alternative schools like coding boot camps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110445" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110445" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110445" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg 1768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=768,469 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=1536,938 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-Team-Zoom-Foto.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110445" class="wp-caption-text">Blair&#8217;s team. Photo via Blair.</p></div></p>
<p>So Blair rejiggered its platform (now dubbed Blair Servicing) away from D2C lending to being a technology servicing layer for schools offering ISAs as part of their programs. From there, it constructed Blair Capital, this new $100 million facility which can be used by its partner schools to fund their own ISA programs. That means these schools won’t have to raise their own debt capital for their ISAs if they don’t want to.</p>
<p>Unlike Blair’s original approach focused on consumers, underwriting for ISAs is now based on the quality of an individual school, and even more specifically an individual program. So rather than underwriting a person, Blair knows that certain programs have a given return profile and can underwrite terms of the ISA to fit that risk.</p>
<p>Terms can vary widely between programs. Mahlkow explained that the company more or less has merely floors and ceilings on terms but otherwise is flexible. For instance, the company won’t do income shares above 20% (and often gets queasy even going near that number), and there are repayment caps and limits on repayment time periods as well, with most ISAs it offers being between 1-2 years or a maximum of three years.</p>
<p>Alternative schools with track records of student achievement can use Blair Capital right away. For newer schools without the same operating history, Blair will help guide those schools to build the early track record they need so that the company can underwrite their ISAs in the future. Either way, all schools can use Blair Servicing to handle their loans.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110444" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110444" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110444" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="487" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,1099 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blair-KPI-Dashboard.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110444" class="wp-caption-text">The school dashboard within Blair Servicing. Photo via Blair.</p></div></p>
<p>Blair Servicing takes a percentage fee of the money that flows back from an ISA after graduation, while Blair Capital takes an origination fee plus joins in the upside of the ISA itself. The goal is to incentive-align the loans for all parties involved.</p>
<p>The company, which is based in SF, remains lean, at six employees. With $100 million capital to fund ISAs though, it hopes to have an outsized impact on this burgeoning industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Micromobility startup <a href="https://helbiz.com/">Helbiz</a>, which now operates across Europe and the USA, is merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) to become a publicly listed company, giving it a war chest to potentially roll-up smaller competitors in the space, as well as the resources to expand into &#8220;cloud&#8221; or &#8220;ghost&#8221; kitchens as part of a move into food delivery.</p>
<p>Helbiz intends to merge with GreenVision Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: GRNV) in the second quarter of 2021. The combined entity will be named Helbiz Inc. and will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the new ticker symbol, &#8220;HLBZ.&#8221;</p>
<p>The transaction includes $30 million PIPE anchored by institutional investors and approximately $80 million in net proceeds will be fed into Helbiz’s micromobility and advertising businesses, which have 2.7 million users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Helbiz says the merged entity will have a valuation of $408 million, and by run Helbiz’s existing management under CEO Salvatore Palella.</p>
<p>Palella said: “Through this transaction, we’re committed to fulfilling our vision in revolutionizing transport by using micromobility to become a seamless last-mile solution.”</p>
<p>He further revealed to me that the company plans to establish &#8220;ghost kitchens&#8221; in Milan and Washington, DC later this year, with the aim of introducing a five-minute delivery time.</p>
<p>Helbiz has tried to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/as-europe-slowly-unlocks-e-scooter-startups-like-helbiz-are-wooing-with-offers/">differentiate</a> itself from other players like Lime and Bird by offering e-scooters, e-bicycles and e-mopeds all on one platform.</p>
<p>Key to Helbiz’s offering is an integrated geofencing platform that tends to appeal to city authorities who don’t want scooters left in random places, as well as a swappable battery that enables easier charging of the devices. Its subscription service allows users to take unlimited 30-minute trips on its e-bikes and e-scooters every month.</p>

<p>In Europe the company currently operates a fleet of e-scooters and e-bicycles in Milan, Turin, Verona, Rome, Madrid and Belgrade, and in the U.S. it operates in Washington, DC, Alexandria, Arlington and Miami.</p>
<p>David Fu, chairman, and CEO of GreenVision, commented: “Helbiz has distinguished itself as the only company to offer e-scooters, e-bicycles, and e-mopeds all on one user-friendly platform… Helbiz has a proven and capital-light business model that combines hardware, software, and services with extensive customer relationships.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unless you&#8217;ve got someone&#8217;s Amazon Wish List, gift giving today can still be fairly difficult. You don&#8217;t necessarily know a friend or family member&#8217;s shipping address, their sizes or their particular tastes, at times. A new startup called <a href="https://www.ongoody.com/">Goody</a>, backed by a recent $4 million fundraise, wants to help. Through its newly launched mobile gifting app, Goody lets you celebrate your friends, family and other loved ones with a gift or, soon, even just an &#8220;IOU&#8221; that lets them know you&#8217;re thinking of them.</p>
<p>To do so, you first download the Goody mobile app for iOS or Android, then browse across the hundreds of brands and products it offers. You also can filter these by occasion, like birthdays or holidays, or by a specific need, such as gifts to say congratulations or get well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110422" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110422" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110422" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110422" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Goody</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you find a gift you like, you just enter the recipient&#8217;s phone number. Goody then sends a text that lets the recipient know that you&#8217;ve sent them something. The recipient clicks the link to accept the gift, which opens a website where they can see what you&#8217;ve selected, while also customizing any specific options &#8212; like their clothing size, color preferences or what flavor of cupcakes they&#8217;d like, for example.</p>
<p>Here, they also provide their shipping address, and the gift is sent. Afterwards, they can choose to send a thank you note, as well.</p>
<p>What makes this experience work is that &#8212; unlike some gifting startups in the past &#8212; Goody doesn&#8217;t require the recipient to download an app, nor do you need to know anything other than a phone number of the person you want to send a gift to.</p>

<p>The idea for Goody comes from co-founder and serial entrepreneur and startup investor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/edward-lando">Edward Lando,</a> whose prior company, YC-backed GovPredict, was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201102005838/en/Phone2Action-Acquires-GovPredict-to-Provide-the-Most-Comprehensive-Solution-for-Government-Affairs-and-Grassroots-Advocacy-Teams">recently acquired</a>. He was also the first investor in Misfits Market, serves on the board at Atom Finance and is a managing partner at <a href="https://www.pareto20.com/">Pareto Holdings</a>, based in Miami, where Lando now lives.</p>
<p>Joining him on Goody are Even.com tech lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktbao/">Mark Bao</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lclinden/">Lee Linden</a>, who notably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-acquires-karma/">sold his prior gifting startup Karma Gifts to Facebook</a> back in 2012.</p>
<p>Lando says he was interested in working on the idea because he loves to send gifts, but thinks there&#8217;s a lot of friction involved with the process as it stands today. Meanwhile, gifts that are easier to send, like gift cards, can lack a personal touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing for us is for Goody to feel highly personal,&#8221; Lando explains. &#8220;If someone sends you something through Goody [it should feel like], wow, they really thought about me &#8212; they picked out something for me. We don&#8217;t want it to feel like someone is just sending you a dollar value,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The mobile app launched in mid-December and now works with a couple dozen brand partners. Many of these are in the direct-to-consumer space or are otherwise emerging companies, like non-alcoholic aperitif <a href="https://drinkghia.com/">Ghia</a>, workout experience <a href="https://www.theclass.com/">The Class</a>, pet company <a href="https://fablepets.com/">Fable</a>, wellness company <a href="https://moonjuice.com/">Moon Juice,</a> <a href="https://www.raakachocolate.com/">Raaka Chocolate</a> and others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110426" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110426" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110426" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Image-from-iOS-8.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110426" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Goody</p></div></p>
<p>Goody&#8217;s model involves a revenue share with its partners, where its cut increases the more sales its makes on the partner&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>Brands are interested in working with Goody, Lando explains, because it can help them acquire new customers with little effort on their part.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so many direct-to-consumer brands these days &#8212; thousands of them &#8212; selling online &#8212; coffee, chocolate, all these cool things,&#8221; Lando says. &#8220;And for now, their only way of getting discovered is buying ads on Facebook. We&#8217;re another way for people to discover them. We&#8217;re like a giant shopping mall for people to discover these things,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The app, however, wants to be useful to those who also just want to stay in touch with friends and family. On this front, it&#8217;s rolling out free gifts this week called &#8220;IOUs,&#8221; for telling someone you&#8217;re thinking of them &#8212; for example, by saying something like &#8220;I owe you dinner next time I&#8217;m in town&#8221; or sharing some other more symbolic gift.</p>
<p>The app will also later integrate a calendar that will help you track important occasions, like birthdays and other major life events.</p>
<p>Goody was founded in March 2020 and the app launched in mid-December of the same year. So far, around 10,000 gifts have been sent using its service, Lando says.</p>
<p>In addition to the holiday season, of course, the pandemic may have played a role in Goody&#8217;s early traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the pandemic has been a big problem for everyone. And one of the things that people frankly don&#8217;t talk about enough, in my opinion, is the psychological toll the pandemic is taking on everyone&#8230;we are all creatures that enjoy social interaction. It feels good to see other people &#8212; especially the people you care about. And when you don&#8217;t, it really drains you of energy,&#8221; Lando says.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is obviously not the same as seeing people in person, but I do think that Goody is a nice injection of warmth and positivity&#8230;Everyone who uses it says they feel good after using it, which I think is rare,&#8221; Lando notes.</p>

<p>The startup, meanwhile, has raised a little more than $4 million in early funding from investors including Quiet Capital, Index Ventures, Pareto Holdings, Third Kind Venture Capital, Craft Ventures and the founders of Coinbase (Fred Ehrsam) and Quora (Charlie Cheever), among others.</p>
<p>Goody is a team of nine full-time employees, based in Miami and elsewhere, working remotely. Ahead of Valentine&#8217;s Day, the company snagged a spot on a Times Square billboard to advertise its app, in the hopes of gaining new users during one of the bigger gifting holidays of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late Friday, Oscar Health <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521030955/d28906ds1.htm">filed to go public</a>, adding another company to today&#8217;s burgeoning IPO market. The New York-based health insurance unicorn has raised well north of $1 billion during its life, making its public debut a critical event for a host of investors.</p>
<p>Oscar Health lists a placeholder raise value of $100 million in its IPO filing, providing only directional guidance that its public offering will raise nine figures of capital.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Both Oscar and the high-profile SPAC for Clover Medical will prove to be a test for the venture capital industry&#8217;s faith in their ability to disrupt traditional healthcare companies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The eight-year-old company, launched to capitalize on the sweeping health insurance reforms passed under the administration of President Barack Obama offers insurance products to individuals, families and small businesses. The company claimed 529,000 &#8220;members&#8221; as of January 31, 2021. Oscar Health touts that number as indicative of its success, with its growth since January 31 2017 &#8220;representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 59%.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, while Oscar has shown a strong ability to raise private funds and scale the revenues of its neoinsurance business, like many insurance-focused startups that TechCrunch has covered in recent years, it&#8217;s a deeply unprofitable enterprise.</p>
<h2>Inside Oscar Health</h2>
<p>To understand Oscar Health we have to dig a bit into insurance terminology, but it&#8217;ll be as painless as we can manage. So, how did the company perform in 2020? Here are its 2020 metrics, and their 2019 comps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total premiums earned:</strong> $1.67 billion (+61% from $1.04 billion).</li>
<li><strong>Premiums ceded to reinsurers:</strong> $1.22 billion (+113%, from $572.3 million).</li>
<li><strong>Net premium earned:</strong> $455 million (-3% from $468.9 million).</li>
<li><strong>Total revenue:</strong> $462.8 million (-5% from $488.2 million).</li>
<li><strong>Total insurance costs:</strong> $525.9 million (-8.7% from $576.1 million).</li>
<li><strong>Total operating expenses:</strong> $865.1 million (+16% from $747.6 million).</li>
<li><strong>Operating loss:</strong> $402.3 million (+56% from $259.4 million).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through the numbers together. Oscar Health did a great job raising its total premium volume in 2020, or, in simpler terms, it sold way more insurance last year than it did in 2019. But it also ceded a lot more premium to reinsurance companies in 2020 than it did in 2019. So what? Ceding premiums is contra-revenue, but can serve to boost overall insurance margins.</p>
<p>As we can see in the net premium earned line, Oscar&#8217;s totals fell in 2020 compared to 2019 thanks to greatly expanded premium ceding. Indeed, its total revenue fell in 2020 compared to 2019 thanks to that effort. But the premium ceding seems to be working for the company, as its total insurance costs (our addition of its claims line item and &#8220;other insurance costs&#8221; category) fell from 2020 to 2019, despite selling far more insurance last year.</p>
<p>Sadly, all that work did not mean that the company&#8217;s total operating expenses fell. They did not, rising 16% or so in 2020 compared to 2019. And as we all know, more operating costs and fewer revenues mean that operating losses rose, and they did.</p>
<p>Oscar Health&#8217;s net losses track closely to its operating losses, so we spared you more data. Now to better understand the basic economics of Oscar Health&#8217;s insurance business, let&#8217;s get our hands dirty.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Pinterest employee <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/">who alleged racial and gender discrimination</a> at the company, is co-leading new legislation with California State Senator Connie Leyva and others to empower those who experience workplace discrimination and/or harassment. Introduced today, the Silenced No More Act (SB 331) would prevent the use of non-disclosure agreements in workplace situations involving all forms of discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unacceptable for any employer to try to silence a worker because he or she was a victim of any type of harassment or discrimination—whether due to race, sexual orientation, religion, age or any other characteristic,&#8221; Leyva said in a statement. &#8220;SB 331 will empower survivors to speak out—if they so wish—so they can hold perpetrators accountable and hopefully prevent abusers from continuing to torment and abuse other workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This proposed bill would expand the current protections workers have through the Stand Together Against Non-Disclosures Act, also authored by Leyva, that went into effect in 2019. Ozoma, along with former co-worker Aerica Shimizu Banks, came forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination last year. They eventually settled with Pinterest, but the STAND Act technically only protected them for speaking out about gender discrimination. This new bill would ensure workers are also protected when speaking out about racial discrimination.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a legal gamble,&#8221; Ozoma told TechCrunch about coming forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination, despite having signed an NDA. Pinterest could&#8217;ve decided to sue both Ozoma and Banks, Ozoma said, but that would&#8217;ve required the company to admit wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically, we weren&#8217;t [supposed to talk about racial discrimination] and that&#8217;s what most companies bank on,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long road ahead for the bill, which needs to be passed by the legislature and ultimately signed into law by California Governor Gavin Newsom, but it would represent a monumental shift in the tech industry, if passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be huge and not just for tech, but for your industry as well,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;I believe that we don&#8217;t have real progress unless we approach things intersectionally and that&#8217;s the lesson from all of us.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This group of companies are what we're calling our $50 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) group, though we're not too strict on that revenue figure.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lost amongst <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">all the IPO chatter</a> of the mega-unicorns are a crop of companies reaching their stride, often flush with capital, ready with big plans, and still with some time before they go public. This group of companies are what we&#8217;re calling our $50 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) group, though we&#8217;re not too strict on that revenue figure.</p>
<p>Close enough will do.</p>
<p>A little bit ago we kicked off the series by looking at  <a href="https://www.ownbackup.com/">OwnBackup</a> and <a href="https://www.withassembly.com/">Assembly</a>. Today we&#8217;re continuing the series, digging into <a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a> and <a href="https://picsart.com/">PicsArt</a>. Next up is and <a href="https://www.synack.com/">Synack</a>, and we have an interview with <a href="https://www.kaseya.com/">Kaseya</a> on deck. The latter company is a bit oversized for our cohort, but we&#8217;ll figure out what to do with our notes from that chat in due time.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we&#8217;re looking at startups that are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/one-final-100m-arr-company-and-the-startups-we-want-to-meet-in-2021/">around the $50 million ARR mark</a> because our 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">exploration of $100 million ARR companies</a> wound up merely taking looks at companies, like Lemonade, that were going public in short order. We&#8217;ll still do the occasional piece on the group, but we&#8217;re focusing on smaller firms this year.</p>
<p>So, into the breach with notes on SimpleNexus and PicsArt, drawing on public information concerning their fundraising history and product, and interviews with both companies. Let&#8217;s see what we can learn from their growth!</p>
<h2>SimpleNexus</h2>
<p>SimpleNexus is a Utah-based technology company that provides digital mortgage software. The company most recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/simplenexus-secures-108m-to-transform-the-homeownership-journey-into-a-seamlessly-connected-experience-301200675.html">raised $108 million in January of this year</a>, a Series B that we sadly lack a valuation for.</p>
<p>The company is growing quickly, with founders Matt Hansen and Ben Miller telling TechCrunch that they expect to scale from $30 million to $58 million in the next 12 months. That puts the the company comfortably into our new group.</p>
<p>SimpleNexus&#8217;s product is sold to banks and other financial institutions, helping provide a hub &#8212; a simple nexus, if you will &#8212; providing consumers a single login to manage their home-buying process from search to purchase. The software itself is sold on a SaaS basis, often white-labeled to banks.</p>
<p>But while SimpleNexus has seen success with its current model, claiming to touch around one in every eight mortgages, its founders told TechCrunch in a video call that they have bigger aspirations. Hansen, who is also the company&#8217;s CEO, said that in the future its service could stick with customers after they buy a home, perhaps helping them connect utilities, find appraisers, and manage their home.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious about the company&#8217;s recent capital raise, and how it may impact SimpleNexus&#8217;s ramp to nearly $60 million in revenue by January 2021. Per the company, it wasn&#8217;t looking for capital, but after receiving some inbound offers to sell its entire business, which weren&#8217;t what its founders wanted, it decided to raise more external capital instead. Insight, which led the round, was excited about their company, the founders said, thanks to its customer growth and revenue expansion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> &#8212; the programming language, not the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/">survival game</a> &#8212; now has a new home: the <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/">Rust Foundation</a>. AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla banded together to launch this new foundation today and put a two-year commitment to a million-dollar budget behind it. This budget will allow the project to &#8220;develop services, programs, and events that will support the Rust project maintainers in building the best possible Rust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rust started as a side project inside of Mozilla to develop an alternative to C/C++. Designed by Mozilla Research&#8217;s Graydon Hore, with contributions from the likes of JavaScript creator Brendan Eich, Rust became the core language for some of the fundamental features of the Firefox browser and its Gecko engine, as well as Mozilla&#8217;s Servo engine. Today, Rust is the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most-loved language</a> among developers. But with Mozilla&#8217;s layoffs in recent months, many on the Rust team lost jobs and the future of the language became unclear without a main sponsor, though the project itself has thousands of contributors and a lot of corporate users, so the language itself wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>
<p>A large open-source project often needs some kind of guidance, which the new foundation will provide &#8212; and it takes a legal entity to manage various aspects of the community, including the trademark, for example. The <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board/">new Rust board</a> will feature five board directors from the five founding members, as well as five directors from project leadership.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Mozilla incubated <span class="il">Rust</span> to build a better Firefox and contribute to a better Internet,&#8221; writes Bobby Holley, Mozilla and <span class="il">Rust</span> Foundation Board member, in a statement. &#8220;In its new home with the <span class="il">Rust </span>Foundation, <span class="il">Rust</span> will have the room to grow into its own success, while continuing to amplify some of the core values that Mozilla shares with the <span class="il">Rust</span> community.”</p>
<p>All of the corporate sponsors have a vested interest in Rust and are using it to build (and rebuild) core aspects of some of their stacks. Google recently said that it will fund a Rust-based project that aims to make the Apache webserver safer, for example, while Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3605551/microsoft-forms-rust-language-team.html">formed a Rust team</a>, too, and is using the language to rewrite some core Windows APIs. AWS recently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/announcing-the-general-availability-of-bottlerocket-an-open-source-linux-distribution-purpose-built-to-run-containers/">launched</a> Bottlerocket, a new Linux distribution for containers that, for example, features a build system that was largely written in Rust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank’s earnings always leads to a bonanza of news. One storyline that has dominated the company’s earnings over the past few years that has all but disappeared though is WeWork.</p>
<p>The co-working company, which saw its scorching-hot flame dim a few years ago and which has been parlayed into such books as <a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/reeves-wiedeman/billion-dollar-loser/9780316461368/">Billion Dollar Loser</a>, is all but invisible in SoftBank’s presentations these days. The company, despite being one of the largest investments in SoftBank’s $98.6 billion Vision Fund, is <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2020/investor-svf_q3fy2020_01_en.pdf">not mentioned in the firm’s quarterly update</a>, and the <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2020/earnings-presentation_q3fy2020_01_en.pdf">company’s investor presentation also has no mention of the company</a>. (Its logo does appear on the portfolio page, although it is buried with all the other logos.)</p>
<p>Yet, for all the doom that has been emanating from WeWork, from its financial shenanigans to dealing with the workplace in a post-COVID-19 world, results apparently are better than what might be expected.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Buried in the footnotes of SoftBank’s earnings report today is some good news related to WeWork. The Japanese telco conglomerate recognized improvements of $1.36 billion in various credit facilities for WeWork compared to its figures in the first three months of 2020.</p>
<p>Given WeWork’s instability, SoftBank had set aside large sums of capital to cover the rent and mandatory loan payments of WeWork in order to shore up the company’s financial picture. However, “mainly due to the improvement in the credit risk of WeWork” according to SoftBank, the risk profile of those loans has improved quite a bit, and the company no longer feels the need to offer as much of a financial buffer as it did nine months previous.</p>
<p>Now, that could just be some innovative accounting engineering, but that improvement in WeWork’s performance mirrors rumors heard in recent weeks that the company is expected to once again attempt to head to the public markets.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-combine-with-spac-or-raise-money-privately-11611857306">The Wall Street Journal reported that WeWork was looking to go public via SPAC</a> for a rumored price of $10 billion. No deal has yet been announced, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/softbank-files-for-a-double-scoop-of-spac/">while SoftBank is in the process of raising two more SPACs</a> for a grand total of three, it is unlikely to merge WeWork through its own vehicles.</p>

<p>While that $10 billion market cap is far below some of the most bullish prices that WeWork was pumping investors on back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/30/wework-delays-ipo/">during its roadshow in September 2019</a>, it nonetheless shows that the company may not be the financial albatross it was two years ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DoorDash is expanding its robotic footprint into the kitchen. The delivery service is set to acquire Chowbotics, a Bay Area-based robotics best known for its salad-making robot, Sally. TechCrunch has confirmed the acquisition, which was first noted by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doordash-is-buying-robotics-startup-chowbotics-11612805441">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>“We have long admired the work that Chowbotics has done to increase access to fresh meals, with its groundbreaking robotics product and vision,” DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang said in a comment offered to TechCrunch. &#8220;At DoorDash, we are always working to innovate and continue improving how we support our merchant partners and their success &#8212; and are excited to leverage this technology to do so in new ways. With the Chowbotics team on board, we can explore new use cases and customers, providing another service to help our merchants grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Chowbotics has raised around $21 million to date, including an $11 million round back in 2018. The company’s vending machine-style salad bar robot was already well-positioned for the pandemic, removing a human element from the food preparation process &#8212; not to mention the fact that salad bars and buffets tend to be open air affairs. In October, the startup added a contactless feature to the robot, letting users order ahead of time, via app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Joining the DoorDash team unlocks new possibilities for Chowbotics and the technology that this team has built over the past seven years,” CEO Rick Wilmer said in a statement. “As the leader in food delivery and on-demand logistics, DoorDash has the unparalleled reach and expertise to help us grow and deploy our technology more broadly, so together, we can make fresh, nutritious food easy for more people.”</p>
<p>It’s not entirely clear how the company’s technology will fit into the delivery service’s current offering, though DoorDash notes it will “improve consumer access to fresh and safe meals, and enhance our robust merchant offerings and logistics platform.” It also remains to be seen whether Chowbotics will continue to operate as its own entity within the broader DoorDash. We’ve reached out for more insight.</p>
<p>“At DoorDash, we strive to become a merchant’s first call when they want to grow their business,” Tang said. “What excites us most about Chowbotics is that the team has developed a remarkable tool for helping merchants grow. Bringing Chowbotics’ technology into the DoorDash platform gives us a new opportunity to help merchants expand their current menu offerings and reach new customers in new markets &#8212; which is a fundamental part of our merchant-first approach to empowering local economies.”</p>
<p>DoorDash has been working with robotics companies for a number of years now. Perhaps the most prominent example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/18/postmates-and-doordash-are-testing-delivery-by-robot-with-starship-technologies/">is a partnership with Starship Technologies</a> to explore food delivery robots. Though that technology has seen a fair number of roadblocks among local officials not eager to turn their sidewalks over to robots. The delivery company likens Chowbotics’ kiosk-style technology to its work with ghost kitchens, effectively serving as a conduit to help expand food options at local merchants – be it in store or through delivery. The former will likely be of more interest once the current pandemic is in the rear view.</p>
<p>Details of the acquisition have not been disclosed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is there so much M&#038;A action in the container security space now?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, another container security startup came off the board when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/rapid7-acquires-kubernetes-security-startup-alcide-for-50m/">Rapid7 bought Alcide</a> for $50 million. The purchase is part of a broader trend in which larger companies are buying up cloud-native security startups at a rapid clip. But why is there so much M&amp;A action in this space now?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/palo-alto-networks-to-acquire-container-security-startup-twistlock-for-410m/">Palo Alto Networks was first</a> to the punch, grabbing Twistlock for $410 million in May 2019. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/vmware-to-acquire-kubernetes-security-startup-octarine-and-fold-it-into-carbon-black/">VMware struck a year later</a>, snaring Octarine. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cisco-acquires-portshift-to-raise-its-game-in-devops-and-kubernetes-security/">Cisco followed with PortShift</a> in October and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/">Red Hat snagged StackRox</a> last month before the Rapid7 response last week.</p>
<p>This is partly because many companies chose to become cloud-native more quickly during the pandemic. This has created a sharper focus on security, but it would be a mistake to attribute the acquisition wave strictly to COVID-19, as companies were shifting in this direction pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that security startups that cover a niche like container security often reach market saturation faster than companies with broader coverage because customers often want to consolidate on a single platform, rather than dealing with a fragmented set of vendors and figuring out how to make them all work together.</p>
<p>Containers provide a way to deliver software by breaking down a large application into discrete pieces known as microservices. These are packaged and delivered in containers. Kubernetes provides the orchestration layer, determining when to deliver the container and when to shut it down.</p>
<p>This level of automation presents a security challenge, making sure the containers are configured correctly and not vulnerable to hackers. With myriad switches this isn&#8217;t easy, and it&#8217;s made even more challenging by the ephemeral nature of the containers themselves.</p>

The company has now seen 18 investments exit, including 10 fully exited and eight that are now trading on the public markets.</p>

<p>Yet, tucked away deeply in the company’s earnings statement was a note that the company has cut in half the performance incentive earmarked for the Vision Fund’s leadership, from $5 billion to $2.5 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That $5 billion incentive scheme was controversial when news of it was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ec8628a8-73ef-11e8-b6ad-3823e4384287">first reported by publications like Financial Times</a> back in April 2018. In the model, SoftBank essentially loaned its employees money to buy into the Vision Fund, a structure that was designed to accelerate the closing of the fund’s $100 billion fundraise. The company first added language about the incentive scheme in its 2018 Q2 earnings, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>On October 19, 2018, SoftBank Vision Fund completed an interim closing with additional committed capital of $5 billion. This brought the total committed capital of the Fund to $96.7 billion. The additional committed capital is intended for the installment of an incentive scheme for operations of SoftBank Vision Fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the company has had consistent language about the $5 billion figure in every quarterly earnings report. However, in today’s latest earnings for fiscal 2020 Q3, the company noted that the incentives are now “$2.5 billion (decreased from the previous $5.0 billion).”</p>
<p>The incentive scheme for SoftBank has been a huge point of discussion for industry observers. Four top executives at SoftBank — Rajeev Misra, Marcelo Claure, Katsunori Sago and Ken Miyauchi have collectively been loaned $600 million to buy into the Vision Fund, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/54b67d4c-fb3c-489c-ac58-418f0f5c739f">according to a report two weeks ago in Financial Times</a>. Some of that money was derived from the $5 billion (now $2.5 billion) incentive scheme, although it isn’t clear if all that money was earmarked exclusively from this particular pool.</p>
<p>SoftBank’s pullback on incentives for the Vision Fund is seemingly a response to the fund’s overall lackluster performance and the fund’s disastrous investment in WeWork, which led to wide losses at the telecom group. While more recent performance has been much better for the fund, eliminating some of those incentives should improve overall performance of the fund and ultimately SoftBank’s bottom line.</p>
<p>Vision Fund I has stopped investing in new companies as of last year. A second fund has $10 billion in capital — all from SoftBank itself — and has been making regular investments. The Vision Fund has also been raising SPACs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/softbank-files-for-a-double-scoop-of-spac/">including two new ones it announced late last week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The French government and the government-backed initiative La French Tech <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com/fr/la-france-aide-les-startups/french-tech-120-2/">unveiled</a> the new indexes that identify the most promising French startups. The 40 top-performing startups are called the Next40, and the top 120 startups are grouped into the French Tech 120.</p>
<p>The Next40 and French Tech 120 are somewhat new as this is only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">the second version</a> of those indexes. Out of the 120 startups that were in last year’s French Tech 120, 90 of them are still in this year’s index — 30 are newcomers as there were 123 startups in last year’s French Tech 120.</p>
<p>Combined, they generate close to €9 billion in revenue and provide a job to 37,500 people. Revenue in particular is up 55% compared to last year’s French Tech 120.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s a list of the French Tech 120 — the red logos are part of the Next40:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110214" style="width: 948px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110214" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2110214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png" alt="" width="938" height="626" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png 938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110214" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> La French Tech</p></div></p>
<p>There are two ways to get accepted in the Next40:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have raised more than €100 million over the past three years ($120 million at today’s rate) or you are a unicorn, which means your company’s valuation has reached $1 billion or more.</li>
<li>You generate more than €5 million in revenue with a year-over-year growth rate of 30% or more for the past three years.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the remaining 80 startups in the French Tech 120:</p>
<ul>
<li>40 of them have raised more than €20 million in a funding round over the past three years.</li>
<li>40 of them are selected based on the annual turnover and growth rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, those indexes are limited to private French companies. For the French Tech 120, there are at least two startups per administrative region.</p>
<p>Based on those metrics, only a handful of the startups in the French Tech 120 have a female CEO and the French government thinks tech startups should do more when it comes to diversity and inclusion. That’s why a small group of people are going to work on a roadmap and some recommendations to improve those numbers.</p>
<p>Representatives of six different startups in the French Tech 120, as well as people from <a href="https://www.wearesista.com">Sista</a>, <a href="http://www.techyourplace.fr">Tech Your Place</a> and <a href="https://www.futurepositivecapital.com">Future Positive Capital</a>, will get together to work on those topics.</p>
<p>In addition to a cool logo for your website, being part of the French Tech 120 comes with some perks. Those companies can access a network of French Tech representatives in different public administrations.</p>
<p>For instance, it’s easier for your company if you want to get visas for foreign employees, obtain a certification or a patent, if you want to sell your product to a public administration, etc.</p>
<p>There are two new additions to the French Tech network. Someone from the <em>Conseil d’État</em> can help you when it comes to legal compliance. The government has also signed a partnership with Euronext to educate entrepreneurs about going public.</p>
