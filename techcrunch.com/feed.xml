</div><p id="speakable-summary">Apple has delayed the release of a feature that will eventually allow you to store your ID in the company’s Wallet app. In an update to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>official iOS 15 website</ins></a> that was spotted by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/23/apple-delays-ios-15-wallet-id-feature-early-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>MacRumors</ins></em></a>, Apple says that functionality will now arrive sometime in early 2022. The company previously planned to launch in late 2021.</p>
<p>Apple first announced the feature at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-drivers-license-ios-15-tsa-174600256.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>WWDC 2021</ins></a>. At the time, the company said the tool would allow you to add your driver’s license or state ID card to Apple Wallet just like you would a credit or debit card. Among the first locations that will support the feature will be select Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints at some US airports.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At those locations, you’ll have the option to use your iPhone or Apple Watch to present your ID to the TSA. You’ll do so by tapping your device on an identity reader, and you won’t need to hand over your iPhone or Apple Watch to a TSA employee.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In September, Apple announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-drivers-license-state-id-first-states-ios-15-140215751.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>eight states</ins></a> would support the feature at launch, starting with Arizona and Georgia, and Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma and Utah to follow. Beyond TSA checkpoints, Apple said retailers and venues would add support later.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238931" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Outside of early 2022, Apple has not shared a specific release date for the feature. What’s clear is that it won’t arrive with iOS 15.2. That update is currently in beta testing and does not include support for storing digital IDs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh on the heels of Rocket Lab’s third successful booster recovery, CEO Peter Beck said the next step will be attempting to catch the booster mid-air using a helicopter, likely within the first half of next year.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab recovered the first stage of its Electron launcher during an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/rocket-labs-electron-booster-splashes-down-in-the-pacific-ocean/">ocean splashdown last week</a>, after the rocket delivered two BlackSky geospatial imaging satellites to low Earth orbit. The company stationed a helicopter near the splashdown area during that mission, but only for reconnaissance purposes. The ultimate goal for the company&#8217;s reusability program has always been to actually recover the booster in mid-air, and now it’s nearly upon them.</p>
<p>The main work to be done between now and then is helicopter readiness, Beck said during a call with reporters Tuesday. The aircraft that will be used for the mid-air catch attempt will be significantly heavier, and will have a significantly heavier payload capacity, than the one that was present at last week’s launch (the first stage weighs around 980 kilos).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The other part of it is slotting that flight and with a very, very busy manifest,” he said. “A priority is always making sure we deliver our customers on time. So that that&#8217;s the next thing, but we certainly hope to have that flight within the first half of next year or as soon as practically possible, really.”</p>
<p>The company is planning a number of commercial flights between now and the mid-air recovery attempt, but these will be non-recovery missions. The next big learning opportunity for Rocket Lab will be once it is able to catch the booster and return it dry to the factory, Beck added.</p>
<p>Looking to next year, Beck said he foresees a busy year for the company, in part as a response to the ongoing coronavirus restrictions in New Zealand that have restricted Rocket Lab’s launch cadence throughout this year. While he didn’t speculate on how many launches the company might complete next year, he said he anticipated 2022 being the busiest year so far for the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the world quickly transitions into a global village thanks to the rapid penetration of internet networks, it is easy for some people to be left behind owing to the remoteness of their locations. In most parts of Zanzibar, an autonomous island in East Africa, for example, services by terrestrial cable and satellite networks are deficient, leaving a big percentage of the population uncovered. But, if plans by the <a href="https://worldmobile.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Mobile Group</a> &#8212; a global telecommunications operator &#8212; materialize, many Zanzibaris will be connecting to the internet for the first time in the next few months.</p>
<p>World Mobile is building infrastructure for last-mile connectivity using spectrums like free-space optical communication and other radio transmitters, which do not require licensing, translating to less expensive internet access.</p>
<p>The spectrums connect to multiple air nodes to create a mesh network, providing internet coverage to far-flung villages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There&#8217;s a lot of fiber optics that have been laid throughout the continent, and we pick up on the last mile of fiber and use alternative spectrums like free-space optics, or other radio spectrums that do not require licensing,” World Mobile group CEO and founder Micky Watkins told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Watkins said that because they do not require licenses for these alternative spectrums they get a massive tax saving, which translates to cheaper internet for users.</p>
<p>“We use these alternative spectrums to build the backhaul (connection between an access node and the core network) and then create a device (node) that people can use to pick up from that backhaul,” said Watkins.</p>
<p>For sustainability, the air nodes will be owned by private entities, through a one-off fee of about $7,000 that they will recoup over time by earning income or rewards in the form of World Mobile Token (WMT), the operator’s cryptocurrency, as people connect to the internet through their access points. The network operator is working with micro-lenders in financing entrepreneurs to buy the nodes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each air node provides reliable Wi-Fi internet to 500 to 700 people, and other ancillary utilities like public lighting through integrated solar-powered floodlights.</p>
<p>Watkins said the concept of a sharing economy reduces operational expenditures incurred in maintenance, security and leasing costs, while also powering a self-sustaining business model.</p>
<p>“And now the residents have a choice; do I own livestock or is it better for me to own part of a telecom infrastructure and run a telecommunications platform? This option was never there before; so, just like Uber or Airbnb, we are operating under the sharing economy model.”</p>
<p>World Mobile is currently serving about 3,000 customers on the five pilot sites, but has plans to expand to 30 sites by January &#8212; as it moves to fast-track the connectivity efforts.</p>
<p>Watkins said that current users spend about $4 a month on internet usage. The operator has a network of vendors where users onboard their fiat cash or buy WMT, the company’s digital currency, to connect to the internet.</p>
<p>World Mobile has a more ambitious plan of covering Zanzibar in five years, making internet available to the entire population of 1.5 million people, stepping up competition for traditional network companies like Zanlink and satellite internet companies like GlobalTT teleport and operator.</p>
<p>“We have a few deals that are coming through the pipeline that will allow us to have connectivity throughout the whole of Zanzibar, including the whole shoreline and in between mainland (Tanzania) and the borders of Zanzibar, allowing us to implement IoT, as well as connectivity for the people,” said Watkins.</p>
<p>The company is set to roll out the network in Kenya and Tanzania, where they already have operations, over the coming months.</p>
<p>“This is a movement, and this can be the biggest mobile network in the world that is run by the people. No one has ever done that before. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re actually going for,” said Watkins.</p>

<h2>How Zanzibar is tapping connectivity to build a digital economy</h2>
<p>As more citizens get connected, the Zanzibar government has started implementing its digital economy framework, a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/5289999/Zanzibar_eGovernment_Agenda_A_Way_Forward" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan</a> it had shelved for over a decade.</p>
<p>Among the many ideas it had laid out and is now on course for includes tapping connectivity to grow its <a href="https://thecommonwealth.org/blue-economy#:~:text=The%20'Blue%20Economy'%20is%20an,ocean%20or%20'blue'%20resources.&amp;text=Similar%20to%20the%20'Green%20Economy,environmental%20risks%20and%20ecological%20scarcities.">blue economy</a> and to develop solutions that protect Zanzibar’s blue economy from illegal fishing trawlers.</p>
<p>Zanzibar’s ocean-based activities provide employment to 33% of its labor force and contribute more than <a href="https://uongozi.or.tz/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Realizing-the-Blue-Economy-in-Zanzibar_WP21_17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29% of the island’s GDP,</a> but could realize more from its ocean-based wealth with better technologies.</p>
<p>It will also help in building infrastructure that will help it automate all its administrative tasks and processes. This means building an e-government system that would allow the interaction of government with its citizens, businesses, employees and between its agencies. The investment will make the government more accessible to its citizens, who no longer need to physically visit offices for services or information.</p>
<p>“The new administration is really focusing on digital transformation. We need to get there. But first we&#8217;re going to ensure that everybody can access the internet at an affordable rate,” said Said Seif Said, director general of the E-Government Agency of Zanzibar (eGaz).</p>
<p>The agency was established to promote policies, standards and other practices to improve ICT uptake across the public institutions.</p>
<p>“We might have a different solution like an integrated blue economy management system &#8212; which means we&#8217;re including satellite automatic identification systems, vessel management systems and drones. So, all this is to solve the problem of illegal unreported and unregistered fishing. And all these technologies need the connectivity to be in place.”</p>
<p>The urgency to digitize has partly been fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated Zanzibar’s plan for a digital government and economy. Zanzibar is now compensating for the time lost by quickening its pace toward that transition.</p>
<p>“The COVID pandemic has really changed how we do everything and we need to enable our citizens to do what they need to do from their homes. We have to ensure the sheer accessibility of government services countrywide in an affordable, effective and efficient manner through the appropriate use of ICT, and that&#8217;s where this collaboration with the World Mobile Group and Input Output Global (IOG) comes in,” he said.</p>
<p>In the partnership, IOG, a blockchain and digital identity firm behind Cardano blockchain, will automate Zanzibar’s systems by implementing blockchain technology in registry systems to provide “digital identifications with traceability”. It will also integrate back-end government systems to enable business-process automation and facilitate the flow of communication within government institutions.</p>
<p>World Mobile subscribers will access <a href="https://www.atalaprism.io/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atala PRISM</a>, IOG’s digital identity solution for services such as education, banking and healthcare.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zanzibar is launching a blockchain academy that will, beginning early next year, hold conferences as the tourist destination positions itself as a blockchain center of the future.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you get mad about something silly on the internet, people will tell you, &#8220;go touch some grass.&#8221; But a few months back, when Mark Zuckerberg announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/"> Facebook&#8217;s rebrand to Meta</a> and shared his vision of the metaverse, I felt an insatiable need to go outside so that I could literally touch grass. The development of new technology is exciting, but when it can feel a bit overwhelming, there&#8217;s nothing better than being surrounded by some green stuff.</p>
<p>Luckily, not all new technology wants to render us tethered to our VR headsets &#8212; some tech is designed to help us turn our homes into thriving gardens.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234094" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The first startup I ever covered at TechCrunch was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/greg-an-app-for-plant-lovers-grows-5-4-million-in-seed-funding/">Greg</a>, an app that uses machine learning to help you know when to water your plants. When CEO Alex Ross saw my Zoom background &#8212; a large, forest tapestry that I bought for my freshman dorm seven years ago &#8212; he asked if I have plants. I told him that I can&#8217;t keep plants alive, because all of the windows in my apartment are north-facing.</p>
<p>He recommended some plants that can thrive in low light (snake plants, pothos, zz plants) and he guaranteed that if I used Greg, I could keep them alive. I was skeptical. Of course the co-founder of a plant app would tell you that if you use his app, you can keep your plants alive. But six months later, my snake plant, pothos and zz plant are all doing just fine. And I&#8217;ve become so obsessed with plants that here I am, writing the plant tech gift guide. Thanks, Greg.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Greg isn&#8217;t a miracle app. Even though monsteras need lots of light to thrive, I couldn&#8217;t resist how pretty they are, so I got one from a local plant nursery and placed it by the window at my desk. My hubris wounded me. It did not do well. So, I bought a relatively inexpensive grow light. Now, my monstera is doing great, and not to brag, but I&#8217;ve even kept a jade succulent standing up.</p>
<p>Greg won&#8217;t tell you, &#8220;Hey, your monstera desperately needs light because your apartment is dark and sad,&#8221; but you can change the settings on each individual plant you track on the app to indicate whether it&#8217;s on a grow light, since the amount of light a plant gets affects its watering cycle.</p>
<p>Greg is free for up to five plants, but you can buy unlimited access with Super Greg, which runs for $6.99 per month, $30 per year (so around $2.50 per month, if you pay annually) or $49.99 for lifetime access.</p>
<p>As Ross told TechCrunch: &#8220;Coinbase onboards people into crypto, Greg onboards people into plants.&#8221; A wild quote, but in my case, he was kind of right.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> From free to $7 per month. Available on <a href="https://greg.app/download/?utm_source=website_cta">iOS and Android</a></p>
<h2>Okay, now where do you buy the plants?</h2>

<p>Among techy startup people, you&#8217;ll probably hear about <a href="https://www.thesill.com/">The Sill</a>, an online retailer selling plants. Founder Eliza Blank is an investor in <a href="https://greg.app/">Greg</a> &#8212; small world!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not fortunate enough to live in walking distance of multiple plant nurseries, ordering online can be a good option, but oof. Some of these plants are pricey for stuff that literally grows on trees! (Looking for free cuttings? Check to see if there&#8217;s a plant exchange group for your neighborhood.)</p>
<p>But if you want to send something nice to a friend for the holidays, you&#8217;re probably not going to buy a snake plant from your local plant shop, box it up and bring it to the UPS store. So in that case, sure, buy that <a href="https://www.thesill.com/products/snake-plant-laurentii?variant=30412141690985">$60 snake plant and chic, modern planter</a>. And honestly, without the overpriced (but pretty!) planters you can buy a snake plant for <a href="https://www.thesill.com/products/snake-plant-laurentii?variant=39521020313705">as low as $23</a>, which isn&#8217;t much more than what you&#8217;d probably pay at a nursery. So go treat yourself. Just don&#8217;t get the <a href="https://www.thesill.com/products/monstera-deliciosa?variant=31411322028137">monstera</a> unless you have lots of natural light or are willing to invest in a grow light.</p>
<p>Modern Sprout also makes indoor garden kits designed to hand-hold habitual plant killers through growing things from <a href="https://store.modsprout.com/products/terracotta-grow-kits-1">cacti</a> to <a href="https://store.modsprout.com/products/garden-jar-collection">edible herbs</a>. But again, even if you follow the directions closely, your plants need light to survive. So…</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s talk grow lights</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, your standard lightbulb won&#8217;t give your plants the light they need to thrive. So if you aren&#8217;t fortunate enough to have a sun-drenched salon in your home, grow lights are crucial to making sure you can still enjoy an indoor oasis &#8212; or, at least, one that isn&#8217;t filled exclusively with snake plants.</p>
<h3>Best on a budget</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2234274" style="width: 1408px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234274" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234274 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png" alt="" width="1398" height="1054" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png 1398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=300,226 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=768,579 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=680,513 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1398px) 100vw, 1398px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234274" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Juhefa LED Grow Light</p></div></p>
<p>I bought myself this grow light when I was skeptical about whether my monstera was dying because it hates me, or because it needed more light. So I didn&#8217;t want to invest in any super high-tech setup when I was still, as Greg CEO Alex Ross would say, &#8220;onboarding into plants.&#8221; At $24, this one&#8217;s the best bang for your buck. You can program it to adhere to a daily schedule and it has a very strong clamp to keep the gooseneck LEDs in place. Honestly, I can&#8217;t really say anything more than the fact that it works. No complaints. But maybe you want something prettier?</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $24 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TFHFP7Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07TFHFP7Q&amp;linkId=5aa1b2fc86883190ac43b5e50399734c">Amazon</a></p>
<h3>This one&#8217;s just ridiculously pretty</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2234272" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234272" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234272 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="854" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234272" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Modern Sprout Growframe</p></div></p>
<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t have enough space for your plants. Why not make more room on your walls? If a picture is worth 1,000 words, plants are worth … probably also about a thousand. We&#8217;re not here to slander the fine arts.</p>
<p>But if all the art you own is stored in your crypto wallet (sigh), your walls might be looking bare, so why not hang up your plants in an LED grow frame? Depending on the size and shape, these frames run about $200, which isn&#8217;t cheap, but again: They&#8217;re <em>pretty</em>. Still, before you invest, make sure you know how to hang up an eight-pound piece of tech on your wall. You don&#8217;t want this thing to come crashing down, especially if you have plants on it!</p>
<p>The frame&#8217;s LEDs can be controlled and set on a timer with the Modern Sprout app. These are full-spectrum white LEDs, so while they&#8217;ll still grow your plants, you won&#8217;t have to deal with the obtrusive red and blue colors that other grow lights use. Again, this thing isn&#8217;t magic &#8212; you&#8217;re going to want to be smart about what plants can thrive on your wall, presumably not near a window, receiving only artificial light. May I suggest a <a href="https://www.thesill.com/blogs/plants-101/how-to-care-for-jade-crassula-ovata?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b45d944a3&amp;_ss=r">jade succulent</a>?</p>

<h3>Not enough books on your bookshelf?</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2234266" style="width: 1254px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234266" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234266 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg" alt="" width="1244" height="1400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg 1244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=267,300 267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=768,864 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=604,680 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 1244px) 100vw, 1244px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234266" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Modern Sprout Grow Bar</p></div></p>
<p>Got a lot of bookshelves and not enough books? More plant space!</p>
<p>The Modern Sprout Smart Growbar is a bit cheaper than the Growframe at $119, and it attaches via velcro to the underside of a cabinet or shelf to keep your plants happy.</p>
<p>If your bookshelf is full, why not build an herb garden in your kitchen? If you don&#8217;t eat fresh basil on a regular basis … I&#8217;m sorry. But this Growbar can help with that. Like the Growframe, this device is app-enabled and emits only natural white LED light.</p>

<h3>For very serious, yet stylish plant folk</h3>

<p>Soltech&#8217;s grow lights are designed to look like luxury light fixtures that also just so happen to be designed to help plants grow. The $75 <a href="https://www.soltechsolutions.com/product/vita-grow-light/">Vita Grow Light</a> can screw into any existing light fixture you have, but it&#8217;s far heavier than a traditional lightbulb. So, for instance, if you live in an apartment that gets very little natural light and your landlord included some very cheap floor lamps as a gesture of good faith, maybe don&#8217;t use your Vita in those very flimsy lamps. But if your lighting doesn&#8217;t resemble what you&#8217;d find in a college dorm, you&#8217;re probably good to go with the Vita. Like other high-end grow lights, the Vita emits a warm, natural light, so you won&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s a special kind of lightbulb. No blues and reds here!</p>
<p>If you want to get extra fancy, Soltech also sells light fixtures that <a href="https://www.soltechsolutions.com/product/aspect-plant-light/">hang from your ceiling</a> or <a href="https://www.soltechsolutions.com/product/highland-track-light-system-international/">drill into your wall</a>.</p>

<h2>Plants need water, too</h2>
<p>Now that your plants are well lit, how do you keep them watered? Let&#8217;s say, hypothetically, you&#8217;re going out of town for over a month, live alone in a badly lit apartment, and your landlord won&#8217;t give you a second fob key unless you pay $75, and you&#8217;re too stubborn for that. So that means you can&#8217;t give a friend a key to water your plants while you&#8217;re gone. How can you keep your plants watered without human intervention?</p>
<h3>Add some modern style to your plants while keeping them hydrated</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2234259" style="width: 1690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234259" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234259 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/plantstraws.jpeg" alt="" width="1680" height="1200" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/plantstraws.jpeg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/plantstraws.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/plantstraws.jpeg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/plantstraws.jpeg?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/plantstraws.jpeg?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/plantstraws.jpeg?resize=1536,1097 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/plantstraws.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234259" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Plantstraws</p></div></p>
<p>Plantstraws, run by founder Elin Fyhr and her father, sells handmade products designed and produced in a small, Stockholm studio. The product spruces up a well-known DIY trick for plant watering, in which you dampen a string and run it between a bowl of water and your plant&#8217;s roots. This product essentially does the same thing, running a rope through a brass metal tube that looks way more stylish than a DIY setup.</p>
<p>Though Plantstraws is based in Sweden, they ship around the world. A plant straw is about $30, and though they don&#8217;t come with the beautiful glassware shown in the product photos, they still look good with a mason jar, an old wine bottle or whatever else you have lying around. Even when you&#8217;re not out of town, you can use plant straws to keep your plants healthy &#8212; but it&#8217;s better to use them on plants that require a decent amount of water, like a money tree or a peace lily, as opposed to a plant that wants dry soil, like a succulent or snake plant.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $30 at <a href="https://plantstraws.co/products/plantstraws-brass">Plantstraws</a></p>
<h2>Just go ahead and literally turn your home into a garden</h2>
<p>Speaking of water: hydroponic gardens? Extremely cool. It&#8217;s amazing what you can grow with just the right amount of light and water, even if you&#8217;re growing plants in a dark apartment with no porch to grow a big ol&#8217; tomato plant on. Growing plants is great, but you know what&#8217;s even better? Growing plants that you can eat.</p>
<h3>If you want to feel like you&#8217;re living in a high-tech Stardew Valley</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2234254" style="width: 2570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234254" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234254 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clickandgrow.jpeg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clickandgrow.jpeg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clickandgrow.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clickandgrow.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clickandgrow.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clickandgrow.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clickandgrow.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clickandgrow.jpeg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clickandgrow.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234254" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Click and Grow Smart Garden 27</p></div></p>
<p>If you simply cannot get enough of your indoor plants and love fresh produce, you might want to invest in a family-sized smart garden. Winter is approaching. Why trek through the snow to get groceries when you can have fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs and even (non-edible!) flowers blooming in your home?</p>
<p>The Click and Grow Smart Garden 27 comes with three <a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/products/the-smart-garden-9">Smart Garden 9s</a> (generally $200+ each), plus a sturdy, wooden plant stand, which is surprisingly easy to assemble. Since the whole system sells for $600, it&#8217;s actually a good deal if you were going to buy three individual smart gardens anyway. That might seem steep, but some competitors like the (also very pretty) <a href="https://mygardyn.com/">Gardyn</a> are even more expensive.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: You place Click and Grow&#8217;s plant pods into the Smart Gardens (you can grow a total of 27 pods at once in the Smart Garden 27, as its name suggests). Then, you pour water into the device&#8217;s reservoir until it&#8217;s filled. While you wait for the seeds to sprout, you place plastic domes on top of each pod, which speeds up the process &#8212; once they start peeking out of the soil, you remove the domes and let them grow.</p>
<p>Of course, like all of these high-tech plant devices, Click and Grow has an app, which you can use to regulate the light cycle of the system. From then on, you don&#8217;t really have to do much except refill the reservoir with water once it depletes. After a few weeks or months (depending on the plant) you&#8217;ll have some food!</p>
<p>The Smart Garden 27 comes with nine basil pods, nine tomato pods and nine lettuce pods to start. The pods can also be purchased separately in packs of three for $10, averaging out to $3.33 per pod. With Click and Grow&#8217;s <a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/pages/click-grow-subscription">subscription</a> service, you can order in bundles for as low as $1.64 per pod. There&#8217;s a wide variety in what you can grow, like cilantro, blue petunias, kale, bell peppers, wild strawberries, white snapdragons, peas, chives, catnip, arugula and more. Click and Grow also sells &#8220;<a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/products/grow-anything-indoors">Grow Anything</a>&#8221; soil pods, which let you add in your own seeds to grow whatever you want.</p>
<p>Click and Grow&#8217;s smart gardens all use similar technology, so if you&#8217;re looking for something a bit less intense (and expensive), try Click and Grow&#8217;s $140 <a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/products/the-smart-garden-3">Smart Garden 3</a>, which can grow three plant pods at once. Put it in your kitchen so you can grow fresh basil, rosemary and parsley year-round.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $600 at <a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/products/smart-garden-27-home-garden">Click and Grow</a></p>

<p>Don’t miss these two breakout sessions presented by <strong>The Aerospace Corporation</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>University Showcase: New Frontiers in Space Exploration From OSAM to xGEO —</strong> What’s next for on-orbit servicing, assembly and manufacturing (OSAM) and orbital debris clean-up as small spacecraft move beyond earth orbit and the geostationary satellite belt (xGEO) into open space (cis-lunar space) and onto the lunar surface itself? We’re showcasing university trail blazers in space exploration — Dr. Jonathan Black (Virginia Tech), Professor Kathleen C. Howell (Purdue University) and Dr. Moriba Jah (The University of Texas at Austin). Learn about the technologies and meet the people working on the projects to find out what’s ahead and how you can participate.</li>
<li><strong>Securing Space at Speed —</strong> The demand signal is clear: the U.S. government needs to spur innovative commercial capabilities to excel in an increasingly contested space domain. Hear directly from the leaders — including Steve Isakowitz (Aerospace Corporation) and Pete Muend (National Reconnaissance Office) — driving government-commercial collaborations and about opportunities to help usher in the next era of achievement in space.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lockheed Martin Space</strong> will be in the virtual house for this joint panel discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Robots, Meet Regolith: A New Generation of Lunar Landers and Rovers —</strong>The Moon is back on the menu with Artemis and a dozen other missions. Lisa Callahan (Lockheed Martin Space), Sean Mahoney (Masten Space Systems) and Takahiro Nakamura (iSpace) will talk about building a new generation of robotic explorers and surveyors to roam around its surface. Plus, you’ll hear how they design for the Moon’s unforgiving surface and what robots can do to help prepare for human arrival.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Make time in your schedule for this presentation with <strong>Maxar Technologies</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering and Protecting In-space Operations</strong> — As investment in space skyrockets, many companies are also thinking about safety and sustainability. Lucy Condakchian (Maxar), Daniel Ceperley (LeoLabs) and Nobu Okada (Astroscale) discuss protecting and extending the life and capabilities of major installations in orbit — and the required advances in robotics, tracking and spacecraft design.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Einride CEO and founder Robert Falck talks about his strategy for scaling revenue, why autonomous vehicles should be built on electric platforms and why the future is in startups' hands.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robert Falck used to work at a Russian trucking factory by day, and by night, he built a nightclub guest list startup. He also collects old books, and once guessed that Chinese author Gao Xingjian would win the Nobel Prize in literature. He grew up on a farm, but has degrees in finance, economics and mechanical engineering.</p>
<p>No, this isn&#8217;t a game of two truths and a lie — indeed, these are snippets from the life of a serial entrepreneur who harbors a vendetta against the carbon emissions produced by the world&#8217;s trucking industry.</p>
<p>Falck, now the CEO and founder of Swedish autonomous freight company Einride, also worked as the director of manufacturing engineering assembly at Volvo GTO Powertrain. He learned how heavy duty vehicles are produced en masse during his three-and-a-half years there, and also helped start and invest in other companies. Einride, which he founded in 2016, is his seventh company.</p>
<p>Einride&#8217;s business is threefold. It currently operates one of Europe&#8217;s largest fleets of electric trucks, but its main offering is its electric autonomous pods, self-driving freight trucks built without a front cab and no room for a human operator. The startup also offers an IoT system called Saga that runs through its fleet and helps the company and its shipping partners optimize routes, and manage and electrify fleets.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/einride-launches-autonomous-pods-and-electric-freight-operations-in-u-s/">Einride launched its U.S. operations</a> this month and plans to operate its pods, trucks and OS with partners like GE Appliances, Bridgestone and Oatly. In May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/autonomous-trucking-startup-einride-raises-110m-ahead-of-expansion-into-united-states/">the company raised $110 million</a> to help fund its U.S. expansion, bringing its total funding to $150 million.</p>
<p>We sat down with Falck to talk about Einride&#8217;s strategy for scaling revenue, the need for autonomous vehicles to be built on electric platforms and why the future is in startups&#8217; hands.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The average OEM will need to write off between six and seven years of profit to get rid of the legacy investments in diesel platforms.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: In addition to your work at Volvo, you&#8217;ve started two nightclub-related platforms and a hunting app. Why start an autonomous trucking company?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Robert Falck: </strong>Working at Volvo, producing diesel engines, gearboxes and trucks, made it clear to me the challenges the industry was facing and that I have a moral obligation. I mean, the heavy freight transport industry stands for between 7% to 8% of global CO2 emissions, and the engines that I helped to produce contribute roughly 1% of global CO2 emissions. That&#8217;s how much of an impact my previous position was actually making, and I realized that I was part of the problem.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t exactly make sense to start a company. You&#8217;re either crazy, or if you&#8217;re in it for money, you&#8217;re not going to get there, because there are much easier ways to make money. But for me, I consider the CO2 emissions to be our generation&#8217;s greatest challenge. And it&#8217;s quite fascinating how secondary failure becomes when you know that you do it for the right reasons.</p>
<p><strong>You have been described as a serial entrepreneur. Are you with Einride for the long run, or are you already thinking about your next startup?</strong></p>
<p>I think all entrepreneurs get a thrill out of entrepreneurship. And I&#8217;m definitely more of an entrepreneur and company builder than I am an administrator and manager. I&#8217;m not the kind of person to sit there and keep the status quo. It&#8217;s not my thing.</p>
<p><strong>So will your next startup tackle CO2 emissions, but just in a different industry?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the very traditional industries are ready for disruption, and that&#8217;s going to challenge and change society at its core. The main driver behind it is that if you look globally, there&#8217;s a huge demand for sustainability.</p>
<p>I think most of the companies that are going to change or save the planet will be created in the next five to 10 years, and there&#8217;s lot of potential in some of the more traditional parts of the economy. Everything from trucking and the automotive space to real estate, a lot of those big plays are still up for grabs. I think energy — smart grids and how we structure energy production — is going to be another one of them.</p>
<p><strong>So you think most of the climate tech that&#8217;ll solve the biggest issues will come from startups rather than legacy companies?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit is <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/bringing-more-of-dubsmash-to-reddit-by-launching-new-video-features">shutting down</a> Dubsmash, its short-form TikTok-like video platform, on February 22, 2022. The company says after February, Dubsmash will no longer be available for download in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Currently downloaded apps will stop functioning on the same date.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22796234/reddit-dubsmash-video-creation-tools?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">acquired Dubsmash</a> in December 2020 and had said it would integrate its video creation tools into Reddit. Following the acquisition, Dubsmash&#8217;s leadership team joined Reddit. Now, nearly a year later, Reddit says the Dubsmash team has been accelerating the app&#8217;s video offerings and that parts of Reddit will feel familiar to Dubsmash users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since joining, the Dubsmash team has been working to integrate their innovative video creation tools into Reddit &#8212; with a goal of empowering Reddit’s own creators to express themselves in original ways that are authentic to our communities,&#8221; Reddit said in a<a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/bringing-more-of-dubsmash-to-reddit-by-launching-new-video-features"> blog post</a>. &#8220;Combining forces has been a perfect match. Reddit is where passionate communities come together for timely, interactive, and authentic exchanges about topics that matter to them, and video is increasingly core to how people want to connect.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As part of the integration, Reddit has announced that it&#8217;s rolling out new video creation tools. New camera features include the ability to change recording speeds and the option to set a timer. Users can now also upload videos in landscape, portrait mode and fill, as well as adjust and trim multiple clips. The company is also adding a new editing screen that includes text Stickers, a drawing tool and filters. And users have the option to add voiceovers or adjust the volume directly on the editing screen.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238851" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238851" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2238851" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bread-Meme-Gif-1.gif?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238851" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit</p></div></p>
<p>In August, Reddit rolled out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios/">video feed feature </a>for iOS users, which shows a stream of videos in a TikTok-like configuration. When presented with a video, users can upvote or downvote, comment, gift an award or share it. Similar to TikTok, users can swipe up to see another video, feeding content from subreddits the user is subscribed to, as well as related ones. The launch of the new video feed came as Instagram&#8217;s Reels feature and Snapchat&#8217;s Spotlight tool were gaining traction, as social media platforms were looking to compete with TikTok.</p>
<p>Reddit says video content is soaring on Reddit, as it has seen nearly 70% growth in overall hours watched. It notes that there has been a 30% increase in daily active video viewers growth. The app has also seen a 50% increase in quarter-over-quarter short video viewership, which it describes as less than than 2 seconds, in its new video player.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Reddit first launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/reddit-rolls-out-its-own-video-platform/">native video platform</a> in 2017, which allows users to upload MP4 and MOV files to the site. Then, in August 2019, it launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20812887/reddit-live-streaming-test-public-access-network-rpan-subreddit-tool">RPAN</a> (Reddit Public Access Network), which lets people livestream to selected subreddits.</p>
<p>Now that Reddit has completed its Dubsmash integration, it&#8217;s no surprise that it&#8217;s looking to garner more users with the launch of its new video creation tools as it aims to continue to compete with TikTok. However, apps like TikTok and Snapchat go beyond simple video creation, as they also leverage sounds and music on their platforms. It&#8217;s unknown if Reddit will take its video ambitions further by following suit in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has launched a lawsuit against NSO Group, the maker of the nation-state spyware Pegasus, seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the spyware maker from using any Apple product or service.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211123005662/en/">a statement</a>, Apple said it&#8217;s seeking the injunction to &#8220;prevent further abuse and harm to its users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Israel-based company NSO Group develops Pegasus, a spyware that gives its government customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/">near-complete access</a> to a target’s device, including their personal data, photos, messages and precise location. The spyware works by exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities in iPhone software. Many of those targeted, including journalists, activists, and human rights defenders, received malicious links in text messages, but Pegasus more recently has been able to silently hack iPhones without any user interaction.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238773" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Several authoritarian governments are known to use Pegasus, including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico; though, NSO has repeatedly declined to name or confirm its dozens of customers, citing non-disclosure agreements.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s complaint, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21116797-apple-v-nso">filed Tuesday</a>, aims to make it far more difficult for NSO to find and exploit vulnerabilities in iPhone software to hack its targets.</p>
<p>Researchers at Citizen Lab found evidence earlier this year that NSO Group had developed a new exploit able to bypass new protections built into iPhone software, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/">known as BlastDoor</a>, which Apple designed in large part to prevent NSO-style attacks by filtering out malicious payloads that could be used to compromise a device. This so-called zero-click vulnerability — named as such because it doesn&#8217;t require the victim to click any links to become infected — was dubbed ForcedEntry by Citizen Lab for its ability to skirt Apple&#8217;s BlastDoor&#8217;s protections. Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/apple-zero-day-nso-pegasus/">patched the vulnerability</a> in September after it was found to affect all Apple devices, not just iPhones.</p>
<p>Apple said that NSO uses Apple&#8217;s own services to deliver its spyware. By seeking a permanent injunction, Apple wants to ban NSO from using any of its services to launch attacks against those targeted by its government customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At Apple, we are always working to defend our users against even the most complex cyberattacks. The steps we’re taking today will send a clear message: in a free society, it is unacceptable to weaponize powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place,” said Apple&#8217;s security chief Ivan Krstić. &#8220;Our threat intelligence and engineering teams work around the clock to analyze new threats, rapidly patch vulnerabilities, and develop industry-leading new protections in our software and silicon. Apple runs one of the most sophisticated security engineering operations in the world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to protect our users from abusive state-sponsored actors like NSO Group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple said its notifying known victims targeted by the ForcedEntry exploit, and said it notifies victims who it discovers who have been targeted with state-sponsored spyware.</p>
<p>An email to NSO Group&#8217;s media email was returned as undelivered.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Commercial space companies are increasingly seeking out paths to the public markets, and mergers with special purpose acquisition corporations (SPACs) are a popular mechanism for doing so. This year at the all-virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=TRUE">TechCrunch Sessions: Space</a> event on December 14-15, we&#8217;ll hear from key senior executives at Astra, Rocket Lab and Redwire about the SPAC process and what the public markets unlock for their respective companies.</p>
<p>Astra CFO Kelyn Brannon has ample experience leading companies through IPOs, and the was also the first chief accounting officer and head of finance at Amazon.com. Brannon helped guide Astra though its public debut via merger with SPAC Holicity at the end of June, and the startup has since seen its fortunes rise on big successes like its milestone first orbital launch, which took place this past weekend.</p>
<p>Redwire President and COO Andrew Rush serves as a member of the NASA Advisory Council, and was previously the president and CEO of Made in Space, the in-space manufacturing company that Redwire acquired last year. He&#8217;s in charge of the company&#8217;s overall business portfolio, long-term planning and strategic investments, and is the perfect person to ask about Redwire&#8217;s merger with Genesis Park Acquisition Corporation and NYSE debut in September.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237897" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Rocket Lab CFO Adam Spice joined the company in 2018, and has held a number of financial executive roles at companies across the tech industry, including stints at Broadcom, Symwave Corporation and Intel, all key chipmaking companies. Spice ushered Rocket Lab through its public debut on the Nasdaq in August via a merger with Vector Acquisition.</p>
<p>SPACs have uncorked longstanding pressure in the private space startup market for public market exit events, but they&#8217;ve also introduced companies in this relatively nascent market to the vagaries of public investors. We&#8217;ll hear from all of these companies who&#8217;ve taken this path this year what that&#8217;s meant for them and their businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=TRUE">Get your pass</a>, join your global space community and get the very latest thinking on space SPACs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s that magical time of year. No, I&#8217;m not talking about the upcoming holiday season. Instead<strong>,</strong> it&#8217;s time for AWS&#8217;s annual customer extravaganza <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/?trk=www.google.com">re:Invent</a>, which starts next week. The conference is always a newsy event with tons of new features and products being announced. It&#8217;s also a time for AWS to pull together the press, customers, partners and other interested parties to party in Vegas. This year it has a new twist.</p>
<p>Besides the gathering returning to Vegas after a year as virtual event due to the pandemic, this year&#8217;s event will mark the first re:Invent with new CEO Adam Selipsky at the helm.</p>
<p>Selipsky <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tableau-ceo-adam-selipsky-is-returning-to-aws-to-replace-andy-jassy-as-ceo/">came over from Tableau</a> earlier this year after Jeff Bezos announced he was moving into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">the executive chairman role</a>, and former AWS CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/today-is-day-1-for-andy-jassy-as-former-aws-ceo-moves-to-amazon-corner-office/">Andy Jassy moved up to replace Bezos</a> as Amazon CEO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238296" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the executive musical chairs shuffle settled, Selipsky will deliver the main keynote, and he&#8217;ll have big shoes to fill. Jassy had an uncanny ability to keep his company&#8217;s vast product catalogue inside his head and talk about how all of the pieces connected to one another seemingly extemporaneously. Pulling off a similar feat would not be easy.</p>
<p>But Selipsky brings his own personal strengths to the table as Jassy pointed out in the email he sent to employees announcing that the former Tableau exec<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/aws-announces-next-ceo"> would be his successor</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Adam brings strong judgment, customer obsession, team building, demand generation, and CEO experience to an already very strong AWS leadership team. And, having been in such a senior role at AWS for 11 years, he knows our culture and business well.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is all true, and the division he is now running remains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/">firmly in command</a> of the market, but there have been signals that in spite of that success, that Selipsky could be ready to put his own stamp on AWS and maybe begin to tweak how they do business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/amazon-cloud-ceo-tweaks-strategy-amid-microsoft-google-rivalry?sref=gni836kR">he told Bloomberg</a> last week that he intends to take a page from Microsoft and Google&#8217;s cloud playbook and start to create industry-specific solutions. Under Jassy&#8217;s rule, they avoided this strategy, preferring a more generalized approach, letting partners deal with the specifics.</p>
<p>Perhaps his short time as part of Salesforce when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">Tableau was acquired</a>, which likes the industry-driven solutions approach, convinced Selipsky that this would be a good way for AWS to go as well. But beyond that, he has not revealed if he intends to change things under his command. Maybe he will next week, or perhaps he sees something that isn&#8217;t broken and doesn&#8217;t need fixing.</p>
<p>When asked what advice they would give to Selipsky, a couple of industry watchers had quick responses.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says the first thing he would advise Selipsky to do is reduce the growing set of products into a simpler, less comprehensive catalogue. &#8220;CTOs avoid [solutions that have] to rely on the ingenuity of developers instead of a platform offering with version numbers and road maps from AWS connecting the dots for them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Secondly he would suggest becoming more enterprise friendly by taking a page from how Google and Microsoft (and even IBM and Oracle) about how these companies approach cloud sales to larger companies. He would suggest possibly hiring experienced enterprise executives as Google has done, particularly with CEO Thomas Kurian, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/16/former-oracle-exec-thomas-kurian-to-replace-diane-greene-as-head-of-google-cloud/">who came from Oracle</a> in 2018 or Robert Enselin, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/google-cloud-brings-on-27-year-sap-veteran-as-it-doubles-down-on-enterprise-adoption/">who came on board from SAP</a> in 2019 as president of global cloud operations.</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy has a couple of different recommendations, proposing they move up the stack and start developing more SaaS applications to compete with Google, Microsoft and Adobe, among others. Further, he wants to see them move into hybrid more where their competitors are trying to take the lead.</p>
<p>All that said, the division is immensely successful. In the most recent quarterly report, the company <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/default.aspx">reported $16.1 billion</a> in revenue, but Selipsky himself told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-11-18/bloomberg-studio-1-0-aws-ceo-adam-selipsky">Bloomberg&#8217;s Emily Chang in an interview</a> last week that you he knows he can not simply rest on his laurels and count on that success continuing with such formidable competitors chasing his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to continue to act as if we&#8217;re insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents,&#8221; Selipsky told Chang.</p>
<p>Regardless, at re:Invent, he will have his first turn as the face of AWS, delivering the main keynote, and while he is reporting to Jassy, he is his own person and will emphasize what he sees as important to continue growing the lucrative division. We will see next week if that involves any significant changes or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In what looks like bad news for adtech giants like Facebook and Google, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted for tougher restrictions on how Internet users&#8217; data can be combined for ad targeting purposes &#8212; backing a series of amendments to draft legislation that&#8217;s set to apply to the most powerful platforms on the web.</p>
<p>The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (IMCO) today voted overwhelmingly to support beefed up consent requirements on the use of personal data for ad targeting within the Digital Markets Act (DMA); and for a complete prohibition on the biggest platforms being able to process the personal data of minors for commercial purposes &#8212; such as marketing, profiling or behaviorally targeted ads &#8212; to be added to the draft legislation.</p>
<p>The original Commission proposal for the DMA was notably weak in the area of surveillance business models &#8212; with the EU&#8217;s executive targeting the package of measures at other types of digital market abuse, such as self-preferencing and unfair T&amp;Cs for platform developers, which its central competition authority was more familiar with.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238581" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">&#8220;The text says that a gatekeeper shall, &#8216;for its own commercial purposes, and the placement of third-party advertising in its own services, refrain from combining personal data for the purpose of delivering targeted or micro-targeted advertising&#8217;, except if there is a &#8216;clear, explicit, renewed, informed consent&#8217;, in line with the General Data Protection Regulation,&#8221; IMCO writes in a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20211118IPR17636/digital-markets-act-ending-unfair-practices-of-big-online-platforms">press release</a>. &#8220;In particular, personal data of minors shall not be processed for commercial purposes, such as direct marketing, profiling and behaviourally targeted advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that adtech giants are masters of manipulating user consent at scale &#8212; through the use of techniques like A/B testing and dark pattern design &#8212; so beefed up consent requirements (for adults) aren&#8217;t likely to offer as much of a barrier against ad-targeting abuse as the committee seems to think they might.</p>
<p>Although if Facebook was finally forced to offer an actual opt-out of tracking ads that would still be a major win (as it doesn&#8217;t currently give users any choice over being surveilled and profiled for ads).</p>
<p>However the stipulation that children should be totally protected from commercial stuff like profiling and behavioral ads is potentially a lot more problematic for the likes of Facebook and Google &#8212; given the general lack of robust age assurance across the entire Internet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It suggests that if this partial prohibition makes it into EU law, adtech platforms may end up deciding it&#8217;s less legally risky to turn off tracking-based ads altogether (in favor of using alternatives that don&#8217;t require processing users&#8217; personal data, such as contextual targeting) vs trying to correctly age verify their entire user base in order to firewall only minors&#8217; eyeballs from behavioral ads.</p>
<p>At the very least, such a ban could present big (ad)tech with a compliance headache &#8212; and more work for their armies of in-house lawyers &#8212; though MEPs have not proposed to torpedo their entire surveillance business model at this juncture.</p>
<p>In recent months a number of parliamentarians have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">pushing for just that: An outright ban on tracking-based advertising period</a> to be included, as an amendment, to another pan-EU digital regulation that&#8217;s yet to be voted on by the committee (aka the Digital Services Act; DSA).</p>
<p>However IMCO does not look likely to go so far in amending either legislative package &#8212; despite a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/edpb-call-to-ban-tracking-ads/">call this week by the European Data Protection Board</a> for the bloc to move towards a total ban on behavioral ads given the risks posed to citizens fundamental rights.</p>
<h2 class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">Digital Markets Act</h2>
<p>The European Parliament is in the process of finalizing its negotiating mandate on one of the aforementioned digital reforms &#8212; aka, the DMA &#8212; which is set to apply to Internet platforms that have amassed market power by occupying a so-called &#8216;gatekeeping&#8217; role as online intermediaries, typically giving them a high degree of market leverage over consumers and other digital businesses.</p>
<p>Critics argue this can lead to abusive behaviors that negatively impact consumers (in areas like privacy) &#8212; while also chilling fair competition and impeding genuine innovation (including in business models).</p>
<p>For this subset of powerful platforms, the DMA &#8212; which was presented as a legislative proposal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">at the end of last year</a> &#8212; will apply a list of pre-emptive &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; in an attempt to rebalance digital markets that have become dominated by a handful of (largely) US-based giants.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers argue the regulation is necessary to respond to evidence that digital markets are prone to tipping and unfair practices as a result of asymmetrical dynamics such as network effects, big data and &#8216;winner takes all&#8217; investor strategies.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=kFuFZl2frV" data-secret="kFuFZl2frV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process, once the Commission proposes legislation the European Parliament (consisting of directly elected MEPs) and the Council (the body that represents Member States&#8217; governments) must adopt their own negotiating mandates &#8212; and then attempt to reach consensus &#8212; meaning there&#8217;s always scope for changes to the original draft, as well as a long period where lobbying pressure can be brought to bear to try to influence the final shape of the law.</p>
<p>The IMCO committee vote this morning will be followed by a plenary vote in the European Parliament next month to confirm MEPs&#8217; negotiating mandate &#8212; before the baton passes to the Council next year. There trilogue negotiations, between the Parliament, Commission and Member States&#8217; governments, are slated to start under the French presidency in the first semester of 2022. Which means more jockeying, horse-trading and opportunities for <a href="https://twitter.com/ka_iwanska/status/1463094399949324289">corporate lobbying</a> lie ahead. And (likely) many months before any vote to approve a final DMA text.</p>
<p>Still, MEPs&#8217; push to strengthen the tech giant-targeting package is notable nonetheless.</p>
<p>A second flagship digital update, the DSA, which will apply more broadly to digital services &#8212; dealing with issues like illegal content and algorithmic recommendations &#8212; is still being debated by MEPs and committee votes like IMCO&#8217;s remain outstanding.</p>
<p>So the DMA has passed through parliamentary debate relatively quickly (vs the DSA), suggesting there&#8217;s political consensus (and appetite) to rein in tech giants.</p>
<p>In its press release summarizing the DMA amendments, rapporteur Andreas Schwab (of the EPP and DE political grouping) made this point, loud and clear, writing: “The EU stands for competition on the merits, but we do not want bigger companies getting bigger and bigger without getting any better and at the expense of consumers and the European economy. Today, it is clear that competition rules alone cannot address all the problems we are facing with tech giants and their ability to set the rules by engaging in unfair business practices. The Digital Markets Act will rule out these practices, sending a strong signal to all consumers and businesses in the Single Market: rules are set by the co-legislators, not private companies!”</p>
<p>In other interesting tweaks, the committee has voted to expand the scope of the DMA &#8212; to cover not just online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, and video-sharing services (i.e. where those platforms meet the relevant criteria to be designated “gatekeepers”) &#8212; but also add in web browsers (hi Google Chrome!), virtual assistants (Ok Google; hey Siri!) and connected TV (hi, Android TV) too.</p>
<p>On gatekeeper criteria, MEPs backed an increase in the quantitative thresholds for a company to fall under scope &#8212; to €8 billion in annual turnover in the European Economic Area; and a market capitalisation of €80 billion.</p>
<p>The sorts of tech giants who would qualify &#8212; based on that turnover and market cap alone (NB: other criteria would also apply) &#8212; include the usual suspects of Apple, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Google, Microsoft etc but also &#8212; potentially &#8212; the European booking platform, Booking.com.</p>
<p>Although the raised threshold may keep another European gatekeeper, music streaming giant Spotify, out of scope.</p>
<p>MEPs supported the additional criteria for a platform to qualify as a gatekeeper and fall under scope of the DMA of: Namely, providing a &#8220;core platform service&#8221; in at least three EU countries; having at least 45M monthly end users and 10,000+ business users. The committee also noted their support that these thresholds do not prevent the Commission from designating other companies as gatekeepers &#8212; &#8220;when they meet certain conditions&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other changes, the committee backed adding new provisions around the interoperability of services, such as for number-independent interpersonal communication services and social network services.</p>
<p>And &#8212; making an intervention on so-called &#8216;killer acquisitions&#8217; &#8212; MEPs voted for the Commission to have powers to impose “structural or behavioural remedies” where gatekeepers have engaged in systematic non-compliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The approved text foresees in particular the possibility for the Commission to restrict gatekeepers from making acquisitions in areas relevant to the DMA in order to remedy or prevent further damage to the internal market. Gatekeepers would also be obliged to inform the Commission of any intended concentration,&#8221; they note on that.</p>
<p>The committee backed a centralized enforcement role for the Commission &#8212; while adding some clarifications around the role of national competition authorities.</p>
<p>Failures of enforcement have been a major bone of contention around the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection regime, the GDPR, which allows for enforcement to be devolved to Member States but also for forum shopping and gaming of the system &#8212; as a couple of EU countries have outsized concentrations of tech giants on their soil and have been critized as bottlenecks to effective GDPR enforcement.</p>
<p>(Only today, for example, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">hit with a criminal complaint</a> accusing it of procedural blackmail in an attempt to gag complainants in a way that benefits tech giants like Facebook&#8230; )</p>
<p>On sanctions for gatekeepers which break the DMA rules, MEPs want the Commission to impose fines of “not less than 4% and not exceeding 20%” of total worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year &#8212; which, in the case of adtech giants Facebook&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s full year 2020 revenue would allow for theoretical sanctions in the $3.4BN-$17.2BN and $7.2BN-$36.3BN range, respectively.</p>
<p>Which would be a significant step up on the sorts of regulatory sanctions tech giants have faced to date in the EU.</p>
<p>Facebook has yet to face any fines under GDPR, for example &#8212; over three years since it came into application, despite facing numerous complaints. (Although Facebook-owned WhatsApp was recently fined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">$267M for transparency failures</a>.)</p>
<p>While Google received an early <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">$57M GDPR from France</a> before it moved users to fall under Ireland&#8217;s legal jurisdiction &#8212; where its adtech has been under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">formal investigation since 2019</a> (without any decisions/sanctions as yet).</p>
<p>Mountain View has also faced a number of penalties elsewhere in Europe, though &#8212; with France again leading the charge and slapping Google with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">$120M fine for dropping tracking cookies without consent</a> (under the EU ePrivacy Directive) last year.</p>
<p>Its competition watchdog has also gone after Google &#8212; issuing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">$268M penalty this summer for adtech abuses</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">a $592M sanction (also this summer)</a> related to requirements to negotiate licensing fees with news publishers over content reuse.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to imagine such stings as a mere <em>amuse-bouche</em> compared to the sanctions EU lawmakers want to be able to hand out under the DMA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite Apple and Facebook investing billions into a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; future, in recent years there&#8217;s been a distinct drop-off in venture deals for startups focused on finding opportunities in augmented reality. Many VCs who have been burned by investments in large-scale efforts like Magic Leap now see the near-term spoils of augmented reality tech as opportunities largely left for big tech companies, but smaller startups are still finding inroads that appeal to investors.</p>
<p>For London-based <a href="https://www.dentreality.com/">Dent Reality</a>, one opportunity is in creating specific small-scale experiences that showcase the powers of the technology &#8212; and hyper-localized mapping &#8212; starting in venues like grocery stores. In the case of a grocery store, the team&#8217;s augmented reality platform can provides shoppers with a small-scale layout of the store&#8217;s aisles, while integrating with the store&#8217;s database to provide shelf-specific data on where to find particular items. AR capabilities allow users to hold their phone up to chart a path to the object of their desire.</p>
<p>CEO Andrew Hart says that retailers are more broadly interested in finding ways to bring their online toolsets into the experience of real-world shoppers because those personalization tools have grown to make online shoppers much more valuable to them. Dent Reality isn&#8217;t specifically a platform for finding things in grocery stores, but Hart says that their high density of products makes them an ideal location to stress test their tech.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238675" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We decided on grocery stores, because it’s the hardest challenge that we could have solved,&#8221; Hart tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Investors see an opportunity in Dent&#8217;s efforts, the London startup has closed a $3.4 million seed round led by Pi Labs with participation from Sugar Capital and 7Percent Ventures.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the years following the launch of Apple&#8217;s ARKit augmented reality developer platform, Hart has built up an audience on Twitter showcasing many of the futuristic augmented reality tech demoes he&#8217;s created. Dent Reality was an effort to turn some of these future-flung use cases into a present-day tech platform for developers. While smartphones are an imperfect device for augmented reality, they still offer consumers a way to experience and interact with 3D interfaces which Hart believes will be central to the utility of an upcoming wave of augmented reality glasses devices.</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Interfaces in general have been trapped in 2D and phone screens,&#8221; Hart says. &#8220;There’s so much opportunity in AR for things we just can’t do with a 2D interface.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the road, Dent Reality wants to tackle everything from large office complexes to hospitals to college campuses, leveraging hyper-localized map data, augmented reality and their unique approach to localizing users with public WiFi data and smartphone sensors that doesn&#8217;t require buildings to integrate new hardware infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The venture arm of Volvo Cars, an automaker long synonymous with safety, has invested in an optics and imaging startup developing technology that can be integrated into a car&#8217;s windshield or windows to deliver images to drivers and passengers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Volvo Cars Tech Fund invested $2 million into o</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ptics and imaging developer </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://www.spectralics.com/">Spectralics</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, funds it will use to accelerate the development of its optical film that the company says could make cars safer and provide a better user experience. While the investment might not seem significant, the relationship with Volvo could prove fruitful, particularly if its tech ends up in production vehicles. </span></p>
<p>Spectralics is developing see-through optical overlay, also known as a “multi-layered thin combiner,” that can be integrated onto a car’s windshield or windows. Spectralics says this creates a wider field of view and, crucially, a sense of distance – both necessary for a safe augmented reality overlay.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238676" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Outside of the vehicle, the tech could also be used for smart glasses, optical systems and other head up displays. It’s the latest sign that augmented and virtual reality are moving beyond gaming and consumer goods and into the vehicle. It’s arguably part of a wider shift of automotive OEMs distinguishing new cars not by horsepower but by user experiences and technology offerings.</p>

<p>While the uptake of AR/VR in cars has faced a number of bottlenecks, automakers are leading the pack in investing in companies developing this tech for in-cabin applications. as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/automakers-suppliers-and-startups-see-growing-market-for-in-vehicle-ar-vr-applications/">Abigail Basset notes for TechCrunch+.</a></p>
<p>If Volvo’s investment in Spectralics wasn’t signal enough, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the Swedish car giant is looking to adopt this tech in its cars. “Spectralics is a good portfolio fit for us and we believe that their technology has the potential to set a standard for the next generation of displays and cameras,” Volvo Cars Tech Fund’s head Lee Ma said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spectralics is an alum of MobilityXlab, an accelerator in Götenborg, Sweden, and is also part of Drive-TLV, a mobility hub in Tel Aviv that connects startups with automotive industry investors. Volvo&#8217;s investment arm has been part of both initiatives since 2017, and has recently invested in a handful of other Israeli startups, including MDGo, which develops accident detection sensors, and vehicle inspection tech developer UVEye.</p>
<p>The new funding now brings the Israel-based startup’s total raised to $5 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, Netflix&#8217;s new gaming service became globally available across both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/netflix-launches-games-to-iphone-and-ipad-users-worldwide/">iOS</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-are-coming-to-all-members-on-android-starting-this-week/">Android</a> with a debut lineup that included two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221;-themed games and a few more casual gaming titles. In the days since its launch, Netflix has expanded its lineup with two more games, including another casual game, Bowling Ballers, and now, a reboot of Gameloft&#8217;s Asphalt Xtreme, which officially <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asphalt9/comments/p6tgv7/offtopic_asphalt_xtreme_will_shut_down_by/">shut down</a> this September.</p>
<p>Bowling Ballers is <a href="https://twitter.com/hellofrostypop/status/1461009547447783429">another title</a> from existing Netflix gaming partner Frosty Pop, which already offers two other games for the streamer&#8217;s new service, Shooting Hoops and Teeter Up. Like the others, this latest addition is a simple game that&#8217;s described as an &#8220;endless runner&#8221; for bowling, which also includes a level-based mode. And like all Netflix games, Bowling Ballers is ad-free and doesn&#8217;t offer any in-app purchases.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; Frosty Pop (@hellofrostypop) <a href="https://twitter.com/hellofrostypop/status/1461009547447783429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The other new addition is a bit more interesting. Asphalt Xtreme was a fairly popular Gameloft title for a few years. It was the second spinoff from Gameloft&#8217;s Asphalt series of action racing games and allowed players to go off-road to explore exotic locales while controlling a variety of vehicles, including rally cars and monster trucks. The gameplay would see the cars having to traverse difficult elements like water, rocks, sand, mud and snow.</p>
<p>The game was developed from August 2015 to September 2017 but was shut down entirely on September 30, 2021. By Oct. 1, 2021, it was no longer available on the app stores for download. Netflix then licensed the title from Gameloft to add to its mobile gaming collection.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmPVO0j03TU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Larger gaming publishers like Gameloft tend to shut down titles that have passed their prime and no longer generate the revenue needed to keep the game active. But a service like Netflix, it seems, could be an interesting new home for such IP, as its goal is not to develop a profit from the games directly.</p>
<p>This format of an all-access &#8220;gaming subscription&#8221; is already used by the various cloud gaming services, like Xbox Cloud Gaming or Stadia, as well as the retro gaming service <a href="https://gameclub.io/">GameClub</a> and even Apple&#8217;s own Apple Arcade.</p>
<p>But Netflix doesn&#8217;t need the game subscription to stand on its own. Instead, Netflix sees these mobile games as a means of maintaining and growing its paying subscriber base by offering consumers a different type of entertainment beyond its TV shows and movies. Netflix subscribers can browse the available games inside Netflix&#8217;s streaming app, but the titles themselves are listed on the respective app stores as free downloads. When users are ready to play, the games require your Netflix credentials to log in &#8212; making them exclusive to Netflix members.</p>
<p>Bowling Ballers, which launched earlier this month, is available to global users. Netflix confirmed Asphalt Xtreme, which launched just this week, is now slowly rolling out to users worldwide. It will become available to U.S. users in the weeks ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of NASA&#8217;s most exciting and unusual missions in years, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/nasas-armageddon-style-asteroid-deflection-mission-takes-off-in-november/">Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)</a>, is scheduled to launch tonight on its way to strike and deflect an incoming space rock millions of miles from Earth. You can watch it live here, though it&#8217;ll be some time before the big smash happens.</p>
<p>DART is our first attempt as a spacefaring species to deliberately change the path of an oncoming asteroid. Rest assured, this one in particular is no danger to our precious planet, but does happen to be a perfect test bed for the type of interception that might be necessary should such a danger appear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Planetary Defense has been working on the problem for, really, decades,&#8221; explained Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. &#8220;It&#8217;s time to start getting together this toolset — it&#8217;s getting important for all our stakeholders. It&#8217;s really been in the last five years or so that the program has increased its support. And the target has been around for at least five years before that — people were talking about how this is really perfect, we can view its success from the ground, there&#8217;s no need for a second investigation.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238108" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The asteroid in question is actually the smaller of two in a binary configuration, traveling like a married couple through the solar system. The larger asteroid, Didymos, is about half a mile wide — not quite a planet-killer, but you wouldn&#8217;t want it coming down in your neighborhood either. And around it orbits our target: Dimorphos, about 525 feet across and sort of peanut-shaped, it&#8217;s about the size the Statue of Liberty would go bouldering on.</p>
<p>What DART will do is fly right out there and, just when Dimorphos is coming around from the far side of Didymos, smash into it as hard as possible — and that&#8217;s quite hard, considering that the spacecraft will <a href="https://dart.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Impactor-Spacecraft.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weigh about 1,210 pounds</a> and its new ion engine will have propelled it to the eye-watering (if it had eyes, and there was air) speed of 4.1 miles per second. (That&#8217;s 550 kilograms at 6.6 km/s for our metric friends; I leave it to the boffins to calculate the approximate impact force.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238175" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238175" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2238175" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg" alt="Diagram showing how the orbit of Dimorphos will change following impact." width="1024" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg?resize=768,449 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg?resize=1536,898 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg?resize=2048,1198 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DART-infographic_v4.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2238175" class="wp-caption-text">Diagram showing how the orbit of Dimorphos will change following impact. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JHUAPL</p></div></p>
<p>Dimorphos won&#8217;t explode and send fragments flying everywhere. Quite the opposite: the effect will be barely noticeable. But the impact will ever so slightly affect the period of its orbit around Didymos, slowing and expanding it to the point where a powerful telescope can perceive it. By observing this change scientists should be able to tell the mass of the object and how effective this refined technique of hitting a heavy thing with another thing actually was.</p>

<p>Once they know that, they can make an informed decision on what might be necessary if, for instance, an asteroid twice as large was in fact on a collision course. By applying <em>this</em> much force at <em>this</em> angle, at <em>this</em> time and distance (as far out as possible, one member of the team told me), we can divert it just enough that it won&#8217;t hit us. DART will be foundational to this sort of planetary defense work. Hopefully we won&#8217;t ever need it, but we can all agree it&#8217;s better to be prepared than have to muster a ragtag group of oil rig roughnecks to nuke the Big One at the last minute. That&#8217;s another &#8220;Armageddon&#8221; reference to keep our valued older readership engaged.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;d really like to do with this is, we need to know how to size an impactor depending on the size of the threat coming in. We want an impactor model with a high degree of accuracy,&#8221; said Zurbuchen. One such mission may not be enough, and though there are no plans for another impact mission yet, &#8220;I could easily imagine that a follow-up test into a different asteroid type could be on the books.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, though the impact may be relatively small, it will still be cool. So we&#8217;re sending up a partner spacecraft, LICIACube, that will watch from nearby, providing both data and crowd-pleasing footage of our attack on space mountain. Chances are it will just look like a puff of dust, gravel and solar panel parts, but you never know. This might be the asteroid with something living in it. If so, it will still be about 6.8 million miles away, so we won&#8217;t be in immediate danger. At any rate it&#8217;s hard to imagine ramming an asteroid with a spacecraft and <em>not</em> getting it on camera.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a high risk, high impact investigation,&#8221; Zurbuchen said of the companion CubeSat, which will have to be perfectly positioned and watching closely at the time of impact. &#8220;We can be sure it worked without it, but&#8230; I want to see that movie, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The launch window for DART, aboard its SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle, begins tonight at about 10:20 PM Pacific, and the weather at Vandenberg Space Force Base is looking 90% favorable in the latest reports. Once it&#8217;s out there it will be nearly a year before the spacecraft makes its destructive rendezvous with Dimorphos: impact is estimated to take place at the end of September 2022, though we&#8217;ll only know the exact time once the variables are locked down.</p>
<p>Pre-launch coverage will be happening all day on NASA Live, but tune in at about 7 PM for the real run-up and countdown to launch.

					<description><![CDATA[We need a new framework for us to use to sort private-market companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What is a startup? It&#8217;s a question so picked over at this point that it feels like the only answer is <em>it depends</em>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fair. In the past, we might have said that once a private-market company earns a $1 billion valuation, it is no longer a startup. But with venture capitalists and crossover investors turning an ever-increasing number of less mature startups into unicorns, that demarcation line has lost its rigidity.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The $1 billion unicorn term has lost most of its meaning. It was once an indicator of a startup demonstrating abnormal success, the marker of a <em>positive</em> outlier to a degree that the company in question deserved the boosterish sobriquet.</p>
<p>But now, with <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">907 unicorns out there</a>, the term really just means &#8220;startup that should have its shit together.&#8221; Which is less useful.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>What about a $10 billion deciding line? Would that be a useful filter to apply to the startup masses, allowing us to filter out the &#8220;must pay attention tos&#8221; from the &#8220;companies heating up&#8221; and the &#8220;potential but few material results yets&#8221;? Yes, but only because there really isn&#8217;t a better option.</p>
<p>I am not the first person to noodle on this point: Dan Primack <a href="https://www.axios.com/unicorn-startup-privately-held-valued-1-billion-c64e66cb-ec22-4c68-9aaf-db7f71431704.html">decided to call</a> the group of startups worth $10 billion or more &#8220;dragons&#8221; earlier this year; Crunchbase News has a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/decacorn-startups-2021-global-record-data-charts/">great riff on decacorns here</a> from earlier this week that we&#8217;ll cite again shortly; and the term &#8220;decacorn&#8221; is <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=decacorn">simply not new</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unicorn&#8221; has lost its heft thanks to massive rarity dilution. If we turn the clocks back to 2013, when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/">Aileen Lee wrote the post inventing the term,</a> there were fewer unicorns being created than there are decacorns today &#8212; in a nutshell, that&#8217;s how the startup game has changed in the last eight or nine years.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Lee from the past:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We found <strong>39 companies belong to what we call the “Unicorn Club”</strong> (by our definition, U.S.-based software companies started since 2003 and valued at over $1 billion by public or private market investors). That’s <strong>about .07 percent of venture-backed consumer and enterprise software startups.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tidal/">Tidal</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/distrokid/">DistroKid</a>, a popular independent music distributor,<a href="https://news.distrokid.com/tidal-artist-payments-95c541f08212" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> teamed up</a> last week to introduce a direct artist payments system. This partnership foreshadows a larger pivot from Tidal toward experimenting with streaming payout models that are thought to distribute funds more equitably to musicians who don&#8217;t get millions of streams on any given day (AKA, people who aren&#8217;t Taylor Swift or Lil Nas X).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re subscribed to Tidal&#8217;s HiFi Plus plan &#8212; which costs $19.99 per month &#8212; up to 10% (or about $2) of your monthly subscription fee will be distributed to your most-listened-to artist (so long as that artist uses DistroKid). That percentage shrinks if you&#8217;re paying for your subscription through a service that takes a cut, like the Apple or Google app stores. Tidal told TechCrunch that it also struck similar deals with independent distributors like CD Baby, Equity Distribution, Stem, Symphonic, Tunecore and Vydia.</p>
<p>This model is an example of a user-centric payment system (UCPS), which is generally favored by artists. As described by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/20/deezer-100/">Deezer</a>, a <a href="https://www.deezer.com/us/ucps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streaming service</a> that uses UCPS, this system helps individual fans more directly and transparently support their favorite artists, since their subscription fee is distributed to the artists they listen to. So, let&#8217;s say you listen to a 10-track record one time on a platform that pays about one cent per stream, like <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/apple-music-artist-payment-penny-streaming-1156932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Music</a>. Then, that artist will earn 10 cents (and that&#8217;s before distributors and publishers take their cut). But, on a UCPS platform like Deezer or SoundCloud, if you listen to 10 albums from 10 different artists in a month, then a portion of your monthly subscription fee is divided among those 10 artists, which means they&#8217;re probably getting more than 10 cents each. It&#8217;s similar to buying a CD &#8212; it&#8217;s not how often you listen to that CD, but rather, the fact that you bought it in the first place.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236885" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tidal told TechCrunch that beyond its deals with independent distributors, a kind of UCPS will come to its HiFi Plus tier starting in January 2022. The platform says it teamed up with more than 100 labels &#8212; both major labels and independents &#8212; to develop what it calls its fan-centered royalties program.</p>

<p>Currently, major streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify pay pro rata, which divides a pool of money based on total streams. But the growth of music streaming services &#8212; an attempted answer to the crisis of music piracy &#8212; has been, on the whole, not great for musicians. Musicians&#8217;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-do-musicians-make-money-2018-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> primary source of revenue</a> is now touring, so when the pandemic hit and canceled a slew of concerts, the inequity of streaming payouts became even clearer.</p>
<p>Last year, the<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW)</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/justice-at-spotify-demands-better-compensation-and-increased-transparency-for-musicians/">launched a campaign</a> called <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice at Spotify</a>, which demands the streaming giant to adopt UCPS, increase transparency about payouts and pay at least $0.01 per stream. As it stands, the platform is estimated to pay an average of $0.0038 per stream, according to the UMAW, but Spotify itself doesn&#8217;t disclose this value, saying that pay per stream is <a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/?question=spotify-pay-per-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a meaningful value</a> to analyze.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;We applaud Tidal&#8217;s move toward a more user-centric payment system, a shift we&#8217;ve been demanding since we launched our Justice at Spotify campaign in 2020, and one already adopted by Deezer and <a href="https://routenote.com/blog/soundclouds-new-ucps-fan-powered-royalty-system-will-see-soundcloud-take-a-45-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundCloud</a>,&#8221; said Joey DeFrancesco in a statement to TechCrunch on behalf of UMAW. &#8220;User-centric is no silver bullet, and we still desperately need more fundamental changes in streaming royalties, but it is a step in the right direction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Comparatively, Apple Music pays <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/apple-music-artist-payment-penny-streaming-1156932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$0.01 per stream</a> on average, per an internal memo leaked earlier this year. Tidal is thought to pay <a href="https://variety.com/2018/music/news/music-streaming-sites-fraud-1202905665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about the same</a>, though the company itself hasn&#8217;t confirmed these numbers. But Spotify, which has the most subscribers out of the three streaming leaders, pays the least.</p>
<p>Spotify points out that it appears to pay less per stream than competitors because, according to the company, Spotify users stream more music than users on competitor platforms. Also, unlike Apple Music or Tidal, Spotify offers a free tier, subsidized through ads, which the platform says might skew its pay-per-stream metrics.</p>
<p>Streaming payouts don&#8217;t directly reach the artist &#8212; first, payouts are divided among an artist&#8217;s record labels and publishers. The amount that an individual artist will get per stream depends on their contracts in the industry. But for now, according to the UMAW, an independent artist would need to amass 283,684 Spotify streams per month to pay a monthly rent of $1,078, the U.S. national median.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Spotify took a minority stake in DistroKid in 2018, but just weeks ago, Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/8aac006e-c0b2-4b52-a682-d5ed53274725.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quarterly SEC filing</a> revealed that it sold two-thirds of its equity interest in the independent distributor for €144, or about $163 million. It&#8217;s interesting timing for DistroKid to immediately strike a deal with Tidal, a more musician-friendly service, to enact a version of the policies that the UMAW are demanding from Spotify.</p>
<p>But Spotify doubts how much user-centric payments would actually benefit artists. <a href="https://cnm.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20210121_UCPS_CNM_Pressrelease.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study</a> from the National Music Center in France found that yearly payouts would fluctuate by &#8220;at most a few euros&#8221; for artists outside the top 10,000 acts.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We are willing to make the switch to a user-centric model if that’s what artists, songwriters and rights holders want to do. However, Spotify cannot make this decision on its own &#8212; it requires broad industry alignment to implement this change,&#8221; says <a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/?question=user-centric-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the platform&#8217;s website</a>.</span></p>
<p>So, perhaps the model of Tidal&#8217;s deals with independent distributors &#8212; a variation of UCPS &#8212; could be more beneficial for artists. A $2 per month bonus per user for being their most-streamed artist could add up. But, industry-wide changes like these may require trial and error to determine how streaming platforms can run their businesses while also paying musicians fairly for access to their music.</p>

That said, a $2 a month bonus &#8212; only to one artist per user, and only to artists signed up via [independent distributors] &#8212; is not going to add up for too many musicians and feels gestural,&#8221; Sadie Dupuis, a UMAW member, told TechCrunch. Dupius fronts bands like Speedy Ortiz and Sad13. </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;I’d be curious to know how many self-distributed artists are the #1 most streamed artist for any subscriber per month in general. It also excludes artists with label distribution, who also need fair streaming royalties, especially when they’re splitting 50% or more of those royalties with a label. It would be great to see more of this subscription fee proportionally divvied up to more music workers, regardless of how their songs are distributed.&#8221;</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-based digital therapy company ieso announced a $53 million Series B round on Tuesday. The round is the funding the company needs to move in a brand new direction: creating more intuitive autonomous text therapy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, AI trained on thousands of hours of real-life therapy that can provide personalized sessions, over chat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ieso has been around for about 10 years, and has been running a text-only therapy service (with human therapists on one end) through the U.K.’s National Health Service. So far, the company has provided text-based therapy for about 80,000 patients &#8212; though 6,000 are actively receiving therapy, Nigel Pitchford, ieso’s CEO told TechCrunch. That’s a total of 460,000 hours of therapy so far. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238597" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ll deliver some sort of 400 hours of therapy this evening, via our network,” said Pitchford. </span></p>
<p>This most recent round of funding was led by Morningside, with participation from Sony Innovation Fund. It also included existing investors IP Group, Molten Ventures and Ananda Impact Ventures</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, ieso is looking to take itself from a human-based therapist system, to a scaled-up autonomous system. The idea of AI-based chat therapy isn&#8217;t exactly unique in this space (we’ve covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/mental-health-app-wysa-raises-5-5m-for-emotionally-intelligent-ai/">other companies</a> pursuing this) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but the data </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">behind </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eso’s approach is what the company sees as its secret sauce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ieso’s “unfair advantage” is 10 years of real-life text-based conversations between patients and therapists, which Pitchford calls “transcripts of care.” That data set is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">paired </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with real-time data on patients&#8217; clinical outcomes, which the company has also been collecting alongside those transcripts. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ieso has built one of the most impressive data assets I have seen in the space with their text therapy data set,” said Stephen Bruso, an investment partner at Morningside. The data set is one aspect of ieso he finds most attractive as an investor, and called it &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data set has been used to track how certain therapeutic conversations or techniques are linked (or not linked) to patient improvement. And, there is some evidence ieso has managed to mine that data for insight. For example, the company published </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2748757" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA Psychiatry </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing 90,000 hours of therapy. The paper found that aspects of therapy like “planning for the future,” or certain cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, were linked to better patient outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the data suggested that 28 minutes out of every hour of therapy contained conversations or exercises that “directly affected” the patient outcome, said Andy Blackwell, the company’s group chief science and strategy officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps counterintuitively, the paper also found that therapeutic empathy was negatively associated with patient outcomes &#8212; though other research has suggested clients </span><a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/156744221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have better outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they feel their therapists understand them. Blackwell interpreted the empathy finding as evidence that empathy should be employed alongside other therapeutic techniques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Pitchford sees this data set, and analysis like the type conducted in that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper as a roadmap for how the AI-based therapists will be trained and personalized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So essentially, we&#8217;ve been studying what the very best therapists are doing at a very high scale, and then reconstructing that, so it can reach people that are unable to access human psychotherapy delivery, which is a huge problem all over the world,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with this data set, ieso does seem to be working in an increasingly crowded space. Funding for mental health startups is anticipated to crack $3 billion in 2021, per a Q3 Silicon Valley Bank Trend report. That means there are a lot of minds focused on the problems associated with traditional therapy right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruso sees ieso as one of the few mental health companies that can point to real-world health outcomes, at least using their own data set. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that there is a unique synergy between ieso’s digital products built on real-world data, and their ability to trial these products in their existing user base to generate outcomes data from day 1,” he said. “At the end of the day, the products that will last in the space will be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">those who can demonstrate a measurable impact on both individual health and societal outcomes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackwell is also aware of how packed this space is &#8212; in fact, he sees it as a problem for consumers. These apps, ieso’s leadership figures, are often designed for either self-help, mindfulness or patients with non-severe mental health diagnoses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though ieso can treat people with non-advanced mental health struggles, the company also has a focus on moderate-to-severe diagnoses. It’s not, to use his words, a “wellness solution” &#8212; and can be used by groups who might require more intensive care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This focus means that safeguards for self-harm need to be especially strong. Blackwell says the company has risk escalation protocols in place for its human-based therapy model that have been honed over the course of 10 years as one of the largest mental health providers in the U.K. The company has plans to incorporate those programs into the autonomous therapy product in the future.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Blackwell doesn’t anticipate a harder regulatory path because it’s looking to deal with higher-stakes mental health diagnoses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The good thing is that there are precedents and predicates that we can use as we come to market. But the key thing will be about having, you know, demonstrably safe and effective products,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high volume of data the company has already collected will allow it to collect insights into efficacy and safety “many times faster” than you’d expect under regular clinical trial circumstances, Blackwell argued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, ieso plans to use this round to build out its AI based therapy arm, and shore up a presence in the U.S. The team is expected to grow to about 200 people by next year, which will set up a push to go to market over in the next two years. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.stepzen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StepZen</a> stepped onto the scene at the end of last year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stepzen-snares-8m-seed-to-build-data-integration-api/">an $8 million seed round</a> and a vision for unifying APIs. Today that vision came into clearer focus as the company announced two new free GraphQL tools to help simplify API management.</p>
<p>StepZen CEO and co-founder Anant Jhingran sees the graph as part of what he calls &#8220;a fundamental transformation that&#8217;s taking place in how applications communicate with the back end.&#8221; As companies use increasing numbers of APIs to build software and connect systems, StepZen wants the graph to be at the center of API management, where it handles all of the various connections and dependencies between these APIs.</p>
<p>There is inherent complexity involved in crossing multiple applications to pull together all of the information about something that has interconnections. As an example, a company may want to pull all of the information about a customer together, but it lives in multiple systems. How do you see the connections between customer information, interaction data and previous orders. One of those comes from the CRM, one from marketing and customer service tools and one from an order management system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238578" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What StepZen wants to do is simplify the act of making those connections. &#8220;The fundamental thing is that while there are individual sub-elements, the use cases really connect the dots because that&#8217;s where the real power of the business [lies],&#8221; Jhingran explained.</p>
<p>To help with that, the company is releasing two free tools today. The first is GraphQL Studio, which helps companies create a map or flow that shows the connections between the various APIs your company uses, whether internal private ones or the public SaaS variety.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is not the case that developers only deal with private APIs. It&#8217;s not the case that developers only deal with SaaS APIs. And what we want to do is to enable both sides of the story, and our GraphQL Studio is really starting from &#8216;here are your pre-finished APIs&#8217; that you&#8217;re going to kind of pick and choose and then add your own secret sauce,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The second piece is GraphQL Federation, a tool that can take the various graphs inside an organization and can consolidate them into a single graph of graphs that lets companies see how the various pieces fit together. Being able to federate these small graphs has been a real challenge that StepZen wants to solve with this tool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, the idea is that in a team of teams, there&#8217;s no one graph, and therefore when you look at how applications consume data, they&#8217;ve got to connect across multiple graphs and get to a unified graph. And that&#8217;s what GraphQL Federation does,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that the company is offering both tools for free as a starting point for developers to build connections between various APIs, and as they move into more complex use cases, they can sign up for StepZen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once people start using the tools, some of them will say, &#8216;we need to kind of modify it a bit, or we need to add our own private data,&#8217; and that&#8217;s where we want people to sign up for StepZen, but we want people to succeed on this without even signing up.&#8221;</p>

The streaming music service today introduced a new &#8220;Netflix Hub&#8221; on its app, which will offer a centralized place for finding the official soundtracks, playlists and podcasts for top shows and movies on Netflix.</p>
<p>At launch, the Netflix Hub offers soundtracks and playlists from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXc3KPAjGyPdm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stranger Things</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX44eggCvVygr?si=f9b67c3380de47c7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Casa De Papel</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6lVCyaFY768wM8Xea6gTta?si=55b9325882e54b39" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Narcos: Mexico</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ahCzrtmSSap5KaeI7dJco?si=eb6b189ada23400d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outer Banks</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3LUdxlF9Gq90Jcd9Y24ZH8?si=ou_w_CrmRuOFRgudYbT9ig&amp;dl_branch=1&amp;nd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squid Game</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4d1XaejoQ5r4jdkV8k5SNJ?si=ILrT_4EBRjKTy7LTvRHRrA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tick, tick&#8230;Boom!</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5Hl0iWtr5b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bridgerton</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/539jKDvQomLMWGBEkjyTWX?si=Mov_a7zMTxqb_iA2GeuTlw&amp;nd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cowboy Bebop</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZWf7hUnPGOw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virgin River</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX1R30zLwU9ZL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On My Block</a> and others.</p>
<p>It will also include Netflix-tied podcasts, like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1v65XLQM0QVsAk1rZlpE7y?si=NoboZsnQSqOfPxWjgNz0tw&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Okay, Now Listen</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0e2HFBiiGl9hMjZsk4WIvW?si=TM8_sJAMTKqu85foBw_pUQ&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix Is A Daily Joke</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/490u5TbLKuI10Bh98nTRim?si=mn2eHojwRUq_PzBVco0AWw&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/10 Would Recommend</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3hDsTlBt1o1qIizN8phRzO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You Can&#8217;t Make This Up</a> and those that delve into popular shows, like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3a2j3rZCG7cT7yVdHFrMr4?si=bCQ-kT3wREeszYgv3h6f6w&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Crown: The Official Podcast</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/netflix-netflix_podcasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behind the Scenes: Shadow and Bone</a>, and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238577" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other music and fan experiences will be a part of the new destination as well, including an enhanced <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6IgPnyVYfHg?si=5ee0263deb8b4a4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">album</a> for the Netflix Western film, &#8220;The Harder They Fall,&#8221; which offers fans a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the soundtrack led by Jay-Z. In addition, there&#8217;s a content destination for &#8220;La Casa De Papel (Money Heist),&#8221; Part 5 Volume 2, and <a href="http://www.lacasadepapel.withspotify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a character matching experience</a> where fans get to play a game to find out which &#8220;La Casa De Papel&#8221; character they are &#8211;which feels a bit like a playing a BuzzFeed quiz.</p>

<p>The hub builds on Spotify and Netflix&#8217;s existing partnership, Spotify tells TechCrunch. The two companies have worked together on many official playlists, including, most recently, the enhanced album for &#8220;The Harder They Fall,&#8221; which had been available before the Hub&#8217;s debut. They also worked on the &#8220;Money Heist&#8221; content experience and the character-matching game ahead of today&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>Netflix didn&#8217;t purchase access to have a hub on Spotify&#8217;s app. In other words, it&#8217;s not an ad product, nor did any money exchange hands here. Instead, both companies see the potential in working together to serve their respective fan bases, where there&#8217;s naturally a lot of overlap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Netflix is not the only major company to debut a thematic &#8220;hub&#8221; on Spotify&#8217;s app. Recently, Spotify and Peleton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/spotify-partners-with-peloton-to-launch-new-playlists-featured-in-its-workout-hub/">announced a similar partnership</a> that introduced a &#8220;Curated by Peloton&#8221; Workout Hub featuring playlists from Peloton instructors. And outside its app, Spotify earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/spotify-partners-with-giphy-to-connect-users-with-artists-music-via-gifs/">partnered</a> with GIPHY to introduce users to music via artists&#8217; GIFs.</p>
<p>Making some of this Netflix content exclusive to Spotify may make sense for the streamer as the other large music and podcast provider on the market, Apple (via Apple Music and Apple Podcasts), is also now a Netflix competitor through its Apple TV+ streaming service. Spotify, at least as of yet, hasn&#8217;t expanded into Netflix&#8217;s core market, which makes them better suited as partners.</p>
<p>Spotify says that it plans to roll out more exclusive content to the Netflix Hub in the months ahead.</p>
<p>The Netflix Hub will available to all users, both Free and Premium, in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland and India.</p>
