										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A day spent driving a pre-production 2022 Mercedes Benz EQS provided an up-close look at what the German automaker has been doing with the billions of dollars it has dedicated to electrification.</p>
<p>The EQS is a meticulously designed flagship sedan that brings together the automaker&#8217;s MBUX infotainment system, a new electric platform and advancements in performance. It is an unapologetic pursuit to set a new benchmark for a full-size luxury sedan that happens to be electric.</p>
<p>The luxury electric sedan is meant to show American consumers what Mercedes can deliver (and will) in the future with EVs. And the stakes are high. The German automaker is banking on a successful rollout of the EQS in North America.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the beginning of a complete new era, because so far we had a completely flexible platform in place with hybrids, ICE, and BEVs,&#8221; said Christophe Starzynski, head of the EQ brand, who added that Mercedes will add three additional electric vehicles to its U.S. portfolio by 2025, including the EQE and two additional SUVs. &#8220;This is the first time that we really designed and developed and put all the technology in a battery electric vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EQS is the 17-foot long flagship derivative of the S-Class, Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s top-of-the-line luxury sedan that has a base price of $110,000. (So far, pricing on EQS hasn&#8217;t been revealed.) It&#8217;s stocked with its best tech to date. While most customers won&#8217;t appreciate all the doodads optioned on this car, they might enjoy knowing it&#8217;s all stored in that extensive infotainment cloud, or only a software update away.</p>
<h2>The first drive</h2>
<p>A fully loaded EQS is such a leap forward that it makes the new S Class already feel of another era.</p>
<p>The EQS 580 4Matic model I tested came spec&#8217;d out with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mercedes-unveils-hyperscreen-a-curved-56-inch-screen-for-its-flagship-eqs-electric-vehicle/">56-inch Hyperscreen</a>, head up display, acoustic glass, rear seat entertainment and an air filtration system, which Starzynski said pre-dates the pandemic, but naturally feels very of the moment.</p>
<p>At writing, the car&#8217;s exterior details are under wraps until its reveal April 15. The version I tested was partially cloaked, so I can&#8217;t tell you much about the sculpted nuances of its A pillar.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136904" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136904" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2136904 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg" alt="Mercedes-Benz-EQS" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_67.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2136904" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>My five-year-old daughter accompanied me on the test drive. We started at the Mercedes Manhattan dealership, where EQS was displayed in the store window. As I approached the car, the driver door automatically swung open with great fanfare. From the vantage point of her booster seat, my daughter played with the rear screen that hovered in front of her. She selected ambient lighting in pink and purple hues for the cabin. Her top takeaway: &#8220;It&#8217;s a sparkly rainbow ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>The backseat experience actually matters quite a bit, because EQS is chauffeur friendly, a prereq for luxury cars in China, the hub for EV sales for the next decade.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136905" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136905" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2136905 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg" alt="Mercedes EQS" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_56.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2136905" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, up front, for a tall person like myself, the spacious driver seat — accented by the pillow that cradled the base of my neck — was one the most comfortable rides I&#8217;ve had. Once belted in, the car is all mood. Cue the lighting and sound design bells and whistles.</p>
<p>As much as I could appreciate the sensation of sonic silver waves to compensate for that faint EV whir, we soon opted to blast the five year old&#8217;s current favorite Barbie soundtrack from the billowing set of 15 Burmester speakers. (There are unfortunate compromises involved in bringing a five year old along for the ride.)</p>
<p>Everything in the EQS emanates from the 56-inch Hyperscreen OLED, which is divided into three separate displays spanning door-to-door. In person, it&#8217;s not as intrusive as it appears in photos. Its elliptical contour has a gamer-like cockpit sensibility.</p>
<p>The MBUX functions are housed on the main 17.7-inch OLED screen, to the right of the steering wheel. The passenger can opt to personalize their own touchscreen, too. Inside the powerful computation system is 24-gigabytes of RAM and 46.4 GB per second RAM memory, and eight CPU cores.</p>

<h2>The user experience</h2>
<p>Simplicity is a hallmark of good design, embodied in the best of Apple products. In contrast, Mercedes has always been big on delivering a dizzying set of user experience options and providing multiple approaches to access information. That inclination carries over in the EQS, using controls on the steering wheel, arm rest, and main screen. On test drives, I find multiple options for controls distracting. I am never sure if it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t had the time to fully adapt, in the same way that a new feature on a smartphone takes a couple weeks to get used to, or if it&#8217;s plain overkill. I noted the heads up display, but it was one place too many to look during the time I spent in the car.</p>

<p>What intrigued me is that the MBUX system studies driver behavior over time. By the end of my ride, the screen module reminded me that perhaps I would like to tee up my active seat massage once more. In short, I could bypass the other controls and focus on what I wanted to use most. Voice commands were decent, though my high pitch tenor managed to stump the system. I have yet to meet an automotive voice system that understands me all the time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no room for analog in the EQS experience. The graphics are crisp, multidimensional-dimensional, and clear. One downside was that my fingerprints smudged on the touchscreens. Pro tip: bring along a good screen spritzer and cloth before shooting photos. Another small grip was that the steering wheel seemed to be designed for a person with much larger hands than mine, and it was a little awkward to access all the functions stored on the wheel, which forced me to glance down to find the right spots. I ended up relying on the MBUX center screen to adjust settings.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the EQS user experience is how it handled messaging about range. At all times, the various screens on the dash displayed how many miles I had left, if my calculations for my destination were realistic, and mapped where I could go to charge.</p>
<h2>The range</h2>
<p>About that battery. The model I drove had a 107.8 kWh battery pack powering two electric motors used in the all-wheel-drive system. The range according to European testing is 470 miles, but could drop down according to U.S. EPA testing standards. I drove about 125 miles roundtrip from Manhattan to a little town called Beacon and back without even worrying about recharging.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136906" style="width: 5257px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136906" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2136906 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg" alt="Mercedes EQS" width="5247" height="3498" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg 5247w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mercedes-Benz_EQS_Manhattan_58.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5247px) 100vw, 5247px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2136906" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes Benz</p></div></p>
<p>I pulled up the screen to plot out ChargePoint options presented one click away. It also distinguishes which stations have 200 kW DC fast-chargers available, which Mercedes says take about 15 minutes to recharge. To assuage consumers on battery life, Mercedes has added a warranty that covers loss of capacity of the battery, valid for a decade after purchase, or up 150,000 miles.</p>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>The drive itself delivered powerful performance, as one would expect with 517 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque at work. The EQS beats out competitors drag coefficient at .20, which is a fun car enthusiast fact, but not essential knowledge for regular drivers.</p>
<p>It always takes a moment to get comfortable driving a long saloon, but like the S Class, the EQS handles its proportions with grace, and it turns with ease due to standard rear-wheel steering. It mirrors the S-Class safety features and ADAS systems. The drive settings include classic and sport, achievable through steering wheel controls or through the armrest. I am generally a sporty driver, and I liked the peppy feedback that this mode delivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we will be developing it further,&#8221; Starzysnki said, adding that the ADAS features will improve via software updates. Customizable updates such as light settings are also available for download.</p>
<p>The biggest differentiator of the EQS drive is its battery recuperation system. Intelligent recuperation mode optimizes the battery and controls driver actions. Normal recuperation dialed down the interference. I played around with one-pedal driving on the highway. Drivers can also choose no support at all.</p>

<p>Mainstream EV adoption in the United States feels like its right around the corner &#8212; and it could come even faster than expected if President Biden&#8217;s infrastructure plan passes. But automakers will need to do much more than edge out Tesla if they hope to capture the attention and dollars of U.S. consumers. EVs accounted for just 1.8% of U.S. car sales in 2020, according to Experian and reported in Automotive News.</p>
<p>Sweeping change takes time, money and a long-term commitment. The next level Mercedes-Benz EQS edges the playing field one step closer to the tipping point when the EV part of the architecture is no longer newsworthy, but the expectation for a luxury vehicle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Recent roars from an investment firm, credited to put Indian startups on the global map in the past decade and a half, are turning local young firms into unicorns at a pace never seen before in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Tiger Global has finalized &#8212; or is in late stages of concluding &#8212; more than 25 deals with Indian startups this year. About 10 of those investments have been unveiled so far while the rest, spanning from a few million dollars to over $100 million, are in the pipeline for the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>The New York-headquartered firm, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/">closed a $6.7 billion fund</a>, last week led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">investments in social network ShareChat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-100-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/">business messaging platform Gupshup</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">investment app Groww</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">participated in fintech app CRED’s round</a>, helping all of these startups attain the much sought after unicorn status.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(A report in India speculated that Tiger Global plans to invest $3 billion of its new fund in Indian startups. TechCrunch understands the $3 billion figure is way off the mark.)</p>
<p>Tiger Global also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/infra-market-becomes-newest-indian-unicorn-with-100-million-fundraise/">invested in Infra.Market</a> and Innovaccer, two other Indian startups that turned unicorn earlier this year. (India has delivered 10 unicorns this year already, up from seven last year and six in 2019.)</p>
<p>And it is currently in advanced stages to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tiger-global-eyes-pharmeasy-stake-amid-e-pharmacy-consolidation/articleshow/81928880.cms">back epharmacy firm PharmEasy</a>, which also turned into a unicorn last week, fintech firm ClearTax (at possibly $1 billion valuation), crypto exchange CoinSwitch, insurer Plum, B2B marketplace Moglix (at over $1 billion valuation), social firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/tiger-global-in-talks-to-invest-in-young-indian-social-network-at-170-million-valuation/">Kutumb</a> and Koo (at over $100 million valuation, <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/04/twitter-clone-koo-tiger-global-100-125-mn/">per the CapTable</a>), healthtech firm Pristyn Care, and Bzaar (an FBA), and agritech Reshamandi, according to people familiar with the matter. (Some deals haven&#8217;t closed yet so the terms could change.)</p>
<p>No other investment firm has written checks of this magnitude to Indian firms this year &#8212; or ever &#8212; and the frenzy has reached a point where dozens of startup founders are scrambling to get an intro with Tiger Global partners.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever I need to get funded by Tiger&quot;</p>
<p>&mdash; arnav (@arnav_kumar) <a href="https://twitter.com/arnav_kumar/status/1380848075904716805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Tiger Global’s confidence in young Indian firms isn’t newly found. Its investment in Flipkart in 2009 and Ola in 2012 showed the opportunities and level of risk-appetite the U.S. firm was prepared to operate with in India, at a time when both the firms were struggling to raise money from some Indian investors.</p>
<p>Under its former partner Lee Fixel, the investment firm backed several young firms including online grocer Grofers, logistics startup Delivery, fashion e-commerce Myntra, news aggregator InShorts, electric scooter maker Ather Energy, music streaming service Saavn, fintech Razorpay, and web producer TVF.</p>
<p>A handful of startup founders, on the condition of anonymity, recalled their investments from Tiger Global, which they all said concluded within two to three weeks after the first call from the investment firm.</p>
<p>But the firm slowed down its investment pace when Fixel departed in 2019, and for nearly a year focused largely on backing SaaS startups.</p>
<p>Things have changed in recent quarters and Tiger Global has become more aggressive than ever before, said a venture capitalist, who has invested alongside Tiger Global in a few startups, on the condition of anonymity to be able to speak candidly.</p>
<p>The firm is now also exploring investment opportunities in months-old startups.</p>
<p>The investor quoted above pointed to Infra.Market as another example of Tiger Global’s new strategy. It wrote its first check to Infra.Market in 2019, when the B2B startup was just two years old.</p>
<p>“Tiger then wanted to see if the startup can grow and convince other investors to back them. So in December, Infra.Market raised money at about $250 million valuation. Two months later, Tiger Global closed the new round at $1 billion valuation,&#8221; the investor said.</p>
<p>While great for startups, it creates a challenge for some investors, another investor said.</p>
<p>When Tiger Global values a startup at a level that much of the industry can&#8217;t match, and tends to not lead the subsequent round, there are very few firms that can invest in the following financing round, the investor said.</p>
<p>On private forums and in recent weeks, Clubhouse, a number of investors have cautioned that the recent optimism shared by some investors could prove challenging to materialize. &#8220;Tiger Global has traditionally got very optimistic in India every two to three years. The problem is that when it&#8217;s not optimistic, we are supposed to pick the tab,&#8221; one investor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under Scott Shleifer [MD at Tiger Global and pictured above], things may be different,&#8221; the investor added. Looking at Tiger Global&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-tiger-globals-deal-machine">recent activities elsewhere in the world</a>, things sure look consistent &#8212; and India is positioned to be a key global playground for the firm &#8212; and several others &#8212; in the next few years.</p>
<p>India, the world&#8217;s third largest startup hub, is poised to produce 100 unicorns in the coming years, analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a report for clients last month. &#8220;India’s corporate landscape is undergoing a radical change due to a remarkable confluence of changes in the funding, regulatory and business environment in the country over the past two decades. An unprecedented pace of new-company formation and innovation in a variety of sectors has meant a surge in the number of highly-valued, as-yet unlisted companies,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The growth in highly valued companies has been enabled by a range of factors: (1) the natural shortage of risk capital in an economy with low per capita wealth has been addressed by a surge in (mostly foreign) private equity: these flows have exceeded public market transactions in each year of the last decade; (2) increase in teledensity and smartphone and internet penetration. Till 2005 less than 15% of Indians had a phone, versus 85% now; 700 mn-plus people have internet access now due to cheap data and falling smartphone prices (40% penetration now).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(3) deep-rooted physical infrastructure changes: nearly all habitations are now connected by all-weather roads compared to only half in 2000, and all households are electrified now vs. just 54% in 2001; (4) financial innovation is accelerating, courtesy the world-leading “India stack”, which has innovative applications like UPI built on a base of universal bank account access, mobiles, and the biometric-ID (Aadhaar), helped by greater data availability; and (5) development of ecosystems in several sectors that now provides a competitive advantage versus global peers; for example in technology (4.5 mn IT professionals) and pharma/biotech (several Indian firms can now afford US$200-300 mn of annual R&amp;D).&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome back to Week in Review!</p>
<p>Last week, I talked about Clubhouse&#8217;s slowing user growth. Well, this week news <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/twitter-is-said-to-have-discussed-4-billion-clubhouse-takeover">broke</a> that they had been in talks with Twitter for a $4 billion acquisition, so it looks like they&#8217;re still pretty desirable. This week, I&#8217;m talking about a story I published a couple days ago that highlights pretty much everything that&#8217;s wild about the alternative asset world right now.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><span class="s1">newsletter page</span></a>, and follow my tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny"><span class="s1">@lucasmtny</span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>If you successfully avoided all mentions of NFTs until now, I congratulate you, because it certainly does seem like the broader NFT market is seeing some major pullback after a very frothy February and March. You&#8217;ll still be seeing plenty of late-to-the-game C-list celebrities debuting NFT art in the coming weeks, but a more sober pullback in prices will probably give some of the NFT platforms that are serious about longevity a better chance to focus on the future and find out how they truly matter.</p>
<p>I spent the last couple weeks, chatting with a bunch of people in one particular community &#8212; one of the oldest active NFT communities on the web called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">CryptoPunks</a>. It&#8217;s a platform with 10,000 unique 24&#215;24 pixel portraits and they trade at truly wild prices.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wrote about the history and legacy of CryptoPunks, a vibrant $200 million NFT marketplace built around trading pixelated characters. There are only 10,000 of them and owning the cheapest one will cost you about $30k. <a href="https://t.co/X4iTSl6FjC">https://t.co/X4iTSl6FjC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lucas Matney (@lucasmtny) <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny/status/1380221886290780164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/6487">picture</a> sold for a $1.05 million.</p>
<p>I talked to a dozen or so people (including the guy who sold that one ^^) that had spent between tens of thousands and millions of dollars on these pixelated portraits, my goal being to tap into the psyche of what the hell is happening here. The takeaway is that these folks don&#8217;t see these assets as any more non-sensical than what&#8217;s going on in more traditional &#8220;old world&#8221; markets like public stock exchanges.</p>
<p>A telling quote from my reporting:</p>
<p><em>“Obviously this is a very speculative market… but it’s almost more honest than the stock market,” user Max Orgeldinger tells TechCrunch. “Kudos to Elon Musk — and I’m a big Tesla fan — but there are no fundamentals that support that stock price. It’s the same when you look at GameStop. With the whole NFT community, it’s almost more honest because nobody’s getting tricked into thinking there’s some very complicated math that no one can figure out. This is just people making up prices and if you want to pay it, that’s the price and if you don’t want to pay it, that’s not the price.”</em></p>
<p>Shortly after I published my piece, Christie&#8217;s announced that they were auctioning off nine of the CryptoPunks in an auction likely to fetch at least $10 million at current prices. The market surged in the aftermath and many millions worth of volume quickly moved through the marketplace minting more NFT millionaires.</p>
<p>Is this all just absolutely nuts? Sure.</p>
<p>Is it also a poignant picture of where alternative asset investing is at in 2021? You bet.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>
<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/">Amazon workers vote down union organization attempt</a><br />
</b>Amazon is breathing a sigh of relief after workers at their Bessemer, Alabama warehouse opted out of joining a union, lending a crushing defeat to labor activists who hoped that the high-profile moment would lead more Amazon workers to organize. The vote has been challenged, but the margin of victory seems fairly decisive.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-google-oracle-ruling/">Supreme court sides with Google in Oracle case</a><br />
</b>If any singular event impacted the web the most this week, it was the Supreme Court siding with Google in a very controversial lawsuit by Oracle that could&#8217;ve fundamentally shifted the future of software development.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/"><b>Coinbase is making waves</b></a><br />
The Coinbase direct listing is just around the corner and they&#8217;re showing off some of their financials. Turns out crypto has been kind of hot lately and they&#8217;re raking in the dough, with revenue of $1.8 billion this past quarter.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details/"><b>Apple share more about the future of user tracking</b></a><br />
Apple is about to upend the ad-tracking market and they published some more details on what exactly their App Tracking Transparency feature is going to look like. Hint: more user control.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/consumers-now-average-4-2-hours-per-day-in-apps-up-30-from-2019/"><b>Consumers are spending lots of time in apps</b></a><br />
A new report from mobile analytics firm App Annie suggests that we&#8217;re dumping more of our time into smartphone apps, with the average users spending 4.2 hours a day doing so, a 30 percent increase over two years.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/sonos-delivers-a-near-perfect-portable-speaker-with-the-new-sonos-roam/"><b>Sonos perfects the bluetooth speaker</b></a><br />
I&#8217;m a bit of an audio lover, which made my colleague Darrell&#8217;s review of the new Sonos Roam bluetooth speaker a must-read for me. He&#8217;s pretty psyched about it, even though it comes in at the higher-end of pricing for these devices, still I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing one with my own ears.</p>

<h2>Extra things</h2>
<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our Extra Crunch subscription service this week:</em><br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/"><b>The StockX EC-1</b></a><br />
&#8220;StockX is a unique company at the nexus of two radical transitions that isn’t just redefining markets, but our culture as well. E-commerce upended markets, diminishing the physical experience by intermediating and aggregating buyers and sellers through digital platforms. At the same time, the internet created rapid new communication channels, allowing euphoria and desire to ricochet across society in a matter of seconds. In a world of plenty, some things are rare, and the hype around that rarity has never been greater. Together, these two trends demanded a stock market of hype, an opportunity that StockX has aggressively pursued.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/how-to-build-the-right-team-for-a-billion-dollar-startup/"><b>Building the right team for a billion-dollar startup</b></a><br />
&#8220;I would really encourage you to take some time to think about what kind of company you want to make first before you go out and start interviewing people. So that really is going to be about understanding and defining your culture. And then the second thing I’d be thinking about when you’re scaling from, you know, five people up to, you know, 50 and beyond is that managers really are the key to your success as a company. It’s hard to overstate how important managers, great managers, are to the success of your company.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/"><b>So you want to raise a Series A</b></a><br />
&#8220;More companies will raise seed rounds than Series A rounds, simply due to the fact that many startups fail, and venture only makes sense for a small fraction of businesses out there. Every check is a new cycle of convincing and proving that you, as a startup, will have venture-scale returns. Moore explained that startups looking to move to their next round need to explain to investors why now is their moment.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Until next week,<br />

Unemployment </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/unemployment-rate-falls-march-employers-add-916000-jobs/story?id=76788420"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is falling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while interest rates are </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">staying low</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lots of new capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on offer, and some expectation that we’ll get back to Q1’s IPO wave in Q3. Throw in widespread vaccinations and a return to something akin to our old lives, and the world of business could be ready to accelerate further in short order. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are caveats, of course. Lots of folks are being left behind in the recovery. And vaccine hesitancy is as lethally stupid as it is surprisingly common. But anticipated summer economic conditions, strong markets and a general belief that the digital transformation’s acceleration will continue point to a coming hot(ter) period for tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is </span><a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/videos/Brooklyn-bridge-ventures-charlie-odonnell-interview/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good news for startups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re already starting to see anticipatory reporting on the matter. Wired’s </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-revs-up-for-hot-startup-summer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on venture capitalists telling startups to invest rapidly is worth reading. I’ll back it up by saying that it seems that most startups that I am chatting with every week had a solid-as-heck first quarter and aren’t worried about the second. If I am not accidentally speaking with only founders who are doing well and somehow missing legion startups that are struggling, it seems to be a pretty darn good time to build a tech company. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaid’s round from earlier this week underscores what I’m talking about. The API-powered consumer fintech company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/plaid-raises-425m-series-d-from-altimeter-as-it-charts-a-post-visa-future/">CEO Zach Perret told TechCrunch</a> how much the digitization of the world of financial services had accelerated in the last year. Yep. Startups that would have done well in more normal times are often seeing their market move in their direction. Often rapidly. That’s why Plaid is worth north of $13 billion today, nearly triple what it was worth in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the startups doing well, there’s ample cash on offer. Ramp’s latest round, a two-in-one, makes that point plain. So, if the broader economy and its technological sector do accelerate, expect wallets to open even further. As the temperature heats up, so too could the business climate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, how else can you explain </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clubhouse-funding/audio-app-clubhouse-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-4-billion-valuation-bloomberg-news-idUSKBN2BT2NQ?il=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Clubhouse news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next week The Exchange is digging into Q1 2021 venture capital numbers from around the world. We’ll see soon enough how big the start to the year was, but we have a guess.</span></p>
<h2>Kudo, Coinbase and Canva</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sticking to our theme of growth and a hot and warming climate for tech startups, a few more data points from the last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I caught up with the CEO of Kudo this week, a few days after his company announced a $21 million Series A round of funding. I covered the translation-as-a-service company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/kudo-raises-6m-for-its-real-time-translation-and-video-conference-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year when it raised a seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Per its chief executive Fardad Zabetian, the company had 14 employees last March. It now has 150 and has more than 50 open positions. That’s not the sort of growth you see off of merely a few capital raises. That’s growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monster quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlights how some technology work from the past decade is maturing in a lucrative manner. The company’s epic revenue growth and nearly hilarious profitability are going to make its impending direct listing an even bigger event than I had expected. Get ready for that on the 14th. (More from the original Coinbase listing </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ObC7ZUeOCd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five takeaways from Coinbase&#8217;s S-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/embed/#?secret=ObC7ZUeOCd" data-secret="ObC7ZUeOCd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there’s Canva, which just </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210406005342/en/Visual-Communications-Platform-Canva-Announces-USD-15-Billion-Valuation-Launches-Suite-of-Presentations-Products-for-the-Workplace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repriced itself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through a $71 million secondary transaction. The cloud design company is now worth $15 billion, up from around $6 billion last June, per Crunchbase data. Even more, the company announced a few growth metrics worth sharing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Canva has crossed the $500 million annualized revenue mark </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Canva grew 130% in the last year, and was profitable (though we don’t know of what sort)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Canva now has 55 million monthly active users</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not going public. Yes, you can laugh. I got the company to ask its CEO Melanie Perkins why that’s the case, and here’s what we got back:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no rush for us. We&#8217;re profitable and we&#8217;re very fortunate that we can still find investors that align to our vision and values. I often say that we&#8217;re just one percent of the way there with Canva. We have a huge vision to empower every team to achieve its goals through visual communication. We’ve still got a whole lot more to achieve and so no immediate plans for any public listing- there&#8217;s simply no rush for us right now.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me just say that you don’t only have to go public when there’s a rush to do so! You can do so merely to make us, the reporting class, excited about going to work, as there are new numbers to read!</span></p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was off for a bit of this week to recharge, so some news and notes you might have expected in the above missive may be missing. Rest assured that The Exchange is going to get bigger and better and more number-y and full of jokes when I get back. Someone is joining the little team, so we have big plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hugs, </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Most of the startups I give advice to about how to raise venture capital shouldn’t be raising venture capital,” an investor recently told me. While the idea that every startup isn’t venture-backable might run counter to the narrative to the barrage of funding news each week, I think it’s important to double click on the topic. Plus, it keeps coming up, off the record, on phone calls with investors!</p>
<p>As venture grows as an asset class, the access to capital has broadened from a dollar perspective, but I do think the difficulties that remain is an important dynamic to call out (and something no one talks about during an upmarket). Beyond the fact that only a small subset of startups truly can pull off scaling to the point of venture-level returns, it is still hard for even qualified founders to raise venture capital. Venture capital is still a heavily white, male-led industry, and as a result contains bias that disproportionately limits access for underrepresented founders.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/?tpcc=ECTW2020">So, you want to raise a Series A</a></li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/how-to-build-the-right-team-for-a-billion-dollar-startup/">Building the right team for a billion-dollar startup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Eniac founding partner Hadley Harris applied this dynamic to the current market boom in a <a href=" https://twitter.com/Hadley/status/1380145821413482501">recent tweet:</a><em> A lot of people are misunderstanding this VC funding market. More money is flowing into the market but the increase is not evenly distributed. The market believes winners can be much bigger but not necessary that there will be more winners. It’s still very hard for most to raise a VC.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To say otherwise is to gaslight the early-stage or first-time founders that have spent months and months trying to raise their first institutional dollars and failed. So ask yourself: Seed rounds have indeed grown bigger, but for who? What comes at the cost of the $30 million seed round? Are the founders that can raise overnight from diverse backgrounds? Are investors backing first-time founders as much as they are backing second- or third-time entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>The answers might leave you debating about the boundaries, and limitations, of the upcoming hot-deal summer.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/y-combinator-demo-day-dispo-due-diligence/">the disconnect between due diligence and fundraising</a> right now. Now we&#8217;ve moved onto the disconnect, and bifurcation, within first-check fundraising itself. There is so much more we can get into about the fallacy of “democratization” in venture capital, from who gets to start a rolling fund to the lack of assurance within equity crowdfunding campaigns.</p>

<p>We’ll get through it all together, and in the meantime make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">follow me on Twitter @nmasc_</a> for more hot takes throughout the week.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we will talk about fintech politics, the Affirm model with a twist, and sneakers-as-a-service.</p>
<h2><strong>Ex-Coinbase talks politics </strong></h2>
<p>The inimitable <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo </a>has been dominating the fintech beat for us, covering everything from the latest<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/uruguayan-payments-startup-dlocal-quadruples-valuation-to-5b-with-150m-raise/"> Uruguayan unicorn</a> to Acorn’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/acorns-scoops-up-pillar-a-fintech-backed-by-kleiner-perkins/">scoop of a debt management startup.</a> But the story I want to focus on this week is her interview with ex-Coinbase counsel &amp; former Treasury official, Brian Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">notoriously released</a> a memo last year denouncing political activism at work, calling it a distraction. In this exclusive interview, Brooks spoke about how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/blockchain-and-taking-the-politics-out-of-tech/">blockchain is the answer to financial inclusion</a>, and argued why politics needs to be taken out of tech.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We don’t want bank CEOs making those decisions for us as a society, in terms of who they choose to lend money to, or not. We need to take the politics out of tech. All of us do a lot of different things, and we have no idea on a given day, whether what we’re doing is popular with our neighbors or popular with our bank president or not. I don’t want the fact that I sometimes feel Republican to be a reason why my local bank president can deny me a mortgage.</em></p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>The Affirm for X model </strong></h2>
<p>While Affirm may have popularized the “buy now, pay later” model, the consumer-friendly business strategy still has room to be niched down into specific subsectors. I ran into one such startup when covering Plaid’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/plaid-accelerator-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-fintech-startups/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> inaugural cohort of startups in its accelerator program. </a></p>
<p>Here’s what to know: Walnut is a new seed-stage startup that is a point-of-sale loan company with a healthcare twist. Unlike Affirm, it doesn’t make money off of fees charged to consumers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our new podcast Found is now available, and the first episode features guest Iman Abuzeid, co-founder and CEO of Incredible Health. Abuzeid&#8217;s story of founding and building Incredible Health, a career platform for healthcare professionals focusing specifically on nurses, is all about a focused entrepreneur building a unique skill set, and acquiring the experience necessary to create a world-leading solution.</p>
<p>Abuzeid went to medical school and acquired her MD, but decided before residency to instead go get an MBA from Wharton, in order to pursue her dream of entrepreneurship, inspired by two generations of entrepreneurs in the family that preceded her. After eventually making her way to Silicon Valley and working in a couple of other startups in the healthcare space, Abuzeid took important lessons away from those experiences about what not to do when running your own company, and embarked on building her own with co-founder Rome Portlock, now the company&#8217;s CTO.</p>
<p>Incredible Health is tackling a huge challenge — the shortfall of availability of skilled nurses, and the lack of mature, sophisticated career resources to help those nurses in their professional life. COVID-19 threw those issues into stark relief, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/incredible-health-updates-its-healthcare-career-platform-to-help-nurse-hiring-cope-with-covid/"> Incredible Health adjusted its game plan to adapt to its users&#8217; needs</a>. Abuzeid tells us all about how she made those calls, and also how she <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/incredible-healths-hiring-platform-for-nurses-gets-15m-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">convinced venture investors to come along for the ride</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>

And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>

<p>The Epic Games versus Apple trial is nearing launch. The trial, which begins May 3 and is expected to drag on for weeks, will see the Fortnite maker attempting to argue that Apple&#8217;s control over the App Store &#8212; and the 30% commission it requires on in-app purchases &#8212; represents anti-competitive behavior from a monopoly that requires regulation under antitrust law. Apple, meanwhile, feels confident that it can demonstrate its not a monopoly as it faces competition across the market, not just in its App Store. It will also likely point to the commission decreases it recently made in the wake of the increased regulatory scrutiny. Apple now takes a smaller 15% cut from developers making less than $1 million in revenues.</p>
<p>New filings this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/epic-cries-monopoly-as-apple-details-secret-project-liberty-effort-to-provoke-fortnite-ban/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">detail Epic&#8217;s long-term program &#8220;Project Liberty,</a>&#8221; which describes how Epic planned its antitrust battle by forcing app stores to reject Fortnite for circumventing their payment mechanisms. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute">A filing from Epic also references</a> comments by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddie Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller that talk about how Apple locks users into its ecosystem with its services, including iMessage. Epic also argues that Apple uses security as a &#8220;pretext&#8221; for its commissions &#8212; even as a recent series of allegations (and threat of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">lawsuit</a>) from app developer Kosta Eleftheriou have demonstrated that Apple&#8217;s vetting process is failing to stop massive scams. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/08/epic-accuses-apple-of-using-security-as-a-pretext/">Epic also says</a> that allowing Apple to serve customers&#8217; refund requests leads to fraud because it doesn&#8217;t have the same visibility into the developer&#8217;s content that the developer itself does.</p>

<p>With the public release of iOS 14.5, which is expected soon, Apple will be shaking up the app economy with the launch of its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8h0btjq7">App Tracking Transparency framework</a>, or ATT. This requires iOS apps to begin prompting users for permission to track their users&#8217; activity, instead of just quietly doing so &#8212; generally without the user&#8217;s informed consent. Apple has said developers can explain in this prompt why they&#8217;re asking for this permission &#8212; for example, because they want to serve more personalized ads, perhaps. Tech giants like Facebook and Google, as well as many other ad-supported apps (and particularly social media apps), will be impacted by the change. Some have even gone so far as to try to find workarounds using non-IDFA methods, it&#8217;s been reported (IDFA being the current system that assigns a unique advertising ID to each device that is then tracked across the apps and websites a user visits). It was revealed <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/02/workaround-to-app-tracking-transparency/">last week</a> that Snapchat had investigated an IDFA alternative known as probabilistic matching, but claims it was just a &#8220;test.&#8221; Meanwhile, China&#8217;s largest tech companies &#8212; including Baidu, Tencent and ByteDance &#8212; <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snapchat-risks-apples-wrath-attempts-053334646.html">have been exploring</a> a state-backed IDFA alternative CAID.</p>
<p>This week, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details">made it clear</a> that &#8220;no tracking&#8221; without permission means just that.

<p>Facebook’s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, this week launched its latest experiment, Hotline, into public beta testing. The web-based application could be described as a mashup of Instagram Live and Clubhouse, as it allows creators to speak to an audience who can then ask questions through either text or audio. However, unlike Clubhouse, creators can opt to turn their cameras on for the event, instead of being audio-only. Currently, users sign in with Twitter and then verify their phone number to authenticate with the app. They can then type in their question to submit it to the speaker, who pulls them &#8220;on stage&#8221; to discuss. For now, the participants were audio-only and represented by a profile icon, but settings suggest that Hotline will test video for users in the future.</p>
<p>As the questions are asked, users can react with emoji, including clapping hands, fire, heart, laughter, surprise and thumbs up. And most importantly, unlike Clubhouse, Hotline events are recorded. Creators get both an audio and video recording that they could edit and upload elsewhere, including on other social networks. Because of its use of video, upvoted questions and recording, the app has a different vibe than Clubhouse &#8212; it feels more like a virtual event than a more casual space. Facebook is catering to this audience, too, by seeking out creators who are focused on doling out professional advice, it says.</p>
<p>Of note, Hotline is being led by Eric Hazzard, who joined Facebook when it acquired his app tbh, a positivity-focused Q&amp;A app.</p>

<p><strong>Still more betas</strong>. Apple this week <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/07/apple-issues-seventh-betas-for-ios-145-ipados-145-watchos-74">released its seventh betas</a> for iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 and other platforms, including Apple TV and Apple Watch &#8212; iOS 14.5 brings the rollout of App Tracking Transparency, which is why Apple is probably taking its time with this one.</p>
<p><strong>iOS 14 adoption has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/06/ios-14-adoption-surpasses-90-according-to-mixpanel/">now surpassed 90%</a></strong> according to data from Mixpanel. In December, 81% of phones were running iOS 14, now 90.45% are. Another 5.07% of users are running iOS 13, while 4.48% are running iOS 12 or older versions.</p>
<p><strong>Apple has been spotted testing tags in the App Store</strong> that will help guide users to more precise search results. The test, first reported by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/app-store-search-tags/">MacRumors</a>, had users encounter tags at the top of App Store search results when searching for popular terms like &#8220;photos&#8221; or &#8220;wallpaper,&#8221; that could help narrow results. Some users were running the iOS 14.5 beta when they saw tags, but others were not. It&#8217;s unclear if or when tags will launch to the wider public.</p>

The company has still not launched its own AirTags, a lost-item finder similar to Tile. Instead, it&#8217;s smartly positioning the Find My app as a platform anyone can plug into, in order to assuage anti-competitive concerns. The first items that will plug into Find My include VanMoof’s S3 and X3 e-bikes, Belkin’s SoundForm Freedom True Wireless Earbuds and the Chipolo ONE Spot tracker (a Tile rival).</p>

<p>However, one big name is notably missing from the lineup, and that&#8217;s AirTags&#8217; biggest competitor, Tile itself. Tile doesn&#8217;t want to hand over the direct customer relationship it has by way of its Tile app just to be included in Find My. And some have suggested Apple is propping up the Chipolo tracker to counter any arguments from Tile that it&#8217;s being anti-competitive with the launch of AirTags when they finally arrive.</p>

Apple says it complies with these requests where it&#8217;s legally required to do so. These requests, however, are not focused on Apple&#8217;s own editorial guidelines, which prohibit content that Apple itself chooses not to host.</p>

The process will give publishers feedback on their apps&#8217; approval status so they can resolve issues that could lead to policy violations. Google says the new app reviews are being rolled out gradually in 2021 with two features: app readiness and app claiming. The former will require publishers to link apps they want to monetize with one supported app store, so their app can then be reviewed. The process will check the app source, publisher&#8217;s ownership and policy compliance. App Claiming will provide a list of apps that are being monetized with their ad code but aren&#8217;t yet on their AdMob or Ad Manager account.</p>

<p>This relatively new AR app lets you add AR to anything &#8212; a textbook, a magazine cover, a piece of paper, a photo or any other flat real-world object. To use Halo AR, you first select the object and snap a photo, then choose which photo, video or 3D model you want to overlay on top of it. Teachers can use the app to &#8220;tag&#8221; their course materials with AR links of sorts to immersive content or videos. Or you could use it for fun to create a scavenger hunt in the house for the kids. The app is a free download in the Education category on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/halo-ar-add-ar-to-anything/id1534359793">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lightup.lens&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese regulators have hit Alibaba with a record fine of 18 billion yuan (about $2.75 billion) for violating anti-monopoly rules as the country seeks to rein in the power of its largest internet conglomerates.</p>
<p>In November, China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">proposed sweeping antitrust regulations </a>targeting its interent economy. In late December, the State Administration for Market Regulation said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba</a>, weeks after the authorities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">called off the initial public offering</a> of Ant Group, the financial affiliate of Alibaba.</p>
<p>SAMR, the country&#8217;s top market regulator, said on Saturday it had determined that Alibaba had been &#8220;abusing market dominance&#8221; since 2015 by forcing its Chinese merchants to sell exclusively on one e-commerce platform instead of letting them choose freely among different services, such as Pinduoduo and JD.com. Vendors are often pressured to side with Alibaba to take advantage of its enormous user base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since late 2020, a clutch of internet giants including Tencent and Alibaba have been hit with various fines for violating anti-competition practices, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/china-literature-alibaba-fined/">failing to clear past acquisitions with regulators</a>. The meager sums of these penalties were symbolic at best compared to the benefits the tech firms reap from their market concentration. No companies have been told to break up their empires and users still have to hop between different super-apps that block each other off.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, however, there are signs that China&#8217;s antitrust authorities are getting more serious. The latest fine on Alibaba is equivalent to 4% of the company&#8217;s revenue generated in the calendar year of 2019 in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we received the Administrative Penalty Decision issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China,&#8221; Alibaba said in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210409005494/en/Alibaba-Group-Has-Received-the-Administrative-Penalty-Decision-Issued-by-the-State-Administration-for-Market-Regulation-of-the-People%E2%80%99s-Republic-of-China">statement in response to the penalty</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We accept the penalty with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination. To serve our responsibility to society, we will operate in accordance with the law with utmost diligence, continue to strengthen our compliance systems and build on growth through innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.alizila.com/a-letter-to-our-customers-and-to-the-community/">separate letter</a> to its customers and users, Alibaba said it will work to &#8220;lower entry barriers and business costs of operating on our platforms&#8221; to ensure &#8220;an operating environment for our merchants and partners that is more open, more equitable, more efficient and more inclusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thick walls that tech companies build against each other are starting to break down, too. Alibaba has submitted an application to have its shopping deals app run on WeChat&#8217;s mini program platform, Wang Hai, an Alibaba executive, recently confirmed.</p>
<p>For years, Alibaba services have been absent from Tencent&#8217;s sprawling lite app ecosystem, which now features millions of third-party services. Vice versa, WeChat is notably missing from Alibaba&#8217;s online marketplaces as a payment method. If approved, the WeChat-powered Alibaba mini app would break with precedent of the pair&#8217;s long stand-off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Practically every film production these days needs some kind of visual effects work, but independent creators often lack the cash or expertise to get that top-shelf CG. <a href="https://www.wonderdynamics.com/">Wonder Dynamics</a>, founded by VFX engineer Nikola Todorovic and actor Tye Sheridan, aims to use AI to make some of these processes more accessible for filmmakers with budgets on the tight side, and they&#8217;ve just raised $2.5 million to make it happen.</p>
<p>The company has its origins in 2017, after Sheridan and Todorovic met on the set of Rodrigo Garcia&#8217;s film <em>Last Days in the Desert</em>. They seem to have both felt that the opportunity was there to democratize the tools that they had access to in big studio films.</p>
<p>Wonder Dynamics is very secretive about what exactly its tools do. <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/vfx-startup-wonder-dynamics-2-5-million-seed-funding-nikola-todorovic-tye-sheridan-steven-spielberg-joe-russo-1234730142/">Deadline&#8217;s Mike Fleming Jr</a> saw a limited demo and said he &#8220;could see where it will be of value in the area of world creation at modest budgets. The process can be done quickly and at a fraction of a traditional cost structure,&#8221; though that leaves us little closer than we started.</p>
<p>Sheridan and Todorovic (who jointly answered questions I sent over) described the system, called Wallace Pro, as taking over some of the grunt work of certain classes of VFX rather than a finishing touch or specific effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building an AI platform that will significantly speed up both the production and post-production process for content involving CG characters and digital worlds. The goal of the platform is to reduce the costs associated with these productions by automating the &#8216;objective&#8217; part of the process, leaving the artists with the creative, &#8216;subjective&#8217; work,&#8221; they said. &#8220;By doing this, we hope to create more opportunities and empower filmmakers with visions exceeding their budget. Without saying too much, it can be applied to all three stages of filmmaking (pre-production, production and post-production), depending on the specific need of the artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>From this we can take that it&#8217;s an improvement to the workflow, reducing the time it takes to achieve some widely used effects, and therefore the money that needs to be set aside for them. To be clear this is distinct from another, more specific product being developed by Wonder Dynamics to create virtual interactive characters as part of the film production process — an early application of the company&#8217;s tools, no doubt.</p>
<p>The tech has been in some small scale tests, but the plan is to put it to work in a feature entering production later this year. &#8220;Before we release the tech to the public, we want to be very selective with the first filmmakers who use the technology to make sure the films are being produced at a high level,&#8221; they said. First impressions do matter.</p>
<p>The $2.5M seed round was led by Founders Fund, Cyan Banister, the Realize Tech Fund, Capital Factory, MaC Venture Capital, and Robert Schwab. &#8220;Because we are at the intersection of technology and film, we really wanted to surround ourselves with investment partners who understand how much the two industries will depend on each other in the future,&#8221; Sheridan and Todorovic said. &#8220;We were extremely fortunate to get MaC Venture Capital and Realize Tech Fund alongside FF. Both funds have a unique combination of Silicon Valley and Hollywood veterans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wonder Dynamics will use the money to, as you might expect, scale its engineering and VFX teams to further develop and expand the product&#8230; whatever it is.</p>
<p>With their advisory board, it would be hard to make a mistake without someone calling them on it. &#8220;We’re extremely lucky to have some of the most brilliant minds from both the AI and film space,&#8221; they said, and that&#8217;s no exaggeration. Right now the lineup includes Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo (&#8220;obviously geniuses when it comes to film production and innovation&#8221;), UC Berkeley and Google&#8217;s Angjoo Kanazawa and MIT&#8217;s Antonio Torralba (longtime AI researchers in robotics and autonomy), and numerous others in film and finance who &#8220;offer us a wealth of knowledge when we’re trying to figure out how to move the company forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>AI is deeply integrated into many tech companies and enterprise stacks, making it a solid moneymaker in that industry, but it is still something of a fringe concept in the more creator-driven film and TV world. Yet hybrid production techniques like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/ilm-shows-off-the-new-stagecraft-led-wall-used-for-season-2-of-the-mandalorian/">ILM&#8217;s StageCraft</a>, used to film <em>The Mandalorian</em>, are showing how techniques traditionally used for 3D modeling and game creation can be applied safely to film production — sometimes even live on camera. AI is increasingly that part of the world, as pioneers like Nvidia and Adobe have shown, and it seems inevitable that it should come to film — though in exactly what form it&#8217;s hard to say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sometimes you’ve just got to confirm an unannounced product to put the rumors to bed, I guess. That was Google’s strategy this afternoon, following earlier rumors <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-5g-limited-release-us-japan">from Android Central</a> that a chip shortage had put the kibosh on the mid-budget phone.</p>
<p>In a comment to TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson noted, “Pixel 5a 5G is not cancelled. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.”</p>
<p>That time frame would put the device’s arrival around late-summer, meaning it won’t arrive in time for Google I/O in May, as some speculated. Interestingly, the company appears to be limiting the device&#8217;s availability to two countries &#8212; at least at launch. That could, perhaps, be due to earlier-reported component shortages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled">The Verge notes</a>, the company hasn’t been particularly precious when it comes to product announcements. The company took a similar approach ahead of the release of the Pixel. Either way, this isn’t exactly the standard big company approach to rumor denial, which is to either not answer or otherwise deflect.</p>
<p>Google may well be on edge about its Pixel line these days. The phone line hasn’t exactly taken the mobile world be storm, resulting in longstanding rumors that the company is looking to shake things up. That, in part, has seemingly been confirmed by some fairly high-profile exits.</p>
<p>Still, even while there have been issues on the premium side, the company’s budget &#8220;a&#8221; line has helped buoy its overall numbers. No word yet on specific specs, but the handset is not expected to be a radical departure from its predecessor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few companies have done better than Scale at spotting a need in the AI gold rush early on and filling that gap. The startup rightly identified that one of the tasks most important to building effective AI at scale — the laborious exercise of tagging data sets to make them usable in properly training new AI agents — was one that companies focused on that area of tech would also be most willing to outsource. CEO and co-founder Alex Wang credits their success since founding, which includes raising over $277 million and achieving break-even status in terms of revenue, to early support from investors including Accel&#8217;s Dan Levine.</p>
<p>Accel haș participated in four of Scale&#8217;s financing rounds, which is all of them unless you include the funding from YC the company secured as part of a cohort in 2016. In fact, Levine wrote one of the company&#8217;s very first checks. So on this past week&#8217;s episode of Extra Crunch Live, we spoke with Levine and Wang about how that first deal came together, and what their working relationship has been like in the years since.</p>
<p>Scale&#8217;s story starts with a pivot, and with a bit of rule-breaking, too — Wang went off the typical YC book by speaking to investors prior to demo day when Levine cold-emailed him after seeing Scale on Product Hunt. The Product Hunt spot wasn&#8217;t planned, either — Wang was as surprised to see his company there as anyone else. But Levine saw the kernel of something with huge potential, and despite being a relative unknown in VC at the time, didn&#8217;t want to let the opportunity pass him, or Wang, by.</p>
<p>Both Wang and Levine were also able to provide some great feedback on decks submitted to our regular Pitch Deck Teardown segment, despite the fact that Levine actually never saw a pitch deck from Wang before investing (more on that later). If you&#8217;d like your pitch deck reviewed by experienced founders and investors on a future episode, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">you can submit your deck here</a>.</p>
<h2>Knowing when to bend the rules</h2>
<p>As mentioned, Levine and Accel&#8217;s initial investment in Scale came from a cold email sent after the company appeared on Product Hunt. Wang said the team had just put out an early version of Scale, and then noticed that it was up on Product Hunt — it was submitted by someone else. The community response was encouraging, and it also led to Levine reaching out via email.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the side effects of that, one of the outcomes, was that we got this cold email from Dan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We really knew nothing about Dan until his cold email. So like many great stories that started with a bold, cold email. And we were pretty stressed about it at the time, because in YC, they tell you pretty definitively, &#8216;Hey, don&#8217;t talk to a VC during the batch,&#8217; and we were squarely in the middle of the batch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang and the team were so nervous that they even considered &#8220;ghosting&#8221; Dan despite his obvious interest and the prestige of Accel as an investment firm. In the end, they decided to &#8220;go rogue&#8221; and respond, which led to a meeting at the Accel offices in Palo Alto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last few days, we&#8217;ve published several articles recapping panels from last week&#8217;s TechCrunch Early Stage virtual conference.</p>
<p>Each story is based on an interview with a founder or investor who addressed some of the most common startup dilemmas. Predictably, they&#8217;re mostly focused on the <strong><em>how</em></strong> and <strong><em>why:</em></strong></p>
<p><i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/how-to-get-into-a-startup-accelerator/">How do I get into an accelerator?</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/building-and-leading-an-early-stage-sales-team-with-zoom-cro-ryan-azus/">When should I hire a sales team?</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/four-strategies-for-getting-attention-from-investors/">What&#8217;s the best way to earn attention from investors?</a></i></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch reporter Natasha Mascarenhas interviewed Kleiner Perkins partner Bucky Moore to get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/">sector-agnostic advice for founders who are ready to raise a Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Their conversation isn&#8217;t a rehash of basic best practices — Moore says the pandemic has fundamentally changed the way he does business: &#8220;I actually believe that first meetings over Zoom are here to stay; I think it&#8217;s far more efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the eventual return of live TechCrunch events, but each Early Stage recap includes video and a complete transcript. As ever, full articles are available for Extra Crunch members.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading — I hope you have a fantastic weekend.</p>

<p>Have you ever bought a pig in a poke?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a saying from medieval times: A farmer traveling on an unfamiliar road agrees to buy a baby pig in a bag from a passing stranger. Unfortunately, when the farmer gets back to their hut and opens the sack, there&#8217;s a kitten inside.</p>
<p>The risk of getting stuck with a counterfeit item when buying online is real, especially when it comes to sneakers, jewelry and other designer products. That&#8217;s why online marketplace StockX created a rigorous product verification and authentication process.</p>
<p>To date, its users have conducted more than 10 million transactions for sneakers, handbags, streetwear, watches and other high-end items that are often produced in limited quantities.</p>
<p>StockX&#8217;s prices are regulated and all transactional data is transparent, factors that have combined to help the platform reach a $2.8 billion valuation.</p>

<p>It appears that the slowdown in tech debuts is not a complete freeze; despite concerning news regarding the IPO pipeline, some deals are chugging ahead.</p>
<p>Alkami Technology joins a list that includes Coinbase’s impending direct listing and Robinhood’s expected IPO.</p>
<p>Texas-based Alkami Technology is a software company that delivers its product to banks via the cloud, so it’s not a legacy player scraping together an IPO during boom times.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the latest SEC filing from the software unicorn.</p>

<p>Last year could well have been the dawn of alternative protein in China. More than 10 startups raised capital to make plant-based protein for a country with increasing meat demand. Of these, Starfield, Hey Maet, Vesta and Haofood have been around for about a year; ZhenMeat was founded three years ago; and Green Monday is a nine-year-old Hong Kong firm pushing into mainland China.</p>
<p>The competition intensified further last year when American incumbents Beyond Meat and Eat Just entered China.</p>
<p>Although some investors worry the sudden boom of meat-substitute startups could turn into a bubble, others believe the market is far from saturated.</p>

<p>For those who follow the space, LG will be remembered fondly as a smartphone trailblazer. For well over a decade, the company was a major player in the Android category and a driving force behind a number of innovations that have since become standard.</p>
<p>LG continued pushing envelopes — albeit to mixed effect. But in the end, the company just couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>This week, the South Korean electronics giant announced it will be getting out of the “incredibly competitive” category, choosing instead to focus on its myriad other departments.</p>

<p>Electric cars and trucks seem to have everything going for them: They don’t produce tailpipe emissions, they’re quieter than their fossil-fuel-powered counterparts and the underlying architecture allows for roomier and often sleeker designs.</p>
<p>But the humble lithium-ion battery powering these cars and trucks leads a difficult life. Irregular charging and discharge rates, intense temperatures and many partial charge cycles cause these batteries to degrade in the first five to eight years of use, and, eventually, they end up in a recycling facility.</p>
<p>Instead of sending batteries straight to recycling for raw material recovery — and leaving unrealized value on the table — startups and automakers are finding ways to reuse batteries as part of a small and growing market.</p>

<p>Eghosa Omoigui, the founder and managing general partner of EchoVC Partners, has helped entrepreneurs navigate the first steps of starting a company and laying the right foundation early on.</p>
<p>Omoigui advocates for founders to develop their own All-22 tape — a tool used by professional football coaches that allows the viewer to see all 22 players on the field at the same time. It improves a coach’s line of sight, and, most importantly, helps avoid missing a critical motion or player.</p>
<p>The concept of this tool can — and should — be applied in the startup world as well, Omoigui said during the virtual TC Early Stage event. He explained what it means to have an All-22 tape and the steps founders should take to develop a skill set that will allow them to see and understand the playbook from all sides.</p>

<p>This year at Early Stage, TechCrunch spoke with Zoom Chief Revenue Officer Ryan Azus about building an early-stage sales team.</p>
<p>Azus is perhaps best known for leading the video-calling giant’s income arm during COVID-19, but his experience building RingCentral’s North American sales organization from the ground up made him the perfect guest to chat with about building an early-stage sales team.</p>
<p>We asked him about when founders should step aside from leading their startup’s sales org, how to build a working sales culture, hiring diversely, how to pick customer segments and how to build a playbook.</p>

<p>Katie Moussouris has been in cybersecurity circles since some of the world’s biggest tech companies were startups, and helped to set up the first vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs.</p>
<p>Moussouris, who runs consultancy firm Luta Security, now advises companies and governments on how to talk to hackers and what they need to do to build and improve their vulnerability disclosure programs.</p>
<p>At TC Early Stage, Moussouris explained what startups should (and shouldn’t) do, and what priorities should come first.</p>

<p>Product-led growth is all the rage in the Valley these days, and we had two leading thinkers discuss how to incorporate it into a startup at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021.</p>
<p>Tope Awotona is the CEO and founder of Calendly, which bootstrapped for much of its existence before raising $350 million at a $3 billion valuation from OpenView and Iconiq. And on the other side of that table (and this interview) sat Blake Bartlett, a partner at OpenView who has been leading enterprise deals based around the principles of efficient growth.</p>
<p>The two talked about bootstrapping and product-led growth, expanding internationally, when to bootstrap and when to fundraise, and how VCs approach a profitable company (carefully, and with a big stick). Oh, and how to spend $350 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The planet-loving folks at the <a href="https://www.soalliance.org">Sustainable Ocean Alliance</a> started an accelerator a couple years back focusing on very early-stage companies, but this year they&#8217;re expanding the program to accept those that have already closed their first round. The mix of experimental and (comparatively) proven approaches may help diversify the accelerator&#8217;s growing network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, amidst the onset of a global pandemic and mounting urgency related to solving the ocean’s greatest challenges, we received unprecedented demand for the <a href="https://www.soalliance.org/ocean-solutions-accelerator/">Ocean Solutions Accelerator,</a>&#8221; said the accelerator&#8217;s co-founder, Craig Dudenhoeffer. &#8220;It became clear to us that now more than ever, ocean tech startups need powerful community support, mentorship and access to those unique opportunities that truly propel their businesses. We decided to double our efforts and run two accelerator cohorts in 2021 in order to support 21 incredible innovators.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/ocean-solutions-accelerators-third-wave-tackles-a-new-set-of-aquatic-challenges/">Last year&#8217;s cohort</a> included companies creating robotic fish, kelp-based foods, artificial reefs, aquaculture animal feed and other interesting and potentially breakthrough products. But one thing they all have in common with each other and those from previous years is they are nearly all <em>very</em> early stage.</p>

<p>Having a prototype and taking on a big problem or market is a great start, but it&#8217;s also where a lot of startups wash out. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/coral-vita-cultivates-2m-seed-to-take-its-reef-restoration-mission-global/">Coral Vita</a> have powered through repeated disasters (in their case hurricanes and of course the pandemic) to raise money and move toward scaling up.</p>
<p>But others in the sadly undervalued conservation space still have a long road ahead before VCs think it&#8217;s worth taking a risk on them. Few check writers will see the problems and potential solutions up close and personal and make a personal connection with the driven and occasionally idealistic young founders, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/in-the-accelerator-over-the-sea/">those that I saw do that in Alaska were convinced</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WzIA6hn81g"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/in-the-accelerator-over-the-sea/">In the Accelerator over the Sea</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This year the accelerator will have two sequential cohorts, an early-stage one in June for pre-seed companies and another in September for those that have raised a seed or A round and have &#8220;a strong MVP.&#8221; Applications for both are open until April 12th, with 21 spots available. That&#8217;s Monday, so better get to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In expanding to two accelerator programs this year, we&#8217;re now able to provide highly curated content and tailored support to serve our entrepreneurs and meet them exactly where they&#8217;re at in their unique journeys to addressing our most critical ocean challenges,&#8221; said Dudenhoeffer.</p>
<p>While the organization is still small and the accelerator a relatively straightforward affair, the space that they are in is expanding and gaining credit among investors. Renewed attention and funding on climate change, ecological stewardship and alternative energy sources from the new Biden administration change the equations for startups and services in related industries; all of a sudden an idea that seemed wild a couple years ago makes perfect sense. With luck that means a bit of wind in the sails of entrepreneurs trying to save the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Efforts to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama appear to have failed, Facebook takes down fake review groups and a monkey plays Pong with its brain. This is your Daily Crunch for April 9, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Amazon beats back union push</strong></p>
<p>Union organizers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/">lost a much-publicized election</a> at Amazon&#8217;s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse, with more than half of the 3,215 ballots cast ultimately voting against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,&#8221; the company said in a blog post. &#8220;Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us. And Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum suggested that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/rwdsu-head-says-rerun-election-very-likely-following-amazon-union-vote-loss/">there will &#8220;very likely&#8221; be a rerun election</a>, and his organization is demanding &#8220;a comprehensive investigation over Amazon’s behavior in corrupting this election.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ureeka founder Melissa Bradley explains how to prepare for a virtual pitch, allocate time, how to close meetings with a clear list of action items, and what to avoid.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Melissa Bradley wears many hats. She&#8217;s the co-founder of a startup called Ureeka, an investor at 1863 Ventures, and a professor at Georgetown&#8217;s business school. So it&#8217;s not an understatement to say that she understands the fundraising process from every angle. And moreover, she has both invested and fundraised for her own startup during this last year, where the landscape has shifted drastically. At TechCrunch Early Stage, she led a session on how to nail your virtual pitch meeting.</p>
<p>Bradley covered how to allocate your time during the meeting, how to prepare, how to close out the meetings with a clear list of action items, and what to avoid.</p>
<p>You can watch the session or check out the full transcript below, but I&#8217;ve also pulled out a few highlights from the talk just for you.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Conversation &gt; Pitching</h2>
<p>One of the greatest shifts in the pitch landscape during the pandemic was the nature of meetings themselves. Because investors and founders can take 30 meetings a day from the comfort of their home, it means that conversation has been prioritized over presentation. Adding to the need for conversation is the fact that investors aren&#8217;t &#8216;getting to know you&#8217; IRL as they would in the past, and so how you interact (not just the content of your pitch) is critically important.</p>
<p>Bradley explained that planning for extra time to answer questions and go deep on strategy is more important now than ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now is the time to really have a conversation and deeply engage the investor in your story and your vision. You want to be conversational in nature, but still formal in tone. So you want to be respectful; you want to avoid jargon; you want to make sure it&#8217;s clear what you&#8217;re talking about. But it&#8217;s really much more of a two-way conversation than we&#8217;ve probably seen before. I think again, pace yourself, be really clear in advance how much time you have. One-third of the time should be spent on your pitch, and the other two-thirds, you should be prepared to field questions and really have that conversation. Pace yourself. Don&#8217;t rush through. If you only have 30 minutes, it&#8217;s probably not the best time to do a demo. You might want to follow up with a recorded demo or make an offer to do a demo afterwards. <em><strong>(Timestamp &#8211; 6:03)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>A review of job listings, company websites and LinkedIn shows that Lime and Dott are preparing to launch in London, while Lime, Superpedestrian and maybe even Spin are getting ready for New York. While the job posts don&#8217;t provide definitive proof that these companies have been awarded these coveted permits, it does identify which companies believe they will win.</p>

<h3><b>Dott, Tier and Lime for London?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been speculation that Dott, Lime and maybe Tier will be sharing the streets of London once the pilot takes off. Information on Dott’s and Lime’s websites, LinkedIn profiles and hiring pages show that they&#8217;re hiring for positions in the city. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Sources in the industry told TechCrunch that Tier had a London-focused job posting listed on its page that has since been taken down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dott, which doesn’t already appear to have a footprint in the United Kingdom, is hiring a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/dott/1e6c32b0-9d6d-48fc-b3f4-a35450badef5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-based operations manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “set up operations from scratch within the U.K.” They’re also hiring a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/dott/78ab7100-968b-425e-81c7-9db30ac85f27"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public policy manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be the “voice for the Dott U.K. market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dott&#8217;s website, a map showing service areas shows a little yellow flag over London. Clicking on the flag leads to a 404 “page not found” error page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime, a mobility company that appears to be swiftly taking over the world, already has a presence in London in the form of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/lime-puts-jump-bikes-back-on-london-streets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jump e-bikes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which made an appearance last summer. New job postings on LinkedIn suggests they&#8217;re preparing to expand. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s LinkedIn page reveals a call for a London-based </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2468099289/?refId=%2F4D1DeGAM%2By8FBOAHtY83w%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=Iu46GoQeCBTbKH0u65NHpg%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose responsibilities include building and implementing “the operational infrastructure to ensure market growth in the United Kingdom.” That gig was posted a week ago and they’re actively recruiting for it on LinkedIn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a month ago, Lime also posted a London-based </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2364137536/?refId=%2F4D1DeGAM%2By8FBOAHtY83w%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=HKFaSrR3Lu9Vxr37yD23Yg%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations manager </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">role, for which it appears to still be recruiting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voi might also still be in the running based on its job postings on LinkedIn. On Thursday, the company added a call for an </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2495249822/?refId=iPEgNhvu8RWSo83rrvagLw%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=HH3H%2Bk7GnAOTXkBp9gKFeQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ambassador supervisor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a six-month position in London. It seems to be an on-the-ground sort of role, and the temporary nature of it could have something to do with London’s year-long pilot. It’s also possible the company is just looking for someone in a central city to manage the other U.K. cities where Voi operates.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird has already been in London’s Olympic Park since the summer, and it </span><a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/olympic-park-legalization-how-bird-brought-e-scooters-to-uk/#:~:text=You%20can%20ride%20Bird's%20e,of%20lobbying%20for%20legislative%20change"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively lobbied for a change in London’s legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around scooters riding on roads or pavements. This presence could explain why Bird’s operating map highlights London, but to make matters more confusing, the company is hiring an </span><a href="https://www.bird.co/careers/?gh_jid=4258750003"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations associate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ostensibly handle London city operations and general U.K. operations. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superpedestrian, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has four new job posts up between its website and LinkedIn. On the site, there’s a call for a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/superpedestrian/88228461-304b-4ac0-9d84-b7eb0990b36d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief of staff who is ideally based in </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC to support the CEO. Also listed is a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/superpedestrian/9b94e33e-8fa6-48cc-afe6-fca8d3d933f2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> position; duties include “being responsible for the growth and success of our scooter share in New York and New Jersey.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On LinkedIn, Superpedestrian has posted two positions based in NYC. The first, posted a week ago, is an </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2483019826/?refId=b4Z7U61diRhPUxiz9vlnaA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=GDZHe%2FMrZ1Uti7TakXIkQw%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations associate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will handle things like scooter charging, safety inspections, deployment of scooters and scooter repair and assembly. The second is a </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2416394401/?refId=b4Z7U61diRhPUxiz9vlnaA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=aqan4Jcv6XtRSJ9TclTeUQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scooter mechanic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, posted a month ago, but to be fair the post does include the caveat: “If we are awarded the privilege of operating in NYC…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin also posted (about a week ago) an </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2473930979/?refId=LILWlsW2LY6y82OAPBSdAQ%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=TLwut3hpFmcF77q54xx82A%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based in New York. The employee hired for the position will be tasked with “Spin’s day-to-day operations, managing drivers and mechanics and building a highly efficient operations team.” It’s not precisely indicative of the Ford-owned company winning NYC, but the job does appear to be involved with on-the-ground tasks. The post also hints that the new hire would be leading the build-out and deployment of Spin’s vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a huge presence in Europe but absolutely none in the United States as of yet, Voi has been hoping NYC would be its entry into the country. The company hasn’t posted any NYC-specific job ads, but its job board features a locations dropdown menu that includes NYC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Bird is adding to the mess of guesses with two LinkedIn job posts based in New York. The </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2457588069/?refId=0S0DwtAk2i1eLYXaYYAQJA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=KADK0VOiB%2F6YYHXJMc4yKQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> position, posted four weeks ago but still actively recruiting, appears to require someone to be pretty locally involved. The </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2494000853/?refId=0S0DwtAk2i1eLYXaYYAQJA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=gHjW6Ie6uSb7%2BkVFr%2FXcfQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations associate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> role, posted on Wednesday, is a bit more vague about whether the new hire would be on the ground in NYC or not. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://shorthand.com/">Shorthand</a>, the Australian startup behind a no-code platform that allows publishers and brands to create multimedia stories, has raised $10 million Australian (just under $8 million U.S.) from Fortitude Investment Partners.</p>
<p>CEO Ricky Robinson told me via email that this is Shorthand&#8217;s first institutional round of funding, and that the company has been profitable for the past two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been lucky enough to grow to where we are today through an entirely inbound, organic model that leverages the beautiful content that our customers create in Shorthand to generate leads,&#8221; Robinson wrote. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve been testing other channels with some success and the time is right to ramp up those other marketing initiatives. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll be spending this funding, while also investing heavily in our product to keep Shorthand at the cutting edge of storytelling innovation for the web.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those customers include the BBC, Dow Jones, the University of Cambridge, Nature, Manchester City FC and Peloton. For example, BBC News used Shorthand to create <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/nxVbFidDbs/mission-jurassic">this story about searching for dinosaur fossils</a>.</p>
<p>The Shorthand website extols the virtues of &#8220;<a href="https://shorthand.com/features/scrollytelling">scrollytelling</a>,&#8221; where a reader can trigger interesting transitions and effects simply by scrolling through the story. Robinson suggested that this is a way to make stories feel interactive and engaging &#8220;without asking your audience to learn how to interact with it.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpOFXNR55wo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As you can see in the demo video above, Shorthand offers a fairly straightforward drag-and-drop interface for adding different text and media elements, as well as effects. Robinson said that unlike other tools like Webflow and Ceros, Shorthand was designed to be used by editors and writers. And although Shorthand does support the use of themes and templates, he said that&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to provide flexibility without making writers get into the weeds of web design or making them use complicated design tools,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The focus should be at the level of <em>story</em> design, not <em>web</em> design, and that’s really what sets Shorthand apart, and it&#8217;s why our customers are able to consistently produce highly engaging, award-winning content for their audiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company also says that demand has only increased during the pandemic, with usage quadrupling in the fourth quarter of 2020 and subscription revenue up 8.8% month-over-month in February of this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Open-source software gave birth to a slew of useful software in recent years. Many of the great technologies that we use today were born out of open-source development: Android, Firefox, VLC media player, MongoDB, Linux, Docker and Python, just to name a few, with many of these also developing into very successful for-profit companies.</p>
<p>While there are some dedicated open-source investors such as the Apache Software Foundation incubator and OSS Capital, the majority of open-source companies will raise from traditional venture capital firms.</p>
<p>Our team has raised from traditional venture capital firms like Speedinvest, open-source-specific firms like OSS, and even from more hybrid firms like OpenOcean, which was created by the founders and senior leadership teams at MariaDB and MySQL. These companies understandably have a significant but not exclusive open-source focus.</p>
<p>Our area of innovation is an open-source AutoML server that reduces model training complexity and brings machine learning to the source of the data. Ultimately, we feel democratizing machine learning has the potential to truly transform the modern business world. As such, we successfully raised $5 million in seed funding to help bring our vision to the current marketplace.</p>
<p>Here, we aim to provide insights and advice for open-source startups that hope to follow a similar path for securing funding, and also detail some of the important risks your team needs to consider when crafting a business model to attract investment.</p>
<h2>Strategies for acquiring open-source seed funding</h2>
<p>Obviously, venture capitalists find many open-source software initiatives to be worthy investments. However, they need to understand any inherent risks involved when successfully commercializing an innovative idea. Finding low-risk investments that lead to lucrative business opportunities remains an important goal for these firms.</p>
<p>In our experience, we found these risks fall into three major categories: market risk, execution risk, and founders’ risk. Explaining all three to potential investors in a concise manner helps dispel their fears. In the end, low-risk, high-reward scenarios obviously attract tangible interest from sources of venture capital.</p>
<p>Ultimately, investment companies want startups to generate enough revenue to reach a valuation exceeding $1 billion. While that number is likely to increase over time, it remains a good starting point for initial funding discussions with investors. Annual revenue of $100 million serves as a good benchmark for achieving that valuation level.</p>
<h2>Market risks in open-source initiatives</h2>
<p>Market risks for open-source organizations tend to be different when compared to traditional businesses seeking funding. Notably, investors in these traditional startups are taking a larger leap of faith.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">However the outcome of today’s vote count turned out, there was one thing we knew for certain: it wasn’t going to mark the end of the battle between Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. With voting having broken overwhelmingly in Amazon’s favor, the union was quick to challenge the results.</p>
<p>The RWDSU was quick to offer TechCrunch a statement from President Stuart Appelbaum after no votes broke the 50% threshold, noting, “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon&#8217;s behavior in corrupting this election.”</p>
<p>Amazon, unsurprisingly, was quick to take a victory lap. In a blog post credited to “Amazon Staff,” the company writes:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Thank you to employees at our BHM1 fulfillment center in Alabama for participating in the election. There’s been a lot of noise over the past few months, and we’re glad that your collective voices were finally heard. In the end, less than 16% of the employees at BHM1 voted to join the RWDSU union. It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the company was quick to state that the election is “over,” the RWDSU is hopeful, both in terms of future organizing at the Bessemer warehouse and for what the movement will mean for unionizing efforts at Amazon, going forward.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AIQ7k0ThKS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/">More tech workers are starting to unionize</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More tech workers are starting to unionize&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/embed/#?secret=AIQ7k0ThKS" data-secret="AIQ7k0ThKS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a press conference held earlier today, Appelbaum suggested that Amazon told workers that they would have to vote against the union if they wanted to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>“We believe a rerun election is going to be very likely,” the union president told media. “I think that if Amazon considers this a victory, they may want to reconsider it. At best, it’s a Pyrrhic victory. Look at what happened during this period. We exposed atrocious working conditions at Amazon for everybody to see.”</p>
<p>Appelbaum’s comments seem to refer, in part, to numerous reports of workers urinating in bottles over concerns about stringent quotas. In the midst of an aggressive social media campaign at the apparent behest of CEO Jeff Bezos, the company initially denied reports, before conceding they may apply to some drivers. Amazon was quick to deflect blame to broader industry issues, however.</p>
<p>“Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union,” the company added in its post. &#8220;Our employees are the heart and soul of Amazon, and we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, take their feedback, make continuous improvements, and invest heavily to offer great pay and benefits in a safe and inclusive workplace. We’re not perfect, but we’re proud of our team and what we offer, and will keep working to get better every day.”</p>
<p>A key part to the RWDSU’s challenge is a ballot box the company reportedly pressured the USPS to install, in defiance of a National Labor Relations Board ruling. Appelbaum said the box “creates the impression of surveillance.”</p>
<p>He added that the union has already been in communication with workers at other Amazon facilities, explaining, “We have already started talking to workers at other facilities, as well, before this election.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Amazon has offered the following statement about the ballot box, &#8220;We said from the beginning that we wanted all employees to vote and proposed many different options to try and make it easy. The RWDSU fought those at every turn and pushed for a mail-only election, which the NLRB&#8217;s own data showed would reduce turnout. This mailbox—which only the USPS had access to—was a simple, secure, and completely optional way to make it easy for employees to vote, no more and no less.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers say APKPure, a widely popular app for installing older or discontinued Android apps from outside of Google&#8217;s app store, contained malicious adware that flooded the victim&#8217;s device with unwanted ads.</p>
<p>Kaspersky Lab <a href="https://securelist.com/apkpure-android-app-store-infected/101845/?/kaspersky/april8/index.html">said that</a> it alerted APKPure on Thursday that its most recent app version, 3.17.18, contained malicious code that siphoned off data from a victim&#8217;s device without their knowledge, and pushed ads to the device&#8217;s lock screen and in the background to generate fraudulent revenue for the adware operators.</p>
<p>But the researchers said that the malicious code had the capacity to download other malware, potentially putting affected victims at further risk.</p>
<p>The researchers said the APKPure developers likely introduced the malicious code, known as a software development kit or SDK, from an unverified source. APKPure removed the malicious code and pushed out a new version, 3.17.19, and the developers <a href="https://apkpure.com/apkpure/com.apkpure.aegon/versions">no longer list</a> the malicious version on its site.</p>
<p>APKPure was set up in 2014 to allow Android users access to a vast bank of Android apps and games, including old versions, as well as app versions from other regions that are no longer on Android&#8217;s official app store Google Play. It later launched an Android app, which also has to be installed outside Google Play, serving as its own app store to allow users to download older apps directly to their Android devices.</p>

<p>APKPure is ranked as <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/apkpure.com">one of the most popular sites</a> on the internet.</p>
<p>But security experts have long warned against installing apps outside of the official app stores as quality and security vary wildly as much of the Android malware requires <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/android-malware-system-update/">victims to install malicious apps</a> from outside the app store. Google scans all Android apps that make it into Google Play, but some have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/android-users-tricked-adware-apps/">slipped through the cracks</a> before.</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted APKPure for comment but did not hear back.</p>
