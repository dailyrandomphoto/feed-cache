										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many real estate technology companies are developing technology that is in competition with, or could potentially replace, real estate agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One startup that aims to help agents succeed and flourish with its technology and “bundled business services,” </span><a href="http://www.place.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $100 million in a Series A round at a valuation north of $1 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s growth equity business led the investment, which included participation from 3L Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235361" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round and company caught our attention for a couple of reasons. For one, prior to this financing, Place says it had not raised any external capital. Also, impressively and refreshingly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place shared specifics around financials, saying that it was profitable from its first year in business: in 2020, the company’s top line revenue exceeded $85 million with more than $11 million in profit. In 2021, the company expects it will exceed $150 million in top line revenue.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place emphasizes that it is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a brokerage. Rather, the two-year-old company describes itself as a “broker agnostic technology and business services solution” that works with top real estate producers from a variety of independent brokerage brands in the U.S. and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Place wants to help real estate salespeople &#8212; regardless of what brokerage they are affiliated with &#8212; become business owners. More than 10,000 agents use its technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bellingham, Washington, startup is targeting the “top 20%” of agents as customers. Those agents, it claims, serve the majority of consumers that need to buy, sell or invest in real estate. Place co-founders and co-CEOs Ben Kinney and Chris Suarez have firsthand knowledge of the industry &#8212; each have two decades of experience as licensed real estate agents themselves.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place says it can provide agents with assistance in administrative support, marketing and branding, lead generation, accounting, legal, human resources, back-office infrastructure and training for all positions so that “they have more time to help buyers buy and sellers sell.” The end result, Kinney said, is that those agents see “significant increases” in their production, including growing sales volume, increasing agent productivity and more than doubling their bottom-line profitability. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235368" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235368" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235368 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235368" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Place</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We provide a technology platform that provides top agents every tool and service they need to run their business all in one place,” Suarez told TechCrunch. “Our goal is to simplify the homeownership process for both agents and consumers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also provides property search as well as mortgage, title and insurance services for buyers as part of its effort to serve as a “one-stop shop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most real estate agents don’t receive benefits, unless employed by specific startups that hire them as full-time employees. Kinney says that Place </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provides “industry unique benefits” such as health insurance for agents who average 2 sales a month, stock purchase plans and revenue share when agents recruit other agents in an effort to help</span> &#8220;make it easier to recruit and retain&#8221; to their teams.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the luxury real estate space, the startup powers brands such as The Bucher Group, Elizabeth Olcott and Associates, The Level Up Group, PDX Property Group and Spinelli Residential Group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to expand its products and services, continue to invest in its technology and, naturally, toward hiring. Presently, Place has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">300 employees, up from 200 at the end of 2020. It anticipates boosting its headcount to 700 to 1,000 in 2022, according to Suarez. The startup also wants to scale into new markets and go deeper in existing markets; it is currently in 100 across the U.S. and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Pate, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a vice president in the growth equity business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said his firm was impressed by the fact that Place</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> built its software first, specifically for top agent teams, and has seen strong commercial traction selling it standalone under its Brivity brand.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, he said, Place recognized that top agents need more than just software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They need a full-stack offering that fully abstracts away the complexity of running a business. It is rare that we can invest in a full-stack business with clear validation of the technology on a standalone basis,” Pate wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that Goldman views the company&#8217;s ability to serve agents across any brokerage affiliation as differentiated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t need to leave your current brokerage to join Place,” he said. </span></p>
<p>Of course, Place is not the only company in this space. In late June, Side, a real estate technology company that works to turn agents and independent brokerages into boutique brands and businesses, raised “$50 million-plus” in a funding round that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/real-estate-tech-startup-side-raises-50m-more-at-a-2b-valuation-as-it-preps-for-an-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than doubled its valuation</a> to $2.5 billion. At the time, the startup said it was prepping for an IPO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The cloud may be the direction that much of enterprise IT is moving today, but it still remains a major source of security issues, with some 98% of all enterprises in a <a href="https://www.cybertalk.org/2021/10/20/key-cloud-security-statistics-that-will-reshape-your-cloud-perspectives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent survey</a> reporting that they have contended with a cloud-related security breach in the last 18 months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, a startup called <a href="https://laminarsecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laminar</a> is coming out of stealth with $37 million in funding with a solution to address how that issue plays out in public cloud architecture, specifically with &#8216;agent-less&#8217; technology it claims can monitor for data leakages, and fix them, faster than other approaches to cloud security on the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The funding is being disclosed for the first time now to coincide with the company&#8217;s launch, but it actually comes in two tranches: a $32 million Series A led by Insight Partners with SentinelOne, TLV Partners and Meron Capital participating, and a $5 million seed round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">SentinelOne, a specialist in endpoint security, is the obvious strategic investor in that list, but Insight has been a strategic partner of sorts for Tel Aviv-based Laminar, too. That&#8217;s because the startup has been leaning on <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/onsite/business-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insight Ignite</a>, a division of the VC that pairs portfolio companies with potential customers to grow their business. Laminar says that its tech has been tested by &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of CISOs through the program, with a portion of those progressing into becoming actual customers when the service commercially launches in 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s always notable when a company that has yet to publicly roll out a product, much less sign up a customer, manages to raise a substantial round of funding. The reason is often that the founders in themselves are impressive enough to merit the bet, and that is the case with Laminar, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Co-founders Amit Shaked (CEO) and Oran Avraham (CTO) are both veterans of Unit 8200, the famous Israeli military intelligence service that has been the breeding ground for so many other entrepreneurs in the country. Friends from childhood, Avrhaham led a team that was a four-time winner of Google&#8217;s <a href="https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capture the Flag</a> online security competition, and when he was just 17, he identified the first iPhone 3G baseband vulnerability. Shaked worked for some time at Magic Leap. At the time of writing, they are still both under 30.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are a number of tech companies that have identified the shortcomings of cloud services when it comes to cybersecurity, making for a variety of approaches to solving that problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">In the realm of public cloud services, others providing solutions include the likes of Netskope (which earlier this year was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/cloud-security-platform-netskope-boosts-valuation-to-7-5b-following-300m-raise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued</a> at $7.5 billion, speaking to the business opportunity here); Microsoft (which most recently beefed up its cloud-based cybersecurity profile with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/microsofts-cyber-startup-spending-spree-continues-with-cloudknox-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition</a> of CloudKnox earlier this year); vArmour (which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/varmour-the-multi-cloud-security-startup-raises-58m-en-route-to-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approaching an IPO</a>); and many, many more.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Laminar&#8217;s belief is that it has built technology that is faster and easier to use, and is more geared to the realities of how cloud services are designed: apps and services are built and run across multiple public clouds (in Laminar&#8217;s case it&#8217;s main activity today is centered around Azure, Google Cloud and AWS, Avraham told me).</p>
<p>Laminar&#8217;s approach, Shaked said, is different for another reason, too: it is built around the idea of being proactive rather than reactive. &#8220;It&#8217;s more about preventing data from leaking rather than assuming something happened or already went wrong,&#8221; he said. Typically large enterprises are operating on hybrid cloud systems, using three or four providers across multiple geographics, &#8220;and that makes it more complex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its technology is &#8220;agentless&#8221; and asynchronous to put less strain on network operations and data flow, which the company says contrasts with much of how existing cloud security is built using either agents on end points or proxies that filter (and slow down) traffic.</p>
<p>The system, as Shaked described it, starts by building a picture of a company&#8217;s managed and unmanaged data landscape (that is, both data used actively in services, and data produced through those services but then simply placed in &#8220;shadow&#8221; datastores). This is then used as a basis for a mass-scale monitoring operation around how the network is behaving: systems are set up for &#8220;sanctioned&#8221; data movements, and so when data changes or moves for any other reason, it gets flagged, stopped, and fixed.</p>
<p>Emmet Keeffe, an operating partner at Insight who founded Insight Ignite, said the VC was interested in what Laminar had built was because it fit well with how it saw the market evolving and a gap that was emerging.</p>
<p>Previously, he said, enterprises were just paying lip service to the concept of digital transformation. &#8220;It was just the theatre of digital in 2018,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most of what was happening was not real digital change. That all changed in March 2020&#8221; &#8212; when Covid-19 hit &#8212; &#8220;when we saw a massive unlocking of digital. Then, the first thing that needed to be rethought was cybersecurity.&#8221; In essence, &#8220;fully unlocking the cloud,&#8221; as Keeffe described it, has essentially led to unlocking too much data, too. &#8220;We came to Laminar because this really needed to be solved, market-timing wise.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s very notable that SentinelOne, a specialist in endpoint security, is investing here, too: it makes one wonder if the company might potentially be exploring how it might augment the work it already provides with a cloud-native approach as well, and how it might use Laminar as a partner (or more?) down the line to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Data and APIs are mission critical in the functioning of today’s digital society,” said Tomer Weingarten, CEO, SentinelOne, in a statement. “Securing data wherever it resides is the foundation of our Singularity XDR platform &#8212; we see Laminar’s approach as complementary in helping our customers secure data in a cloud-first world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.plugpagamentos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plug Pagamentos</a> (Plug) announced a $2.7 million seed round, led <a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Costanoa Ventures</a>&#8216; <a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/amy-cheetham-named-partner-at-costanoa-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest partner</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cheetham</a>. Other investors in the round included <a href="https://www.vervecapital.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verve Capital</a> and <a href="https://norte.capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norte Ventures</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Plug, based in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, wants to make its home-market more amenable to online commerce. In an interview, the startup described Brazil as a hostile market for payments, with a quarter of transactions failing and merchants paying a multiple of what they pay in other markets to process payments.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; part of Y Combinator&#8217;s past Summer 2021 cohort &#8212; offers an array of payment processors via an API, along with a number of payment options. In short, the company wants to make payments in Brazil less onerous, perhaps unlocking economic potential in its market while driving commerce through its developer hook.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235212" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Plug told TechCrunch that its product is out in the wild, and is seeing its total payment volume (TPV) and client base double monthly. The company first hit the market in April.</p>
<p>The startup raised its latest capital using a SAFE, or simple agreement for future equity, which featured a cap, though we&#8217;re not sure how high the conversion ceiling was set.</p>
<p>Cheetham said that she met Plug CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexliaovilhena/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Vilhena</a> in May, before the company was a part of Y Combinator, but that a deal to put Costanoa&#8217;s capital into the business didn&#8217;t come together until months later. Cheetham was already looking into the payments orchestration space, the market where Plug competes, before she met the company. The company fit into her thesis, even if its target market wasn&#8217;t where she had initially looked for a company to back. Once graduated from its accelerator program, the startup was ready to take on more capital.</p>
<p>For fun, here&#8217;s how TechCruch covered the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">during the August-era Y Combinator demo day cycle</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.plugpagamentos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plug</a>: One API to process payments across multiple providers. Alex Vilhena says they take a 1% cut while saving teams up to 30% in processing fees and have processed over $230,000 to date.</p></blockquote>
<p>In our mid-November chat, Vilhena said that the 1% rate was aimed at his company&#8217;s first customers, and that he wants to get the number down to a median figure of 0.5%. For larger customers, the rate could fall as low as 0.2% he hypothesized.</p>
<p>Plug&#8217;s round fits neatly into the boom of Latin American fintech investment that we&#8217;ve observed for some time. Its project implies that there is still quite a lot of room in its home region to build. That there is still such large obstacles to online activity in Latin America is notable, given that the region&#8217;s startup market is about to push a mega-unicorn live on the U.S. public markets in short order.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Toyota bZ4x, the first electric vehicle under the automaker&#8217;s new bz brand, will come to U.S. in mid-2022 with an estimated range of up to 250 miles.</p>
<p>The vehicle is nearly identical to the Subaru Solterra, which along with the bZ4x was showcased at the Los Angeles Auto Show that kicked off Nov. 17. Both the bZ4x and the Solterra are the product of a partnership between Toyota and Subaru to jointly develop a platform dedicated to battery electric vehicles. There are a few slight differences between the two vehicles, the taillights being one example. Still, the casual observer might have a hard time distinguishing the Solterra from the bZ4x.</p>

<p>Toyota first revealed the production version of the bZ4x <a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/all-electric-bz4x-production-model-announced-in-japan/">for the Japanese market</a> back in October. While the U.S. version is essentially the same, with the exception of the right-hand drive, the range figures are new. This is still Toyota&#8217;s internal estimate, not the official EPA one that is expected to be announced closer to its production date. The 250-mile range is for the XLE front-wheel drive models of the bZ4x. The range for the all-wheel drive version was not announced.</p>
<p>The all-electric vehicle is part of Toyota&#8217;s all-of-the-above approach to lower carbon emissions — a stance it is sticking to even as the industry has homed in on a battery electric centric approach. During an event this week, Toyota executives repeated the company&#8217;s strategy to offer a range of mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid, battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.</p>

<p>Other automakers including GM have made commitments to shift completely to battery electric vehicles in the future; Toyota isn&#8217;t budging. The company has said it plans to offer about 70 electrified models globally by 2025. Of those, there will be 15 battery electric vehicles, including seven that will be under the bZ, meaning &#8220;beyond zero,&#8221; brand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By the end of the decade, Toyota estimates 2 million of the 10 million vehicles it sells annually will be battery electric. Another 2 million will have internal combustion engines. The remaining 8 million vehicles, or 80% of its portfolio will be hybrids, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-app-mac-091514744.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1">Amazon</a> has escalated its fight with Visa: Starting on January 19th, 2022, the e-commerce giant will <a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonHelp/status/1460899797053976577" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">stop accepting</a> Visa credit cards issued in the UK. It notified Amazon UK customers in an email about the change, blaming the high fees Visa charges for credit card transactions. Buyers can at least continue using their Visa credit cards throughout the holidays, but after that, they&#8217;d have to switch to a Visa debit card or another credit card like a Mastercard or an AMEX.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers. These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise. As a result of Visa’s continued high cost of payments, we regret that Amazon.co.uk will no longer accept UK-issued Visa credit cards as of 19 January, 2022. Customers can continue to use all debit cards (including Visa debit cards) and other non-Visa credit cards to shop on Amazon.co.uk. With the rapidly changing payments landscape around the world, we will continue innovating on behalf of customers to add and promote faster, cheaper, and more inclusive payment options to our stores across the globe.&#8221;</p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235564" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, a Visa spokesperson said the company is disappointed that &#8220;Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.&#8221; They added: &#8220;When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins.&#8221; They also said that Visa is working towards a resolution with the e-commerce giant so that cardholders can keep on using their UK-issued Visa credit cards on the website &#8220;without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting that Amazon has a much better relationship with other credit card providers. The e-commerce giant currently has a partnership <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Platinum-Mastercard/dp/B01LSOD0ZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">with Mastercard</a> for consumer credit cards and with AMEX for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Business-American-Express-Card/dp/B07V3GD6PJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">business cards</a> in the UK.</p>
<p>The companies may be engaging in a public war in an effort to get better terms from each other. Amazon has been putting pressure on the credit card brand over the past few months and started <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/amazon-to-introduce-05-surcharge-for-visa-credit-card-transactions-in-singapore" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">imposing</a> a 0.5 percent surcharge on Visa credit card purchases on its Singapore website on September 15th. A month-and-a-half after that, Amazon also started imposing a surcharge on Visa transactions <a href="https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/amazon-takes-visa-battle-to-australia/606055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">in Australia</a>. In both instances, the company offered customers a gift card (AU$20 and SG$30) to add an alternative payment method that isn&#8217;t a Visa credit card.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a 2019 <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/za/Documents/risk/za-The-future-of-payments-in-South-Africa%20.pdf">report by Deloitte</a>, about 80% of South Africans have a bank account but only 24% of them make more than three transactions monthly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other African countries, South Africa also has a functioning credit system with the prevalent use of credit cards. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, expensive value-added services like credit cards do not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> address the needs of underbanked people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital payments gateways, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have a unique use case, particularly when they can help people use their basic bank accounts to make payments. <a href="https://ozow.com/">Ozow</a> is one such player. Coming off a year of exponential growth, it has raised a $48 million Series B to provide more alternative payment solutions to its millions of merchants and consumers.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese internet giant Tencent led the round, with other investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Harvest Fund participating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder and CEO <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/thomas-pays">Thomas Pays</a> started Ozow in 2014 to drive financial inclusion through open banking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company allows consumers to access their internet banking platform when they make transactions online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a call with TechCrunch, Pays said that before Ozow, manual EFT processes were the popular options to carry out transactions online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, most fintechs and banks did not recognize the need for using bank payments to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pays launched Ozow to automate the manual EFT process consumers used to pay across e-commerce, point-of-sale, e-billing or P2P methods. According to Pays, he wanted Ozow to “make it seamless for consumers to pay in three clicks.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you looked at e-commerce, point of sale, e-billing or P2P payment seven years ago, it was always a fragmented market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, if I want a point of sale device, I need to go to a company like Yoco. If I want to accept payments via card on my e-commerce site, I need to go to a PayU,” the CEO stated in an interview with TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we wanted to address was a central platform that could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provide solutions to e-commerce, point of sale, e-billing and peer to peer payment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform, which caters to more than 47 million bank account holders, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> works this way</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. First, consumers select Ozow as a payment option when shopping online or in-store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, they choose their bank (from all ten major South African banks), log in with their online banking details, and Ozow automates the payment process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All merchants need to have is a bank account and a “smart-enabled device” to receive payments. Ozow’s clients include leading enterprise companies, such as MTN, Vodacom, Shoprite Group, Takealot and Uber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ozow is free for individual users. Merchants can also use the payments gateway for free in the first 12 months, or up to $65,000 in processing value per month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also works with distributors and payment service providers and resellers of its product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They get charged a percentage fee that varies between 1.5-2.5% for every successful transaction made via Ozow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EFTs represented about 4% of the volume of sales in e-commerce stores in South Africa before Ozow came into the picture. Now that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> volume has grown to an average of about 30%, and EFTs have become South Africa’s second most popular payment option (after cards) for e-commerce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pays says Ozow is creating automated bank-to-bank payment solutions for over 47 million bank account holders and more than 100 industries in South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the company’s Series A raise of  $2.5 million in 2019, Ozow has seen a 100% year-on-year growth of its business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It processes over $100 million in transaction volume per month across thousands of merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are also seeing a growth in new users, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in excess of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 140,000 per month. That’s quite an incredible growth and adoption,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">certainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to the consumer and merchant education that we had to go through over the past seven years as it was quite an innovative solution that no one was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> familiar with before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2016 to 2017, Ozow raised a combined $1.2 million in angel and seed rounds, and up until now, its total raise stood at $3.7 million from backers such as Kalon Ventures. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this Series B round has increased that number to $51.7 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pays is particularly excited about the company’s new investors that made this happen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lead investor, Tencent committed almost half of the total raised, about $20 million, Pays tells me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an honour to bring on board Tencent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Harvest Fund. This is a validation of our role in transforming the banking industry through the development of innovative, convenient and more inclusive payment solutions for everyone,” he said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a side note, Reid Hoffman was also involved in the round as he chaired the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst’s investment committee approval</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the new funds, Ozow hopes to drive fintech regulation to ensure that more people access payment services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re working </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the regulators to drive open banking, and that includes our collaboration with government and industry partners to rollout RPP,” the company said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though 8 out of 10 South Africans own a bank account, over 70% of all retail payment volumes and 89% of the country’s transactions in its informal economy are still cash-based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ozow’s plan with the RPP (Rapid Payment Programme) is to create an instant payment ecosystem that would give people the ability to make real-time payments using simple identifiers, such as mobile numbers or email addresses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO mentioned that Ozow also plans to expand its team from 100 to 250, including hiring employees in its new European office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the funds will also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be directed at</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mergers and acquisitions and pan-African expansion to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">four countries in the next six months: Namibia, Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya.</span></p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/faster-deals-less-diligence-the-african-startup-market-mirrors-its-larger-rivals/">piece</a> that African venture capital raised during the first half of 2021 was about twice the funds raised in H2 2020. Having raised more than $3 billion already, the continent is set to trounce historical records of venture capital raised this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Partly as a result of modern employment trends, and partly as a result of the pandemic’s effect on the world of work, there’s an increasing gap between traditional full-time employment and freelancing. So-called ‘job pairing&#8217; splits a full-time position between two people to reduce working hours without sacrificing the career continuity of those involved.</p>
<p><a href="http://roleshare.com">Roleshare</a> is a talent marketplace that matches professionals with each other so they can both apply and share one full-time job. The startup has now raised an initial pre-seed funding round of over $550,000 from largely UK-based super angels to build a global &#8220;rolesharing” marketplace and is now committed to launching with &#8220;large multi-sector organizations”, it says.</p>
<p>The idea here is that companies end up being able to both retain their top talent, as well as bring in new talent at the same time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235233" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sophie Setareh Smallwood, co-founder and co-CEO of Roleshare, told me over a call: “Job-sharing has been around for some time. It started to become a thing in the 70s when women started to become more active in the workforce. In the private sector, it&#8217;s something that has happened in an ad hoc capacity, whether it&#8217;s about juggling parenting duties or whatever.”</p>
<p>Since senior strategic roles are not really “part-time-able”, job-sharing becomes an interesting solution, she told me.</p>
<p>“But it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s easy to solve for, right? There&#8217;s an interpersonal element of putting two people together, to, in essence, share the responsibilities of a job.</p>
<p>Roleshare says it makes all this easier for companies to find out if any of their roles are able to be ‘job shared’ and then matches-up candidates. Individuals can add their jobs for free (clearly a &#8216;trojan horse&#8217; into the enterprise), or companies can, for a fee. This means it provides liquidity of talent for companies seeking to make some roles a job-share.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Roleshare quotes a UK study that shows employees who share jobs are 30 percent more productive than those who do not, because it helps with work-life balance and alleviates job-related stress. It can also increase diversity, skills, and greater business continuity inside companies, says the startup.</p>
<p>“Our solution has been described as “third way” by MIT Sloan Management Review” Smallwood told me over email.</p>
<p>She added that the “competitive landscape is broad (talent marketplaces / flexible working / knowledge worker + Gig Economy)” but that there are “not very many direct competitors, except for a few players like tandemploy (DE), duome (U.K.), jobpairing (US), among others.”</p>
<p>According to the World Economic Forum, by 2027, 50 percent of the workforce will be freelance. An MIT Sloan Management Review/Deloitte survey indicated that nearly 90 percent of managers consider external workers to be part of their workforce.</p>
<p>Setareh Smallwood added: “What makes us unique is our team (ex PayPal, Facebook, ebay), and our story. Roleshare didn’t exist when I needed it, so I quit Facebook to build it. We are the only talent marketplace that allows companies to source talent pairs for specific roles internally and externally, our platform matches talent from both sides to co-apply and share roles. We also uniquely allow talent to post their existing jobs as shareable as a form of direct sourcing.”</p>
<p>Roleshare has been backed by a number of European angels including Ian Hogarth, Azeem Azhar, Gabbi Cahane, Brendan Gill and Thish Nadessan among several others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the years we&#8217;ve seen wearables measuring every aspect of your body, but lung capacity is more esoteric than most. Sylvee is a brand new wearable from <a href="https://respiralabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Respira Labs</a> which continuously measures lung function &#8212; perfect for COPD and asthma patients, and other people who may have temporarily reduced lung function. A certain pandemic that affects lung function springs to mind, in particular.</p>
<p>Sylvee is a product that&#8217;s worn at the lower part of the rib cage, and it promises to easily and continuously assess lung function without having to blow into anything. The wearable patch has embedded speakers and microphones that measure changes in acoustic resonance. The company claims that this is a good proxy for changes in lung air volume &#8212; which is the basis of pulmonary function testing.</p>
<p>The tech is fantastically clever. Sylvee generates noise through its speakers, and then uses the microphones to measure the sounds that are generated. The theory is that if there are air cavities, this changes the quality of the sound, much like if you were to tap a drum head on a drum set, before filling the drum with cotton, wool or liquid and doing the same. Obviously, these are lungs &#8212; I&#8217;m not a doctor, but I have to assume that there are typically air cavities in there. The wearable uses the data it collects to measure lung volume, capacity, rate of flow and any trapped air.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233526" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Well-established science shows that air trapping can be measured with more than 90% accuracy using low-frequency sound. There is a clear difference in the acoustic resonance spectra of COPD patients versus healthy controls,&#8221; explained Dr. Maria Artunduaga, Respira Lab’s founder and CEO. &#8220;With more than 100 million Americans affected by COPD, COVID-19 and asthma, and with an aging population, it can be lifesaving to remotely and accurately monitor lung function and discover a problem early enough to avoid serious consequences. Our goal is to flag abnormalities early, enable earlier treatment at home and empower patients to manage their own health.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233580" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TorsoApp.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233580" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233580" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TorsoApp.png" alt="" width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TorsoApp.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TorsoApp.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TorsoApp.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TorsoApp.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TorsoApp.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TorsoApp.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2233580" class="wp-caption-text">Sylvee is worn on the ribcage. It produces sound &#8212; and captures the resonance of the lungs &#8212; to determine lung health. <strong>Illustration:</strong> Respira Labs</p></div></p>
<p>The product &#8212; Sylvee &#8212; is named after Artunduaga&#8217;s grandmother, who suffered from COPD and died after symptoms quickly worsened without detection.</p>
<p>&#8220;The device facilitates early diagnosis and management of acute deterioration, which is what respiratory patients must avoid. We provide vital information to doctors and patients so they can make the medical treatment changes earlier and prevent hospitalizations, Dr. Artunduaga said. &#8220;This is what happened with my grandmother. She suffered from COPD and had a sudden exacerbation of her symptoms and tragically died. I left my medical career and devoted myself to devise the Sylvee because of this terrible and common outcome.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Respira Labs has set a goal of achieving 90% accuracy in measuring air trapping by pursuing a large trial of more than 500 patients located both in the U.S. and internationally. They also intend to publish in top journals by late 2022. The device is currently in prototype, with FDA clearance expected within the next 18 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has developed a bad reputation for hosting dangerous viral &#8220;challenges&#8221; on its app, which at their worst, have led to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/08/27/tiktok-bans-milk-crate-challenge/5618315001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious injury</a> or death &#8212; as in the case of the blackout challenge that prompted Italian regulators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">to take action against</a> the social network this year to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users/"> remove underage users</a>. More recently, the app has made headlines for challenges that have encouraged students to<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/10/08/slap-teacher-tiktok-challenge-condemned-tiktok-and-schools/6048654001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> hit teachers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/tiktok-devious-licks/">destroy school property</a>. As the potential threat of further regulation looms, TikTok today is sharing the results of its research into viral challenges and hoaxes, as well as how it&#8217;s taking action.</p>
<p>To date, TikTok has often tried to downplay its involvement in viral challenges.</p>
<p>In October, <a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokComms/status/1445813823198220295?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok denied that</a> the &#8220;slap a teacher&#8221; dare was a TikTok trend, for example. After a child died from trying the blackout challenge, TikTok released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">a statement that said</a> the company found no evidence of any challenge involving asphyxiation on its platform. It repeated this claim again during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-dodges-questions-about-biometric-data-collection-in-senate-hearing/">a recent Senate hearing</a> devoted to the topic of minor safety on social platforms. But Sen. Blackburn (R-TN) told TikTok&#8217;s representative that her staff had found the &#8220;pass out videos,&#8221; along with other disturbing content.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235048" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, TikTok is releasing the results of its own internal research into harmful challenges and hoaxes.</p>
<p>The company said it launched a global project a few months ago into this topic, which included a survey of more than 10,000 teens, parents and teachers from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Indonesia, Mexico, the U.K., the U.S. and Vietnam. It also commissioned an independent safeguarding agency, Praesidio Safeguarding, to write a report detailing the findings and its recommendations. A panel of 12 leading teen safety experts were additionally asked to review the report and provide their own input. Finally, TikTok partnered with Dr. Richard Graham, a clinical child psychiatrist specializing in healthy adolescent development, and Dr. Gretchen Brion-Meisels, a behavioral scientist specializing in risk prevention in adolescence, to offer further guidance.</p>
<p>The data the report uncovered is worth examining, as it speaks to how social media can be a breeding ground for harmful content, like these viral challenges, because of how social platforms are so heavily used by young people. And young people have a much larger appetite for risk due to where they are in terms of their psychological development.</p>
<p>As Dr. Graham explained, puberty is this extraordinary period that works to prepare a child to transition to adult life. It&#8217;s a time of &#8220;massive brain development,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of focus now on understanding why teens do the things they do &#8212; because those judgment centers are being revised again in preparation for more complex decision-making and thinking in the future,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Dr. Graham said young people&#8217;s brains are developing in terms of abstract thinking, the recognition of more complex psychological and emotional states and more sophisticated consideration of relationships. And as all this is underway, their desire to learn about the world around them increases &#8212; and this can include a desire, at times, to engage in riskier activities and to test themselves or win peer approval. Sometimes these &#8220;dangerous&#8221; activities are relatively harmless, like watching a scary movie or riding a rollercoaster. But other times, teens and other young people may choose to engage with something that they believe will really stretch them in some way, and this attracts them to riskier challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes they&#8217;re going to&#8230;bite off more than they can chew, and have an experience that in a way traumatizes them at least in the short-term, but [the teens&#8217;] aspiration is to grow,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>In addition, viral challenges, in general, can appeal to teens&#8217; desire for approval from friends and peers because they result in likes and views. But the way teens assess whether challenges are safe has flaws &#8212; they tend to just watch more videos or ask friends for advice. Parents and teachers, meanwhile, have often been hesitant to talk about challenges and hoaxes for fear of prompting more interest in them.</p>
<p>The study found that most teens aren&#8217;t participating in the most dangerous challenges. Only 21% of global teens were participating in challenges, and only 2% participated in those that are considered risky. An even smaller 0.3% have taken part in a challenge they considered to be &#8220;really dangerous.&#8221; Most thought participation in challenges was either neutral (54%) or positive (34%), not negative (11%). And 64% said participation had a positive impact on their friendships and relationships.</p>
<p>The research also examined hoax challenges &#8212; like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Whale_Challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Whale</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momo_Challenge_hoax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momo</a> &#8212; which propagate the belief there&#8217;s a bad actor directing the children to engage in harmful activities that escalate to self-harm or suicide. Sixty-one percent of teens said they search for more information on hoaxes when they come across them to try to verify if they&#8217;re real, but a lot of confusion tends to remain around the hoaxes. Teens suspect people who repost the hoaxes are doing so for likes and views (62% believe this) or because they think the hoax is real (60% believe this). Forty-six percent of teens exposed to hoaxes sought support or advice, which signals teens would benefit from resources that help them to make sense of hoax material.</p>
<p>Though the research indicates there&#8217;s much left for social media platforms to do in order to address problems related to user safety, TikTok&#8217;s response here is fairly minimal.</p>
<p>The company today announced it&#8217;s adding to its Safety Center <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/online-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new section</a> dedicated to challenges and hoaxes, and it&#8217;s revising some of the language used in its warning labels that appear when people search for hoaxes linked to suicide or self-harm, based on the researchers&#8217; suggestions.</p>
<p>Considering the relatively minor nature of these changes &#8212; essentially a help doc and some revised text &#8212; it&#8217;s interesting to note that TikTok livestreamed a presentation about its research to the media for an hour on Monday ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, and emailed the full 38-page research report to reporters. In doing so, it seems as if TikTok wants to differentiate itself from Facebook, where damning internal research was kept quiet until <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043377310/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> came forward with thousands of documents indicating Facebook knew of its problems and failed to take action.</p>
<p>TikTok wants to be viewed as meaningfully engaged in the research process, but ultimately, the changes it&#8217;s making don&#8217;t solve the problem. At the end of the day, harmful content is a moderation challenge and a problem that stems from the nature of social media itself. Eliminating harmful content would require a system that&#8217;s designed from the ground up to <em>not</em> incentivize the shocking or outrageous in exchange for likes and views. That&#8217;s not how most social media is built.</p>
<p>TikTok additionally said it will look for sudden increases in violating content, including potentially dangerous behavior, linked to hashtags.</p>
<p>For example, if a hashtag like #FoodChallenge, which is commonly used to share food recipes and cooking inspiration, began to see spikes where more content was violating TikTok&#8217;s policies, then the moderation team would be alerted to look for the causes of this spike so they could take action.</p>
<p>Or, in other words, TikTok says it will now better moderate content &#8212; something users thought the company was doing anyway.</p>
<p>The full research report is below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cym.bio/about/">Cymbio</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup has raised $20 million in a Series B round, which saw the participation of two new backers, Chris North, an ex-Amazon executive, and Jeff Weiser, formerly of Shopify.</p>
<p>The funding was led by Corner Ventures, with participation from Udi Angel, Vertex Ventures, and Yuval Tal, founder and president of Payoneer.</p>
<p>Cymbio, a B2B dropship automation platform, is planning to use the new funding to grow its global footprint by establishing an office in Europe and expanding its team in the US.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235511" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company was founded in 2015 by Roy Avidor, Mor Lavi and Gilad Zirke, driven by their passion for eCommerce and a realization of the challenges faced by brands and retailers in digital commerce. The platform was built to connect brands with retailers and/or marketplaces.</p>
<p>“Cymbio is laser-focused on serving brands, enabling sales growth while relieving manual, error-prone, and time-consuming processes,” said Avidor, the startup’s CEO.</p>
<p>“We are humbled and excited to work with so many trailblazing operators and visionaries, and together join our mission of creating a connected commerce world. This next stage allows us to continue innovating and supporting brands’ growth with additional product offerings, expanding partnerships and our global footprint”.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126737" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126737" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2126737 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?w=680" alt="Cymbio Founders" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126737" class="wp-caption-text">Left to Right: Roy Avidor Co-founder &amp; CEO, Gilad Zirkel Co-founder &amp; CTO, Mor Lavi Co-founder &amp; COO</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today’s new funding announcement comes about seven months after the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/cymbio-series-a/">raised $7 million in a Series A round</a>, which the company used to expand its sales and marketing team, and its technology.</p>
<p>Cymbio is also planning to add new offerings to its core automation platform to expand “actionable data analytics and enhance its low code integration capabilities”, which will allow brands to easily connect with hundreds of retailers and marketplaces with only a few clicks.</p>
<p>“Cymbio’s technology stack is paving the future for brands that sell online. The company has built the infrastructure for the next generation of eCommerce, with a platform that uniquely supports brands’ growth,” said co-founder and general partner at Corner Ventures, Marvin Tien.</p>
<p>The platform was built to help brands sell on any e-commerce platform, with the goal of increasing their targeted visibility and sales. For maximum benefits, before listing, brands first have to establish the cost of setting up, the ability of retailers to deliver on sales, and margin projections.</p>
<p>Cymbio does end-to-end handling, including the listing of the products, inventory integration, tracking and returns.</p>
<p>“All the brand needs to do is kick off work with any retailer and then Cymbio does the rest. In the past few months, we picked up significant tailwinds as retailers and marketplaces that we support started introducing us to brands they wanted to sell on their dropship programs or marketplaces,” Avidor told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“At the same time, we received many referrals from third party logistics and software vendors, which generated a network effect (where more brands brought more marketplaces, who brought more brands who brought more vendors to the Cymbio network) which helped us scale up quickly.”</p>
<p>The company said that it has so far tripled its revenues in 2021, when compared to a similar period last year, and has grown its enterprise customers fourfold. The over 400 brands it is currently supporting includes New Balance, Steve Madden and Authentic Brands Group.</p>
<p>“With the rise of marketplaces (most large retailers are operating a marketplace or a dropship program today) brands need to comply with every retailer’s requirements, some of which are very challenging to accommodate. Cymbio supports hundreds of retailers, and became the go-to solution for “outsourcing” all marketplace and dropship needs for brands,” said Avidor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.getdefacto.com">Defacto</a>, a new French startup that wants to improve the credit infrastructure for small and medium companies. The startup wants to offer credit products using an API. It automatically analyzes your revenue to give you an answer in real-time.</p>
<p>Defacto is an embedded finance product, meaning that it doesn’t distribute its credit offering directly to small companies. Instead, other companies are embedding Defacto within their own products so that their customers can access Defacto’s products. It’s a B2B2B strategy, and embedded finance has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/embedded-finance-might-represent-fintechs-future/">an important trend</a> in fintech over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>The three founders, Jordane Giuly, Morgan O’hana and Marc-Henri Gires, started working on the company in May 2021. They think that it’s still too complicated to get some cash quickly so that you still have money to pay your employees or your suppliers. In France, big clients usually pay an invoice 30 to 60 days after the initial signature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235160" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead of reinventing the bank from scratch, Defacto is trying to reach potential clients where they already are. For instance, the company has signed a deal with <a href="https://en.staffme.fr">StaffMe</a>, a French marketplace for short-term freelancing jobs. Instead of waiting a month or two to get paid, you can open a credit line with Defacto and get paid right now.</p>
<p>The fintech startup is already thinking about other potential partnerships with marketplaces for contractors, freelancers, logistics, freight and more.</p>
<p>In addition to this strategy, Defacto thinks there are other potential distribution channels. If you work for an SME, chances are you already use a fintech product for accounting, accounts receivable and accounts payable, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/pennylane-raises-18-3-million-for-its-accounting-service/">Pennylane</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/libeo-lets-you-pay-your-suppliers-without-going-through-your-bank-account/">Libeo</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/agicap-raises-100-million-for-its-cashflow-management-service/">Agicap</a>.</p>
<p>“All these companies want to become the financial dashboard of SMEs. They will all want to offer credit,” Jordane Giuly told me.</p>
<p>And companies using these products can see that they’re supposed to receive a big check in a few weeks. So they could click on a button and start applying for a Defacto loan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You could also imagine a deep integration with e-commerce clients. As e-commerce companies acquire goods, they could use Defacto to pay their suppliers directly. With each sale, Defacto could get a cut to repay outstanding loans.</p>
<p>This strategy reminds me of <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/banking/loans">Square’s loan offering</a>. Customers can repay loans with a percentage of daily card sales through Square.</p>
<p>Defacto recently raised a $3.4 million (€3 million) pre-seed round from Global Founders Capital, Headline as well as various business angels, such as Thibaud Elzière, Rodolphe Ardant and Arthur Waller. In addition to that traditional equity round, Defacto also raised $3.4 million (€3 million) in debt.</p>
<p>“We’re starting by lending from our balance sheet — that’s why we had to raise a first funding round in debt and equity,” Giuly said.</p>
<p>And because Defacto wants to give you an answer as quickly as possible, the company is starting with small, short-term loans. Eventually, as the product gets better and as the company improves its risk scoring engine, Defacto expects to finance €100 million in transactions by the end of 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche saved the versatile and performance-focused GTS for its last two variants of the all-electric Taycan.</p>
<p>The German automaker unveiled the Taycan GTS sedan and a new third body style called the Taycan GTS Sport Turismo in an event Tuesday evening ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show, rounding out the robust Taycan vehicle portfolio. The reveal of the two Taycan variants caps Porsche&#8217;s biggest bet in more than a generation. The company invested more than $1 billion into the development of the four-door Taycan, which was unveiled in fall 2019.  Since then, Porsche has taken the Taycan down the all-electric wagon trail with the Cross Turismo.</p>
<p>With these two final variants, there are now 10 in all, including rear-wheel drive Taycan, 4, 4S, Turbo and Turbo S versions of the sedan and Cross Turismo. But it&#8217;s the Taycan GTS variants, which feature custom calibration and tuning for stiffer and faster reacting performance, that might make the biggest splash with customers when U.S. deliveries start in the second quarter of 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235404" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2235429" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235429" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235429 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg" alt="Porsche sport turismo gts angled" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235429" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>Ten variants of the Taycan is a lot. And yet Porsche North America CEO Kjell Gruner says it fits with the company&#8217;s mission of fulfilling individual customer demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would never go one-size-fits-all,&#8221; Gruner said in an interview Tuesday. &#8220;And that&#8217;s not just with the derivatives but within the derivatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the multi variant strategy of the Taycan has played out, Porsche will apply the same clean sheet approach to its next &#8220;electric baby,&#8221; as Gruner put it. That next EV is the Macan, which will be the first Porsche to be built on its Premium Platform Electric platform. The electric Macan is planned for 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Back to the Taycan GTS</h2>
<p>The GTS version of the Taycan has a different front fascia, side skirts and side window trim in a high-gloss black as well as headlights tinted in black. GTS logos are abundant on this Taycan, including on the rear and side skirts.</p>
<p>Inside, customers will find the same infotainment system in the other variants, which includes the multi-screen dashboard that includes a few details inspired by the 1963 Porsche 911. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the in-car platform that brings the look and functions of a smartphone to the vehicle’s central screen, are in the GTS just like the other versions as well other features like automatic climate control and a charging planner.</p>
<p>The Taycan GTS Sport Turismo — a mashup between Taycan Cross Turismo wagon and Taycan sedan — is the notable stand out with the rear spoiler painted to match the body color and no cladding on the wheel arches. The Sport Turismo has the same silhouette as the Cross Turismo wagon and storage space. But it has the lower ride height of the Taycan sedan, giving it a racier, performance-minded look — and feel.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235431" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235431" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235431 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg" alt="Porsche Taycan sport turismo gts back side" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235431" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>Notably, Porsche is introducing a new panoramic roof in the GTS that the driver or passenger can adjust how much light comes through. The roof has nine liquid crystal film segments in the roof, sort of like a digital clock. Each segment is electrically isolated. When it&#8217;s charged that segment becomes opaque. Users can pick from four preset patterns: clear, matte, 40%, and 60%. When the vehicle is switched off, the roof automatically switches to matte. The system also remembers the previous setting and when the vehicle is turned on will revert to whatever the driver previously chose.</p>

<p>While the Taycan GTS sedan and GTS Sport Turismo have distinct differences — one is a low-slung wagon, after all — there is quite a bit that they share. Both vehicles have the same permanent magnet single-speed front motor, larger permanent magnet rear motor and two-speed rear transmission and can accelerate from 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds.</p>
<p>They come standard with the 93.4 kWh battery and an 800-volt architecture that allows for charging at speeds of up to 270 kilowatt. This means the vehicle can charge from 5% to 80% in 22.5 minutes.</p>
<p>The GTS sits between the Taycan 4S and the Taycan Turbo, in terms of pricing and power (total output will be 590 horsepower with its branded launch control feature). The Taycan GTS sedan, starts at $131,400, and the Taycan GTS Sport Turismo comes in a skosh higher at $133,300. Neither price includes $1,350 delivery, processing, and handling fee.</p>
<p>And while, Porsche has yet to release range estimates, the GTS will likely have a range somewhere between the 4S and the Turbo as well, putting it between 227 and 212 miles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Funding for European startups is at a record-high so far for this year, with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">€73.7 billion raised in the first three quarters, and the full year on track for more than 8,000 deals, according to research from <a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_Q3_2021_European_Venture_Report.pdf#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>. To keep up with the pace, London firm <a href="https://www.balderton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balderton</a> is today announcing its latest fund, a $600 million war chest targeting early-stage  investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The fund is Balderton&#8217;s biggest yet earmarked for seed and Series A bets, and it comes five months after the firm closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/balderton-launches-680m-early-growth-fund-to-lure-startups-looking-for-a-different-kind-of-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$680 million fund</a> for later and growth-stage investments, bringing the total funds to over $1.2 billion.</span></p>
<p>Balderton has traditionally been seen as one of the big four VCs based out of London &#8212; the other three being Accel, Atomico and Index. In years past, it held the distinction of being the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/balderton-capital-raises-new-400m-fund-to-back-european-tech-startups-at-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most active</a> of all early-stage investors in the region.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235220" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These days, in part because there are so many more companies launching and growing, we&#8217;re seeing a significantly bigger presence from a wider range of investors. The deep-pocketed SoftBank &#8212; which is investing with gusto from its latest Vision Fund 2 &#8212; Sequoia, and Andreessen Horowitz, along with a number of new and newly-raising European funds, have all shifted the dynamics in the market.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the size of this latest fund, and the fact that it&#8217;s coming from Balderton, are bellwethers of the state of the market and the opportunities within it.</p>
<p>Balderton will be investing about half of the fund in seed stage investments and keeping its interests category-agnostic, Suranga Chandratillake said in an interview.</p>
<p>These are typically on the smaller side, and even though recent years have seen them growing with rounds <a href="https://avc.com/2021/11/seed-rounds-at-100mm-post-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching into post-money valuations as high as $100 million</a>, it speaks to a wide range of companies coming into the Balderton fold. The VC has made some 300 investments in the last 21 years, and it said that it has made 20 investments since the start of this year, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/primer-raises-50m-at-a-425m-valuation-for-a-framework-designed-to-help-merchants-build-more-powerful-payment-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primer</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/hubilo-picks-up-125m-to-double-down-on-building-a-more-engaging-platform-for-virtual-and-live-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubilo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/beauty-pie-an-online-buyers-club-picks-up-100m-to-boost-its-beauty-and-wellness-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beauty Pie</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dream-games-raises-155m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-its-royal-match-puzzle-game-hits-a-royal-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream Games</a> and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fact that so many more companies are finding the ability to scale in Europe is one reason that Balderton launched and raised a large growth fund. That expanded remit, meanwhile, also means more risk-taking in the early bets that Balderton is willing to make, and it&#8217;s one reason they are glad to have more investors with deep pockets in the region.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;If you met great moonshot teams in the past, you knew in your heart of hearts that money would run out,&#8221; said partner Rob Moffat. &#8220;Today, you can say with a high chance it won’t fail, because there are others who will invest.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The remaining half will primarily focus on following on previous investments, supporting those startups already in the portfolio. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s sweeping clampdown on its internet industry has chilled investors and startups betting on once red-hot areas like games and e-commerce. But investors aren&#8217;t slowing their pace in the country. The consumer internet boom in the 2010s gave rise to juggernauts like Tencent and Alibaba. As digitization spreads to more traditional sectors, new giants will emerge within the &#8220;tech&#8221; industry at large.</p>
<p>Temasek, for example, sees a &#8220;huge amount of opportunity&#8221; in areas like medtech, biotech, healthcare, and sustainability in China, its Rohit Sipahimalani recently told Nikkei Asia in an <a href="https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/news-and-views/news-room/statements/2021/statement-on-nikkei-asia-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a>. These are fields &#8220;that continue to be in line with government policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Temasek recently bankrolled a few Chinese startups in these verticals: <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vision-x-ff01">Vision X</a>, an ophthalmology and optometry device supplier; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/abogen-biosciences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abogen Biosciences</a>, an mRNA-based vaccine and drug provider; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edge-medical-robotics/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edge Medical Robotics</a>, a surgical robot developer; and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/momenta-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momenta</a>, an autonomous driving tech provider.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234595" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As of March 31, China was the Singapore government-owned firm&#8217;s largest geographic source of investment, accounting for <a href="https://www.pionline.com/pension-funds/temasek-strategist-says-china-exposure-indispensable-portfolios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27%</a> of its S$381 billion ($280 billion) portfolio.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Temasek is halting capital deployment in internet-focused companies amid the regulatory overhaul.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would expect in the next few months to have regulatory clarity, and that would shape some winners and losers out there, and I think we will probably wait to deploy more capital till we have more regulatory clarity in that space,&#8221; Sipahimalani said in the interview.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t one unifying law that molds the development of China&#8217;s tech industry. Over the past year, China has introduced a litany of new regulations aiming at the information and technology sector. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personal Information Protection Law</a>, for example, is designed to protect user privacy and will affect the ways internet services collect data, and eventually their bottom line. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anti-Monopoly Law</a> seeks to tame the unfettered growth of internet firms and breathe new air into the space. Meanwhile, many see the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/the-casualties-of-chinas-education-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crackdown on online education</a> as an attempt to address the country&#8217;s widening income gap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The challenge for industry players and investors is not only parsing these new laws but also anticipating when the next one comes.</p>
<p>&#8220;[It is] just that in China the way that is being executed is a little more blunt and quick, and that is why it has created a lot of shocks out there,&#8221; said Sipahimalani.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures has doubled down its bet on Velocity, which operates a revenue-based financing platform for e-commerce and direct-to-consumer businesses in India, just months after it first backed the Bangalore-based startup.</p>
<p>The one-and-half-year-old Velocity said on Wednesday it has raised $20 million in its Series A financing round. Valar Ventures, which led Velocity&#8217;s seed round earlier this year, led the Series A as well, the two said Wednesday. Presight Capital, AngelList India head Utsav Somani’s iSeed, Maninder Gulati of Oyo, Zac Prince of BlockFi and Philippe De Mota of Hedosophia also participated in the round, which takes the startup’s all-time raise to $30 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.velocity.in">Velocity</a> is attempting to build a reliable alternative to venture capital and traditional bank debt for e-commerce and direct-to-consumer brands in India. Rather than charging an interest on the loans it sanctions, Velocity takes a low standard fee and businesses pay it back based on their revenue.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235471" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Abhiroop Medhekar, co-founder and chief executive of Velocity, told TechCrunch in an interview last week that the duration of the payback period varies based on the revenue a business generates.</p>
<p>“In case the partner firm&#8217;s revenue ends up growing, it benefits us because the duration of the loan payback time is shorter. In case the revenue falls, then we also take that risk along with the business. We are saying it’s perfectly fine for them to take longer if the business is not doing as well,” he said.</p>
<p>Velocity integrates its platform with the partner firm&#8217;s digital data and is able to tell how the business is doing. The startup uses over 50 parameters to assess whether it can provide a loan to a business, and credits the amount within 5 days.</p>
<p>Direct-to-consumer and e-commerce businesses, both of which are highly working capital intensive, typically need a steady source of capital to run their operations. Until recently, the firms either relied on regular lenders or venture firms for financing, but the nature of their business has made both such options widely inefficient. According to a recent estimate, less than 0.5% of over 75,000 independent e-commerce stores on platforms such as WooCommerce and Shopify in India were equity funded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When Velocity partners with a business, “it also has a skin in the game. And that is why we see so many repeat customers. 78% of businesses that have worked with us come back to take more loans from us in the future,” said Medhekar.</p>
<p>Citing its own figures, Velocity said that the brands that have historically raised capital through Velocity grew their revenues by 1.5 times within six months of funding. Some of its customers include PowerGummies, Green Soul, WallMantra, BellaVita, Smoor Chocolates and CrossBeats.</p>
<p>Velocity has amassed 175 customers and made a total of about 250 investments to date.</p>
<p>Medhekar, who previously worked as an investor at Elevation Capital, said integrations into several platforms and systems gives Velocity full visibility into the financials of how its partner businesses are doing. Even the founders of those firms were keen to have such clarity, he said.</p>
<p>“As a founder, your data is scattered across Amazon, Shopify, Facebook, Google and other services and you may not be able to compile them all to draw meaningful insights,” he said.</p>
<p>To tackle this, Velocity recently launched a free product called Velocity Insights that helps its partner businesses get a daily report delivered to them on WhatsApp each morning. “It’s in our best interest that our partners also grow. We found that these actionable insights are helping the businesses inform their decisions,” he said.</p>
<p>The product has made inroads with many businesses in recent months and many non-customers are also signing up to the platform to receive insights, the startup said. Velocity may introduce a paid service for its non-customers and it is looking to broaden its insights offerings by adding more metrics and benchmarks, said Medhekar.</p>
<p>Velocity itself has grown 10 times in recent months, said Andrew McCormack of Valar Ventures. “Despite this exponential growth, their portfolio quality remains strong. We were impressed by their strong customer orientation, tech-product DNA, and ambitious growth plans. We are excited to support their bold vision of empowering thousands of entrepreneurs in India,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which partners with NBFCs to finance loans, said it aims to deploy over $134 million to over 1,000 e-commerce and direct-to-consumer businesses in the next one year. &#8220;Our long-term vision is to empower new-age businesses through multiple financing products. The reason we started with revenue-based financing is because we felt the access to financing is the biggest gap for them. As we spend more time, we have identified several more areas in which we wish to expand,&#8221; said Medhekar.</p>
<p>Divij Bajaj, Founder of PowerGummies, a customer of Velocity, said, “we chose to raise capital through Velocity because of their speed and convenience. We were able to securely connect our online sales and marketing data with Velocity’s platform within a few clicks and got funded within a week. Their terms were better than other alternatives and we got to retain our equity in a growing business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nader Al-Naji, a crypto entrepreneur who today lives in L.A., has been on a roller coaster in recent years &#8212; and he doesn&#8217;t pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>In 2018, roughly 16 months after raising $140 million from investors for a cryptocurrency startup that aimed to develop a stablecoin, Al-Naji and his Princeton classmates returned $130 million when they couldn&#8217;t make a go of things. As Al-Naji came to <a href="https://www.basis.io/">realize</a> at the time, Basis&#8217;s technology road map and U.S. securities regulations didn’t quite mix.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t stop Al-Naji from trying again. Instead, two years ago, he began work on DeSo, which he describes as a blockchain that was built from the ground up to power social applications and whose most renowned app is BitClout, a kind of stock market that invites people to bet on the popularity of influencers and celebrities by buying tokens linked to their profiles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235090" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>BitClout took off last spring in part because it scraped the profiles of tens of thousands of Twitter users, then awarded different amounts of “creator coins” to each profile to populate the app. But along with attention and curiosity came contempt by users surprised to see their names associated with the project, and speaking at a San Francisco <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/145636603@N06/albums/72157720136032014/page1">event</a> late last week, Al-Naji told interviewer Erin Griffith of the New York Times that he regrets ever rolling it out.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t so much the controversy that he rues, he said, but rather that it was &#8220;launched pretty much as a prototype,&#8221; and that it may have dissuaded developers on DeSo from developing something similar. &#8220;Going back, I think it would have been better if we didn&#8217;t build any app on [DeSo] honestly, because I think the appetite for developers to create is pretty high, and creating BitClout might have even deterred people from [trying to build a perceived competitor to it].&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, Al-Naji took pains to note numerous times that there are now more than 100 <em>other</em> apps operating on the DeSo blockchain, saying they &#8220;make BitClout look like Craigslist&#8221; in comparison. Among these is <a href="https://diamondapp.com/">Diamondapp</a>, which invites users to buy virtual diamonds that they can award to creators who they like; <a href="https://cloutfeedapp.com/">CloutFeed</a>, a mobile app for BitClout; and <a href="https://polygram.cc/">Polygram.cc</a>, an NFT marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Al-Naji further noted that if &#8220;one of those apps succeeds, the content and users generated by that app is usable by all the other apps,&#8221; which is very much by design.</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Al-Naji, the whole idea is for one truly sticky app to bring users to the platform, where they will encounter and have access to other apps (making DeSo&#8217;s coins more valuable in the process). It&#8217;s basically Meta, but decentralized and without all the ads that Facebook and Instagram present to their captive audiences, he suggested.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9vacOnx0Gw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Naturally, Griffith asked if Al-Naji &#8212; who briefly operated BitClout <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/21/nader-al-naji-fka-diamondhands-unveils-new-blockchain-long-term-plan-for-bitclout">pseudonymously</a> as &#8220;Diamondhands&#8221; &#8212; really thinks his organization has a chance against Meta, given that it has its own blockchain initiatives and that DeSo is still &#8220;a kind of pirate-ship startup,&#8221; as she described it.</p>
<p>Al-Naji shrugged, then dived into why he thinks platforms like DeSo actually do pose a threat to the tech giant. For one thing, he noted, the apps running on DeSo typically take fees off financial transactions, and a lot of money can potentially be thrown around fairly effortlessly in this way, unlike with an outfit like Meta that relies on a traditional financial system where &#8220;red tape is meaningful&#8221; and there are chargebacks, among other points of friction.</p>
<p>When you run a &#8220;fee model sustainably,&#8221; Al-Naji continued, &#8220;it can be much more efficient than the ads-driven business model&#8221; on which Facebook today relies. Being ad free is also liberating in that you &#8220;don&#8217;t care what people are looking at it as long as they&#8217;re generating transactions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, what DeSo represents is directly at odds with how Meta is run today, and switching to a more &#8220;crypto-oriented&#8221; future &#8212; as Meta seems to be plotting &#8212;  could well prove a years-long high-wire act.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235104" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235104" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235104 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235104" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Whether DeSo will still be around at the end of that process is a fair question. Griffith asked, for example, if it isn&#8217;t true that both DeSo and Meta &#8212; as it builds its so-called metaverse &#8212;  are subject to some amount of regulatory risk as much gets sorted out in Washington. Al-Naji answered that &#8220;you can&#8217;t be in crypto and not be subject to some amount of regulatory risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he also argued that his experience with Basis puts him on more solid footing. &#8220;That $10 million that I didn&#8217;t [return to investors] was actually spent all on lawyers, learning like, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s a security and what does FinCEN think about all these things that we&#8217;re doing to make a synthetic dollar. So yeah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I learned a lot. And I think we did it right this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for DeSo&#8217;s funding, it has raised $40 million from investors this time around, including Sequoia Capital, and another $230 million from the sale of DeSo tokens. Al-Naji has no plans to return the money this time, either. Thankfully, he said, &#8220;No is asking for that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-based <a href="https://www.deskimo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deskimo</a>, the on-demand app that lets people find co-working spaces and pay by the minute, announced today it has raised a $3 million seed round. It is also soft launching in Jakarta, bringing its total markets to three, along with Singapore and Hong Kong. Participants in the round included Y Combinator (Deskimo was <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/deskimo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of its summer 2021 cohort</a>), Global Founders Capital, Pioneer Fund, Seed X, Starling Ventures and TSVC.</p>
<p>The startup was founded earlier this year by Raphael Cohen, Rocket Internet’s former head of Asia, and Christian Mischler, who co-founded Foodpanda, HotelQuickly and GuestReady. Instead of offering its app directly to consumers, Deskimo works with companies that have a hybrid workplace model. The app is offered as a benefit to employees, who usually work from home but might want to get away to concentrate or take calls (Mischler said Deskimo’s average users spend 3 hours at a desk, but some stay the whole day). It partners with coworking spaces, including WeWork, The Hive, Executive Centre and Garage Society, giving them additional streams of revenue.</p>

<p>Mischler told TechCrunch in an email that the startup expanded into Jakarta because it is targeting cities with heavy traffic congestion and where real-estate infrastructure is usually less developed than in cities like Hong Kong or Singapore. “Indonesia is the largest market in Southeast Asia and Jakarta is one of the first markets where Singaporean companies expand into, hence many of our existing corporate clients were requesting the ability to use Deskimo there, which is why we’ve prioritized Deskimo in Jakarta ahead of other metropolitan areas in Southeast Asia.”</p>
<p>In Jakarta, Deskimo has contracted with more than 40 workspaces so far for its soft launch, with plans to add about 10 to 20 more locations by the end of this year. In all its cities, it looks for spaces outside of central business districts so users can find desks close to their homes. For example, in Hong Kong and Singapore, about one-third of Deskimo’s spaces are located in residential areas. In Jakarta, spaces are spread more evenly across the city, Mischler said, with about 60% of its partner workspaces located outside of CBDs.</p>
<p>“As COVID-related restrictions continue to ease, we expect spaces to become more busy, which is why we’ll continue to add options to the app to ensure availability in proximity to all Deskimo users,” he added.</p>
<p>Over the past three months since its launch, Deskimo has also added several new services in response to user demand, including the ability to book centrally-located meeting rooms. It is also trialling fixed-fee subscriptions in addition to its current pay-as-you-go model. Other features Deskimo is working on include the ability for main account holders to bring a guest, prepaid credits for companies in addition to end-of-month bills and a rate cap for users who want to spend the entire day at a space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneur Avi Dorfman, who sued Compass seven years ago for not recognizing him as a co-founder, received a settlement and key acknowledgement today from the now-public real estate company Compass. The result comes just months before an expected trial date for the ongoing lawsuit, in which Dorfman sought a $200 million stake in the company to represent his expertise and role in shaping the business, according to court filings.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to have been recognized as a member of Compass’s founding team and to have resolved this dispute in a manner that is satisfactory to both sides. I wish [CEO] Rob Reffkin and the Compass community only the best,” Dorfman said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Compass spokesperson gave acknowledgement to &#8220;Mr. Dorfman’s work in the early days of Compass as a founding team member of the company.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Compass, today valued at more than $6.4 billion, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001563190/000119312521326001/d256657dex991.htm">posted an SEC filing</a> that indicated a charge of $21.3 million in connection with the settlement, but the total sum remains undisclosed.</p>
<p>Dorfman filed the lawsuit in 2014, two days after Compass announced its new $360 million valuation. Today, Compass is worth around $4.4 billion.</p>
<p>“Despite the company’s astronomical success due, in part, to Dorfman’s significant contributions towards conceptualizing, creating, and launching the company, Dorfman was intentionally and wrongfully cut-out,” the original complaint from Dorfman said. The lawsuit also alleged that Compass misappropriated trade secrets from RentJolt, Dorfman’s company before he began working on Compass, in violation of a non-disclosure agreement.</p>
<p>For Compass&#8217;s part, the company argued that the entrepreneur&#8217;s lawsuit was coming from a more opportunistic place. In its motion for summary judgment, the company wrote: &#8220;Having spurned multiple offers of employment to join Reffkin&#8217;s new real estate venture, Dorfman now seeks a do-over of that decision, claiming he should be awarded tens of millions of dollars in equity in Compass — far in excess of what he could have earned if he had actually chosen to join that venture and invested his time and energy building it into the successful company it is today.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Robert Reffkin went from being a C-average student to the founder of Compass&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/how-robert-reffkin-went-from-being-a-c-average-student-to-the-founder-of-compass/embed/#?secret=2IJ5ImG9ap" data-secret="2IJ5ImG9ap" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a summary judgement, Compass claimed that it changed its business model and “transformed from a start-up venture into a successful real estate technology company.”</p>
<p>This lawsuit illustrates the complex, and increasingly common, tension that can arise between founding team members during the earliest, garage-stage days of a business. Decisions can be made over drinks, ideas over a single chat, and contracts are often a step made far later into a process. Other prominent founder disputes include the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/23/winklevii/">Winklevoss twins versus Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown/">Reggie Brown versus Snapchat. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.susmangodfrey.com/attorneys/arun-subramanian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arun Subramanium</a>, a partner at Susman Godfrey who worked for Dorfman on this case, spoke to TechCrunch about the growing threat of founder disputes in today&#8217;s frenetic funding and startup formation environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in an ideas economy, and so there are more and more companies and successful ventures that are premised on ideas as opposed to products,&#8221; he said, compared to a few decades ago. He added that it may have been easy to understand who at Pepsi is responsible for selling a certain number of Pepsi cans per year, but now, the questions around impact are more elusive, such as: who came up with the idea for Facebook?</p>
<p>&#8220;As we shift into the ideas economy, it is natural that we will have more of these issues come up where a particular individual says &#8216;I played a role in the development of this technology, but in the infancy of the business you kind of left me on the sidelines and now, that technology, those ideas, that I helped build are extremely lucrative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Dorfman is the founder of Clearing, a direct-to-consumer digital health startup working on chronic pain that has raised $20 million in funding to date. Compass has had a rocky time on the stock market since its debut last April, with its stock price down nearly 40% compared to its opening price.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">You’ve launched a few paid acquisition channels and are now starting to see your first leads trickle in. Maybe you’ve even set up a drip campaign to convert these leads into paid subscriptions. Amazing!</p>
<p>But when you start ramping up, having a growth marketing tech stack (which we’ll refer to as “growth stack” for the rest of this column) becomes increasingly vital. Every startup with a successful growth program has factored in this foundational piece as a part of its overall strategy. They’ve also had a proper understanding and implementation of their growth stack.</p>
<p>So, what’s a growth stack? What are its components? How do you properly set everything up without heavy resources or funds?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>Growth stack overview</h2>
<p>A growth stack is the foundation of your growth marketing efforts — it essentially webs everything together. While not an exhaustive list, the main components to a growth stack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer data platform (CDP).</li>
<li>Mobile measurement partner (MMP).</li>
<li>Data warehouse.</li>
<li>Business intelligence tool (BI).</li>
<li>Customer engagement tools.</li>
<li>A/B testing/experimentation tools.</li>
<li>Acquisition mediums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of these tools as the parts of a car, where the customer data platform acts as the engine and the other tools are the parts hooked up to the engine. The customer data platform (i.e., Segment) provides a basis for aggregating the data and federating it to other tools as necessary.</p>
<p>A mobile measurement partner is only necessary when running mobile app install campaigns and is being used as the tool to attribute paid acquisition efforts. Without getting into the details of how they work, mobile measurement partners are necessary to help mitigate fraud from ad partners, establish last-click attribution windows and assign credit to winning channels.</p>
<p>Now that you have data flowing between tools and channels, where is the data stored internally? This is typically the point when companies start looking for a <em>data warehouse</em> (Redshift, for example). However, I’d like to debunk the myth that a data warehouse is needed early on, because business intelligence tools (like Amplitude) have become very robust and can easily replace a data warehouse’s function.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In short, a data warehouse is used to combine data from many sources, track historical changes in data and provide a single source of truth. But for a lean startup, this can all be initially accomplished with the use of a business intelligence tool.</p>
<p>Now comes the fun tools for your growth stack — or, to continue our analogy, the modifications to your car. Customer engagement, A/B testing/experimentation tools and all your acquisition mediums are the pieces that help you drive top-of-funnel growth, optimizing the funnel and engaging with customers to push them toward conversion.</p>
<h2>Why growth stacks?</h2>
<p>If the answer isn’t already clear on why a growth stack is crucial for your startup, we can summarize the top three reasons for implementing one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Source of truth.</li>
<li>Clear attribution.</li>
<li>Actionable data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s say you’re five months into your startup, and you’ve proven there’s product-market fit. You’re now scaling various acquisition mediums, including paid, influencers and lifecycle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is also exhaustive testing and iteration on the user funnel being performed. This sounds very typical to a startup in scale mode, with various tests and optimizations in progress. It can either be done slowly and incorrectly or, with the help of a growth stack, rapidly and accurately.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on ad dashboard data, which often lacks accuracy, a growth stack helps provide a single source of truth for all growth sources. This inherently increases the reliability of attribution and allows for the use of more accurate, actionable data. Nothing beats taking a few minutes to pull that data in a singular dashboard, leading to increased optimizations.</p>

<h2>Implementing a growth stack</h2>
<p>There isn’t a structured or one-size-fits-all method to implementing a growth stack; each startup has unique needs. The top three components to prioritize early on should include a customer data platform, a business intelligence tool and a mobile measurement partner. These pieces will help build your growth foundation while allowing you to correctly track and optimize incoming traffic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235071" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235071" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="697" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png 1110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235071" class="wp-caption-text">Visual representation of a lean growth stack.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez</p></div></p>
<p>In this simplified representation of a lean growth stack, there is a customer data platform, business intelligence tool and mobile measurement partner. The paid channels and lifecycle platform are acquisition mediums, which pass data back to the centralized customer data platform. As the customer data platform receives data, it federates data to the business intelligence tool for visualization.</p>
<p>If your startup is still in its early days and testing for product-market fit, you might not need a growth stack. In this case, launching acquisition mediums is sufficient. After identifying whether there is potential, prepping for the implementation of a lean growth stack will become key.</p>
<h2>Leveraging a growth stack</h2>
<p>So, you’ve got your growth stack all set up. Now what?</p>
<p>The power of this implementation is now unlocked, and you can start performing some powerful analyses that can help provide actionable insights for optimizations. Think cohort modeling (actuals versus cohorted), retention charting, deep funnel analyses, identifying user-level behaviors, cross-channel attribution and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235073" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235073" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235073" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png" alt="" width="750" height="638" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png?resize=680,578 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235073" class="wp-caption-text">Sample Amplitude (business intelligence) dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amplitude</p></div></p>
<p>With a business intelligence tool, setting up a dashboard with various visualizations is one of the most beautiful ways to leverage your data. Wake up to a centralized dashboard with daily traffic reports by channel, funnel conversion rates, conversion counts by state and endless other options.</p>
<p>The ability to act on data rapidly becomes a breeze, rather than painfully slow, when pulling and analyzing from different sources. Having one source of truth for all growth sources will also keep everything at parity, which becomes important when comparing cross-source performance.</p>
<p>It’s so crucial to implement a growth stack early on to accelerate optimizations. Those who do will eventually reap the rewards.</p>
